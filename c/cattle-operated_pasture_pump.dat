50|$|There is a brick {{building}} {{located at the}} end of the University of Massachusetts Boston campus facing Squantum. This is the location of the sewer system's pump house, known as the Calf <b>Pasture</b> <b>Pumping</b> Station Complex, which was named for the marshy area known as the Dorchester Calf Pasture at that time. Initially, this area was a long narrow land-filled peninsula but has been subsequently expanded many times to accommodate development.|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s, {{the calf}} pasture {{was used as}} a Boston sewer line and pumping station, known as the Calf <b>Pasture</b> <b>Pumping</b> Station Complex. This large pumping station still stands and in its time was a model for {{treating}} sewage and helping to promote cleaner and healthier urban living conditions. It pumped waste to a remote treatment facility on Moon Island in Boston Harbor, and served as a model for other systems worldwide. This system remained in active use and was the Boston Sewer system's headworks, handling all of the city's sewage, until 1968 when a new treatment facility was built on Deer Island. The pumping station is also architecturally significant as a Richardsonian Romanesque designed by the then Boston city architect, George Clough. It is also the only remaining 19th century building on Columbia Point and is in the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R

40|$|Farmers Creek is a {{moderately}} flowing stream that winds through seventeen miles of central Jackson County, encompassing a watershed area of 30, 590 acres. Due to nutrient loading and sedimentation, the stream {{was placed on}} Iowa’s 303 (d) List of Impaired Waters in 2002. A three year grant project was initiated in January 2005 to reduce both sediment delivery and phosphorus levels by 40 % in critical areas along the stream corridor. Over thirty-five BMP’s were started {{in the first nine}} months of this project. Funding through WIRB is being requested specifically for streambank stabilization and protection projects not covered by other cost-share programs. Innovative project designs and techniques will be installed and act as demonstration sites. Projects may include jetties, weirs, cedar revetments, cattle crossings, and fencing. To assist in excluding cattle from the stream, watering systems such as slingpumps, <b>pasture</b> <b>pumps,</b> or water rams will be installed, in conjunction with filter strips and riparian buffers...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Small {{commercial}} and non-commercial animal enterprises (SCAEs) raise a few beef cows, horses, pigs, sheep, poultry, {{and other animals}} on a few acres. These enterprises are often located in suburban areas of watersheds and show potential for degrading water quality through to increased bacterial, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations. SCAEs implement Best Management Practices (BNIPs) {{on a voluntary basis}} to control their water quality impacts. Off-stream watering areas, with animal access to streams, and covered manure storages are two BMPs which were analyzed in this thesis for effectiveness in reducing bacteria, nitrogen, and phosphorus from entering surface and groundwater in four SCAEs. The four cooperating SCAEs were located in the Tualatin River Basin, and the potential water quality improvements from implementing these two practices in all SCAEs in the basin were discussed. The BMP analyses use results from several studies. Two of these studies analyzed off-stream watering areas for reducing time animals spend watering at the stream. This time was measured and used to estimate the manure defecated in the stream. Reducing time animals spend at the stream decreases direct defecations in the stream and reduces water quality impacts of SCAEs. A third study analyzed a <b>pasture</b> <b>pump</b> as a possible off-stream watering device. It was analyzed for its ability to provide water to 27 Holstein dairy heifers without limiting water consumption. Daily water consumption from the <b>pasture</b> <b>pump</b> was not significantly different than daily consumption from an open water trough. A fourth study predicted the rainfall required to produce runoff from pastured areas in the Dairy-McKay Hydrological Unit Area within the Tualatin River Basin. These required rainfall amounts and runoff frequency were predicted for summer and winter soil conditions. The BMPs were analyzed for a variety of wet and dry conditions during the summer and winter. Off-stream watering areas were most effective in reducing water quality impacts of SCAEs for dry conditions during the summer and winter, while the covered manure storages were most effective during winter days of continuous rain. Off-stream watering areas reduced the time animals spent at the stream by 75...|$|R
5000|$|UMass Boston {{is located}} off Interstate 93 and within one mile of the JFK/UMass MBTA Station on the Red Line and the Old Colony Lines of the Commuter Rail. On weekdays, free {{shuttles}} run directly between the JFK/UMass {{station and the}} university's Campus Center, and alternative free shuttles (which run all week) follow a secondary route that makes intermediate stops at the Clark Athletic Center, the Massachusetts Archives, the JFK Presidential Library, and the university's Early Learning Center (although the Early Learning Center stop is skipped on weekends). The MBTA Bus Routes 8 and 16, from the Kenmore Square and Forest Hills train stations respectively, end at the university's Campus Center bus circle, and the MBTA program [...] "The Ride" [...] has drop-off locations at the university's Campus Center and the Clark Athletic Center. Parking lots located directly on campus include a garage below the Campus Center and parking lots adjacent to the Science Center (called the [...] "Beacons Lot"), the Clark Athletic Center, and the Calf <b>Pasture</b> <b>Pumping</b> Station Complex ("Lot D"). The university also owns and operates satellite parking lots (one of which {{is located at the}} former Bayside Expo Center) that have free shuttle service on weekdays as well.|$|R
40|$|Mankind’s misgivings {{caused by}} the {{depletion}} of fossil fuels have accelerated research on obtaining energy from unconventional sources. One such source is the Sun. The present article reviews {{the possibility of using}} solar energy, converted in batteries of photovoltaic cells into electricity, in agriculture and farming. It should also be emphasized that it is energy friendly to the environment, whose acquisition on agricultural land, which often lacks access to the power grid, is now legitimate and profitable. This study presents the results of computer simulations in tabular and graphical form, using the PVSYST program, for a <b>pasture</b> water <b>pumping</b> system for watering grazing cattle...|$|R
