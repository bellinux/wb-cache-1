5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in <b>compressive</b> loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both <b>compressive</b> and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E
5|$|<b>Compressive</b> forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. <b>Compressive</b> forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|Indriids {{such as the}} sifakas {{use their}} toothcombs to gouge bark or dead wood (bark-prising), which is done prior to scent-marking with the gland on their chest. The more robust {{structure}} of their toothcomb is thought to help it withstand the <b>compressive</b> forces experienced during regular bark-prising.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{extensive}} volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its mountains are tectonic structures, {{and are not}} produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian mountains form {{as the result of}} <b>compressive</b> stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io's crust through thrust faulting. The <b>compressive</b> stresses leading to mountain formation are the result of subsidence from the continuous burial of volcanic materials. The global distribution of mountains appears to be opposite that of volcanic structures; mountains dominate areas with fewer volcanoes and vice versa. This suggests large-scale regions in Io's lithosphere where compression (supportive of mountain formation) and extension (supportive of patera formation) dominate. Locally, however, mountains and paterae often abut one another, suggesting that magma often exploits faults formed during mountain formation to reach the surface.|$|E
5|$|For instance, pure diamond is an {{electrical}} insulator, but diamond with boron added is {{an electrical}} conductor (and, in some cases, a superconductor), {{allowing it to}} be used in electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) and put the lattice under <b>compressive</b> stress, thereby increasing hardness and toughness.|$|E
5|$|Magnesium-poor adakites {{have been}} found at Monte Burney. Fueguino {{volcanic}} rocks also include adakites but these are richer in magnesium. These adakitic magmas reflect the subduction of a relatively hot and young Antarctic Plate. In the case of Monte Burney, these magmas then underwent some fractionation during ascent, as it was retarded by the tectonic regimen, which is somewhat <b>compressive.</b>|$|E
25|$|A beam bends under bending moment, {{resulting}} in a small curvature. At the outer face (tensile face) of the curvature the concrete experiences tensile stress, while at the inner face (<b>compressive</b> face) it experiences <b>compressive</b> stress.|$|E

25|$|A doubly {{reinforced}} beam is one {{in which}} besides the tensile reinforcement the concrete element is also reinforced near the <b>compressive</b> face to help the concrete resist compression. The latter reinforcement is called compression steel. When the compression zone of a concrete is inadequate to resist the <b>compressive</b> moment (positive moment), extra reinforcement has to be provided if the architect limits the dimensions of the section.|$|E
25|$|The tectonic {{history of}} the Cesar-Ranchería Basin has been {{subdivided}} into six phases. The basin started as a passive margin in the Paleozoic, followed by a <b>compressive</b> margin in the Late Permian to Triassic, a phase of rifting in the Jurassic. Subsequently, the basin experienced a back-arc basin setting in the Cretaceous, a second <b>compressive</b> margin during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene and a final intramontane phase since the Eocene.|$|E
25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal <b>compressive</b> preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of <b>compressive</b> strain in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the <b>compressive</b> strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.|$|E
25|$|Current {{technology}} {{calls for}} multiple lasers, usually over 100, to concurrently strike a fuel pellet, creating a symmetrical <b>compressive</b> pressure.|$|E
25|$|Type III has {{relatively}} high early strength. Its typical compound composition is: 57% (C3S), 19% (C2S), 10% (C3A), 7% (C4AF), 3.0% MgO, 3.1% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 1.3% free CaO. This cement {{is similar to}} type I, but ground finer. Some manufacturers make a separate clinker with higher C3S and/or C3A content, but this is increasingly rare, and the general purpose clinker is usually used, ground to a specific surface area typically 50–80% higher. The gypsum level may also be increased a small amount. This gives the concrete using this type of cement a three-day <b>compressive</b> strength equal to the seven-day <b>compressive</b> strength of types I and II. Its seven-day <b>compressive</b> strength is almost equal to 28-day <b>compressive</b> strengths of types I and II. The only downside is that the six-month strength of type III is the same or slightly {{less than that of}} types I and II. Therefore, the long-term strength is sacrificed. It is usually used for precast concrete manufacture, where high one-day strength allows fast turnover of molds. It may also be used in emergency construction and repairs, and construction of machine bases and gate installations.|$|E
25|$|While {{osteoarthritis}} is a degenerative {{joint disease}} that may cause gross cartilage loss and morphological damage to other joint tissues, more subtle biochemical changes {{occur in the}} earliest stages of osteoarthritis progression. The water content of healthy cartilage is finely balanced by <b>compressive</b> force driving water out and hydrostatic and osmotic pressure drawing water in. Collagen fibres exert the <b>compressive</b> force, whereas the Gibbs–Donnan effect and cartilage proteoglycans create osmotic pressure which tends to draw water in.|$|E
25|$|Photonic Laser Thruster (PLT) {{stabilized}} structure: Dr. Young Bae {{has proposed}} that photon pressure may substitute for <b>compressive</b> members in large structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{elasticity}} {{of the material}} of the column and not the <b>compressive</b> strength of the material of the column determines the column's bucking load.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, the American Concrete Institute {{produced}} a special publication which presented {{the most recent}} research, to that time, on arching and <b>compressive</b> membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian orthopedist Sydney Haje {{developed}} a non-surgical protocol for treating pectus carinatum {{as well as}} pectus excavatum. The method involves wearing a <b>compressive</b> orthosis and adhering to an exercise protocol.|$|E
25|$|The minimum {{strength}} before exposing concrete {{to extreme}} cold is 500 psi (3.5 MPa). CSA A 23.1 specified a <b>compressive</b> strength of 7.0 MPa {{to be considered}} safe for exposure to freezing.|$|E
25|$|The term arching {{action is}} {{normally}} {{used to describe}} the arching phenomenon in one-way spanning slabs and <b>compressive</b> membrane action is normally {{used to describe the}} arching phenomenon in two-way spanning slabs.|$|E
25|$|Research into arching or <b>compressive</b> {{membrane}} {{action has}} continued {{over the years}} at Queen’s University Belfast, {{with the work of}} Niblock, who investigated the effects of CMA in uniformly loaded laterally restrained slabs; Skates, who researched CMA in cellular concrete structures; Ruddle, who researched arching action in laterally restrained rectangular and Tee-beams; Peel-Cross, who researched CMA in composite floor slab construction; Taylor who researched CMA in high strength concrete bridge deck slabs, and Shaat who researched CMA using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) techniques. A comprehensive guide to <b>compressive</b> membrane action in concrete bridge decks, was compiled by Taylor, Rankin and Cleland in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Different mixes of {{concrete}} ingredients produce different strengths. Concrete strength values are usually specified as the <b>compressive</b> strength of either a cylindrical or cubic specimen, where these values usually differ by around 20% {{for the same}} concrete mix.|$|E
25|$|Rearranging the Laplace and Poiseuille {{relations}} {{suggests that}} radial growth occurs {{as a result}} of circumferential stretch and circumferential growth {{occurs as a result}} of shear stress. Shear stress is proportional to the speed inside the vessel as well as the pressure drop between two fixed points on the vessel wall. The precise mechanism of vessel remodelling is believed to be high stress on the inner wall of the vessel which can induce growth, which heads toward uniform <b>compressive</b> and tensile stress {{on both sides of the}} vessel wall. Generally, it has been found that circumferential residual stress is <b>compressive</b> and tensile, indicating that inner layers of the endothelial tube grow more than outer layers.|$|E
25|$|Ultimate failure {{leading to}} {{collapse}} {{can be caused}} by crushing the concrete, which occurs when <b>compressive</b> stresses exceed its strength, by yielding or failure of the rebar when bending or shear stresses exceed the strength of the reinforcement, or by bond failure between the concrete and the rebar.|$|E
25|$|A {{second phase}} of <b>compressive</b> margin has been noted in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin by the strong {{differences}} between the sedimentary thicknesses of the Paleocene formations. During this stage in the basin development, the Cesar-Ranchería Basin {{was connected to the}} Middle Magdalena Valley to the west. The Paleocene Lisama Formation has a reduced thickness {{in the northern part of}} the Middle Magdalena Valley due to erosion, while the Paleocene section in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin is very thick. This has been explained by the tilt of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the formation of several thick-skinned thrust faults in the basin. The initiation of this <b>compressive</b> phase has been dated to the Maastrichtian, when tectonic uplift and deformation was active in the Central Ranges, to the west of the basin.|$|E
25|$|The {{hip joint}} {{is unique in}} that it {{experiences}} combined mechanical loads. An axial load along the shaft of the femur results in <b>compressive</b> stress. Bending load at {{the neck of the}} femur causes tensile stress along {{the upper part of the}} neck and <b>compressive</b> stress along the lower part of the neck. While osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with bone fracture as we age, these diseases are not the cause of the fracture alone. Low energy falls from standing are responsible for the majority of fractures in the elderly, but fall direction is also a key factor. Elderly tend to fall to the side as instead of forward, and the lateral hip and strikes the ground first. During a sideways fall, the chances of hip fracture see a 15-fold and 12-fold increase in elderly males and females, respectively.|$|E
25|$|This {{relative}} {{weakness is}} important, {{because it would}} allow the relatively small east-west <b>compressive</b> forces associated with the continuing continental drift of the North American plate to reactivate old faults around New Madrid, making the area unusually prone to earthquakes in spite of it being far from the nearest tectonic plate boundary.|$|E
25|$|An {{irregular}} bone is {{one that}} does not have an easily classified shape and defies description. These bones tend to have more complex shapes, like the vertebrae that support the spinal cord and protect it from <b>compressive</b> forces. Many facial bones, particularly the ones containing sinuses, are classified as irregular bones.|$|E
25|$|Wrinkle ridges are {{features}} {{created by}} <b>compressive</b> tectonic forces within the maria. These features represent buckling {{of the surface}} and form long ridges across parts of the maria. Some of these ridges may outline buried craters or other features beneath the maria. A prime example of such an outlined feature is the crater Letronne.|$|E
25|$|The {{data for}} an {{earthquake}} is plotted using a lower-hemisphere stereographic projection. The azimuth and take-off angle {{are used to}} plot the position of an individual seismic record. The take-off angle is the angle from the vertical of a seismic ray as it emerges from the earthquake focus. These angles are calculated from a standard set of tables that describe {{the relationship between the}} take-off angle and the distance between the focus and the observing station. By convention, filled symbols are used to plot data from stations where the P-wave first motion recorded was up (a <b>compressive</b> wave), hollow symbols for down (a tensional wave), with dots for stations with arrivals too weak {{to get a sense of}} motion. If there are sufficient observations, one may draw two well-constrained orthogonal great circles that divide the <b>compressive</b> from the tensional observations and these are the nodal planes. Observations from stations with no clear first motion normally lie close to these planes. By convention the compressional quadrants are colour-filled and the tensional left white. The two nodal planes intersect at the N (neutral)-axis. The P and T axes are also often plotted; with the N axis these three directions respectively match the directions of the maximum, minimum and intermediate principal <b>compressive</b> stresses associated with the earthquake. The P-axis is plotted in the centre of the white segment, the T-axis in the centre of the colour-filled segment.|$|E
25|$|In British and European (except former Soviet Union countries) practice, {{locomotives}} {{usually have}} buffers {{at each end}} to absorb <b>compressive</b> loads ("buffets"). The tensional load of drawing the train (draft force) is carried by the coupling system. Together these control slack between the locomotive and train, absorb minor impacts and provide a bearing point for pushing movements.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 66 {{people died in}} this stampede. According to the {{post-mortem}} examinations, all of the deceased victims died of <b>compressive</b> asphyxia. An additional 61 people were injured, including 21 seriously; 45 of the 66 dead were adolescents, as young as 14, including five young women. The Luzhniki Stadium tragedy was the Soviet Union's worst sporting disaster.|$|E
25|$|Fuller {{wrote that}} the natural {{analytic}} geometry of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres {{and the number of}} <b>compressive</b> or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous truss is cyclically tetrahedral.|$|E
25|$|Pipes and {{pressure}} vessels subject to external overpressure, caused for example by steam cooling within the pipe and condensing into water with subsequent massive pressure drop, risk buckling due to <b>compressive</b> hoop stresses. Design rules for {{calculation of the}} required wall thickness or reinforcement rings are given in various piping {{and pressure}} vessel codes.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels are {{biocompatible}} and {{proven to}} be tolerated in many tissue types, including the CNS. Mahoney and Anseth formed PEG hydrogels by photopolymerizing methacrylate groups covalently linked to degradable PEG macromers. Hydrogel degradation was monitored over time by measuring mechanical strength (<b>compressive</b> modulus) and average mesh size from swelling ratio data. Initially, the polymer chains were highly cross-linked, but as degradation proceeded, ester bonds were hydrolyzed, allowing the gel to swell; the <b>compressive</b> modulus decreased as the mesh size increased until the hydrogel was completely dissolved. It was demonstrated that neural precursor cells were able to be photoencapsulated and cultured on the PEG gels with minimal cell death. Because the mesh size is initially small, the hydrogel blocks inflammatory and other inhibitory signals from surrounding tissue. As the mesh size increases, the hydrogel is able {{to serve as a}} scaffold for axon regeneration.|$|E
25|$|Sediments {{from the}} Late Permian to Triassic periods are absent in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin, but {{evidenced}} {{in the surrounding}} orogens. Intense magmatism and metamorphism affected the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The <b>compressive</b> phase {{is associated with the}} Hercynian orogeny, leading to the formation of Pangea.|$|E
