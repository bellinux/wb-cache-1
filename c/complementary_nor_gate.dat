Experiments were carried out on CdSe at liquid Nitrogen temperature. The operation wavelength is around 673 nm in CdSe.

5000|$|An XOR {{gate circuit}} {{can be made}} from four NAND gates in the {{configuration}} shown below. In fact, both NAND and <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> are so-called [...] "universal gates" [...] and any logical function can be constructed from either NAND logic or NOR logic alone. If the four NAND gates, below, are replaced by <b>NOR</b> <b>gates,</b> this results in an XNOR gate, which can be converted to an XOR gate by inverting the output or one of the inputs (e.g. with a fifth <b>NOR</b> <b>gate).</b> An alternative arrangement of five <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> is shown below, in a topology that emphasizes the construction of the function from [...] (noting from de Morgan's Law that a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> is, in effect, an inverted-input AND gate) but this is clearly not as versatile a 5-gate construction of the XOR function as the one derived from the XNOR construction.|$|R
50|$|An AND gate gives a 1 output {{when both}} inputs are 1; a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> gives a 1 output only when both inputs are 0. Therefore, an AND gate {{is made by}} {{inverting}} the inputs of a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|R

50|$|Now {{we could}} have {{implemented}} those functions exactly according to their SoP and PoS canonical forms, by turning <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> into the functions specified. A <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> is made into an OR gate by passing its output through a 1-input NOR gate; and it is made into an AND gate by passing each of its inputs through a 1-input <b>NOR</b> <b>gate.</b> However, this approach not only increases the number of gates used, but also doubles the number of gate delays processing the signals, cutting the processing speed in half. Consequently, whenever performance is vital, going beyond canonical forms and doing the Boolean algebra to make the unenhanced <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> do the job is well worthwhile.|$|R

The gene regulatory circuit was designed to sense Ultra-Violet (UV) irradiation as input signal. The circuit is composed of two associated parts: a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> and a bistable switch. The <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> is controlled by both the input signal and the bistable switch. On the other hand, the bistable switch can be triggered by {{the output of the}} <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> and switch from one state to the other.
