5000|$|The “station at Freiburg" [...] (Bahnhof bei Freiburg) was {{initially}} outside the city, {{as shown in}} the plan by Joseph Wilhelm Lerch of 1852. It {{was initially}} accessible only via the extended Bertoldstraße, until the completion of the entrance building on Eisenbahnstraße (railway street) in 1861. The construction of the railway station led to Freiburg finally growing out of the confines of the fortress. Hotels, restaurants and the central post office were built in the Vauban belt along Eisenbahnstraße and a landscaped area was established between the city and the station. The city of Freiburg implemented a zoning plan called Hinterm Bahnhof ("behind the station"), leading {{to the development of the}} current Stühlinger <b>quarter.</b> <b>Commercial</b> operations and factories were soon established there, some of which were displaced from the now residential areas of Herder and Wiehre.|$|R

50|$|However, Turhan’s {{greatest}} accomplishment {{would be}} built {{in the capital of}} the empire, Istanbul. Yeni Mosque has an interesting story. The initial construction was started by one of Turhan’s predecessors, Safiye Sultan. She had chosen the <b>commercial</b> <b>quarter</b> of the city, Eminonü as the location of the mosque. This area was inhabited by non-Muslims. By building a new mosque in Eminönü, Safiye wanted to Islamize the area. To build on this site meant that land had to be appropriated from the local non-Muslim residents, an act that had not gone smoothly. In the year 1597, the first stones were laid. At the death of Safiye’s son, Mehmed III, the construction of the mosque stopped as she was no longer the Valide. The construction was abandoned for 57 years, but was restarted after the area was devastated by the Great Fire of 1660. The mosque received a second chance when Turhan decided to complete what had been started by Safiye Sultan. After its completion in 1665, the complex contained not only the mosque, but also a school, public fountains, a market and a tomb. According to Peirce the Yeni Mosque gained the distinction of being the first imperial mosque built by a woman.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a {{continuation}} of our assessment of the finishing of low thermal expansion material wafers obtained through three different <b>commercial</b> pathways. This <b>quarter</b> we have patterned and printed a ULE{reg_sign} wafer (Rodel 1) and saw no difference between its images and those from silicon wafer substrates. This further demonstrated that ULE{reg_sign} can be used as the EUVL mask substrate material. We have also evaluated substrates produced by three vendors: Hoya, General Optics, and Rodel. Consistent with our results reported last quarter, surface roughness of the bare substrates from all three companies does not depend on the position. For Hoya, the wafers it produced had a low roughness than those from last quarter. However, the cleanliness of the wafers needs to be improved. For General Optics, the wafer roughness has increased, and it was only able to deliver one wafer this quarter. General Optics will be replaced by Schott ML next quarter. For Rodel, one of its wafers (Rodel 1) that had been cleaned in-house showed excellent finishing and was selected to be patterned. We also observed that the sleeks on the substrates were smoothed by the ML coating. The other two Rodel wafers (Rodel 2 and Rodel 4) had too many defects and the roughness values derived from AFM are not reliable...|$|R
50|$|Although the expeditions of Lacerda and Gamitto {{were largely}} <b>commercial,</b> the third <b>quarter</b> {{of the nineteenth}} century saw {{scientific}} African expeditions. The Portuguese government was suspicious that the efforts of explorers from other European nations, particularly those whose leasers held some official, often consular, position (as Livingstone had), could be used by their home nations to claim territory Portugal regarded as its own. To prevent this, the Lisbon Geographical Society and the Geographical Commission of the Portuguese Ministry of Marine, which at that time had responsibility for overseas territories as well as the navy, created a joint commission in 1875, which planned scientific expeditions to the area between Angola and Mozambique. Although the Minister, Andrade Corvo, doubted Portugal's ability to achieve a coast-to-coast empire, he sanctioned the expeditions for their scientific value. Despite their mixed aims, three expeditions led by Alexandre de Serpa Pinto were undertaken, through which Portugal could attempt to assert its African territorial claims. The first was from Mozambique to the eastern Zambezi in 1869, the second to the Congo and upper Zambezi from Angola in 1876 and the last in 1877-79 crossing Africa from Angola, with the intention of claiming the area between it and Mozambique. Also in 1877, Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens led an expedition from Luanda towards the Congo basin. Capelo made a second journey from Angola to Mozambique, largely following existing trade routes, in 1884-85.|$|R

40|$|The various {{buildings}} and installations which comprise this holiday town have been organised {{in the following}} manner: a) Residential zone, consisting of separate chalets for single families. There are 200 of these houses, and they follow four distinct designs. All of them are only meant to serve as sleeping and resting quarters, since meals are to be prepared and taken at a collective restaurant. This residential zone also comprises various other buildings that are essential for the functional effectiveness of the holiday town, namely: collective club and restaurant, reception and control <b>quarters,</b> <b>commercial</b> zone, with shops and bars, manager's house, garage-workshop and church. —b) Sports zone: there are facilities for the practise of various games (pelota, tennis, bowls, skating, basket ball and swimming). As a continuation to this there is the beach zone, which has a bar restaurant, and the necessary installations for the swimmers, such as changing rooms, showers and store room where various kinds of sporting gear for swimmers is kept. —c) Service zone, with accommodation for the staff, health centre and wastage disposal fittings. —d) Park and garden spaces extend throughout the holiday town. The architectural style is in accordance wits its situation on the Mediterranean: light, colour and the exuberance of nature have been determining factors in planning this project. Various ideas of the popular Andalusian seaside architecture have been borrowed, and in general terms the curved outline has been preferred to the straight one, since it represents and adapts itself better to the description of gentle rhythms and subtle shadows, {{in a region where}} the sharpness of light contrasts is often too violent. Las instalaciones y edificios de esta ciudad para vacaciones, han sido agrupadas en las siguientes zonas: a) Zona residencial, compuesta de chalets familiares aislados —hasta, un número de 200 — de cuatro tipos diferentes, pero cuya distribución interior ha sido estudiada expresamente para dormir y estar, ya que las comidas han de prepararse y servirse en el restaurante colectivo. En dichas zonas se integran, asimismo, los edificios necesarios para el funcionamiento de la ciudad: club y restaurante colectivo, recepción y dirección, sector comercial con tiendas y bares, vivienda del director, garaje-taller e iglesia. b) Zonas deportivas con instalaciones para diversos juegos (frontones, tenis, bolera, patines, baloncesto y piscina). Como continuación de esta zona se considera otra de playa o marítima, con un edificio bar-restaurante y las instalaciones necesarias de vestuarios para los bañistas, duchas y almacén de útiles náuticos. c) Zonas de servicios, con alojamientos para el personal, centro sanitario y estación de recogida de basuras. d) Zonas de parques y jardines, distribuidas por toda la ciudad. La línea arquitectónica de los edificios está condicionada al carácter mediterráneo del lugar; y la luz, el color y la naturaleza han sido factores determinantes en el proyecto. Se han tomado ideas de la arquitectura popular andaluza junto al mar, y, en general, ha sido preferida la línea curva a la recta, por entenderse que aquélla es más expresiva y adaptable a una arquitectura de formas suaves y sombras difuminadas, en un medio donde la dureza de la luz es un factor importante...|$|R
40|$|Due to the British {{employing}} {{an extensive}} administrative policy concerning commerce and property tax, {{coupled with the}} attention focussed on Potchefstroom by the Transvaal War, a large and varied number of sources are available from which a detailed picture of the central commercial area of the town in 1880 can be reconstructed to indicate the evolution {{of this part of}} Potchefstroom. As no provision was made for a business area in the original planning of Potchefstroom one developed organically after the settlement of foreign traders after the Sand River Convention of 1852. From the original trading focal point around the Old Market it spread southwards towards the New Market Square when that was established in 1855. This resulted in a <b>commercial</b> <b>quarter</b> comprising the Old and New Market Squares and the stretch of Kerk Street connecting them.
