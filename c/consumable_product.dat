During this action bread was baked then served to viewers after the performance. As a complex exploration of women's traditional roles, the performance is both a celebration of motherhood and nurture, and a critique of woman as a <b>consumable</b> <b>product</b> of culture. Murray River Punch (1980) is one of Ely's most well known and significant performances. The work was first performed at Melbourne University’s George Paton Gallery in June 1980 {{as part of a}} week of performance titled Women at Work. In this work the artist set up a cooking demonstration in the university’s Student Union foyer at lunchtime and assumed the role of a cooking demonstrator who narrates the recipe for a ‘punch’ drink, the ingredients coming from pollutants in the Murray River.|$|E
5000|$|Dosage forms (also {{called unit}} doses) are {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{products in the}} form {{in which they are}} marketed for use, with a specific mixture of active ingredients and inactive components (excipients), in a particular configuration (such as a capsule shell, for example), and apportioned into a particular dose. For example, two products may both be amoxicillin, but one is in 500 mg capsules and another is in 250 mg chewable tablets. The term unit dose can also sometimes encompass non-reusable packaging as well (especially when each drug product is individually packaged), although the FDA distinguishes that by unit-dose [...] "packaging" [...] or [...] "dispensing". Depending on the context, multi(ple) unit dose can refer to distinct drug products packaged together, or to a single drug product containing multiple drugs and/or doses. The term dosage form can also sometimes refer only to the pharmaceutical formulation of a drug product's constituent drug substance(s) and any blends involved, without considering matters beyond that (like how it is ultimately configured as a <b>consumable</b> <b>product</b> such as a capsule, patch, etc.). Because of the somewhat vague boundaries and unclear overlap of these terms and certain variants and qualifiers thereof within the pharmaceutical industry, caution is often advisable when conversing with someone who may be unfamiliar with another person's use of the term.|$|E

Then we relate the return policy characteristics to these quality ratings. Consistent with signaling theory, we find that as the ratings of e-tailer quality increase, return policy leniency increases in non-consumable product categories. However, the positive quality/return policy leniency relationship does not hold in <b>consumable</b> <b>product</b> categories. In a follow-up experiment, {{we investigate}} how consumers interpret the return policy signal. Specifically, we find that consumers' ability to control their shopping experience and their general trust of e-tailers moderate their reactions to return policies that differ in leniency.

40|$|This chapter {{reflects}} on the centralisation of immersive experiences in contemporary cultural production, broadly conceived, comparatively analysing a range of examples including Lucien Bourjeily’s 66 Minutes in Damascus (2012), Punchdrunk’s The Crash of the Elysium (2011 - 12) and …and darkness descended (2011), Hilary Westlake’s Dining with Alice (1999), Florida’s Walt Disney World Resort, and US, UK and Japanese horror house culture. It situates immersive theatre within a (now) pervasive ‘experience economy’ identified by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore, and addresses a ‘gap’ between lived experiences and idealised and especially marketable experiences within this economy. Alston suggests that the entry of ethically-engaged immersive theatre into the experience economy, especially, raises a number of concerning issues once participation and immersion are aligned {{with one of the}} experience economy’s most important goals: ‘authenticity’. The chapter proposes a critique of authenticity in immersive theatre that focuses on the performance of confinement in a Syrian detention centre in Bourjeily’s 66 Minutes in Damascus, and the director’s claim that the performance offers the chance ‘to experience first-hand’ {{what it must be like}} to be detained. In conclusion, Alston explores how the assignation of authenticity to the promise of Experience merges an ethics of encounter with a <b>consumable</b> <b>product</b> for an audience’s delectation, suggesting that the ethical space left for audiences ultimately amounts to sabotage...|$|E

40|$|Governments are the {{custodians}} of {{vast amount}} of data. While some of this data may be sensitive in nature, in that it contains personal or confidential information, {{much of it is}} in the public interest. Recent years has seen the emergence of Open Government Data (OGD) where governments are now actively making their data available in open and electronically accessible formats. The motivation for the production of such data includes a desire to increase transparency but also a desire to realise the economic potential associated with re-use of this data. A key usage area for this data to date has been within mobile applications where raw OGD is transformed into a <b>consumable</b> <b>product.</b> Making data available for re-use in this context introduces the concept of data quality in that the OGD being released must be of sufficient quality to allow for re-use by application developers. This dissertation proposes a set of quality guidelines to be applied to OGD to aid its utility within mobile application development. The guidelines are derived from an assessment of Irish produced OGD. Existing data quality literature indicates that data quality can be assessed at both an objective and subjective level. This research adopts this proposal, objectively assessing OGD data quality through an impartial assessment of the data. It also subjectively assesses the quality of OGD through it utilisation within an experimental mobile application developed on the Android platform.

40|$|Many durable {{products}} {{cannot be}} used without a contingent <b>consumable</b> <b>product,</b> e. g., printers require ink, iPods require songs, razors require blades, etc. For such products, manufacturers {{may be able to}} lock in consumers by making their products incompatible with consumables that are produced by other firms. We examine the effectiveness of such a strategy in the presence of strategic consumers who anticipate the future prices of both the durable product and the contingent consumable. Under a lock-in strategy, the manufacturer has pricing power over the contingent consumable, which she can use to extract additional rents from higher valuation consumers, but such pricing power may also reduce consumers' willingness to pay for the durable because it subjects them to being held up with higher consumables prices in the future. Restricting our attention to linear pricing policies, we find that if the manufacturer can commit to shutting down production of her durable after an initial one-time sale, then competition from another consumable of an appropriately degraded level of quality can benefit the manufacturer by mitigating consumers' fears of being held up. On the other hand, when the manufacturer cannot commit to shutting down production of her durable, then her own output of additional durables gives her an incentive to keep consumables prices low, and competition in the consumables market is less beneficial.

40|$|Based on archival and ethnographic {{research}}, {{this research}} depicts {{the story of}} a Levantine mansion which is situated on Büyükada, Istanbul. Conceptualizing the dispossession of the Fabiato Mansion as part of the political violence targeting the non-Muslim communities of Turkey, the thesis aims to capture the continuum between the processes of ethnic cleansing and the Turkification of capital. Following the story of the Fabiato Mansion, which was confiscated in 1993 after the death of its owner, Aurora Fabiato, and transformed into a “culture house” upon the initiative of Turkey’s Touring and Automobile Club (Touring), this thesis attempts at a critical analysis of the aestheticization process and the institutional and individual remembering, as well as silencing, practices around the mansion. The aestheticization process of the Fabiato Mansion can be characterized as a process that aims at turning loss into a <b>consumable</b> <b>product</b> {{in the form of a}} touristic curiosity. A particular presentation of Levantine history justifies the appropriation of the building, while attuning its inhabitants and its history with discourses of Turkish history that glosses over systematic political violence and nationalization of property. The thesis investigates how the history of the mansion is reflected in various archives while at the same time focusing on contemporary memory practices. Taking both institutional archiving and personal memory as instances of knowledge production as much as knowledge preservation, it argues that the knowledge production surrounding the Fabiato Mansion needs to be understood as a process of silencing with gendered and ethnicized dimensions. The silence produced and upheld by state and non-state archives, as well as individuals take different forms, which can be summarized as follows: first, aestheticization as a tool to silence the story of the reminiscences of the past; second, the marginalization of personal memory (vs. written documentation and official history); third, the normalization of political violence through cultural policy; and fourth, archival silencing...|$|E
40|$|Continued {{pressure}} {{to reduce costs}} and manage healthcare delivery in risk-based reimbursement environments, has, internationally, resulted in hospitals adopting different methods to manage pharmaceutical and surgical <b>consumable</b> <b>products.</b> An initial review of systems of management of these products showed that the trend is to manage them separately. Pharmaceutical products are managed using dedicated resources and structures in each hospital, which {{may be difficult to}} establish and sustain in smaller, non-academic hospitals. Amongst other factors, the absence of a classification system and a lack of utilisation information hindered the development of management systems for surgical <b>consumable</b> <b>products.</b> In addition, traditional materials management processes applied to these products, often do not adequately address the impact that these products have on clinical care. In this study, {{the decision was made to}} develop an integrated system for both pharmaceutical and surgical <b>consumable</b> <b>products</b> and to adopt a systems approach in which all hospitals in the group were included as a single system. The study was multi-methodological with the design being contextual and qualitative and the research strategy, exploratory and descriptive. A multi-phased, action research approach was used, comprising of three (3) cycles, two (2) in which the integrated system was developed and enhanced and a third in which it was independently tested in 19 newly acquired hospitals. The result of the three (3) cycles was an implemented integrated system across 43 acute-care hospitals in the group comprising six (6) processes namely: a product selection process, information technology (IT) support system, a hospital implementation process, measurement and management tools, pharmacy capability and a supplier strategy and interface process. These processes included several key unique features, such as one (1) product selection team for all hospitals, a surgical classification system based on functional therapeutic uses, a single IT system and utilisation review capability for all products, extending the role of pharmacy departments in hospitals to include the management of surgical <b>consumable</b> <b>products</b> and an integrated quality assessment process for both types of products. By the end of the three (3) cycles (September 1999), the product selection process covered 66, 5 % of value of product spend, the percentage reduction in the number of products used was 68 % and the value of products purchased that complied with specified products and suppliers was 90 %. Ongoing and further application showed that the integrated system could be sustained in existing hospitals, applied to a further four (4) newly acquired hospitals and expanded to include specialised pharmaceutical and surgical <b>consumable</b> <b>products</b> in cardiac catheterisation laboratories. By September 2003, the total spend on pharmaceutical and surgical <b>consumable</b> <b>products</b> had reached R 1, 7 billion. The product selection process covered 67, 6 % of total spend, the compliance value reached 95 % and there were additional financial improvements realised. Following a further literature review, limitations and improvements to the approach were identified and further adaptations were added as concepts in the graphic representation of system. One (1) of these was to show the integrated system as an open system. The second adaptation highlighted the systems-based input-process-outcomes feedback concept that is critical to continuous improvement of the system. In the final progression, a systems approach to strategic planning and management was incorporated in order to provide a structured approach for adapting to the rapid and ongoing changes in healthcare and aligning the system of management of pharmaceutical and surgical consumables to the overall business strategy. Overall, this research study succeeded in bringing new perspectives and an innovative approach to the management of pharmaceutical and surgical <b>consumable</b> <b>products</b> by developing and implementing an integrated system for both products, establishing essential processes with key unique features and tools, and the application of a systems thinking approach. Four (4) areas of further research are suggested, namely testing the integrated system in other contexts, improved methods of measurement of quality of care, extension to other areas of healthcare and use of the systems approach in other areas of the business.
