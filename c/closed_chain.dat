Surface Electromyography (SEMG) is an approach {{for evaluation of}} muscle activities and onset time during different functions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to use SEMG for detection of central motor control in different functions of knee extensor muscles. Materials and Methods: Ten healthy subjects contributed in this study. They were done five repetitions of knee flexion/extension in open and <b>close</b> <b>chain</b> separately during recording of SEMG simultaneously. Integrated EMG (iEMG) of three middle repeated cycles were detected according to <b>chain</b> (open- <b>close)</b> and kind of contraction (concentric- eccentric). then the Average of three slope of iEMG compared to each other. Results: There were not significant differences in MUR of three extensor muscles for concentric and eccentric contractions in open chain but vastus medialis and lateralis muscles showed significant changes in <b>close</b> <b>chain</b> (P< 0. 05). Result showed that there were significant differences of MUR for two kind of muscle contractions between open and <b>close</b> <b>chains</b> (P< 0. 05. Conclusion: Recruitment of motor units has not shown difference in open chain between concentric and eccentric contractions. This process indicates representative similarity of control pattern in two kind of contraction in open chain. Concentric contraction at <b>close</b> <b>chain</b> cycle has more MUR in comparison with eccentric contraction. It is equal to more interference of contractible compartment in concentric to eccentric contraction. This happens due to the nature of two kind of contraction particularly in <b>close</b> <b>chain</b> cycle. Comparison between two chains indicated that more motor units contribute in <b>close</b> <b>chain</b> (concentric and eccentric).

The analogous concept for <b>closed</b> <b>chains</b> is convexification: reconfiguration to a planar convex polygon. Chains that cannot be straightened or convexified are called locked.

50|$|A precise (homology) version can {{be stated}} using winding numbers. The winding number of a closed curve around a point a {{not on the}} curve is the {{integral}} of f(z)/(2i), where f(z) = 1/(z &minus; a) around the curve. It is an integer.Briefly, the path integral along a Jordan curve of a function holomorphic {{in the interior of}} the curve, is zero. Instead of a single closed path we can consider a linear combination of closed paths, where the scalars are integers. Such a combination is called a <b>closed</b> <b>chain,</b> and one defines an integral along the chain as a linear combination of integrals over individual paths. A <b>closed</b> <b>chain</b> is called a cycle in a region if it is homologous to zero in the region; that is, the winding number, expressed by the integral of 1/(z &minus; a) over the <b>closed</b> <b>chain,</b> is zero for each point 'a' not in the region. This means that the <b>closed</b> <b>chain</b> does not wind around points outside the region. Then Cauchy's theorem can be stated as the integral of a function holomorphic in an open set taken around any cycle in the open set is zero. An example is furnished by the ring-shaped region. This version is crucial for rigorous derivation of Laurent series and Cauchy's residue formula without involving any physical notions such as cross cuts or deformations. The version enables the extension of Cauchy's theorem to multiply-connected regions analytically.|$|E
