2500|$|In archaea and eukaryotes, RNA {{polymerase}} contains subunits homologous {{to each of}} {{the five}} RNA polymerase subunits in bacteria and also contains additional subunits. In archaea and eukaryotes, the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple general transcription factors that work together. In archaea, there are three general transcription factors: TBP, TFB, and TFE. In eukaryotes, in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, there are six general transcription factors: TFIIA, TFIIB (an ortholog of archaeal TFB), TFIID (a multisubunit factor in which the key subunit, TBP, is an ortholog of archaeal TBP), TFIIE (an ortholog of archaeal TFE), TFIIF, and TFIIH. In archaea and eukaryotes, the RNA polymerase-promoter <b>closed</b> <b>complex</b> is usually referred to as the [...] "preinitiation complex." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{initiation}} of gene transcription in eukaryotes occurs in specific steps. [...] First, an RNA polymerase along with general transcription factors binds to the promoter {{region of the}} gene to form a <b>closed</b> <b>complex</b> called the preinitiation complex. The subsequent transition of the complex from the closed state to the open state results in the melting or separation of the two DNA strands and the positioning of the template strand to the active site of the RNA polymerase. Without the need of a primer, RNA polymerase can initiate the synthesis of a new RNA chain using the template DNA strand to guide ribonucleotide selection and polymerization chemistry. However, many of the initiated syntheses are aborted before the transcripts reach a significant length (~10 nucleotides). During these abortive cycles, the polymerase keeps making and releasing short transcripts until {{it is able to}} produce a transcript that surpasses ten nucleotides in length. Once this threshold is attained, RNA polymerase passes the promoter and transcription proceeds to the elongation phase.|$|E

Six point mutations in the repeated T-T-G-C sequences that flank the - 35 consensus region of PRE decreased the apparent affinity of the promoter for cII protein by factors of 4 - 16 relative to the wild-type affinity. Kinetic analyses of transcription initiation in the presence and absence of cII protein demonstrated that five of the six mutations did not significantly affect the intrinsic interaction of RNA polymerase with PRE. Thus, these mutations differ from other cy mutations, including those in the - 35 consensus region, which affect the formation of polymerase-PRE <b>closed</b> <b>complexes</b> or the isomerization of <b>closed</b> <b>complexes</b> to open complexes but do not affect the binding of cII protein.

40|$|A mutation, serine 170 to alanine, in the {{proposed}} ATP binding site of the activator protein NTRC prevents transcriptional activation at sigma 54 -dependent promoters both in vivo and in vitro. The rate of phosphorylation of the mutant protein by NTRB and the stability of mutant NTRC-phosphate {{were similar to those}} of wild-type NTRC. The phosphorylated mutant protein shows only a slight decrease in affinity (around 2 -fold) for tandem NTRC binding sites in the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifL promoter suggesting that the mutation primarily influences the positive control function of NTRC. Moreover the mutant protein is trans dominant to the wild-type protein with respect to transcriptional activation at both the glnAp 2 and nifL promoters. In vitro footprinting experiments reveal that the mutant protein is unable to catalyse isomerisation of <b>closed</b> promoter <b>complexes</b> between sigma 54 -RNA polymerase and the nifL promoter to open promoter complexes. However, the mutant protein retains the ability to increase the occupancy of the - 24, - 12 region by sigma 54 -RNA polymerase, forming <b>closed</b> <b>complexes</b> at the nifL promoter, which are not detectable in the absence of NTRC.
