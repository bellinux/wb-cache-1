25|$|During high {{outbreak}} densities, some males, called “hangers,” {{change their}} copulation behavior. They do not attach physically to the branch while mating, which {{allows them to}} mate longer and counteract their mate’s efforts to reject them. This behavior increases the percentage of eggs they fertilize as they delay their mated female from remating and reduce number of potential mates the female <b>can</b> <b>have.</b> <b>This</b> hanging behavior does not appear at low population densities, presumably {{because it is more}} energetically costly and more conspicuous, since it can attract more males that can potentially interfere in the copulation process. As a result, males only exhibit this behavior when they are trying to prolong mating to reduce sperm competition.|$|E

In simple terms, unlike all other known fields, the Higgs field requires less energy to have a non-zero value than a zero value, so it ends up having a non-zero value everywhere.

2500|$|The Skywhales design {{received}} a mixed reception after the balloon was unveiled on 9 May 2013. Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister Katy Gallagher {{said that her}} eyes [...] "nearly fell out of her head" [...] when she first saw a diagram of The Skywhales design, but {{she had come to}} like it and believed that it would challenge the perception of Canberra as a boring city. She also stated that [...] "There will be people in the community who think it's a great achievement to have won a commission like this in the ACT and have it as a symbol of our centenary and those who won't see it as value for money". The leader of the opposition in the ACT, Jeremy Hanson, was critical of The Skywhale stating that [...] "I really don't know whether to laugh or cry ... it's an embarrassing indulgence only a fourth term government would contemplate". Public views of the design, as expressed on social media and talkback radio, were also mixed. Much of the public criticism has been focused on the five breasts which hang from each side of the balloon, with a Twitter user calling it [...] "terrifyingly nipply". The director of the Canberra Museum and Gallery wrote an opinion article praising The Skywhale, arguing that the strength of the design [...] "arises from how it concentrates the wonder, awe and mystery we experience in nature, with an urgent insistence on social engagement". The Canberra Times' art critic Kerry-Anne Cousins complemented the boldness of the design, and stated that [...] "I think it's a mark of the sophistication of Canberra that we <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> kind of debate". In response to the criticism of the balloon's design, Piccinini has stated that it wasn't intended to be sexual and the breasts represent how female whales feed their calves. She also believes that The Skywhale is likely to win greater support once Canberrans see it in person.|$|E
