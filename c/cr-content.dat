40|$|Abstract. The cyclic and {{isothermal}} oxidation behaviours of stabilized and non-stabilized ferritic and {{austenitic stainless}} steels were compared. Ferritic grades exhibited parabolic kinetics in both oxidation conditions. The protectiveness of chromia scales was maintained owing primarily to a far faster Cr-supply rate than the Cr-consumption rate. Consequently, a constant and high enough interfacial <b>Cr-content</b> was noted and mechanical induced chemical failure (MICF) was avoided; although spallation of the oxide scale was observed during cyclic oxidation. Austenitic grades also exhibited parabolic kinetics during isothermal oxidation but a significant mass loss during cyclic oxidation due to spallation of nodular iron oxides. Actually, all the austenitic grades were sensitive to MICF because of their high values of kp/DCr implying interfacial <b>Cr-content</b> decreasing with oxidation time. Stabilizers (Ti, Nb) had no {{significant effect on the}} resistance of ferritic stainless steels to MICF; whereas, for the austenitics, Nb-addition enabled delay of the formation of iron oxides...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the diamond productions from Panda (Ekati Mine) and Snap Lake with those from southern Africa shows significant differences: diamonds from the Slave typically are un-resorbed octahedrals or macles, often with opaque coats, and yellow colours are very rare. Diamonds from the Kaapvaal are dominated by resorbed, dodecahedral shapes, coats are absent and yellow colours are common. The first two features suggest exposure to oxidizing fluids/melts during mantle storage and/or transport to the Earth's surface, for the Kaapvaal diamond population. Comparing peridotitic inclusions in diamonds from the central and southern Slave (Panda, DO 27 and Snap Lake kimberlites) and the Kaapvaal indicates that the diamondiferous mantle lithosphere beneath the Slave is chemically less depleted. Most notable are the almost complete absence of garnet inclusions derived from low-Ca harzburgites and a generally lower Mg-number of Slave inclusions. Geothermobarometric calculations suggest that Slave diamonds originally formed at very similar thermal conditions as observed beneath the Kaapvaal (geothermal gradients corresponding to 40 – 42 mW/m 2 surface heat flow), but the diamond source regions subsequently cooled by about 100 – 150 °C to fall on a 37 – 38 mW/m 2 (surface heat flow) conductive geotherm, as is evidenced from touching (re-equilibrated) inclusions in diamonds, and from xenocrysts and xenoliths. In the Kaapvaal, a similar thermal evolution has previously been recognized for diamonds from the De Beers Pool kimberlites. In part very low aggregation levels of nitrogen impurities in Slave diamonds imply that cooling occurred soon after diamond formation. This may relate elevated temperatures during diamond formation to short-lived magmatic perturbations. Generally high <b>Cr-contents</b> of pyrope garnets (inside and outside of diamonds) indicate that the mantle lithosphere beneath the Slave originally formed as a residue of melt extraction at relatively low pressures (within the stability field of spinelperidotites), possibly during the extraction of oceanic crust. After emplacement of this depleted, oceanic mantle lithosphere into the Slave lithosphere during a subduction event, secondary metasomatic enrichment occurred leading to strong re-enrichment of the deeper (&# 62; 140 km) lithosphere. Because {{of the extent of}} this event and the occurrence of lower mantle diamonds, this may be related to an upwelling plume, but it may equally just reflect a long term evolution with lower mantle diamonds being transported upwards in the course of “normal” mantle convection...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between diamonds and high-Cr, sub-calcic garnets from kimberlites suggests that garnets have experienced high pressure (and presumably, high temperature) {{conditions in the}} subcontinental lithosphere mantle (SCLM). The oxygen isotope compositions of these garnets are generally reported to be lower than average values of mantle olivines (5. 2 ‰) —opposite the sense of oxygen isotope fractionation expected at high-temperature equilibrium, and to correlate negatively with their Cr-contents. These observations were interpreted to indicate the sub-calcic garnets either are derived from melting Cr-enriched but ^(18) O-depleted source in the SCLM, or have experienced cryptic metasomatism by high-Cr, high-Mg#, but ^(18) O-depleted fluids/melts in the SCLM or during their ascent to the surface. We investigate the possibility that oxygen isotope characteristics of these garnets instead reflect an analytical artifact that reduces the measured δ^(18) O of garnets in proportion to its Cr content—a so-called ‘Cr-effect’. Mixtures of garnet standards (UWG- 2) plus various amounts of pure Cr-metal were measured for δ^(18) O-values by infrared-laser fluorination technique (ILFT). Our results show that oxygen isotope compositions of sample mixtures vary systematically {{as a function of}} <b>Cr-content</b> and O_(2) -yield. Mass-balance analyses indicate that the correlation between the measured δ^(18) O-value and <b>Cr-content</b> is an analytical artifact mostly due to isotopic fractionation between the extracted-O_(2) and chromium oxyfluorides left as residues in the sample chamber during the ILFT analyses, which amounts to a decrease in the measured δ^(18) O values of 0. 064 ‰ for the increase of every wt. ...|$|E

Albeit the excellent corrosion resistance, conventional Fe-Cr-Al alloys suffer from alpha-alpha' phase separation and embrittlement when subjected to temperatures up to 500 degrees C, due to their high <b>Cr-content.</b> Low-Cr Fe-Cr-Al alloys are anticipated to be embrittlement resistant and provide adequate oxidation properties, yet long-term aging experiments and simulations are lacking in literature.

Based on regression of the orthopyroxene-spinel Mg-Fe^ distribution coefficients against the Cr-mole fractions of the spinel {{of a number of}} naturally and experimentally equilibrated samples, the empirical calibration is more successful, gives internally consistent results and agrees well with independent temperature estimates {{of a wide range of}} terrestrial test samples. Uncertainty of the empirically determined temperatures, however, increases with decreasing Mg-Fe^ distribution coefficient between orthopyroxene and spinel and increasing <b>Cr-content</b> of the spinel.

40|$|A {{concept to}} improve {{hardness}} and thermal stability of unstable multilayer alloys is presented based on {{control of the}} coherency strain such that the driving force for decomposition is favorably altered. Cathodic arc evaporated cubic TiCrAlN/Ti 1 −x Cr x N multilayer coatings are used as demonstrators. Upon annealing, the coatings undergo spinodal decomposition into nanometer-sized coherent Ti- and Al-rich cubic domains which {{is affected by the}} coherency strain. In addition, the growth of the domains is restricted by the surrounding TiCrN layer compared to a non-layered TiCrAlN coating which together results in an improved thermal stability of the cubic structure. A significant hardness increase is seen during decomposition for the case with high coherency strain while a low coherency strain results in a hardness decrease for high annealing temperatures. The metal diffusion paths during the domain coarsening are affected by strain which in turn is controlled by the <b>Cr-content</b> (x) in the Ti 1 −x Cr x N layers.

40|$|The {{importance}} of a good vacuum for brazing Chromium containing alloys on stainless steel is well known. The vacuum level required is depending on the Cr content in the brazing alloy, higher content requires a higher vacuum level. Also the alloying composition of the steel in the substrate {{from the point of}} view of elements with high oxygen affinity as e. g. chromium, plays a significant role as well. However, due to the higher <b>Cr-content</b> in the brazing alloy, the dominating factor for what vacuum quality is required is the composition of the brazing alloy. This paper deals with thermodynamic and experimental investigation of the vacuum level required to achieve a good brazing behavior of different alloys. The vacuum levels required, or being more specific, oxygen partial pressures needed, are not at all enough to reduce the Chromium oxide even at the lower chromium activities present in low Chromium containing compositions at the typically applied brazing temperatures. However, brazing powder is covered by heterogeneous oxide, formed by the thin oxide layer of the main matrix element and oxide islands, rich in stronger oxide forming elements. Hence, the oxides controlling the behavior of the powder during process is strongly determined by the removal of this thermodynamically unstable surface oxide layer of base matrix element. Importance of vacuum level/quality is therefore expressed in terms of its effect on oxide transformation and distribution during brazing process that will determine final properties of the component...|$|E

Here, we evaluate if CM group carbonaceous chondritic material, which makes up an important {{fraction of the}} micrometeorite flux today, contains analogous grains that can be searched for in acid residues. We dissolved 8 g of CM 2 meteorite Acfer 331 in HF, which yielded a characteristic assemblage of both transparent Mg-Al- and opaque Cr-spinels > 28 m. We find on average 4. 6 and 130 Mg-Al-spinel grains per gram in the 63250 and 2863 m size fractions, respectively. These grains are mostly pink or colorless, and often characterized by heterogeneous <b>Cr-content.</b> Black, opaque Cr-spinel grains are absent from the > 63 m fraction, but in the 2863 m fraction we find approximately 65 such grains per gram meteorite. The individual grains have a characteristic composition, with heterogeneous major element compositions (e. g., 44. 461. 7 wt% Cr 2 O 3), but narrow ranges for maximum TiO 2 (0. 61. 6 wt%) and V 2 O 3 (0. 51. 0 wt%) concentrations.

40|$|Demands {{on lower}} fuel consumption, reduced pollution, {{increased}} operating times, etc. force {{the automotive industry}} to constantly improve the performance of critical machine elements. In this development various carbon based coatings have proven very promising, mainly because of their low friction and high wear resistance in dry sliding contacts. The contact conditions can be very different in various machine element applications, e. g. both rolling and sliding contacts. Additionally, most contacts are usually lubricated. Hence, other {{properties of the coating}} may be required in order to obtain low friction and wear, as for instance a beneficial running-in ability. In lubricated contacts the very high wear resistance of carbon coatings can cause fatigue damage resulting in delamination of the coating, especially when deposited on rough substrates. In rolling contacts the fatigue damage can be reduced simply by using smoother surfaces, but the thickness of both the coating and the interlayer also has a strong influence on fatigue damage. In lubricated sliding contact tests {{it was found that the}} running-in ability could be improved by modifying the coating and/or by using an appropriate surface preparation prior to coating deposition. An increased <b>Cr-content</b> in the top-layer of the carbon coating reduced the friction due to the formation of a stable tribo-layer on the uncoated counter body. An even further reduced friction could be obtained by employing a fine wet-blasting of the substrate giving sharp surface asperities. The friction reduction is thought to be a result of a transition towards a higher degree of full film lubrication, due to a very fine smoothening process of both the coating and the counter body during the running-in process...|$|E

Rietveld analysis of fitted and observed XRD patterns exhibited the single-phase nature {{of all the}} studied materials, which crystallize in Pbnm space group. Successive substitution of Cr at Mn site in La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 Mn 1 -xCrxO 3 manganites increases the electrical resistivity and decrease the characteristic insulator-metal transition temperature (TIM) of the parent compound along with a hump like feature for higher <b>Cr-content</b> samples. The hump structure basically signifies the onset of anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) interactions as inferred by both the magnetic and infra-red (IR) spectroscopy studies. The systematic suppression of FM state results in a spin glass (SG) like behavior. IR studies revealed that the vibration mode at 413 cm- 1 being associated with internal bending of MnO 6 octehedra, becomes softer, indicating an increase in distortion and hence the possible spin glass behavior. The critical exponents alpha, beta and gama are calculated from the heat capacity (CP) data near the TIM/TFM. The same exhibited variations of their values with doping. In particular the value of beta increases from 0. 37 to 0. 43, clearly indicating the coexistence of both long and short range magnetic orders i. e. tendency towards SG state for Cr doped samples. On the basis of present results, {{it is suggested that}} Cr dilutes double-exchange (DE) based FM and rather promotes the AFM based super exchange interactions (SE) via Cr 3 +/Mn 4 + ions.

40|$|Niobium silicide-based in situ {{composites}} are Nb base alloys {{with high}} Si content {{that have the}} potential for higher temperature capability than the Ni-base superalloys. In microstructure-property studies of these alloys, the differentiation between the alphaNb 5 Si 3 and beta 5 Si 3 is usually not clear, even though it is essential to understanding the solidification of the alloys and the stability of their microstructures at high temperatures. In this work, the effects of Cr (5 or 8 at. %) A 1 (5 or 4 at. %) and Ta (6 at. %) on the microstructures of as-cast and heat-treated Nb- 24 Ti- 18 Si in situ composites have been studied. The main phases observed in the as-cast and heat-treated (at 1400 °C / 1500 °C for 100 h / 200 h) alloys were the niobium solid solution, (Nb,Ti) ss, the silicides, (Nb,Ti) 3 Si, alphaNb 5 Si 3 and beta 5 Si 3, and a Cr-rich C 14 silicide Laves phase. In Nb- 24 Ti- 18 Si (KZ 3) and Nb- 24 Ti- 18 Si- 5 Cr (KZ 4), (Nb,Ti) ss was the primary phase, while in the Al-containing alloys, Nb- 24 Ti- 18 Si- 5 Al (KZ 7), Nb- 24 Ti- 18 Si- 5 Cr- 5 Al (KZ 5), Nb- 24 Ti- 6 Ta- 18 Si- 5 Cr- 5 Al (KZ 6), Nb- 24 Ti- 18 Si- 8 Cr- 4 Al (KZ 2) and Nb- 24 Ti- 6 Ta- 18 Si- 8 Cr- 4 Al (KZ 8), beta 5 Si 3 was the primary phase The as-cast microstructure of KZ 3 consisted of primary (Nb,Ti) ss dendrites together with faceted (Nb,Ti) 3 Si and a rod-like eutectic of (Nb,Ti) ss and (Nb,Ti) 3 Si. The A 1 addition changed the nature of the eutectic; an irregular eutectic of (Nb,Ti) ss and beta 5 Si 3 was formed in the as-cast KZ 7. The Cr stabilised the eutectic of (Nb,Ti) ss and beta 5 Si 3 to lower temperatures and promoted the formation of Ti 5 Si 3 in KZ 8. In KZ 2 and KZ 8, the high <b>Cr-content</b> caused the formation of the Cr-rich C 14 silicide Laves phase without destabilizing the beta 5 Si 3. This Laves phase existed at the depressions of (Nb,Ti) ss dendrites and probably was formed congruently from the remaining liquid. This Laves phase with Si > 2. 5 at. % can be classified as the ternary p-phase proposed by Goldschmidt and Brant, after considering that Si and A 1 atoms substitute for Cr atoms and that Ti and Ta atoms substitute for Nb atoms. During heat-treatments, the beta 5 Si 3 phase transformed to alphaNb 5 Si 3 according to the precipitation reaction beta 5 Si 3 → alphaNb 5 Si 3 + (Nb,Ti) ss, which retarded by Ta and Cr. After heat-treatment, the Ta-containing alloys were homogenised to a lesser extent compared to non-Ta-containing alloys. The Ti 5 Si 3 that formed during solidification in KZ 8 was not eliminated after homogenization at 1400 °C for 100 h. Liquation was observed after 100 h at 1500 °C in KZ 2 and KZ 8, because of their high <b>Cr-content.</b> Thermo-gravimetric analysis was performed at 800 °C for the 100 h heat-treated alloys. "Pest oxidation" was observed in KZ 3. The A 1 and Cr additions suppressed this oxidation mechanism. Higher oxidation rates and lower adherence of the oxide scale were observed with increase of the Cr concentration and/or the Ta addition. The Cr-rich silicide Laves phase and Nb 5 Si 3 silicides with very low oxygen contents existed in the oxide scales, indicating that the oxygen solubility in these phases is quite low and that they are not oxidised easily. The presence of the oxidation resistant Cr-rich C 14 silicide Laves phase in the 1400 °C for 100 h heat-treated KZ 2 and KZ 8 did not affect the oxidation rate at 800 °C, but decreased the oxidation rate at 1200 °C...|$|E

The objectives of this thesis work are to describe the texture and microstructure of Alloy 690 and to analyze {{the connection between the}} propagation/arrest of SCC in corrosion tested samples from steam generator tubes. The method of investigation was the Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) technique. Microtextures of single and double pilgered material are compared, as well as samples from tubes with different tube diameters. EBSD is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) -based technique that measures crystallographic orientation (i. e. texture) of a small volume of material. The EBSD technique provides microtexture information, such as orientation distributions and grain boundary crystallography. The samples were investigated using a Leo 1550 Gemini SEM (with field emission gun) employing an EBSD-unit in combination with a Hjelen detector. For this study the tubes have been tested by reverse U-bending (RUB) in a caustic environment with traces of lead.

40|$|For a {{reliable}} and safe operation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), gastight sealings with high long-term stability are required. Due to stringent demands to the sealing materials resulting from working temperatures up to 900 °C, harsh atmospheres and the need of electrical insulation, only few materials are suitable for this application. Among the different sealing concepts, still the most common used is to apply sealings with glasses or glass ceramics. Glass sealings are related to rigid joints forming chemical bonds with joined components. Therefor the thermo-physical properties of sealing material have to be adapted to these materials. This was realized by a glass forming system of BaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 with additional oxides for controlling crystallization of disilicate-type phases. They are needed to adjust the coefficient of thermal expansion, the viscosity for sealing and reactivity during operation. The general aim was to develop partial crystallizing glass ceramics with residual glassy phases maintained during stack operation for relaxation of mechanical stresses. This study presents the development of sealing glasses for SOFC-stacks based on CFY-interconnects (Cr, Fe, Y) produced by PLANSEE SE. It is shown that relevant properties of the CFY-alloy such as thermal expansion and chemical compatibility are matched by adjusting {{the composition of the}} glasses. With respect to the high <b>Cr-content</b> of CFY the chemical compatibility of the glasses was investigated with a unique setup for in-situ measurements of the resistivity of sandwich type samples at high temperatures in a dual atmosphere under applied voltage up to 5 V. SEM investigations of interfacial reaction layers of tested samples gave valuable information for the optimization of the glass compositions. Special interest was paid to the formation of chromate-type oxides which are known to have detrimental effect on the adhesion of the sealing glasses on metallic substrates. As a consequence sealing glasses with minimized BaO-contents leading to a controlled crystallization behavior have been created. Further testing of selected BaO-containing and BaO-free glasses was performed in SOFC stacks to characterize the joining behavior under realistic conditions. Results obtained from testing of model samples and from sealed and operated CFY-stacks were in good agreement showing possibility to apply the developed methodology for ex-situ glass material development...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this project}} are to present an {{understanding}} in what happens when aluminium-(Al) alloys are welded, and to investigate how the Mg-, Si- and Cr-contents in AA 6005 A influence the weld strength and cracking susceptibility. It is known that heat from welding affects the mechanical properties (strength) of the material. Different heat cycles during welding {{are one of the}} main reasons that the strength varies. Welding can cause various phenomena such as decreased strength, porosity, deformation, cracks and corrosion. To minimize these phenomena one has to have a balance between the welding parameters, alloy composition and welding fixture setup. Al alloys are sensitive to heat from welding because they have high heat conductivity and high thermal expansion coefficient. They also deform easily when the material is heated locally. If the material is deformed too much then cracking easily occurs. This project has examined how the Mg-, Si- and Cr-contents in AA 6005 A, affect the welded material. A V-joint with MIG welding is used for producing weld samples. For evaluation Vickers micro-hardness, tensile testing, radiography (X-ray), LOM and SEM with EBSD and EDS was used. The evaluation focuses on mechanical properties and microstructure. The results show that small variations of Mg-, Si- and <b>Cr-content</b> do not have any clear effects on the welded material. The results from tensile testing show that all samples have failed in the heat affected zone (HAZ). The tensile strength of all samples are higher than standard but the yield strength are lower than standard (EN ISO 10042 : 2005). The lowering in hardness and tensile strength in the HAZ are believed to be a result from beta-phase (AlFeSi), lead to transformation and coarsening of the strengthening and metastable precipitate. The HAZ is wide, ranging about 20 mm from the fusion line in 5 mm thick plate. The microstructure evaluation has shown that the grain size in the HAZ has been influenced while welding.   The EDS analysis shows that a small amount of AlFeSi particles occur in the base material and HAZ but not in the weld seam. Future research is suggested to focus on understanding more about ageing, coarsening of beta-phase and precipitation of intermetallic phases...|$|E
40|$|For energy technology, {{development}} of new materials is required {{to be used for}} boiler and steam turbines with high thermal cyclability, creep strength and excellent corrosion resistance in steam and high temperatures and also at downtime in water. Crofer 22 H, a new kind of steel jointly developed at Forschungszentrum Juelich and Thyssen Krupp, has already shown promising results in laboratory tests. The formation of Laves phase particles improves the material’s properties such as creep strength while the high <b>Cr-content</b> of 22 % provides excellent corrosion resistance. Unfortunately, the formation of Laves phase competes with the formation of other phases. In order to further improve this type of ferritic steels, knowledge of thermodynamics of the intermetallic systems forming the Laves phases (Fe,Cr,Si) 2 (Nb,W) is required for the calculation of phase stability as a function of composition and temperature. The Calphad method is of great help for the calculation of phase stability in technical materials. This kind of calculation is based on thermodynamic databases. Calculations with the commercial steel database have shown to be inaccurate since not all considered alloy systems have been modeled up to now. The present work aims to provide a thermodynamic optimization of the systems containing Laves phases. Thermodynamic data of Laves phase containing systems were obtained by the Calphad method with an optimization of the sub-systems containing Laves phases. The Calphad method relies on the input data for the considered system, their quality and their quantity are of primary importance for the obtained thermodynamic assessment. In the present work, several methods have been used in order to provide consistent thermodynamic calculations of the phase equilibria. A combined experimental and modeling approach was chosen to determine the phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties in the systems Fe-W, Cr-Nb, Cr-Fe-Nb and Fe-Nb-Si. DFT calculations were done for all mentioned systems for the determination of the energy of formation of the compounds through the chosen model. In the Fe-W system, in addition to the DFT calculations which are restricted to 0 K, phonon calculations were performed in order to obtain the temperature dependence of the Gibbs energies which were used to improve the Calphad modeling. As the literature on the Cr-Fe-Nb ternary system is rather scarce, experimental investigations were performed to determine isothermal sections and solidification behavior of selected alloy compositions. The combination of experimental work and DFT simulations was then used as input for the optimization of the phase diagram with the Calphad method...|$|E
40|$|Orogenic peridotites {{from the}} Seve Nappe Complex (SNC), central Scandinavian Caledonides, were {{traditionally}} interpreted as fragments of sub-oceanic, Iapetus-related, lithosphere that became {{incorporated into the}} Scandian nappe pile during the Caledonian orogeny. The Friningen Garnet Peridotite (FGP) consists dominantly of dunite, garnet-bearing harzburgite and garnet lherzolite with minor internal eclogite- and/or garnet pyroxenite layers/dikes. The FGP shows evidence of an Archean to mid Proterozoic origin for the M 1 mineral assemblage, including sulphides, {{as well as an}} early Caledonian age (~ 454 Ma) for the second mineral assemblage (M 2) which is also characterised by a garnet-olivine HP mineral assemblage. Pre-Caledonian HP-HT metamorphic conditions of 1200 °C and P ~ 2. 0 GPa are determined for the early M 1 a assemblage (ol+opx+cpx+grt). These physical conditions are followed by an inferred early Caledonian exhumation event down to 1050 - 1100 °C and 1. 5 GPa (M 1 b), followed by isobaric cooling down to 800 °C (M 1 c). The latter is based on the break down of high-Cr M 1 a grt (uvt= 6 %) into opx+cpx+spl+parg symplectites (M 1 b) and the exsolution of garnet from Al-rich opx and cpx. The early-Caledonian UHPM evidence (M 2; T= 800 °C and P= 3. 0 GPa), discovered within an eclogitic dyke, is displayed in the FGP by low-Cr M 2 grt (uvt= 3 %) replacing the M 1 b lower P symplectite assemblage and growth of M 2 garnets around M 1 b spinels. Pl+di symplectites after omphacite in the internal eclogitic dyke and breakdown of kyanite to sapphirine and pl are indicative of isothermal decompression (M 3 a) down to 800 ºC and 1. 0 GPa. This M 3 a phase has not been recognised in the mineral assemblage of the FGP, however, M 2 mineral compositions of most grt 2, opx 2 and cpx 2 indicate a metamorphic overprint at T= 600 °C and P= 1. 0 GPa (M 3 b). An exception to this rule is formed by the <b>Cr-content</b> of M 1 a and M 2 garnets. The finding of the stable mineral assemblage dolomite+grt+ky+zoi±ph in the eclogitic dyke and of Sr-bearing carbonates in multiphase solid inclusions within M 1 a opx, cpx and ol indicates early (i. e. before crustal intrusion) metasomatism by slab-derived COH-bearing fluids. Three olivine microstructures developed in response to different deformation events occurring at different PT conditions: Olivine M 1 porphyroclasts were formed in the mantle at HT and low differential stress (1 - 3 MPa). The main mechanism involved was dislocation creep, producing a mixture of a- and b-type fabrics. These two fabrics are probably the result of two deformation phases, different in temperature and water content. Olivine M 2 foam microstructure were formed during subduction, after crustal “intrusion” of the FGP. The main mechanism involved was dislocation creep, producing a-type fabrics. Olivine M 3 foam microstructures were formed after strain localization along anastomosed shear zones at low T (650 - 700 °C) and high differential stress (70 - 100 MPa). The main mechanism involved was grain size sensitive creep. However, dislocation creep was also involved producing a weak e-type olivine CPO. The FGP can be interpreted as a mantle wedge garnet peridotite that originates from a cold and thick lithospheric mantle wedge, underneath either Laurentia or a micro-continent positioned between Baltica and Laurentia, that became incorporated into the subducting continental crust (SNC) during “early Caledonian” subduction (M 2) down to UHPM conditions. In addition the M 1 a assemblage, including primary assemblages of the eclogitic dyke, are interpreted {{to be the result of}} Proterozoic (~ 1. 5 Ga) refertilization of an Archean dunite body. Absolute timing of the M 1 b assemblage is uncertain but interpreted to be related to Iapetus formation. The multiphase solid-and fluid inclusions, present only in M 1 a-b mineral assemblages, are interpreted as evidence for an early Caledonian COH-bearing subduction zone fluid infiltration event. This newly documented PTt path of the FGP, except for the M 2 subduction age, resembles that of cold mantle wedge garnet peridotites from the Western Gneiss Complex. As such the PTt path of the FGP gives important information about the role of the SNC during early Caledonian and Scandian collisions between Baltica and Laurentia...|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} steam electrolysis is {{an efficient}} process and a promising technology to convert electricity and steam or {{a mixture of}} steam and CO₂, into H₂ or syn-gas (H₂ 2 + CO) respectively. It is carried out in Solid Oxide Electrolytic Cells (SOECs). At the high temperature of operation, above 8000 [degree] C, loss {{in the rate of}} hydrogen (or syn gas) production by SOECs has been observed. This loss of performance has been a scientific and technological challenge. The goal of this thesis is to identify the mechanisms for the loss in the electrochemical performance of SOECs due to the oxygen electrode and bond layer degradation. Our specific research objectives were focused on two main mechanisms: 1) Cr transport into the oxygen electrode and bond layer, and 2) Long-range segregation of cations in the bond layer. For SOECs provided by Ceramatec Inc. for this analysis, La₀. ₈Sr₀. ₂CoO₃ (LSC) was the bond layer and A₀. ₈Sr₀. ₂MnO₃ (ASM*) was the oxygen electrode, both comprised of perovskite structure. The approach in thesis integrated complementary spectroscopy and microscopy techniques in a novel manner to carry out the 'post-mortem' analysis of SOECs from a high level to a high resolution. Raman spectroscopy was employed to identify secondary phases on the top surface of LSC near the interconnect interphase. Surface chemistry and microstructure of the air electrode and the bond layer was studied using scanning Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) with nano-probe capability. (cont.) High-resolution analysis of the cation distribution in the bulk of the LSC bond layer was achieved by employing Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX) coupled with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). Electrochemical treatment and characterization was performed to isolate the mechanism(s) governing the long-range segregation of cations, leading to the dissociation of the LSC bond layer. Less-conducting, secondary phases of Cr₂O₃, LaCrO₃, La₂CrO₆ and Co₃ 0 ₄ were identified on the top surface of LSC bond layer. The bond layer exhibited: 1) presence of Cr, with average Cr-fraction of approximately 0. 07 at the surface of its grains, and 2) surface composition variation locally, with La/Co ranging widely from 0. 67 to 16. 37 compared to the stoichiometric La/Co value of 0. 8. Sr and Co cations migrated from the bond layer structure to the LSC/interconnect interface, over a distance of 10 - 20 microns. Furthermore, STEM/EDX results showed the presence of phase separated regions at the nano-scale rich in Cr and La but lacking Co, and vice-versa. This indicates the dissociation of bond layer bulk structure at nano-scale. Cr fraction in LSC bulk varied from 10 to 33 %, which is higher than the average <b>Cr-content</b> at the surface of LSC grains. The maximum Sr fraction observed in LSC bulk was 4. 16 %, confirming the migration of Sr to LSC/interconnect interface. (cont.) We hypothesize that the long-range transport of Sr, Co, and Cr cations can be caused by two primary mechanisms: 1) Driven by Cr-related thermodynamics, where the Crcontaning species (i. e. at the vicinity of the interconnect) could thermodynamically favor the presence of select cations (i. e. Sr and Co) at the region interfacing the interconnect. 2) Driven by the electronic or oxygen ion current. To test these hypotheses and to isolate the governing mechanism, we simulated controlled electrochemical conditions on reference cells having ASM electrodes coated with LSC, on both sides of SSZ electrolyte, without any Cr-containing layers on the LSC bond layer. The reference cells degraded {{even in the absence of}} Cr. AES results showed that the microstructure and surface composition of the reference cells stayed stable and uniform upon the electrochemical treatment, in spite of the degradation. Thus, this thesis concludes that the Cr-related thermodynamics could be the dominant mechanism driving the uneven dissociation and segregation of cations in LSC as observed in the stack cells. As a mechanism for Cr-deposition in the LSC bond layer, we suggest that a thermodynamically-favored reaction between the La-enriched phase (at the surface of the LSC grains) and the volatile Cr-species (Cr 0 ₃ and CrO₂(OH)) is responsible for the formation of poorly-conducting secondary phases. This interaction is likely to be limited by the presence of the segregated La-O-species which can serve as a nucleation agent for this reaction. by Vivek Inder Sharma. Thesis (S. M.)
