5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Reduced bone height, {{elevated}} masticatory {{force and}} increased <b>crown</b> height-implant <b>length</b> ratio are all associated with dental implants of short length {{placed in the}} posterior mandible or maxilla. Consequently, dental practitioners generally aim to increase the bone to implant surface area contact by choosing wider diameters for short implants. With implant designs being driven at times by market demands rather than basic scientific research, the influence of different designs on the stress characteristics in the surrounding bone becomes an important issue. This research uses the Finite Element Method to evaluate the stress characteristics within the posterior maxilla for four distinctly different short implant designs (Bicon, Neodent, Nobel Biocare and Straumann) subject to unfavourable <b>crown</b> height-implant <b>length</b> ratio and masticatory forces. Material and Methods: The four bone-implant systems are modelled using three-dimensional hexahedral and wedge shaped brick elements. Assumptions made in the analyses are: temperature sensitive elements are used to replicate the torque within the abutment screw; <b>crown</b> height-implant <b>length</b> ratio is 2 : 1; 50 % osseointegration between bone and implant; and, linear elastic material properties of bone. Results and Conclusion: Bicon's thread design causes larger stress variances from minimum to maximum when compared to all other systems. The combination of a decreased diameter and increased taperage of the Neodent design increases the stress level {{when compared to the}} Bicon implant. Nobel Biocare's rounded implant thread crest design and reduced thread pitch produces a preferred smoothed out stress profile. Straumann's increased thread pitch gives elevated stress in cancellous bone. Generally, stresses are concentrated in the crestal bone region next to the implant neck, attributable to the combination of <b>crown</b> height-implant <b>length</b> ratio and the inclined nature of the masticatory force.

Even if soil evaporation and individual tree transpiration increases after thinning, total evapo-transpiration at stand level tends to decrease; canopy water interception is reduced and throughfall increased, so that tree-water status usually improves after thinning.|$|E

30|$|Root {{resorption}} (RR) {{is described}} as a permanent loss of tooth structure from the root apex. Many reports in the literature indicate that orthodontically treated patients {{are more likely to have}} severe apical root shortening, interesting mostly maxillary, followed by mandibular incisors. The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and severity of RR in adult patients treated with aligners. The study group consisted of 71 class I adult healthy patients (mean age 32.8 [*]±[*] 12.7) treated with aligners (Invisalign®, Align Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All incisors, canines, upper first premolars, and first molars were assessed. Root and <b>crown</b> <b>lengths</b> of 1083 teeth were measured in panoramic radiographs at the beginning (T 0) and at the end (T 1) of clear aligner therapy. Individual root-crown ratio (RCR) of each tooth and therefore the relative changes of RCR (rRCR) were determined. A decrease of rRCR was assessed as a reduction of the root length during treatment.|$|R

It may also be defined as the degree of crowding within stocked areas, using various growing space ratios based on <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> or diameter, tree height or diameter, and spacing. Stand density index is usually well correlated with stand volume and growth, and several variable-density yield tables have been created using it.

50|$|Crown volumes can be {{measured}} {{as an extension of}} the basic crown spread measurement. One method is to map a network of points on the outer surface of the crown from various positions around the tree and plotted by map position and height. The crown itself can be subdivided into smaller segments and the volume of each segment calculated individually. For example, the crown could be subdivided into a series of disk-like slices by elevation, the volume of each disk calculated, and the total of all the disks are added together to determine crown volume. Frank developed a simpler method that requires measuring average crown spread, height of the crown from base to top, and matching the crown profile to best fit of a family of crown profile shapes. The method calculates the volume enclosed by rotating the selected profile around the axis of the tree given the measured <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> and average crown spread.|$|E
