The LASCAUX programme is concerned with food issues, “from plough to plate”, from a mainly legal perspective. More particularly, the nuclear core of the programme {{is based on the}} study of the concept of "food security", according to the definition from the FAO. Studying food security is demanding for researchers in Law: being at the meeting point of different areas of law, but with no clear and indisputable way to identify a special field of the law that could be named food security law, its recognition and effectiveness depend on bringing together a vast set of <b>coordinated</b> <b>rules</b> which must be revealed or thought up. Besides, studying food security means working on legal issues which are not just technical but societal, with regard to socio-economic issues, and therefore concrete reality...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the different ways}} that formal legal pluralism is perceived and utilized in Ecuador, where a legal void has resulted {{from a combination of}} the constitutional recognition of customary law in 1998 and the subsequent failure to develop <b>coordinating</b> <b>rules</b> that would define the relationship between customary law and national law. Adopting a legal anthropological perspective on the cabildo (village council), this article describes variations in the treatment of different types of "internal conflict," depending on both the seriousness of the case and the parties involved. I argue that constitutional recognition of legal pluralism can work either in favor of or against the legal and political empowerment of indigenous local authorities. While it has encouraged local authorities to extend their jurisdiction, formalized legal pluralism has also led to national political tensions over the exact interpretation of relevant articles in the constitution and attempts to limit indigenous jurisdiction...|$|R

In consequence, she received on the Monday mornings those letters which were due to her on Sundays, and on this special Monday morning she received a letter, as to which the delay was of much consequence. It was to tell her that her brother Tom was dying, and to pray that she would be up in London as early on the Monday as was practicable.

Instead of adhering to international guidelines, which have a democratic deficit, or an attempt for {{a new set of}} possible harmonising rules, TubaFrost chose to create a coordinating rule: if tissue may legitimately be used for a certain kind of research in the country where it was taken and under whose jurisdiction the patient falls, it may also be used for such research in the country where it is sent to {{in the context of a}} scientific program even if in that other country other regulations would apply for research with residual tissue taken from patients under their jurisdiction.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{coordinate}} update methods, which {{are useful for}} solving problemsinvolving large or high-dimensional datasets. They decompose a problem into simple subproblems,where each updates one, or a small block of, variables while xing others. Thesemethods can deal with linear and nonlinear mappings, smooth and nonsmooth functions, aswell as convex and nonconvex problems. In addition, {{they are easy to}} parallelize. The great performance of coordinate update methods depends on solving simple subproblems. To derive simple subproblems for several new classes of applications, this thesissystematically studies coordinate friendly operators that perform low-cost coordinate updates. Based on the discovered coordinate friendly operators, as well as operator splitting techniques,we obtain new coordinate update algorithms for a variety of problems in machinelearning, image processing, as well as sub-areas of optimization. Several problems are treatedwith coordinate update for the rst time in history. Coordinate update algorithms can be used to develop decentralized algorithms for consensusoptimization, which run over a network in which the agents communicate with theirneighbors and perform local computation. Decentralized algorithms have broad applicationsand attract interest by itself. The second part of this thesis proposes an asynchronous,decentralized algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, each agent can compute and communicate independently at dierent times, for dierent durations, with the information it has even if the latestinformation from its neighbors is not yet available. Such an asynchronous algorithm reducesthe time that agents would otherwise waste idle because of communication delays or becausetheir neighbors are slower. It also eliminates the need for a global clock for synchronization. Mathematically, the algorithm involves both primal and dual variables, uses xed stepsizeparameters, and provably converges to the exact solution under a random agent assumptionand both bounded and unbounded delay assumptions. When running synchronously,the algorithm performs just as well as existing competitive synchronous algorithms such asPG-EXTRA, which diverges without synchronization. Numerical experiments conrm thetheoretical ndings and illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. In addition to the async-parallel <b>coordinate</b> selection <b>rule</b> well studied in the rst twoparts of the thesis, we analyse the cyclic <b>coordinate</b> selection <b>rules,</b> where the ordering ofcoordinates in each cycle is arbitrary. The corresponding algorithms are fast, but theirconvergence is unknown in the xed-point setting. When T is a nonexpansive operator and has a xed point, we show that the sequenceof coordinate-update iterates converges to a xed point under proper step sizes. This resultapplies to the primal-dual coordinate-update algorithms, which have wide applications tooptimization problems with nonseparable nonsmooth objectives, as well as global linearconstraints. Numerical experiments are presented to compare the cyclic <b>coordinate</b> selection <b>rule</b> withthe previous discussed rules...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a framework of management control that accommodates phenomena found in literature, like the importance of social factors for coordinating behavior, rule-following behavior and the evolutionary nature of control. Phenomena that the dominant economic view, based on self-interested actors and financial incentives, cannot easily absorb. Design/methodology/approach – The framework characterizes control as the coordination of behavior in organizations. It is based on two-stage rationality in which rule-following behavior gives meaning to self-interest, and in doing so, coordinates behavior. Findings – Management control of two-stage rational behavior involves managing the various elements of the framework in combination. The evolution of the <b>coordinating</b> <b>rules</b> in an organization will be partly autonomous and partly formed within the organization. Therefore, management control entails influencing the development path of the organization. Although it is concerned with the formation of controls in an organization, it is not exclusively concerned with the design of controls. Practical implications – The framework provides broader opportunities for managing an organization than the theory based on simple rational choice. Social implications – In this socio-economic approach, management will not consider controlling the “economic man” to be its core activity; instead, management will be coordinating the behavior of authentic human beings. Originality/value – These aspects of management remain undervalued in mainstream literature on management control. The non-mainstream literature does pay attention to these aspects; however, they are seldom integrated in one theoretical structure that is based explicitly on a broad conception of human behavior. The socio-economic view can offer valuable insight into management and organization. Behaviour, Control, General management, Organizations, Rationalization...|$|R

The beam charge passing from a single electron to a high density electron bunch, the covariance of the transition radiation energy {{is expected to}} evolve from a charge-point-like to a charge-density-like one. Besides covariance, the radiation energy spectrum is expected to conform to the temporal causality principle: the N single electron amplitudes composing the radiation field are expected to propagate from the metallic screen with relative emission phases causally correlated with the temporal sequence of the N particle collisions onto the metallic screen. In the present paper, the case of a N electron bunch hitting at a normal angle of incidence a flat metallic surface with arbitrary size and shape will be considered. For such an experimental situation, the distribution function of the N electron longitudinal <b>coordinates</b> <b>rules</b> the temporal causality constraint into the transition radiation energy spectrum. The covariance feature of the transition radiation energy spectrum deals instead with the Lorentz invariance of the projection of the N electron spatial density in the transverse plane with respect to the direction of motion of the N electron beam. Because of the invariance of the N electron transverse density under a Lorentz transformation with respect to the direction of motion of the electron beam, the N single electron radiation amplitudes composing the radiation field show a covariant dependence on the distribution function of the N electron transverse coordinates, the relative emission phases of the N single electron radiation amplitudes [...] .

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on Smart Grid {{applications}} in medium voltage distribution networks. For {{the development of new}} applications it appears useful the availability of simulation tools able to model dynamic behavior of both the power system and the communication network. Such a co-simulation environment would allow the assessment of the feasibility of using a given network technology to support communication-based Smart Grid control schemes on an existing segment of the electrical grid and to determine the range of control schemes that different communications technologies can support. For this reason, is presented a co-simulation platform that has been built by linking the Electromagnetic Transients Program Simulator (EMTP v 3. 0) with a Telecommunication Network Simulator (OPNET-Riverbed v 18. 0). The simulator is used to design and analyze a coordinate use of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) for the voltage/var control (VVC) in distribution network. This thesis is focused control structure based on the use of phase measurement units (PMUs). In order to limit the required reinforcements of the communication infrastructures currently adopted by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs), the study {{is focused on}} leader-less MAS schemes that do not assign special <b>coordinating</b> <b>rules</b> to specific agents. Leader-less MAS are expected to produce more uniform communication traffic than centralized approaches that include a moderator agent. Moreover, leader-less MAS are expected to be less affected by limitations and constraint of some communication links.
