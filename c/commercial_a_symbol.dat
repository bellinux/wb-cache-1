500|$|Louis Dupré differentiates between {{signs and}} <b>symbols,</b> proposing that <b>a</b> sign points to {{something}} while <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> represents it. <b>A</b> <b>symbol</b> holds its own meaning: {{rather than merely}} pointing someone towards another object, it {{takes the place of}} and represents that object. He believes that <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign. Dupré believes that <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself. <b>A</b> <b>symbol</b> reveals <b>a</b> reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived. Dupré differentiates between religious and aesthetic <b>symbols,</b> suggesting that <b>a</b> religious <b>symbol</b> points towards something which [...] "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that <b>a</b> religious <b>symbol</b> does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.|$|R
