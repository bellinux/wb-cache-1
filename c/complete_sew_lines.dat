As effective usage of resources has a significant effect on the productivity and efficiency of production operations, garment manufacturers are urged to utilize their resources effectively in order to meet dynamic customer demand. This paper focuses specifically on line balancing and layout modification.

Lee ordered his factory manager, Elekana Nuu’Uli Ioane to “beat workers up and send them home” {{if they were not}} working as quickly as necessary. A Vietnamese woman, Truong Thi Le Quyen, became a victim of this threat and was choked by the manager. This spurred 20 Samoan security workers to beat the women in Quyen’s <b>sewing</b> <b>line</b> with plumbing pipes, eventually gouging out one of Quyen’s eyes. The scene afterwards was described as a “massacre”, with blood covering the factory floor and garments.

40|$|In apparel manufacturing, {{experience}} and subjective assessment of production planners are used quite often {{to plan the}} production schedules in their fabric-cutting departments. The quantities of cut-pieces produced by fabric-cutting departments based on these non-systematic schedules cannot fulfil the cut-piece requirements of the downstream <b>sewing</b> <b>lines</b> and minimize the makespan. This paper proposes a genetic algorithms (GAs) approach to optimize both the cut-piece requirements and the makespan of the conventional fabric-cutting departments using manual spreading and cutting methods. An optimization model for the manual fabric cutting process based on GAs was developed. Two sets of production data were collected to validate {{the performance of the}} model and the experimental results were obtained. From the results, it can be found that both the makespan and cut-piece fulfilment rates are improved in which the latter is improved significantly.

40|$|An {{effective}} {{user interface}} helps to hinge on ideas and imagination from fashion designers {{and most importantly}} express their artworks with their flair. Shape, material, color, movement and flow - all these qualities give {{a piece of clothing}} its uniqueness, and the designer uses drawings to communicate his intentions. Sketches of various views of the garment provide the preliminary clues needed for bulk manufacturing. However, {{it is very difficult to}} develop a common user interface platform even as intuitive as sketching interface, since different designers have different senses and habits to work on their drawings. In this paper, we focus on this sketching issues and propose a user behavior tree (UBT) model that helps to return the corresponding shapes according to the preference of user. Also, in the front-tier, we provide a 3 D user interface for editing the clothing panels, adjusting the <b>sewing</b> <b>lines</b> and simulating the garment design.

40|$|Feminine {{indigenous}} tattoo {{traditions of}} the American Arctic have often been overlooked in scholarly literature due to colonial pre-conceptions regarding native gender roles {{and the nature of}} adornment. Modern Euro-American conceptions of skin and self often rely on rigid, essentialized categories, such as race and gender, to mark identity onto the individual body. However, the Inuit and Yupik peoples of Alaska and Canada regarded personal essence as fluid and transformative, a belief made visible in the networks of <b>sewn</b> <b>lines</b> that declared a woman’s status and agency. This text examines both written ethnological records and a diverse range of material artifacts, emphasizing visual analysis and critical theory, in order to uncover the trajectory of Arctic tattoo forms and meanings from past to present. By analyzing indigenous feminine tattoos from an art historical perspective, I will argue that this ancient technique was both vitally embedded in historic northern aesthetic and conceptual systems, and that it continues to provide a useful tool for the creation and transformation of contemporary American conceptions of identity.

40|$|AbstractReading {{and writing}} self-efficacy have been {{recognized}} as related to and predictors of writing performance (e. g. Prad-Sala & Redford, 2012; Shell, Murphy & Bruning, 1989). As reading academic texts and writing essays are two essential components of undergraduate programs, discovering and discussing self-efficacy beliefs in reading and writing become valuable. Social cognitive framework suggests that students donated with same skills may perform differently based on their perceived self-efficacy in target tasks (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997). Given the role of these two concepts, the current study aims to identify the relationship between perceived reading and writing self-efficacy beliefs {{in addition to their}} effect on writing performance with two surveys (Self-efficacy in writing [SEW], Self-efficacy in reading [SER], Prat-Sala & Redford, 2010). The first-year EFL preservice teachers of a state university in Turkey (N = 116) <b>completed</b> <b>SEW</b> and SER surveys. Writing performances of the participants were evaluated by a short essay written for the final exam of Written Communication Course. The findings revealed that SEW was positively and significantly correlated with writing performance as well as SER. Also, hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that SER and SER significantly accounted for the variance in writing scores. Implications were discussed based on the results and the related literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{continued}} {{presence of}} arm and wrist-oriented musculoskeletal disorder risk factors on the seat-sewing line at Company XYZ is placing the organization {{at risk of}} incurring continued employee illness and other productiOn/financial forms of loss. The past four years of OSHA recordable injuries, the results of the ergonomic-based risk factor assessment methods of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment(REBA), and an employee symptom survey were compared to recognition and remediation measures for musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) that have been identified in professional literature on the topic. The research results indicate that awkward postures, high repetition, and small-range motions are all present in the top-stitch sewing process. Upper extremity injuries relating to MSDs were the only causes of lost time away from work in the <b>sewing</b> <b>line</b> for the past four years. The seat-sewing line currently has several administrative and engineering controls in place to prevent the occurrence of cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs), but the system is new and has an absence of enforcement and education.

Fred Spitz was an {{electrical}} engineer who owned a store in the same building where the family lived (Starhemberggasse 39, Vienna IV). The family had a maid named Anna. Eve attended kindergarten and first grade in Vienna; her family liked to ski and Eve accompanied her mother on summer vacations in Austria. A relative named Harry Hollitscher provided affidavits for Eve and her parents shortly after the annexation of Austria. They traveled to Trieste, where the family embarked the "Saturnia". The ship departed on July 28, 1938. Most of the family's furniture had been sent to New York beforehand. Other relatives of Eve Sabot also fled to the United States or to England. After their arrival in Manhattan, Erna Spitz worked at a <b>sewing</b> <b>line</b> manufacturing gloves; Fred Spitz took any available employment to support the family. Eve was sent to live with a distant relative in Chicago, but returned 18 months later after her parents had settled in and rented their own apartment on the Upper West Side in New York City.
