40|$|As {{the primary}} route for {{elimination}} of <b>clinafloxacin</b> is renal clearance (CLR) of unchanged drug, studies {{were conducted to}} determine the pharmacokinetic profile of <b>clinafloxacin</b> following administration to young and elderly subjects, subjects with various degrees of renal function, and subjects requiring dialysis. These were open-label studies in which subjects received single oral <b>clinafloxacin</b> doses. Sixteen young subjects (18 to 35 years old) and 16 elderly subjects (> 65 years old) were enrolled in a study comparing pharmacokinetic profiles of <b>clinafloxacin</b> in young and elderly subjects. Twenty subjects having various degrees of renal function were enrolled into one of three groups based on degree of renal function as measured by creatinine clearance (CLCR). Twelve subjects with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis enrolled in a third study. <b>Clinafloxacin</b> was generally well tolerated by all subjects. <b>Clinafloxacin</b> pharmacokinetic profiles in elderly subjects were dependent only on age-related decreases in renal function. <b>Clinafloxacin</b> maximum concentrations in plasma, areas under the concentration-time curves, and terminal elimination half-life values increased with decreasing CLCR values. Total apparent body clearance of <b>clinafloxacin</b> from the plasma after oral administration (CLoral) and CLR were dependent on CLCR according to the following relationships: CLoral = 2. 3 · CLCR + 77 and CLR = 1. 74 · CLCR. Hemodialysis had no significant effect on <b>clinafloxacin</b> clearance. Based {{on the relationship between}} CLCR and <b>clinafloxacin</b> CLoral and CLR values, the <b>clinafloxacin</b> dose should be halved in patients having a CLCR of < 40 ml/min.

40|$|Patients (n = 409) {{with severe}} skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) were {{randomized}} to receive <b>clinafloxacin</b> or piperacillin-tazobactam (plus optional vancomycin for methicillin-resistant cocci), administered intravenously, with {{the option to}} switch to oral medication. Most patients had cellulitis, wound infections, or diabetic foot infections. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common baseline pathogens. Fewer baseline pathogens were resistant to <b>clinafloxacin</b> (1. 8 %) than to piperacillin-tazobactam (6. 2 %) (P = 0. 001). The <b>clinafloxacin</b> and piperacillin-tazobactam {{groups did not differ}} significantly in clinical cure rates (68. 8 and 65. 2 %, respectively) or microbiologic eradication rates (61. 5 and 57. 2 %). <b>Clinafloxacin</b> yielded higher eradication rates for all three of the most common pathogenic species, although no differences were statistically significant.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the response of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae 7785 to <b>clinafloxacin,</b> a novel C- 8 -substituted fluoroquinolone which is being developed as an antipneumococcal agent. <b>Clinafloxacin</b> was highly active against S. pneumoniae 7785 (MIC, 0. 125 μg/ml), and neither gyrA nor parC quinolone resistance mutations alone had much effect on this activity. A combination of both mutations was needed to register resistance, suggesting that both gyrase and topoisomerase IV are <b>clinafloxacin</b> targets in vivo. The sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin MICs for the parC-gyrA mutants were 16 to 32 and 32 to 64 μg/ml, respectively, but the <b>clinafloxacin</b> MIC was 1 μg/ml, i. e., within <b>clinafloxacin</b> levels achievable in human serum. S. pneumoniae 7785 mutants could be selected stepwise with <b>clinafloxacin</b> at a low frequency, yielding first-, second-, third-, and fourth-step mutants for which <b>clinafloxacin</b> MICs were 0. 25, 1, 6, and 32 to 64 μg/ml, respectively. Thus, high-level resistance to <b>clinafloxacin</b> required four steps. Characterization of the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the gyrA, parC, gyrB, and parE genes by PCR, HinfI restriction fragment length polymorphism, and DNA sequence analysis revealed an invariant resistance pathway involving sequential mutations in gyrA or gyrB, in parC, in gyrA, and finally in parC or parE. No evidence was found for other resistance mechanisms. The gyrA mutations in first- and third-step mutants altered GyrA hot spots Ser- 83 to Phe or Tyr (Escherichia coli coordinates) and Glu- 87 to Gln or Lys; second- and fourth-step parC mutations changed equivalent hot spots Ser- 79 to Phe or Tyr and Asp- 83 to Ala. gyrB and parE changes produced novel alterations of GyrB Glu- 474 to Lys and of Pro- 454 to Ser in the ParE PLRGK motif. Difficulty in selecting first-step gyrase mutants (isolated with 0. 125 [but not 0. 25] μg of <b>clinafloxacin</b> per ml at a frequency of 5. 0 × 10 − 10 to 8. 5 × 10 − 10) accompanied by the small (twofold) MIC increase suggested only a modest drug preference for gyrase. Given the susceptibility of defined gyrA or parC mutants, the results suggested that <b>clinafloxacin</b> displays comparable if unequal targeting of gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Dual targeting and the intrinsic potency of <b>clinafloxacin</b> against S. pneumoniae and its first- and second-step mutants are desirable features in limiting the emergence of bacterial resistance...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clinafloxacin</b> (CI- 960) is {{a potent}} broad-spectrum, {{fluoroquinolone}} antibiotic that has been studied for parenteral and oral administration in patients with serious infections. The objectives of these studies were to examine the pharmacokinetics and safety of <b>clinafloxacin</b> following administration of single and twice-daily intravenous (i. v.) and oral doses to volunteers. Plasma and urine samples were assayed by validated liquid chromatographic methods, and pharmacokinetic parameter values were determined by noncompartmental methods. Safety was evaluated by clinical observation and laboratory tests. Absorption was rapid after oral administration, with maximum concentrations in plasma (Cmax) generally occurring within 2 h. Concentrations in plasma declined biexponentially, with an average terminal half-life of 4 to 6 h after single doses and 5 to 7 h after multiple doses. Increases in Cmax and area under the concentration-time curves (AUC) were generally proportional to the dose. The volume of distribution was much greater than total body water. Approximately 40 to 75 % of the <b>clinafloxacin</b> doses were excreted unchanged into urine. Absolute bioavailability of orally administered <b>clinafloxacin</b> was approximately 90 % and did not change with increasing dose. Therefore, switching patients from i. v. to oral dosing should achieve similar concentrations in plasma. The tolerability of <b>clinafloxacin</b> was acceptable. No serious adverse events occurred. Cmax values and minimum plasma <b>clinafloxacin</b> concentrations during multiple dosing exceeded MICs {{for a wide range}} of organisms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>clinafloxacin</b> as a single agent for the empirical treatment of febrile episodes and bacterial infections in neutropenic cancer patients. Methods An open label, active-controlled, randomized, parallel treatment, multicenter study was conducted where <b>clinafloxacin</b> monotherapy was compared to the combination of ceftazidime plus amikacin (plus optional vancomycin or teicoplanin). Four hundred and nineteen patients were randomized to receive either intravenous <b>clinafloxacin</b> 200 mg every 12 h or intravenous ceftazidime (2 g) iv every 8 h plus intravenous amikacin (15 mg/kg) per day in divided doses. All randomized patients were to receive a minimum of 48 h of primary study drug treatment, after which the primary treatment could be modified. Clinical and microbiological responses were evaluated at 7 - 21 days post-treatment after study treatment and long term (maximum 28 days), in intent-to-treat and modified intent-to-treat populations. Results <b>Clinafloxacin</b> and ceftazidime-amikacin were statistically equivalent for the 72 -h defervescence rate, overall defervescence rate, time to defervescence, clinical success rate, by-pathogen microbiological eradication rate, and survival rate. Clinical cure was achieved in 84 % (59 / 70) of patients who received <b>clinafloxacin</b> monotherapy. There {{were no significant differences}} between treatments in rates of adverse events or treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events.

40|$|Ability {{of daily}} {{sequential}} subcultures in subinhibitory concentrations of <b>clinafloxacin,</b> ciprofloxacin, and trovafloxacin to select resistant mutants was studied in 10 pneumococci (ciprofloxacin MICs, 1 to 4 μg/ml, and <b>clinafloxacin</b> and trovafloxacin MICs, 0. 06 to 0. 125 μg/ml [n = 9]; ciprofloxacin, <b>clinafloxacin,</b> and trovafloxacin MICs, 32, 0. 5, and 2 μg/ml, respectively [n = 1]). Subculturing was done 50 times, or until MICs increased fourfold or more. Mutants for which MICs were fourfold (or more) {{higher than those}} for parent strains were selected in five strains by <b>clinafloxacin,</b> in six strains by trovafloxacin, and nine strains by ciprofloxacin. Sequence analysis of type II topoisomerase showed that most mutants had mutations in ParC at Ser 79 or Asp 83 and in GyrA at Ser 81, while a few mutants had mutations in ParE or GyrB. In the presence of reserpine, the MICs of ciprofloxacin and <b>clinafloxacin</b> for most mutants were lower (four to eight times lower), but for none of the mutants were trovafloxacin MICs lower, suggesting an efflux mechanism affecting the first two agents but not trovafloxacin. Single-step mutation rates were also determined for eight strains for which the MICs were as follows: 0. 06 μg/ml (<b>clinafloxacin),</b> 0. 06 to 0. 125 μg/ml (trovafloxacin), and 1 μg/ml (ciprofloxacin).

40|$|In vitro {{pharmacodynamic}} studies investigating the antimicrobial properties of five fluoroquinolones, (trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, <b>clinafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) against Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 23745 were conducted. The times required {{to reduce the}} viable counts by 3 log units were as follows: <b>clinafloxacin,</b> 2. 9 h; levofloxacin, 4. 6 h; trovafloxacin, 6 h; and sparfloxacin, 10 h. Exposure to ciprofloxacin did not achieve a 3 -log decrease in viable counts. The susceptibility of B. fragilis was determined both prior to exposure and following 24 h of exposure {{to each of the}} five fluoroquinolones tested. The MICs of <b>clinafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, and clindamycin were determined by the broth microdilution method. The MICs for B. fragilis preexposure were as follows: <b>clinafloxacin,</b> 0. 25 μg/ml; trovafloxacin, 0. 5 μg/ml; sparfloxacin, 2 μg/ml; levofloxacin, 2 μg/ml; and ciprofloxacin, 8 μg/ml. Similar pre- and postexposure MICs were obtained for cultures exposed to trovafloxacin, <b>clinafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. However, following 24 h of exposure to sparfloxacin, a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain emerged. The MICs for this strain were as follows: <b>clinafloxacin,</b> 1 μg/ml; trovafloxacin, 4 μg/ml; sparfloxacin, 16 μg/ml; levofloxacin, 16 μg/ml; and ciprofloxacin, 32 μg/ml. No changes in the susceptibility of B. fragilis pre- and postexposure to sparfloxacin were noted for metronidazole (MIC, 1 μg/ml), cefoxitin (MIC, 4 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (MIC, 4 μg/ml), and clindamycin (MIC, 0. 06 μg/ml). Resistance remained stable as the organism was passaged on antibiotic-free agar for 10 consecutive days. Mutant B. fragilis strains with decreased susceptibility to <b>clinafloxacin,</b> trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were selected on brucella blood agar containing 8 × the MIC of levofloxacin at a frequencies of 6. 4 × 10 − 9, 4 × the MICs of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin at frequencies of 2. 2 × 10 − 9 and 3. 3 × 10 − 10, respectively, and 2 × the MIC of <b>clinafloxacin</b> at a frequency of 5. 5 × 10 − 11; no mutants were selected with ciprofloxacin. The susceptibilities of strains to trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, <b>clinafloxacin,</b> sparfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin before and after exposure to sparfloxacin were modestly affected by the presence of reserpine (20 μg/ml), an inhibitor of antibiotic efflux. The mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance is being explored, but it is unlikely to be efflux {{due to a lack of}} cross-resistance to unrelated antimicrobial agents and to the fact that the MICs for strains before and after exposure to sparfloxacin are minimally affected by reserpine...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{activities}} of the new fluoroquinolones <b>clinafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, ofloxacin, and sparfloxacin alone or in combination on the intracellular growth of Listeria monocytogenes. Against intracellular growth of the four strains tested, a similar reduction of the bacterial count was obtained with <b>clinafloxacin</b> at the dose of 10 x MIC (delta log 10 CFU/ml = - 2. 19 +/- 0. 24), with levofloxacin at 8 x MIC (delta log 10 CFU/ml = - 2. 28 +/- 0. 25), and with sparfloxacin at 4 x MIC (delta log 10 CFU/ml = - 2. 16 +/- 0. 21) after 24 h of incubation. The combination of the quinolones with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin did not show a substantial increase in activity compared to the fluoroquinolone alone. Antagonism with rifampin was strongly suggested. No modification of the MIC was observed after 20 successive infections of HeLa cells and contact with subinhibitory concentrations of <b>clinafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, and sparfloxacin for 24 h. We conclude that <b>clinafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, or sparfloxacin could represent a therapeutic alternative to amoxicillin for the treatment of Listeria infections in adults, especially <b>clinafloxacin,</b> whose MIC is low (0. 06 to 0. 12 micrograms/ml), and whose best activity against intracellular L. monocytogenes was obtained at a concentration of 1. 2 micrograms/ml, which is similar to clinically achievable levels.

40|$|The susceptibilities of 120 {{clinical}} isolates of Brucella melitensis and 3 reference {{strains of}} the same species to six fluoroquinolones (<b>clinafloxacin,</b> PD 117596, PD 131628, PD 138312, PD 140248, and ciprofloxacin) were examined by agar dilution MIC methodology. <b>Clinafloxacin</b> was the most active compound tested (MIC at which 50 % of strains tested were inhibited [MIC 50] and MIC 90 of 0. 06 micrograms/ml). Its level of activity was slightly higher than that of PD 117596 (MIC 50 and MIC 90 of 0. 12 micrograms/ml). PD 131628 and ciprofloxacin were less active than <b>clinafloxacin,</b> with MIC 50 s ranging from 0. 12 to 0. 25 micrograms/ml and MIC 90 s of between 0. 25 and 0. 5 micrograms/ml for the two compounds. The activity levels of PD 138312 and PD 140248, with MIC 50 s ranging from 1 to 2 micrograms/ml and MIC 90 s of 4 to 8 micrograms/ml, were lower than those of the other fluoroquinolones tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} of two investigational fluoroquinolones and three fluoroquinolones {{that are currently}} marketed were determined for 182 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The collection included 57 pneumococcal isolates resistant to levofloxacin (MIC ≥ 8 μg/ml) recovered from patients in North America and Europe. All isolates were tested with <b>clinafloxacin,</b> gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility test methods. Gemifloxacin demonstrated the greatest activity on a per gram basis, followed by <b>clinafloxacin,</b> trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin. Scatterplots of the MICs and disk diffusion zone sizes revealed a well-defined separation of levofloxacin-resistant and -susceptible strains when the isolates were tested against <b>clinafloxacin</b> and gatifloxacin. DNA sequence analyses of the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE from 21 of the levofloxacin-resistant strains identified eight different patterns of amino acid changes. Mutations among the four loci had the least effect on the MICs of gemifloxacin and <b>clinafloxacin,</b> while the MICs of gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin increased by up to six doubling dilutions. These data indicate that the newer fluoroquinolones have greater activities than levofloxacin against pneumococci with mutations in the DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV genes. Depending upon pharmacokinetics and safety, the greater potency of these agents could provide improved clinical efficacy against levofloxacin-resistant pneumococcal strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} of six new fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, grepafloxacin, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, <b>clinafloxacin,</b> and levofloxacin) {{compared with those}} of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin with or without reserpine (20 μg/ml) were determined for 19 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 5 Haemophilus sp. isolates, and 10 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin from patients with clinically confirmed lower respiratory tract infections. Based upon the MICs at which 50 % of isolates were inhibited (MIC 50 s) and MIC 90 s, the most active agent was <b>clinafloxacin,</b> followed by (in order of decreasing activity) trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, sparfloxacin, and grepafloxacin. Except for <b>clinafloxacin</b> (and gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin for H. influenzae), none of the new agents had improved activities compared with that of ciprofloxacin for P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae. A variable reserpine effect was observed for ciprofloxacin and S. pneumoniae; however, for 9 of 19 (47 %) isolates the MIC of ciprofloxacin was decreased by at least fourfold, suggesting the presence of an efflux pump contributing to the resistance phenotype. The laboratory parC (Ser 79) mutant strain of S. pneumoniae required eightfold more ciprofloxacin for inhibition than the wild-type strain, but there was no change in the MIC of sparfloxacin and only a 1 -dilution increase in the MICs of the other agents. For efflux pump mutant S. pneumoniae the {{activities of}} all the newer agents, except for levofloxacin, were reduced. Except for <b>clinafloxacin,</b> all second-step laboratory mutants required at least 2 μg of all fluoroquinolones per ml for inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Certain new fluoroquinolones {{have high}} {{activity}} against enterococci. Against Enterococcus faecalis (n = 18), MICs at which 90 % of the isolates were inhibited {{were as follows}} (in micrograms per milliliter) : <b>clinafloxacin,</b> 0. 125; CI- 990, 0. 5; and PD 138312, 0. 25 (compared with 1 microgram/ml for ciprofloxacin and 2 micrograms/ml for ofloxacin). Strains producing beta-lactamase or that were vancomycin resistant or resistant to high-level gentamicin were not quinolone cross-resistant. The drugs were bactericidal and were unaffected by 50 % human serum. Oral efficacies (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight for 50 % protective doses) in lethal mouse infections with quinolone-susceptible strains were 4. 3 to 24 for <b>clinafloxacin,</b> 7. 2 to 39 for CI- 990, 7. 2 to 76 for PD 138312, and 41 to > 100 for ciprofloxacin; when the drugs were given subcutaneously, the order was similar and values ranged from 1. 1 to 12. 5. <b>Clinafloxacin,</b> CI- 990, and PD 138312 may have therapeutic potential in systemic enterococcal infections in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of three new, 8 -methoxy-nonfluorinated quinolones (NFQs) against multiple-drug-resistant staphylococci was investigated. First, using Staphylococcus aureus strains containing point mutations in the serine 84 – 80 hot spots {{of the target}} genes (gyrA and grlA), cell growth inhibition potencies of the NFQs {{as a result of}} DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV inhibition were estimated and compared with those of known fluoroquinolones. The NFQs and <b>clinafloxacin</b> showed higher affinities toward both the targets than ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and gatifloxacin. Furthermore, the ratio of the calculated affinity parameter for DNA gyrase to that for topoisomerase IV was lower {{in the case of the}} NFQs, <b>clinafloxacin,</b> and gatifloxacin than in the case of ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin. These results suggest that the former group of quinolones is better able to exploit both the targets. Next, using clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 34) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; n = 24), the NFQs and <b>clinafloxacin</b> were shown to be more potent (MIC at which 90 % of the isolates are inhibited [MIC 90] = 2 μg/ml for MRSA and 0. 5 μg/ml for CoNS) than ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin, and gatifloxacin (MIC 90 = 16 to > 64 μg/ml for MRSA and 4 to > 32 μg/ml for CoNS). Bactericidal kinetics experiments, using two MRSA isolates, showed that exposure to the NFQs at four times the MIC reduced the bacterial counts (measured in CFU per milliliter) by ≥ 3 log units in 2 to 4 h. Overall, the NFQs and <b>clinafloxacin</b> were less susceptible than the other quinolones to existing mechanisms of quinolone resistance in staphylococci...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of five new quinolones (<b>clinafloxacin</b> [CI- 960 or PD- 127391], BAY Y 3118, E- 4868, E- 5065, and E- 5068) against 100 Bacteroides fragilis group bacterial isolates {{were compared with}} those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. Overall, E- 5068 was the most active in vitro (MIC for 90 % of isolates tested [MIC 90], 0. 25 microgram/ml); this was followed by <b>clinafloxacin</b> and BAY Y 3118 (MIC 90, 0. 5 microgram/ml). Ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and ofloxacin were the least active (MIC 90 s, 64, 16, and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively).

The MICs of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and sparfloxacin for 90 % of C. jeikeium, C. urealyticum, and C. xerosis isolates tested were > 16 micrograms/ml. Those of BAY Y 3118 and <b>clinafloxacin</b> against these species were 0. 5 and 1 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MICs for 90 % of all 115 strains tested were 0. 5 microgram/ml for BAY Y 3118, 1 microgram/ml for <b>clinafloxacin,</b> 2 micrograms/ml for E- 5068, 4 micrograms/ml for E- 5065, and > 16 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and E- 4868...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{models are}} {{commonly}} {{used to determine the}} efficacy of various antimicrobial agents for treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Previously we have utilized an in vitro infection model, which incorporates simulated endocardial vegetations (SEVs) to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of various antibiotics. In the present study, we compared four experimental rabbit endocarditis protocols to an in vitro infection model in an effort to determine if these models are comparable. We have evaluated the activity of <b>clinafloxacin,</b> trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin in rabbit models against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. In vitro models were performed simulating the antibiotic pharmacokinetics obtained in the in vivo studies. Models were dosed the same as rabbit models, and SEVs were evaluated {{at the same time the}} rabbit vegetations were examined. <b>Clinafloxacin</b> and trovafloxacin were evaluated against methicillin-susceptible (MSSA 1199) and -resistant (MRSA 494) strains of S. aureus. Ciprofloxacin was studied against MSSA 1199 and MSSA 487. Sparfloxacin and <b>clinafloxacin</b> were evaluated against Enterococcus faecium SF 2149 and Enterococcus faecalis WH 245, respectively.

40|$|Several multilaboratory {{studies to}} {{determine}} quality control (QC) ranges {{for a variety}} of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) susceptibility tests are summarized. Replicate testing used multiple lots of media and antimicrobial disks in accordance with NCCLS recommendations, including the appropriate medium modifications for tests with Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. QC ranges for MIC and disk diffusion testing of N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 were proposed for cefepime, cefetamet, cefmetazole, and cefpodoxime. Disk diffusion QC ranges for Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 or ATCC 49766 were recommended with cefepime, cefetamet (10 - and 30 -microgram disks), cefmetazole, cefpodoxime, and cefprozil.
