40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to capture diverse relations and connection between the perception of reality, places and fictional <b>caracters</b> whose destinies are mutually reflected and projected. This docile procedure is leading us {{to the principle of}} the double, focusing on three couples of doubles: Horacio - Traveler, la Maga - Talita and the author - Morelli. The tenuous frontier between the visible reality and other worlds hidden beneath the surface is related to the theme of quest to which we dedicate the third part of our thesis. We concentrate on the interpretation of several aspects of search: search for one's own identity, home and life-path in the level of the fictional <b>caracters,</b> search for the true reality in the level of the narrator and at he same time the involvement of the reader into this process. On the one hand the reader becomes one of the <b>caracters</b> of the novel {{and on the other hand}} he participates, together with the author, in the formation of the novel...|$|R

500|$|Because of {{the title}} of the Sports Illustrated story that {{compared}} Parker to LeBron James, Mike DeCourcy of Sporting News stated that [...] "Jabari Parker is, rather, the best [...] since Greg Oden." [...] In addition, Parker was considered to have a much less developed physique than James at the same stage of development. [...] CBS Sports' Jeff Borzello also contested the proclamation, pointing out that since James's 2003 class both Dwight Howard (2004) and Oden (2006) were consensus top players in their classes and that Parker might not be any better than the most recent consensus, Oden. [...] In addition, CBS noted that Parker [...] "might not even be the best high school basketball player in the country, given the development of class of 2014's Andrew Wiggins." [...] Chicago Tribune writer Mike Helfgot described the Sports Illustrated comparison as [...] "incredibly irresponsible journalism", noting he had once worked for the Star-Ledger when it described Derrick <b>Caracter</b> as the next James.|$|E

The original method is based on breaking down a map into layers of cells called "Jasses", which means "layers" in Provence. We also describe in details the set of Jassologic Words, whose alphabet is composed of 16 specified <b>caracters</b> (Catherine Mouet's <b>caracters).</b> And we explain how to construct a planar trivalent rooted map from any Jassologic Word.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a few {{aspects of the}} theory of generalized blocks of finite groups. After a short description of the classic and generalized theories, we study the properties of generalized blocks of certain groups. We prove the existence of generalized perfect isometries in three families of groups of Lie rank one, thus generalizing a conjecture of M. Broué. We then study the notion of generalized Cartan group, and a formula is given for the order in the Cartan group of the <b>caracters</b> of the symmetric group. Finally, we define generalized blocks in the finite general linear group, and we show that certain unions of blocks of unipotent <b>caracters</b> satisfy an anologue of the Nakayama Conjecture, as well as an analogue of Brauer's Second Main Theorem. Cette these presente quelques aspects de la theorie des blocs generalises pour les groupes finis. Apres une breve description des theories classique et generalisee, on y etudie les proprietes des blocs generalises de certains groupes. On montre l'existence d'isometries parfaites generalisees dans trois familles de groupes de Lie de rang 1, generalisant ainsi une conjecture de M. Broue. On etudie ensuite le concept de groupe de Cartan generalise, et une formule est donnee pour l'ordre dans le groupe de Cartan des caracteres du groupe symetrique. Enfin, on definit des blocs generalises dans les groupes lineaires finis, et on montre que certaines unions de blocs de caracteres unipotents satisfont un analogue de la Conjecture de Nakayama ainsi qu'un analogue du Deuxieme Theoreme de Brauer...|$|R

40|$|Evidently, gesture {{comes from}} the body, it is motion of it or part of it into space and also time. There is a spacial figure of gesture I can describe, even draw on paper. This figure has no reality in time or spread into it, it is motion that generates it. Gesture is so caracterised by the {{temporal}} stream line of motion wich supports it. But gesture is not only motion, and all movement is not gesture. It must be defined as intentional movement, more or less complex, with determined aim that gives, it a determined individual, social or historical meaning. This point of vue is confirmed by different researches: Henri Wallon, 1949; Claude Cadoz, 1999; Hugues Genevois, 1999. Gesture, finally is always priorely determined by action, and finally by the aim, through the medium’s constraints, either physical or human. MIME EXPERIENCE To have a clearer approach of these questions, mime {{seems to be the}} richest ground of observation. For instance, according to Étienne Decroux, mime tends to evoque mental life through motion only (Paroles sur le mime, p. 46). It is clear with Decroux that the art of mime is not only a mere imitation of shapes, forms and structures, for the inward comes first: “Because if men’s shells would be alike, you should open them. ” (ibid., p. 115). Mime as to do with showing hidden feelings, able to give or start a corporal movement, and so move, resounding in our mind (ibid., p. 155). Unity between gesture, attitude and thinking is the link with sensible and moving representation. This coherence gives the real sense of mimic. In this context the “body mass” must follow the “soul’s emotion ” (ibid., p. 102 - 103), so the corporal motion reveales a dynamic process in time, not a fix and rigid structure only copying emotions. GESTURE‘S EXPRESSIVE COMPONENTS We will see D. Stern’s interesting concepts, and related with music.

The results shown that the landraces varieties presents nutritional composition of macro and oligoelements, fibers, protein and ash contents in whole grain similar than that of breeding lines and cultivars. The black coat grain from breeding programs showed better nutritional quality for macro and oligoelements content than coloured grain, highlighting TB 02 - 04 e TB 01 - 01.
