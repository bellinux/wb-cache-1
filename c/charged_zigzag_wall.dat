40|$|The {{dielectric}} {{response of}} surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystals with chevron layer structure is studied within low and intermediate frequency ranges, characteristic for collective molecular excitations. By analytically solving the dynamic equation for collective molecular fluctuations under a weak alternating electric field, it is demonstrated that chevron cells stabilized by both nonpolar and polar surface interactions undergo at medium frequencies two Debye relaxation processes, connected with two chevron slabs, {{on opposite sides}} of the interface plane. This result is confirmed, experimentally, making use of the electro-optic technique. Based on qualitative arguments supported by microscopic observations of zigzag defects at different frequencies and amplitudes of the external electric field, it is shown that, at low frequencies, the electro-optic response of chevron samples is determined by three kinds of motions of <b>zigzag</b> <b>walls.</b> The first two dynamic categories are related to collective relaxation processes at weak fields, within smectic A layers forming <b>zigzag</b> <b>walls,</b> and drift or creep motions of thick walls occuring at stronger field amplitudes.

The BaTiO 3 systems exhibit 180 o periodic stripe domains at null electric field, as in PZT ultrathin films.

Moreover, {{the evolution of the}} 180 o stripe domains in the BaTiO 3 systems, when applying and increasing an electric field along [001], involves four regions: Region I for which the magnitude of the down dipoles (i. e., those that are antiparallel to the electric field) is reduced, while the domain walls do not move; Region II in which some local down dipoles adjacent to domain walls switch their direction, resulting in <b>zigzagged</b> domain <b>walls</b> - with the overall stripe periodicity being unchanged; Region III in which nanobubbles are created, then contract along [110] and finally collapse; and Region IV which is associated with a single monodomain.

All our investigation are based on first principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Our study is motivated by interesting metal-semiconductor transition recently found in periodically patterned graphene with h-BN islands. After reproducing the electronic band structure for pristine single <b>wall</b> <b>zigzag</b> carbon nanotubes (which shows metallic or semiconducting properties depending on their chirality), we investigated their electronic band structure {{in the presence of}} h-BN islands. The band structure depends not only on the defect concentration, but also on the pattern of the defect atoms. Our results also suggest that, if we start with a metallic /semiconducting mixture of ZSWCNTs, upon h-BN addition, the sample converts to fully semiconducting. This is a promising result for applications of CNTs in molecular electronics. Fundamental understanding of vibrational properties of nano electronics component is equally important in their applications especially in thermal management and thermoelectric applications. Defect engineering is one of the potential approach for tuning nanoelectronic devices for optimal thermal management and thermoelectric devices. In this work, I present a systematic investigation on how the group velocity and frequency of different phonon modes depend on various h-BN defect concentrations and defect patterns in ZSWCNTs.

40|$|Spin {{unrestricted}} density functional theory (DFT) calculations {{have been}} used to investigate the molecular and dissociative adsorption of O 2 on achiral substitutional nitrogen-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (N-SWNTs) with and without additional charges. Adsorption (dissociation) of O 2 on the charged tubes is quite complex. The N-SWNTs with an additional electron with different orientations exhibit different behaviors. The armchair N-SWNTs carrying an extra electron have lower chemisorption (up to 0. 6 eV) and reaction (up to 1. 2 eV) energies for O 2 compared to the corresponding neutral N-SWNTs. For (10, 10) N-SWNTs, the dissociation barrier decreases from 1. 36 eV (in neutral) to 0. 76 eV (in negatively charged). The reactivity of the armchair N-SWNTs with low nitrogen content can be increased by adding extra electrons. For the metallic zigzag N-SWNTs, an additional electron affects the O 2 adsorption and dissociation marginally. However, negatively <b>charged</b> <b>zigzag</b> N-SWNTs, which are semiconducting when un-doped, have significantly lower O 2 adsorption, reaction and dissociation barrier energies than the neutral N-SWNTs. We also studied the molecular and dissociative adsorption of O 2 on (10, 10) single-walled nanotubes doped with two substitutional nitrogen atoms (N 2 -SWNTs), as a function of extra charge. The chemisorption and reaction energies decrease linearly with the increasing number of extra electrons. The barrier for O 2 dissociation on N 2 -SWNTs is found to increase with the increasing number of additional electrons. Our results point out that the dissociative adsorption of an oxygen molecule on N-SWNTs depends on many parameters: curvature, chirality, and charge. The effect of additional charge on the reactivity of the N-doped SWNTs is rather independent of the tube diameter, but depends on the tube orientation. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The polished thin sections studied {{were made}} from areas rich in Al and Ca detected by a micro-focus X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping technique. The gabbro is not a clast within a breccia, but rather this area is located mainly at silicate-metal boundaries only a few cm away from an area with fine-grained, ultramafic silicate similar to winonaites. Medium-grained orthopyroxene and olivine are found in transitional areas showing no disturbance of their crystalline textures. A vein-like region, starting at the area rich in fine-grained mafic silicate, extends towards the gabbroic area with a gradual increase in abundance of plagioclase and diopside. This texture and our accumulated knowledge of the formation mechanism of IAB/winonaltes meteorites, suggest that the gabbroic materials were formed by inhomogeneous segregation of partial melts of chondritic source materials. Compositional data on two mineralogically distinct samples of the gabbro-rich portion of the inclusion were obtained by INAA. Compared {{to an average of}} LAB silicate inclusions or winonaites, the Caddo County gabbro is enriched in the incompatible lithophile elements Na, Ca, Sc, REE and Hf, which is consistent with a melt origin for the gabbro. The cosmogenic space exposure age of Caddo County (511 Ma) is significantly younger than exposure ages of some other IAB meteorites, An 39 Ar- 40 Ar age determination of the gabbroic material indicates a series of upward steps in age from 4. 516 Ga to 4. 523 Ga, with a few high temperature ages up to 4. 54 Ga. The older age could approximate the primary recrystallization age of silicates. The stepped Ar age spectrum may indicate differences in Ar closure temperatures during slow cooling of - 2 - 20 'C/Myr in the parent body.
