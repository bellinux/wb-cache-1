50|$|The closing {{capacity}} (CC) is the volume {{in the lungs}} at which its smallest airways, the respiratory bronchioles, collapse. The alveoli lack supporting cartilage and so depend on other factors to keep them open. The {{closing capacity}} {{is greater than the}} residual volume (RV), the amount of gas that normally remains in the lungs during respiration, and specifically, after forced expiration. This is because closing capacity is equal to <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> plus residual volume. This means that there is normally enough air within the lungs to keep these airways open throughout both inhalation and exhalation. As the lungs age, there is a gradual increase in the closing capacity (i.e. The small airways begin to collapse at a higher volume/before expiration is complete). This also occurs with certain disease processes, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary edema. Any process that increases the CC by increasing the functional residual capacity (FRC) can increase an individual's risk of hypoxemia, as the small airways may collapse during exhalation, leading to air trapping and atelectasis.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of lung volumes, airway resistance, maximal expiratory {{flow rates}} and <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> {{were made in}} 12 {{patients}} with chronic renal insufficiency and fluid overload, before and after hemodialysis. Before dialysis, these measurements were within normal limits, except for peak expiratory flow rate, which was significantly lower, and <b>closing</b> <b>volume,</b> which {{was significantly higher than}} predicted values. After dialysis body weight decreased significantly and the removal of excess of fluid was accompanied by a significant decrease of <b>closing</b> <b>volume.</b> Measurements of <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> and the other pulmonary tests were made in 6 healthy subjects, the same timing being observed as in the patients. Mean as well as individual values of <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> did not alter, thus excluding the possibility that the changes observed in the patients were due to a circadian rhythm. It is suggested that the higher than predicted <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> was due to the accumulation of fluid in the dependent areas of the lung, promoting a premature airway closure. Removal of excess of fluid allowed airways to close at a lower lung volume. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to better {{understand}} previously reported changes in lung function at high altitude. Comprehensive pulmonary function testing utilising body plethysmography and assessment of changes in <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> were carried out at sea level and repeatedly over 2 days at high altitude (4, 559 m) in 34 mountaineers. In subjects without high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE), there was no significant difference in total lung capacity, forced vital capacity, <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> and lung compliance between low and high altitude, whereas lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide increased at high altitude. Bronchoconstriction at high altitude could be excluded as the cause of changes in <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> because there was no difference in airway resistance and bronchodilator responsiveness to salbutamol. There were no significant differences in these parameters between mountaineers with and without acute mountain sickness. Mild alveolar oedema on radiographs in HAPE was associated only with minor decreases in forced vital capacity, diffusing capacity and lung compliance and minor increases in <b>closing</b> <b>volume.</b> Comprehensive lung function testing provided no evidence of interstitial pulmonary oedema in mountaineers without HAPE during the first 2 days at 4, 559 m. Data obtained in mountaineers with early mild HAPE suggest that these methods may not be sensitive enough for the detection of interstitial pulmonary fluid accumulation.

The cardiac output was measured with the Minnesota impedance cardiograph model 304 A and the transthoracic impedance {{was used as an}} expression of the thoracic fluid volume. The slope of the alveolar plateau on the <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> tracing showed a 271 % increase 20 minutes after the prostaglandin administration, at which time the <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> per cent (CV%) had decreased (P less than 0 - 01) and the closing capacity (CC%) had increased (P less than 0 - 05). Vital capacity (VC) decreased (P less than 0 - 01), residual volume (RV) increased (P less than 0 - 01), and the total lung capacity (TLC) remained unchanged. The maximal decrease (9 %) in FEV 1 was seen after 20 minutes. All these measurements except the slope of the alveolar plateau returned to control levels after 60 minutes. The redistribution of regional ventilation was more pronounced than that of the regional pulmonary blood flow. No change was observed in cardiac output and transthoracic impedance. None of the patients experienced any dyspnoea. Our results are consistent with a more pronounced effect of prostaglandin F 2 alpha on the small airways (the alveolar plateau) than on the larger airways (FEV 1). In cases where an increase in the slope of the alveolar plateau is observed, the <b>closing</b> <b>volume</b> per cent should not be used as a measurement of the lung disease.
