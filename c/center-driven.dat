40|$|The {{effects of}} {{picrotoxin}} and bicuculline upon the discharge pattern of center-surround organized cat retinal ganglion cells of X and Y type were studied. All experiments {{were carried out}} under scotopic or possibly low mesopic conditions; mostly but not exclusively on-center cells were studied. Stimuli were chosen so that responses were either; (a) "purely" central; (b) surround dominated; or (c) clearly mixed but center dominated. In each case a pre-drug control response was estaboished, the drug was administered intravenously, and its subsequent effect upon the response was observed. In Y cells both picrotoxin and bicucullin caused the <b>center-driven</b> component of the response to become somewhat reduced in magnitude, while the surround component was substantially reduced. There was thus a change in center- surround balance {{in favor of the}} <b>center-driven</b> component. Responses of X cells remained virtually unaffected by both picrotoxin and bicuculline...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{works have}} {{discussed}} {{in detail the}} difficulties occurring when one applies numerical methods to Hallén's and Pocklington's integral equations for the current distribution along a linear antenna. When the so-called approximate kernel is used, the main difficulty is the appearance of unphysical oscillations near the driving point and/or near {{the ends of the}} antenna. Another work has proposed an easy-to-apply, possible method to overcome these unnatural oscillations. The basic idea is to define a new current from the near magnetic field produced by the original oscillating current. In the present paper, for the case of an antenna <b>center-driven</b> by a delta-function generator, we place this remedy on a much firmer basis. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|When the {{approximate}} kernel is used, Hallén's integral equation {{for the current}} distribution on a <b>center-driven,</b> straight-wire antenna {{does not have a}} solution. This is true for at least two types of feed: the delta-function generator and the frill generator. For the case of subsectional basis functions in Galerkin's method, recent papers have shown that the main associated difficulty is the unavoidable appearance of oscillations near the center and/or the ends of the antenna. In this paper, we investigate the nature of the difficulties for the case of entire-domain, cosine basis functions. We find that the difficulties {{are similar to those of}} the subsectional case, something that we had not expected beforehand. In particular, undesirable oscillations appear when the number of basis functions is greater than a number dependent on the length-to-radius ratio, giving one a simple rule for choosing the number of basis functions so as to yield smooth solutions. We also compare results to ""true"" solutions, study the separate but important effects of roundoff, and give extensions to equations of the Pocklington type. © 2009 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|In this report, Yagi-Uda antenna is {{analyzed}} and simulated {{by developing a}} Matlab program. The analysis of Yagi antenna {{has been based on}} considering a single mode cosine current distribution on all elements. The antenna is viewed as a special kind of <b>center-driven</b> dipole array in which all but the actual exciter element are short-circuited at the terminals. Currents are induced in the parasitic elements via the mutual impedances with the exciter, and radiation occurs as from a set of discrete sources. The mutual impedance matrix of the array is calculated using EMF method and integral equations for electric field. This analysis has led to a fast and efficient code to calculate Yagi parameters. The validity of the results is checked with a MoM solution from NEC 2, where good agreement has been observed in terms of radiation pattern. Then the code has been used together with genetic algorithm in order to optimize Yagi-Uda antenna for gain maximization. A 31 -element high gain Yagi with 19. 2 dB gain and the gain bandwidth of 8 percent is derived i...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} end-cab {{shuttle car}} (SC) design {{has been developed}} to improve protection and address ergonomic concerns of the SC operator in low coal mines. The new design features an end cab transversely mounted to the SC and equipped with a closed-circuit video system. The end cab was retrofitted to a low-coal SC and evaluated in surface trials at the U. S. Bureau of Mines. During surface trials, test operators evaluated the end-cab SC relative to visibility; cab features-space, seating, controls, and operator position; tramming-inby, outby, and turning corners; and dumping. Trials were conducted using 12 test subjects; 6 were experienced SC operators. Results of the trials were promising. Of the experienced operators, the only operator with low-coal experience gave the new design the highest rating. Four experienced operators rated the end-cab design "better" to "much better" than a standard <b>center-driven,</b> side-cab SC for visibility when tramming, protection from roof and rib hazards, and no change in seat position with direction of travel. This report discusses research to modify a used 21 SC JOY SC, retrofit the SC with the Bureau-developed end-cab, and evaluate the retrofitted end-cab SC in surface trials...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{so-called}} Hallén {{integral equation}} {{for the current}} on a finite linear antenna <b>center-driven</b> by a delta-function generator takes two forms depending on the choice of kernel. The two kernels are usually {{referred to as the}} exact and the approximate or reduced kernel. With the approximate kernel, the integral equation has no solution. Nevertheless, the same numerical method is often applied to both forms of the integral equation. In this paper, the behavior of the numerical solutions thus obtained is investigated, and the similarities and differences between the two numerical solutions are discussed. The numerical method is Galerkin’s method with pulse functions. We first apply this method to the two corresponding forms of the integral equation for the current on a linear antenna of infinite length. In this case, the method yields an infinite Toeplitz system of algebraic equations in which the width of the pulse basis functions enters as a parameter. The infinite system is solved exactly for nonzero pulse width; the exact solution is then developed asymptotically for the case where the pulse width is small. When the asymptotic expressions for the case of the infinite antenna are used as a guide for the behavior of the solutions of the finite antenna, the latter problem is greatly facilitated. For the approximate kernel, the main results of this paper carry over to a certain numerical method applied to the corresponding equation of the Pocklington type.

40|$|Liver {{allocation}} in Eurotransplant {{is complex}} as allocation rules {{need to follow}} not only the guidelines of the European Commission but also the specific regulations {{of each of the}} 7 Eurotransplant countries with active liver transplant programs. Thirty-eight liver transplant centers served a population of about 135 million in 2015. Around 1600 deceased donor livers are transplanted annually. The number of deceased organ donors remains stable but donor age is increasing. Nevertheless, liver utilization rates are unchanged at around 80 %. Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCD) increased 4 -fold in the past decade. In Belgium and the Netherlands, DCDs were responsible for 30 % of deceased donor liver transplant activity in 2015; Austria only occasionally transplants a DCD liver; other Eurotransplant countries do not have active DCD programs. The most frequent indications for liver transplantation are alcoholic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and viral hepatitis. Livers are allocated first internationally to high urgency status patients or those with an approved combined organ status (for a liver in combination with heart, lung, intestine, or pancreas) and then on a national basis where allocation is recipient-driven or <b>center-driven,</b> depending on country-specific rules. Median waiting time for an elective liver transplant was 4, 4 months in 2015; high urgency status patients waited a median of 2 days for a suitable liver. Mortality on the waiting list was 18 % in 2015, 4 % of patients were delisted because they became unfit for transplantation. One and 5 -year risk unadjusted adult patient survival after transplantation is 80 % and 65 %. status: publishe...|$|E
