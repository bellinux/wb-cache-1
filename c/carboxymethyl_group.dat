By introducing <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>groups</b> to the chitosan chains, degree of FA substitution increases significantly (P value less than 0.05). This could be due to the presence of carboxylic acid groups and the phenomenon of proton motion. COOH groups of CMC can promote conversion of NH 2 groups of chitosan to NH 3 +; therefore, their reactivity with COOH groups of folic acid increases (Larsson et al. 2013; Li et al. 2008).|$|R

50|$|Vinblastine is {{a highly}} potent drug which also has serious side effects {{especially}} on the neurological system. Therefore, new synthetic analogues were developed {{with the goal of}} obtaining more efficient and less toxic drugs. The stereochemical configurations at C-20', C-16' and C-14' in the velbanamine portion are critical and inversion leads to loss of activity. The C-16' <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>group</b> is important for activity since decarboxylated dimer is inactive. Structural variation at C-15'- C-20' in the velbanamine ring is well tolerated. The upper skeletal modification of vinblastine gave vinorelbine which shows comparable activity as that of vinblastine. Another analogue prepared was the difluoro derivative of vinorelbine which showed improved in vivo antitumor activity. It was discovered that fluorination at C-19' position of vinorelbine dramatically increased the in vivo activity. Most of the SAR studies involve the vindoline portion of bis-indole alkaloids because modification at C-16 and C-17 offers good opportunities for developing new analogues. The replacement of the ester group with an amide group at the C-16 resulted in the development of vindesine. Similarly replacement of the acetyl group at C-16 with L-trp-OC2H5, d-Ala(P)-(OC2H5)2, L-Ala(P)-(OC2H5)2 and I-Vla(P)-(OC2H5)2 gave rise to new analogues having anti- tubulin activity. Also {{it was found that the}} vindoline's indole methyl group is a useful position to functionalize potentially and develop new, potent vinblastine derivatives. A new series of semi-synthetic C-16 -spiro-oxazolidine-1,3-diones prepared from 17-deacetyl vinblastine showed good anti-tubulin activity and lower cytotoxicity. Vinglycinate a glycinate prodrug derived from the C-17-OH group of vinblastine showed similar antitumor activity and toxicity as that of vinblastine.|$|E

40|$|Transmissive spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are {{neurodegenerative}} diseases {{characterized by}} depositions of abnormally folded prion protein (PrPTSE) in brain. PrPTSE is at present the only specific biochemical marker {{of human and}} animal TSEs. Diagnostic tests {{are based on the}} detection of PrPres after proteinase K digestion of brain homogenate using Western blot or on the immunohistochemistry of fixed brain tissue, which are both difficult and time consuming. In this work we focused on development of a new type of tests based on PrP detection without need of proteinase K digestion. As deposits of PrPTSE remain in the body for a long time, there is a substantial chance of them being nonenzymatically modified by glycation. The detection of glycated PrPTSE may have a potential to serve as a diagnostic marker. We prepared monoclonal antibodies specific for carboxymethyl lysine/arginine modified prion protein. Bacterially expressed and purified recombinant human prion protein (rhPrP) was modified by glyoxylic acid that introduces <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>groups</b> on lysine and arginine residues present within the molecule of the protein. Modified rhPrP (rhPrP-CML) was used for immunization of laboratory mice and hybridoma cells were prepared. Screening of cell supernatants resulted in the selection of 4 [...] ...|$|R
