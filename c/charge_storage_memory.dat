30|$|Nonvolatile memory {{technologies}} in Si-based electronics {{date back to}} the 1990 s. Ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) {{was one of the most}} promising devices replacing the conventional Flash memory facing physical scaling limitations at those times. A variant of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> <b>memory</b> referred to as Flash memory is widely used in consumer electronic products such as cell phones and music players while NAND Flash-based solid-state disks (SSDs) are increasingly displacing hard disk drives as the primary storage device in laptops, desktops, and even data centers. The integration limit of Flash memories is approaching, and many new types of memory to replace conventional Flash memories have been proposed. Emerging memory technologies promise new memories to store more data at less cost than the expensive-to-build silicon chips used by popular consumer gadgets including digital cameras, cell phones and portable music players. They are being investigated and lead to the future as potential alternatives to existing memories in future computing systems. Emerging nonvolatile memory technologies such as magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), spin-transfer torque random-access memory (STT-RAM), ferroelectric random-access memory (FeRAM), phase-change memory (PCM), and resistive random-access memory (RRAM) combine the speed of static random-access memory (SRAM), the density of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), and the nonvolatility of Flash memory and so become very attractive as another possibility for future memory hierarchies. Many other new classes of emerging memory technologies such as transparent and plastic, three-dimensional (3 -D), and quantum dot memory technologies have also gained tremendous popularity in recent years. Subsequently, not an exaggeration to say that computer memory could soon earn the ultimate commercial validation for commercial scale-up and production the cheap plastic knockoff. Therefore, this review is devoted to the rapidly developing new class of memory technologies and scaling of scientific procedures based on an investigation of recent progress in advanced Flash memory devices.|$|E
40|$|Discrete charge-trapping flash {{memories}} {{are more promising}} than their floating-gate counterparts due to their physically discrete-trapping and coupling-free nature. Si 3 N 4 is conventional material as charge-trapping layer (CTL) for charge storage. The shortcomings of Si 3 N 4 are its low dielectric constant and small barrier height at its interface with SiO 2 tunneling layer. Therefore, this research aims to investigate new materials as CTL for improving {{the performance of the}} memory devices. The charge-trapping characteristics of La 2 O 3 with and without nitrogen incorporation were investigated. Compared with the memory device with La 2 O 3 as CTL, the one with nitrided La 2 O 3 (LaON) showed larger memory window, higher program/erase (P/E) speeds and smaller charge loss, due to the nitrided La 2 O 3 film exhibiting less crystallized structure, higher trap density induced by nitrogen incorporation, and suppressed leakage by nitrogen passivation. In order to further improve the performance of the memory device with LaON CTL, a device with band-engineered LaTiON/LaON structure as CTL was also explored, and demonstrated to have better performance than the one with LaON CTL. This was ascribed to the variable tunneling path of charge carriers under P/E and retention modes (realized by the band-engineered charge-trapping layer), high trap density of LaTiON, and large barrier height at the LaTiON/SiO interface. SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3,both ofwhich are typical perovskite-type dielectrics, also possess distinguished characteristics as CTL, including remarkably high dielectric constant and large conduction-band offset relative to SiO 2. The charge-trapping properties of SrTiO 3 with and without fluorine incorporation were studied. The device with fluorinated SrTiO 3 film showed promising performance in terms of higher P/E speeds at a low gate voltage, better endurance and data retention compared with that without fluorine treatment. These advantages were associated with generated deep-level traps, reduced leakage path, and enhanced strength of the film due to the highest electro-negativity of the fluorine atoms incorporated in the film. The charge-trapping properties of BaTiO 3 with and without Zr incorporation were also investigated, where Zr incorporated in BaTiO 3 could strengthen the dielectric film and improve its thermodynamic stability. The device with Zr incorporation exhibited similar memory window as the one without Zr incorporation, but higher program speed at low gate voltage, better endurance and data retention, due to the Zr-doped BaTiO 3 exhibiting higher charge-trapping efficiency and higher density of traps with deeper energy levels. Besides nitride-based memories, nanocrystal-based {{memories are}} another type of charge-trapping memories, where nanocrystals (NCs) embedded into a dielectric are used for <b>charge</b> <b>storage.</b> <b>Memory</b> devices with Ga 2 O 3 NCs as CTL were investigated, which are compatible with the CMOS process. The Ga 2 O 3 NCs displayed higher trap density than the Ga 2 O 3 dielectric film. Moreover, compared with the device with Ga 2 O 3 NCs as CTL, the one with nitrided Ga 2 O 3 NCs showed larger memory window, higher operating speed and better data retention, mainly due to higher charge-trapping efficiency of the nitrided Ga 2 O 3 NCs and nitrogen-induced suppressed formation of interlayer at the Ga 2 O/SiO interface. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Technology scaling of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> NVM has always been the strategy to achieve higher density NVM with lower cost per bit in order to meet the persistent consumer demand for larger storage space. However, conventional technology scaling of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> NVM has run into many critical reliability challenges related to fundamental device characteristics.

40|$|Conventional {{technology}} scaling {{is implemented}} {{to meet the}} insatiable demand of high memory density and low cost per bit of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> nonvolatile <b>memory</b> (NVM) devices. In this study, effect of technology scaling to anomalous threshold voltage () variability is investigated thoroughly on postcycled and baked nitride based <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> NVM devices. After long annealing bake of high temperature, cellâ€™s variability of each subsequent bake increases within stable distribution and found exacerbate by technology scaling. Apparent activation energy of this anomalous variability was derived through Arrhenius plots. Apparent activation energy (Eaa) of this anomalous variability is 0. 67 [*]eV at sub- 40 [*]nm devices which is a reduction of approximately 2 times from 110 [*]nm devices. Technology scaling clearly aggravates this anomalous variability, and this poses reliability challenges to applications that demand strict control, for example, reference cells that govern fundamental program, erase, and verify operations of NVM devices. Based on critical evidence, this anomalous variability is attributed to lateral displacement of trapped <b>charges</b> in nitride <b>storage</b> layer.

However, conventional memory technologies are facing many challenges such as difficulties of miniaturization and guarantee good reliability of memory devices.

40|$|In this letter, the {{relation}} between the thickness of SiO 2 and the behavior of forming process has been investigated. During room temperature forming process, the resistive switching (RS) behavior was activated in the thin SiO 2 (12 nm), but failed in the thick SiO 2 (23 nm). The behavior of activation failure is attributed to the reformed SiOx layer due to the unexpected recombination of excessive oxygen ions and oxygen vacancies near the TiN/SiO 2 interface. However, RS behavior can be presented successfully owing to the enhancement of driving ability of oxygen ions into TiN by employing high temperature forming process.

40|$|For {{more than}} 30 years, <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> based {{non-volatile}} <b>memory</b> (NVM) {{devices such as}} floating gate (FG) NVM {{is one of the}} key enablers in the rapid evolution of modern intelligent consumer electronics. However, incessant technology scaling trend has exposed severe reliability challenges of FG NVM devices. Nitride based charge trap (CT) NVM is one of the most promising candidates to eclipse FG NVM as the mainstream flash memory technology. This is due to the intrinsic immunity to point defects of nitride based CT NVM and its superior device scalability as compared to FG NVM. Due to the aggressive technology scaling trend, nitride based CT NVM devices face reliability challenges in post cycled threshold voltage (Vt) instability. For both FG and nitride based CT NVM devices, post cycled Vt instability induces significant Vt distribution shift and broadening of program cells. Vt distribution shifting and broadening reduce the operating window and premature data retention failures of the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> based NVM devices. Vt instability mechanisms of nitride based CTF memory inevitably introduces stochastic fluctuations in Vt of nitride based CTF cells which is detrimental to long term data retention performance. Thus, it is imperative to research and shed new lights in the physical mechanisms of Vt instability in nitride based CT NVM devices. Throughout this work, the charge trap dynamics and Vt instability of nitride based CT NVM were meticulously characterized and studied. Stretched Exponential (SE) is applied to model the decay and steady behaviour of Vt distribution shift exhibited on nitride based CT NVM devices. SE function typically models the decay nature of disordered material. In this work, both SE decay phase and steady phase of Vt distribution shift observed on nitride based CT NVM devices were thoroughly studied to understand the charge loss mechanism that is detrimental to its data retention performance...|$|R

40|$|Of {{the many}} known stoichiometries and crystal phases of {{manganese}} oxide, {{a select few}} {{have been found to}} have remarkable properties for electrochemical <b>charge</b> <b>storage.</b> Among these are hollandite Î±-MnO 2 and spinel Î»-MnO 2, which are studied in this work. Î±-Mn O 2 has been observed to have a high electrochemical <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity with incredible rate capability and cycle lifetime in aqueous alkali salt electrolytes. In these conditions, this material also exhibits the unique property of pseudocapacitance, meaning that the electrochemical behavior mimics the properties of a parallel-plate dielectric capacitor. However, the underlying mechanism for <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in Î±-MnO 2, and the origins of pseudocapacitance are generally not understood. Conversely, Î»-MnO 2 is a well-studied cathode for lithium ion batteries with a high capacity and rate for <b>charge</b> <b>storage,</b> which is known to degrade quickly, especially at elevated temperatures. In this work, we study both pseudocapacitive Mn O 2 and Î»-MnO 2 using computational chemistry and experimental techniques.

40|$|The <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in the a-Si:H PIN {{photodiode}} {{under different}} light wavelength illuminations has been studied. The leakage current-voltage and capacitance-voltage curves under three fundamental visible light wavelengths, i. e., red, {{green and blue}} light were measured. The apparent <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> density in the negative voltage range was quantified from the capacitance-voltage curve; charges in the positive voltage range were estimated from the leakage current-voltage curve. The measurement was verified with a pre-fabricated circuit which is a <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> readout device. The diode under the long wavelength light illumination condition stored more charges than that under the short wavelength light illumination condition because the former could penetrate the intrinsic a-Si:H layer deeper than the latter could. The leakage current and <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity of the diode {{are determined by the}} generation of electron-hole pairs and the depletion of charges in the intrinsic layer as well as the supply of charges from the electrodes. A comparison of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacities of diodes with different intrinsic layer thicknesses is also presented. The number of photogenerated carriers increases with the thickness of the i-layer due to the long penetration depth, but the junction capacitance decreases which results in the decrease of the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Understanding {{the dynamic}} <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in {{nanoporous}} electrodes with room-temperature ionic liquid electrolytes {{is essential for}} optimizing them to achieve supercapacitors with high energy and power densities. Herein, we report coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the cyclic voltammetry of supercapacitors featuring subnan-ometer pores and model ionic liquids. We show that the cyclic charging and discharging of nanopores are governed by the interplay between the external field-driven ion transport and the sloshing dynamics of ions inside of the pore. The ion occupancy along the pore length depends strongly on the scan rate and varies cyclically during charging/discharging.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using {{molecular}} dynamics simulations, {{we show that}} <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in subnanometer pores follows a distinct voltage-dependent behavior. Specifically, at lower voltages, <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> is achieved by swapping co-ions in the pore with counterions in the bulk electrolyte. As voltage increases, further <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> is due mainly to the removal of co-ions from the pore, leading to a capacitance increase. The capacitance eventually reaches a maximum when all co-ions are expelled from the pore. At even higher electrode voltages, additional <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> is realized by counterion insertion into the pore, accompanied by a reduction of capacitance. The molecular mechanisms of these observations are elucidated and provide useful insight for optimizing energy storage based on supercapacitors.
