Nine critical workstations were chosen as subjects for the study {{in order to determine}} the thermal comfort among workers at Malaysian automotive industry. The human subjects for the study comprises of the operators from tire receiving, dashboard assembly, drum tester, body assembly, seat assembly, door <b>check</b> <b>assembly,</b> stamping workstation, engine sub assembly and paint shop of the factory. The environmental factors such as Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), relative humidity, air velocity, illuminance were measured using BABUC A apparatus and Thermal Comfort Measurement equipment. Through questionnaire survey, the demographic data of subjects and their perceptions on thermal comfort at each workstation were assessed based on ISO Standard 7730 and thermal sensation scale using Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Then, Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) is used to estimate the thermal satisfaction of occupants. The results indicated that most of the workstations of the automotive industry are considered as uncomfortable. Tire receiving station is considered having better working environment compared to other stations with lowest PMV index of 1. 09 to 1. 41 and PPD of 46 %. Meanwhile, the engine sub assembly station and paint shop of assembly are considered the worst thermal environment with the PMV index values ranging between 2. 1 to 2. 9 and PPD values of 81 % to 99 %. Therefore, these two workstations are considered not comfortable because the thermal sensation scale is warm and almost hot...|$|E

It {{is also an}} attractive candidate for refurbishing applications because of low heat input, limited dilution with minimal distortion and capability of adding finer near-net shaped features to the components.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years the most {{important}} automotive OEM have given more importance to job organization and optimization in the plants for productivity and legal reasons. The continuous request to produce different new models in few years oblige OEM to develop more flexible assembly lines and better methods for job planning on the same lines. In the meantime, safety norms and product quality reasons request to improve working condition also according to international standards. In this paper, the authors show a new method for process design with the final goal to optimize assembly tasks. The method {{is based on the}} possibility to apply preventive ergonomics and feasibility analysis of the assembly task through a virtual simulation investigating general feasibility of the task and risks of muscle-skeletal pathologies from incongruous postures and movements. Using Digital Human Models (DHM) and Virtual Reality (VR) tools, it is possible to simulate manual assembly tasks in a very preliminary moment of the process development where designers and engineers have only virtual models to <b>check</b> <b>assembly</b> feasibility and to design the final bill of process. Through the use of virtual manikins, designers can vary workers movements to solve complex problems related to human movements and posture recognition bringing more realistic and reliable simulations to systematically investigate workplaces {{for a wide variety of}} users and operative solutions. On the methodological point of view, a special attention has been given to ergonomics evaluation methods that, usually, have an experimental nature and therefore specific adaptations are required to use them on digital humans in virtual environments. In the paper, the authors show an application of the new method to an interesting case study. The simulations suggest new solutions which bring to a more ergonomic and efficient task...|$|E

The challenge of studying information flow for assembly languages is that the control flow constructs that guide the analysis in high-level languages are not present.

A second function can be to hold the elastomer in place while a machine is being assembled, as geometry may prevent the seal from being directly <b>checked</b> after <b>assembly.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{advent of}} {{pyrophosphate}} sequencing makes {{large volumes of}} sequencing data available {{at a lower cost}} than previously possible. However, the short read lengths are difficult to assemble and the large dataset is difficult to handle. During the sequencing of a virus from the tsetse fly, Glossina pallidipes, we found the need for tools to search quickly a set of reads for near exact text matches. Methods A set of tools is provided to search a large data set of pyrophosphate sequence reads under a "live" CD version of Linux on a standard PC that can be used by anyone without prior knowledge of Linux and without having to install a Linux setup on the computer. The tools permit short lengths of de novo <b>assembly,</b> <b>checking</b> of existing assembled sequences, selection and display of reads from the data set and gathering counts of sequences in the reads. Results Demonstrations are given of the use of the tools to help with <b>checking</b> an <b>assembly</b> against the fragment data set; investigating homopolymer lengths, repeat regions and polymorphisms; and resolving inserted bases caused by incomplete chain extension. Conclusion The additional information contained in a pyrophosphate sequencing data set beyond a basic assembly is difficult to access {{due to a lack of}} tools. The set of simple tools presented here would allow anyone with basic computer skills and a standard PC to access this information. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{narrow channel}} (NC) {{facility}} design {{is based on}} the GALCIT Detonation Tube (GDT) test section design of Mike Kaneshige [3]. The main differences are 1) the design of the longitudinal bolted joint was simplified and 2) the keys for the flanges are not designed to assist with shear loading. The GDT side windows and PLIF window may be used in the NC facility. 304 SS was chosen for its excellent corrosion resistance. The yield strength is 275 MPa. 304 SS is non-magnetic and is therefore more difficult to grind on a table with magnetic locking. All four plates were blanchard ground (using mechanical locking to the table through some of the bolt holes which were drilled before grinding) by a subcontractor for Hales. All pieces were machined by Hales except the initiator, window sealing plates, end flange sealing plates which were made by the Aeroshop.

40|$|Fires {{in three}} P 3 {{aircraft}} oxygen systems have occurred: {{one in the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1984 and two in the U. S. Navy in 1998 and 2003. All three fires started in the aluminum manifold and <b>check</b> valve (MCV) <b>assembly</b> and produced similar damages to the aircraft in which they occurred. This paper discusses a failure analysis conducted by the NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) Oxygen Hazards and Testing Team on the 2003 U. S. Navy VP 62 fire. It was surmised that the fire started due to heat generated by an oxygen leak past a silicone check valve seal or possibly because of particle impact near the seat {{of one of the}} MCV <b>assembly</b> <b>check</b> valves. An additional analysis of fires in several check valve poppet seals from other aircraft is discussed. These burned poppet seals came from P 3 oxygen systems that had been serviced at the Naval Air Station (NAS) in Jacksonville following standard fill procedures. It was concluded that these seal fires occurred due to the heat from compression heating, particle impact, or the heat generated by an oxygen leak past the silicone check valve seal. The fact that catastrophic fires did not occur in the case of each check valve seal fire was attributed to the protective nature of the aluminum oxide layer on the check valve poppets. To prevent future fires of this nature, the U. S. and Canadian fleets of P 3 aircraft have been retrofitted with MCV assemblies with an upgraded design and more burn-resistant materials...|$|R
