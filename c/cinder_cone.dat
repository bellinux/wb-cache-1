5|$|If magma were to rise {{towards the}} surface of Nazko, new {{earthquake}} swarms would occur, with {{a significant increase in}} the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small <b>cinder</b> <b>cone,</b> similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to <b>cinder</b> <b>cone</b> eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> are monogenetic - {{the result}} of a single, never-to-be-repeated eruption. Parícutin in Mexico, Diamond Head, Koko Head, Punchbowl Crater and some <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> on Mauna Kea are monogenetic <b>cinder</b> <b>cones.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Volcanic <b>cones</b> or <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> {{result from}} eruptions of mostly {{small pieces of}} scoria and {{pyroclastics}} (both resemble cinders, hence {{the name of this}} volcano type) that build up around the vent. These can be relatively short-lived eruptions that produce a cone-shaped hill perhaps 30 to 400 meters high. Most <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> erupt only once. <b>Cinder</b> <b>cones</b> may form as flank vents on larger volcanoes, or occur on their own. [...] Parícutin in Mexico and Sunset Crater in Arizona are examples of <b>cinder</b> <b>cones.</b> [...] In New Mexico, Caja del Rio is a volcanic field of over 60 <b>cinder</b> <b>cones.</b>|$|R
40|$|Monogenetic {{volcanic}} activity has produced <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> and small shield volcanoes on the earth, moon, and Mars.

5|$|The latest {{volcanic}} eruption created a small tree-covered basaltic <b>cinder</b> <b>cone</b> {{at the east}} end of Kostal Lake called Kostal Cone perhaps as recently as 400 years ago, {{making it one of the}} youngest volcanoes in Canada based on tree-growth data.|$|E
5|$|Magmatic eruptions have {{produced}} tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow <b>cinder</b> <b>cone.</b> The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris flows and debris avalanches; many, if not most, {{of these were}} not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquakes}} were {{a series}} of small volcanic earthquakes measuring less than 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. They took place in the sparsely populated Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. They occurred just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered <b>cinder</b> <b>cone</b> that last erupted about 7,200 years ago.|$|E
50|$|Cherpuk Group (Черпук) is a {{group of}} two <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> located in the central part of Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. It {{is a group}} of a few mostly dormant <b>cinder</b> <b>cones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> are {{randomly}} arranged and {{occur at}} low altitudes, usually on alluvial plains {{or on the}} flanks of eroded shield volcanoes. There are an average of 2.5 <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> every 100 km2.|$|R
5|$|The shaded north {{slopes of}} <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> provide more {{protection}} from direct sunlight and prevailing southwesterly winds {{and have a}} more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring). These parts of <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> are therefore colonized by plants first.|$|R
5|$|In {{the northwestern}} and northeastern {{parts of the}} shield volcano, basanite lava flows were erupted and are volumetrically subordinate. These {{represent}} the youngest known lavas of the Itcha Range. However, a <b>cinder</b> <b>cone</b> {{in the middle of}} the shield could be much younger, perhaps as young as the basanites at Nazko Cone to the east, which were erupted 340,000to 7,100years ago. The older basanites in the Itcha Range may have been erupted contemporaneously with the late feldspar hawaiites.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} lava flows blocked rivers and streams, {{impounding}} small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000years ago, basalt from the largest <b>cinder</b> <b>cone</b> in the park, Crater Hill, flowed over the area. The lava traveled into Coalpits and Scoggins Washes {{to the south}} and accumulated to a depth of over 400ft (122m) in the ancestral Virgin River valley near the present-day ghost town of Grafton, Utah. Water impounded behind the two blockages, forming Coalpits Lake and Lake Grafton respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field is}} one of the 10 volcanic areas in Canada associated with recent seismic activity; the others are Castle Rock, Mount Edziza, Mount Cayley, Hoodoo Mountain, The Volcano, Crow Lagoon, Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi and Nazko Cone. Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain living magma plumbing systems, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some of Canada's volcanoes are potentially active, and that their associated hazards may be significant. Beneath areas of monogenetic <b>cinder</b> <b>cone</b> activity, such as the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, the seismicity appears to be more dispersed. In a few cases earthquakes are clustered in time and space, suggestive of volcanic earthquake swarms.|$|E
5|$|The steep conical <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> of Edziza {{were formed}} by lava {{fountain}} eruptions, emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava {{from a single}} vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinder around the vent to form a circular or oval <b>cone.</b> Edziza's <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> have bowl-shaped craters at their summits and rise {{more than a hundred}} metres above their surroundings. <b>Cinder</b> <b>cones</b> are widespread in British Columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.|$|R
50|$|The Alligator Lake {{volcanic}} {{complex is}} a group of basaltic <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> and lava flows in south central Yukon. The upper part of the Alligator Lake volcanic complex consists of two well-preserved <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> capping a small shield volcano. They probably post-date the local Holocene glaciation. Lava flows from both <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> traveled to the north and were erupted simultaneously. Their compositions range from alkali olivine basalt to basanitic. Lava flows from the northeast cone are the largest extending 6 km from the cone and expanding to a width of 10 km at the terminus.|$|R

25|$|Although paleomagnetic {{evidence}} {{can be used}} to {{rule out}} the 1850s as the age of <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone,</b> it does not provide an actual age for its eruption. By measuring levels of carbon-14 in samples of wood from trees killed by the eruption of <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone,</b> USGS scientists obtained a radiocarbon date for the eruption of between 1630 and 1670. Such a date is also consistent with the remnant magnetization preserved in the lava flows. The series of eruptions that produced the volcanic deposits at <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone</b> were complex and are by no means completely understood. However, the new studies done by USGS scientists refute the purported accounts of an eruption in the early 1850s and confirm Diller’s (1891, 1893) interpretation that <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone</b> erupted {{in the latter half of}} the 17th century. They also suggest that the 1666 tree-ring date proposed by Finch (1937) for his “second” explosive eruption at <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone</b> might actually date the entire eruptive sequence.|$|E
25|$|The first {{geologist}} {{to study}} <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone</b> was Joseph Diller, {{who was among}} the first USGS scientists to study volcanoes. Diller made careful observations of <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone</b> and interviewed many Native Americans and European trappers and settlers who were in the Lassen region in 1850. None of them could recall witnessing any volcanic activity in the area. Diller knew that an “emigrant road” (the Nobles Trail), used by settlers coming to California in the early 1850s, passes close to the base of <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone.</b> He spoke with several people who had “crossed the trail” in 1853. They noted that a large, solitary willow bush (Salix scouleriana) near the summit of <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone</b> was “as large then as now.” Today, more than a century after Diller’s interviews, this bush is still alive and little changed.|$|E
25|$|This {{process of}} {{grouping}} {{was done by}} 3He surface exposure dating and 40Ar/39Ar dating. The new morphologic dating methods suggest that <b>cinder</b> <b>cone</b> formation in the Potrillo volcanic field may have occurred at different intervals and that the field may be currently developing new cinder cones. The <b>cinder</b> <b>cone</b> slope distribution in the Potrillo volcanic field suggests that volcanism occurred at different time intervals. In addition, trend line analysis provides a powerful and useful tool for predicting <b>cinder</b> <b>cone</b> ages in the Potrillo volcanic field. This area has arid climate & cone degradation {{is a product of}} mechanical weathering.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cinder</b> <b>cones</b> and spatter cones are {{small-scale}} features {{formed by}} lava accumulation around a small vent on a volcanic edifice. <b>Cinder</b> <b>cones</b> are formed from tephra or ash and tuff which is thrown from an explosive vent.

Lava flows from the two <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> lie on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, indicating an early Holocene age.|$|R
25|$|The earlier erupted {{group of}} {{volcanic}} deposits at <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone,</b> which are relatively titanium-poor, consist {{of the older}} scoria cone, the Old Bench flow, the two Painted Dunes flows, and {{the lower part of}} the widespread ash layer. The later erupted, relatively titanium-rich group consists of the large, younger scoria cone, the upper part of the ash layer, and the two Fantastic Lava Beds flows. Flow 2 of the Fantastic Lava Beds (see geologic map) is the flow that everyone but Diller thought had been erupted in 1851. The ash on the Old Bench and Painted Dunes lava flows is brightly oxidized because it fell on the lava flows when they were still hot. This oxidized ash belongs to the same compositional group as the Fantastic Lava Beds flows, the last flows erupted at <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone.</b> All the volcanic materials at <b>Cinder</b> <b>Cone</b> therefore represent a single eruptive sequence that probably spanned no more than a few months.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cinder</b> <b>cones,</b> {{also known}} as scoria cones and less {{commonly}} scoria mounds, are small, steep-sided volcanic cones built of loose pyroclastic fragments, such as either volcanic clinkers, cinders, volcanic ash, or scoria. They consist of loose pyroclastic debris formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single, typically cylindrical, vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders, clinkers, or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is beautifully symmetrical; with slopes between 30-40°; and a nearly circular ground plan. Most <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit. The basal diameters of <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> average about 800 m and range from 250-2500 m. The diameter of their craters range between 50-600 m. <b>Cinder</b> <b>cones</b> rarely rise more than 50-350 m or so above their surroundings.|$|R
50|$|The {{size and}} shape of <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> depend on {{environmental}} properties as different gravity and/or atmospheric pressure might change the dispersion of ejected scoria particles. For example, <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> on Mars seem to be more than two times wider than terrestrial analogues as lower atmospheric pressure and gravity enable wider dispersion of ejected particles over a larger area. Therefore, it seems that erupted amount of material is not sufficient on Mars for the flank slopes to attain the angle of repose and Martian <b>cinder</b> <b>cones</b> seem to be ruled mainly by ballistic distribution and not by material redistribution on flanks as typical on Earth.|$|R
