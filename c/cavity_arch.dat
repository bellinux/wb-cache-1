30|$|Transverse maxillary {{deficiency}} is a malocclusion seen {{among adolescents}} or adults with prevalence over 8 – 10 % [1, 2] and can manifest clinically as unilateral or bilateral crossbite, narrow nasal <b>cavity,</b> <b>arch</b> length discrepancy, and crowding [3, 4]. Additionally, some {{evidence indicates that}} posterior crossbites might be associated with temporomandibular disorders, including clicking and muscle tenderness [5]. Therefore, transverse maxillary deficiencies are usually treated on diagnosis to enable the settling of a harmonic occlusion, while avoiding any potential side effects.|$|E

Indodidymozoon moretonensis sp. n. from the buccal <b>cavity</b> and branchial <b>arches</b> and I. suttiei sp. n. from the flesh {{are described}} from Platycephalus fuscus. Indodidymozoon lesteri sp. n. from the belly skin, I, pearsoni sp. n. from the eye, and Helicodidymozoon tortor gen. n., sp. n. from the buccal <b>cavity,</b> branchial <b>arches</b> and operculum are described from Platycephalus endrachtensis. The taxonomic composition of the genus Didymozoon is discussed. Five species, D. branchiale, D. brevicolle. D. koti, D. musculi and D. platycephali are moved to Indodidymozoon; the generic diagnosis of Indodidymozoon is revised. One species, D. spirale, and one species from Neometadidymozoon, N. helicis, arc moved to the newly erected Helicodidymozoon.

40|$|Two {{new species}} of didymozoid trematodes are {{described}} from two species of Onigocia-stem platycephalid (flathead) fishes from Moreton Bay, Australia. Indodidymozoon metridion n. sp. is described fro the operculum of Suggrundus jugosus. Indodidymozoon ditremion n. sp. is described from the buccal <b>cavity,</b> branchial <b>arches</b> and pharynx of inegocia japonica. The two species can be distingished from other species in the genus Indodidymozoon, except Indodidymozoon branchiale, by their two anterior uterine loops, which are located posterior to the fore-body-hindbody junction. The new species can be differentiated from I. branchiale by the length of their testes. Indodidymozoon metridian differs from I. ditremion in body size, position of ventral sucker and relative testis length.

40|$|The role of news {{is found}} to be {{fundamentally}} useful in understanding the behaviour of financial market volatility. It has been found that the Engle’s basic ARCH models are incapable of capturing all observed phenomena, such as asymmetric effect, excess kurtosis and high degree of nonlinearity, which are often the stylized facts exhibited by most financial and economic time series. Bollerslev’s GARCH has the similar <b>cavities</b> as the <b>ARCH.</b> Although the EGARCH and GJR models capture the asymmetric news and nonlinearities, performances of these two models are quite different.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Sinkholes {{encompass}} {{the withdrawal of}} shallow sediment into deep hollow compartments located in karstic stratum. These subsequent surface openings associated with karst geology have inhibited multiple infrastructure developments. Sinkholes are triggered by the alteration of the existing groundwater level which erodes weathered altered dolomite (WAD) residuum into karst cavities. Substantial literature has explored the stability of sinkholes, with reliance on limit analysis and empirical data, to quantify {{the strength of the}} porous karst residuum. In this study, the appraisal of sinkhole propagation was facilitated with the geological data acquired along the Gautrain route through Centurion, South Africa. Sinkhole development was analysed through analytical theories and the application of numerical methods. The analytical study conceptualized the ‘angle of draw’ of dolomite overburden layers into <b>cavities,</b> with Terzaghi’s <b>arching</b> in soil equation. The analytical results illustrated constant vertical drawdown in the WAD and incremental cavity propagation in the frictional chert residuum...|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{techniques}} (histology and electron microscopy), {{as well as}} immunofluorescence assays, {{were applied}} {{to the study of}} the localization and smooth muscle cell (SMC) composition of atherosclerotic lesions in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits during a 4. 5 -month period. Vascular segments from different arteries (carotid, coronary, and iliac arteries) or from the same vessel at different levels (aorta) of animals at days 7, 15, 30, 40, 60, 90, and 135 showed that the atherosclerotic lesion first became visible at the level of the aortic arch in 60 -day-old WHHL animals. Histological examination of serial cryosections from this vascular region indicated that the vascular lesion arose from a cavity in the media layer, located anatomically at the level of the juncture of the ligamentum arteriosum with the aortic arch. This aortic <b>arch</b> <b>cavity</b> is formed during the postnatal closure of the ductus arteriosus and is characterized by the presence of a thickened intima, which was absent in the other vascular regions examined. Immunofluorescence comparison of normal and atherosclerotic tissues from the aortic <b>arch</b> <b>cavity</b> wall with the use of monoclonal antibodies specific for smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin isoforms revealed the existence of distinct SMC populations. SMCs in the thickened intima showed a myosin isoform pattern peculiar to cells with a degree of maturation intermediate between the fully differentiated and the developing (fetal) aortic SMCs. By contrast, SMCs present in atherosclerotic lesions displayed a predominant fetal-type pattern of myosin isoform expression. The achievement of this myosin isoform content seems to be correlated with the accumulation of lipids in the intima. In the media subjacent to the intimal thickening or atherosclerotic lesion, SMCs primarily displayed an intermediate degree of maturation. In older WHHL animals and at this aortic level, the SMC composition of the atherosclerotic lesion did not change, whereas in the subjacent media, the cells of intermediate type almost disappeared. In the vascular regions in which the atherosclerotic lesion appeared at later stages, such as near the aortic bifurcation, the distribution of fetal and intermediate cell types in the atherosclerotic wall was similar to that taken at the aortic arch level. These results indicate that there is 1) a preferential anatomic site from which atherogenesis initiates in WHHL rabbits; 2) a time correlation between the accumulation of lipids in the wall and the phenotypic change of SMCs toward a poorly differentiated cell type; and 3) the tendency for SMCs to follow the same differentiation pattern in early atherosclerotic lesions, irrespective of the site and time at which they develop...|$|R
40|$|Mucosal {{secretion}} is {{the first}} line of defense and mucosal lining cells functions as the defensive cellular barrier against foreign agents. The mucus layer covering the body surface of teleost fishes is secreted by mucus cells (MC). In the present study, the structure of MC and its content in the epithelium of the buccal <b>cavity,</b> the gill <b>arch,</b> the esophagus and the skin of parrotfish (Scarus javanicus) were compared histologically and histochemically. A special mucus-secreting organ of the parrotfish (opercular gland) also observed using the same methods. Many MC distributed in the epithelium of buccal cavity, the esophagus and in the opercular gland of parrotfish. Many MC in the special gland of parrotfish suggest that these organs actively secrete much mucus. Contrary, lower density of MC was observed in the skin of parrotfish. Histochemical reactions revealed that out of eight lectin used in the present study. The WGA reacted widely with tissues of parrotfish in the epithelium of buccal cavity, opercular gland, gill and esophagus. These results suggests that N- 2 ̆ 7 acetyl-D-glucosamine is a common carbohydrate residues of glycoproteins contained in mucus. Other lectins, PNA reacted with the skin of parrotfish. Mucus from these tissues contains carbohydrate residues of D-galactose for PNA. Mucus proteins containing these various carbohydrate residues may reveal characteristic natures of each tissues.

40|$|Trigeminally innervated, {{mechanically}} sensitive chemoreceptors (M) {{were previously}} identified in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, {{but it is}} not known whether these receptors are responsive only to noxious, chemical irritants or have a general chemosensory function. This study aimed to characterise the stimulus–response properties of these receptors in comparison with polymodal nociceptors (P). Both P and M gave similar response profiles to acetic acid concentrations. The electrophysiological properties were similar between the two different afferent types. To determine whether the receptors have a nociceptive function, a range of chemical stimulants was applied to these receptors, including non-noxious stimuli such as ammonium chloride, bile, sodium bicarbonate and alarm pheromone, and potentially noxious chemical irritants such as acetic acid, carbon dioxide, low pH, citric acid, citric acid phosphate buffer and sodium chloride. Only irritant stimuli evoked a response, confirming their nociceptive function. All receptor afferents tested responded to carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the form of mineral water or soda water. The majority responded to 1 % acetic acid, 2 % citric acid, citric acid phosphate buffer (pH 3) and 5. 0 mol l– 1 NaCl. CO 2 receptors have been characterised in the orobranchial <b>cavity</b> and gill <b>arches</b> in fish; however, {{this is the first time}} that external CO 2 receptors have been identified on the head of a fish. Because the fish skin is in constant contact with the aqueous environment, contaminants with a low pH or hypercapnia may stimulate the nociceptive system in fish...|$|R
40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} transverse aortic constriction (MTAC) is a {{more desirable}} method for the constriction of the transverse aorta in mice than standard open-chest transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Although transverse aortic constriction is a highly functional method for the induction of high pressure in the left ventricle, it {{is a more}} difficult and lengthy procedure due to its use of artificial ventilation with tracheal intubation. TAC is oftentimes also less survivable, as the newer method, MTAC, neither requires the cutting of the ribs and intercostal muscles nor tracheal intubation with a ventilation setup. In MTAC, {{as opposed to a}} thoracotomy to access to the chest <b>cavity,</b> the aortic <b>arch</b> is reached through a midline incision in the anterior neck. The thyroid is pulled back to reveal the sternal notch. The sternum is subsequently cut down to the second rib level, and the aortic arch is reached simply by separating the connective tissues and thymus. From there, a suture can be wrapped around the arch and tied with a spacer, and then the sternal cut and skin can be closed. MTAC is a much faster and less invasive way to induce left ventricular hypertension and enables the possibility for high-throughput studies. The success of the constriction can be verified using highfrequency trans-thoracic echocardiography, particularly color Doppler and pulsed-wave Doppler, to determine the flow velocities of the aortic arch and left and right carotid arteries, the dimension of the blood vessels, and the left ventricular function and morphology. A successful constriction will also trigger significant histopathological changes, such as cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy with interstitial and perivascular fibrosis. Here, the procedure of MTAC is described, demonstrating how the resulting flow changes in the carotid arteries can be examined with echocardiography, gross morphology, and histopathological changes in the heart.

40|$|The {{environmental}} {{conditions of the}} Moon require mitigation if a long-term human presence is to be achieved for extended periods of time. Radiation, micrometeoroid impacts, high-velocity debris, and thermal cycling represent threats to crew, equipment, and facilities. For decades, local regolith has been suggested as a candidate material {{to use in the}} construction of protective barriers. A thickness of roughly 3 m is sufficient protection from both direct and secondary radiation from cosmic rays and solar protons; this thickness is sufficient to reduce radiation exposure even during solar flares. NASA has previously identified a need for innovations that will support lunar habitats using lightweight structures because the reduction of structural mass translates directly into additional up and down mass capability that would facilitate additional logistics capacity and increased science return for all mission phases. The development of non-pressurized primary structures that have synergy with the development of pressurized structures is also of interest. The use of indigenous or in situ materials is also a well-known and active area of research that could drastically improve the practicality of human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. The Archway for Radiation and Micrometeorite Occurrence Resistance (ARMOR) concept is a new, multifunctional structure that acts as radiation shielding and micrometeorite impact shielding for long-duration lunar surface protection of humans and equipment. ARMOR uses a combination of native regolith and a deployed membrane jacket to yield a multifunctional structure. ARMOR is a robust and modular system that can be autonomously assembled on-site prior to the first human surface arrival. The system provides protection by holding a sufficiently thick (3 m) archshaped shell of local regolith around a central cavity. The regolith is held in shape by an arch-shaped jacket made of strong but deployable material. No regolith processing is required. During the regolith filling process, an inflatable structure under the arch supports the mass of the regolith, but once regolith filling is complete the catenary arch formed by the regolith and the jacket becomes self-supporting and the inflatable can be deflated and removed. When complete, habitat modules and equipment can be moved into the protected <b>cavity</b> under the <b>arch.</b> ARMOR is a nearterm system that would provide a reliable and robust lightweight structure technology to support large lunar habitats, drastically lower launch mass, and improve efficient volume use, reducing launch costs...|$|R
