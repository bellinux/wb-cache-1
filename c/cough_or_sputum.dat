40|$|Respiratory ill-health effects due to {{particulate}} air exposure at different geographical locations in Hong Kong that aggregate individual living locations were estimated based on satellite information. We assessed {{the presence of}} respiratory symptoms of a frequent <b>cough</b> <b>or</b> <b>sputum</b> in school students aged 11 - 20 years old (n= 9, 881). Daily particulate air pollution levels at students' living locations were derived from the surface extinction coefficients measured by satellite and measurements from the air pollutant monitoring stations at ground level. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) [95 % CI] of respiratory symptoms was 1. 047 [1. 005, 1. 091] per 10 g m- 3 increase in PM 10 concentration. Specificity tests showed that adjusted OR of having other symptoms is not significant (p= 0. 20 - 0. 94).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe study aims were {{to assess}} the {{association}} of microflora between the paranasal sinus and the lower airways of children attending a regional paediatric cystic fibrosis centre and to determine the performance of an eradication treatment protocol for positive paranasal sinus samples. MethodPaired nasal lavage and lower airway samples (<b>cough</b> swabs <b>or</b> <b>sputum)</b> were taken from 54 children with cystic fibrosis (median age 11 years). Positive paranasal sinus samples received eradication treatment, using oral and sinonasal nebulised antibiotics. ResultsA correlation between paranasal sinus and lower airways was detected in 33 / 54 paired timed samples (p< 0. 02). Of 4 / 54 children who reported sinus symptoms, only 2 had paranasal sinus positive samples. 28 positive nasal lavage samples cultured 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), 8 Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and 12 other bacterial pathogens. Eradication using sinonasal nebulised antibiotics and oral antibiotics showed a success of 14 / 21 (67 %) treated paranasal sinus positive samples at 1 month & 3 months after treatment. Success rate was 75 % in the PA group and 71 % in the SA group. Ongoing monitoring with nasal lavage will continue. ConclusionThere was agreement between pathogens or lack of them found in the paranasal sinus and lower airways. Paranasal infection is often asymptomatic in children with cystic fibrosis.

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study of Canadian grain elevator workers over a 12 -year period was conducted. Data on respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function tests were collected once every three years {{as part of the}} Grain Dust Medical Surveillance Program started by Labour Canada in 1978; each three-year interval was called a 'cycle'. Of workers who had two or more observations, 1848 subjects (67. 2 %) were free of respiratory symptoms (wheeze, dyspnea, <b>cough</b> <b>or</b> <b>sputum)</b> at the baseline (cycle II). Predictors of first episode of wheezing were examined in these symptoms-free grain workers. Baseline mean age ± SD of the grain workers was 34. 0 ± 11. 4 years and mean duration of work in the industry was 9. 9 ± 8. 7 years. Of the 1848 symptoms-free grain workers at cycle II, 203 (11. 0 %) subsequently reported wheezing during the study. Cox's proportional hazards model for analysis of survival data was used to determine significant predictors of first episode of wheezing. Significant predictors for first episode of wheezing were current smoking (relative risk [RR] 2. 33; 95 % CI 1. 63 to 3. 33; P< 0. 0001) and baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity ratio [RR 0. 02; 95 % CI 0. 003 to 0. 20; P< 0. 0001).

Therefore we investigated the prevalence of acid and non-acid refluxes, and their association with desaturations, in children with chronic pulmonary symptoms. MethodsIn 25 children aged 6 months to 15 years with unexplained chronic <b>cough,</b> wheeze <b>or</b> <b>sputum</b> production, refluxes were assessed by 24 h-multiple intra-esophageal impedance measurements, simultaneous pH metry and continuous recording of oxygen saturation. ResultspH in the proximal and distal esophagus as well as six impedance channels were evaluated in all subjects. A mean of 129. 4 refluxes per day per patient was detected. Complete and technically usable readings of oxygen saturation were obtained in 14 children. In this group the subjects had a mean of 112. 6 refluxes and 92. 6 desaturations per day per patient. The symptom index and symptom sensitivity index for acid refluxes were 34. 7 % and 24. 6 %, respectively, for non-acid refluxes 3. 0 % and 66. 7 %, respectively. ConclusionsWe found a high prevalence of acid reflux and a very low number of non-acid refluxes in this population. The symptom index was negative {{for all types of}} reflux, whereas the symptom sensitivity index was positive for both acid and non-acid reflux. Our data support a relation between acid gastro-esophageal refluxes and chronic pulmonary symptoms; however, this study does not support a role of non-acid reflux in children with respiratory symptoms, which are not on antacid medication...|$|R

40|$|The {{most recent}} update of the {{international}} NHLBI/WHO Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines defines {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) with respect to its pulmonary and extrapulmonary (systemic) components, but does not mention exacerbations in the main definition, even though they are the main cause of medical intervention and admission to hospital in these patients. In the same guidelines, an exacerbation of COPD is separately defined as ‘an event in the natural course of the disease characterised by a change in the patient’s baseline dyspnoea, cough and/or sputum that is beyond normal day-to-day variations, is acute in onset, and may warrant a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD’. The latest GOLD guidelines also provide a classification of the severity of the exacerbations of COPD based on clinical parameters to drive the necessity and the type of antibiotic therapy. Similarly, the latest update of the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) recommendations for the management of COPD defines an exacerbation of COPD as ‘a sustained worsening of dyspnoea, <b>cough</b> <b>or</b> <b>sputum</b> production leading to an increase in the use of maintenance medications and/ or supplementation with additional medications’. The term ‘sustained’ implies a change from baseline lasting 48 h or more. In addition, COPD exacerbations are defined as either purulent or non-purulent on the assumption that this is helpful in predicting the need for antibiotic therapy. Again, in a strict analogy to the latest GOLD guidelines, the CTS update also provides a classification of the severity of purulent exacerbations of COPD, recognising both simple and complicated purulent COPD exacerbations, based on the presence of clinical risk factors that either increase the likelihood of treatment failure or {{are more likely to be}} associated with more virulent or resistant bacterial pathogens. Although both the GOLD and CTS definitions and classifications of the severity of COPD exacerbations may provide a useful practical tool for clinical studies, they have not been formally validated in clinical trials and are rather cumbersome and difficult to use in clinical practice. Other definitions derived from the literature are also used and are discussed below...|$|E
40|$|Abstract__ Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a disease}} which is characterised by airway inflammation and progressive airflow limitation with poor reversibility. Periods of acute deterioration lie in the natural course {{of the disease and}} are called exacerbations. In literature, there are different definitions for an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). A symptom reported AECOPD is defined solely based on a patient’s symptoms. 1 This is regardless of whether the patient seeks medical attention or receives treatment for the exacerbation. An event defined AECOPD requires a therapeutic intervention such as a change in COPD medications or a change in healthcare utilization. Generally accepted is the definition as in the guidelines of the World Health Organization, US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), which define an exacerbation as “an event in the natural course of the disease characterised by a change in the patient’s baseline dyspnoea, <b>cough,</b> and/ <b>or</b> <b>sputum</b> that is beyond normal day-to-day variations, is acute in onset and may warrant a change in regular medication in a patient with COPD”. Frequent exacerbations result in a decreased health related quality of life, a decline in lung function, an increased risk of hospitalization, and an increase in mortality. COPD and acute exacerbations of COPD impose a burden on health care and society. It is estimated that COPD is the 4 th leading cause of death worldwide and will be the 3 rd leading cause of death in 2030. Along with increasing mortality rates the loss in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) will also rise. By 2030 COPD is predicted to be the 5 th leading cause of loss in DALYs globally, where it was only number 13 in 2004. Increasing health care costs will be the consequence of this trend. In the European Union COPD accounts for just over 3...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} factors on which European general practitioners (GPs) base their decisions to admit to hospital patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). METHODS: A survey was carried out from December 1993 to January 1994 to identify factors that affect GPs' decisions to admit to hospital patients with LRTI by collecting data on 2056 patients from 605 GPs in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. RESULTS: Only 93 (4. 5 %) of the patients included in the study were admitted to hospital. Univariate analysis showed that age > 60 years, institutionalisation of the patient, concomitant diseases, cardiac insufficiency, asthma, a diagnosis of pneumonia, and clinical signs such as chest pain, cyanosis, tachypnoea and hypotension significantly (odds ratio (OR) > 2. 0, p < 0. 002) influenced the decision to admit to hospital. No influence could be shown for sex, smoking habits, history of bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis, the presence of fever, chills, myalgia, <b>cough</b> <b>or</b> purulent <b>sputum,</b> and the diagnoses of acute bronchitis, influenza or exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. In the multivariate analysis only the presence of chest pain (OR 2. 3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 5 to 3. 5), cyanosis (OR 4. 1, 95 % CI 2. 4 to 7. 1), dyspnoea (OR 4. 9, 95 % CI 3. 1 to 7. 9), and hypotension (OR 2. 9, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 5. 2), as well as a diagnosis of pneumonia (OR 6. 6, 95 % CI 4. 3 to 10) (all p < 0. 00001) remained as factors that significantly affected the decision to admit to hospital.

30|$|Acute {{bronchitis}} is {{an inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} tracheobronchial system, clinically characterized by <b>cough</b> with <b>or</b> without <b>sputum</b> production. In their New England Journal review Wenzel et al. define: “Acute bronchitis is a clinical term implying a self-limited inflammation of the large airways of the lung that is characterized by cough without pneumonia.”[1]. However, according to the American College of Chest Physician guidelines acute cough {{is also one of}} the main symptoms of common cold: …the clinical syndrome of nasal congestion, nasal discharge, postnasal drip (PND), throat clearing, sneezing, and cough is common to all of these infections.” [2]. It is largely recognized that distinguishing between acute cough due to acute bronchitis and/or common cold is not practicable: “The prevalence of cough due to the common cold is as high as 83  % within the first two days of illness and because the common cold and acute bronchitis share many of the same symptoms the clinical distinction between acute and chronic bronchitis and the common cold is difficult, or at times, impossible to make.”[3]. This problem is well recognized not only in guidelines, but also in clinical papers [4] and RCT reports [5].|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} history of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is punctuated by recurrent episodes of increases in dyspnea, <b>cough,</b> <b>or</b> <b>sputum</b> production named exacer- bations. In addition to increasing COPD-associated morbidity and mortality, exacerbations contribute to loss of lung function and impaired health status in COPD patients (1). Although {{it is often}} assumed that exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation, there is little information {{on the nature of the}} acute-on-chronic inflammation that characterizes these episodes. Most of the data currently available refer to soluble indirect markers of airway inflammation rather than inflammatory cell infiltration per se (2). Infections of the tracheobronchial tree, together with air pollution, are considered the most common causes of COPD exacerbations (1). Whether different patterns of airway inflammation correspond to different etiologies is largely unknown. Better understanding of these relationships and of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms would give the opportunity to identify relevant targets (pathogens and inflammation) for the treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations. Many exacerbations are associated with symptoms of infection of the tracheobron- chial tree, and bacteria have been considered the main infective cause of exacerbations (1). Determining the contribution of bacteria to exacerbations is difficult, as COPD patients are often colonized with bacteria even when clinically stable (3). The proportion of patients with positive bacterial cultures and a high bacterial load increases during exacerbations in most, although not in all, studies (4 – 6). Newer molecular techniques have recently shown that colonization is not a static condition and there is a frequent turnover of different strains of bacteria evoking specific host responses (7). Thus, it is likely that a change in the strain but not the organism may be responsible for the exacerbations. Therefore, previous studies lacking in the molecular characterization of bacterial strains may have missed evidence of a new infection. Indeed, it has been documented that the acquisition of a new strain of colonizing bacteria increases the risk of an exacerbation (8). In the last few decades, the use of highly sensitive diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to evaluate the association between respiratory virus infections and COPD exacerbations has shown that viruses are responsible for a much higher proportion of exacerbations than was previously realized. In a study of the East London COPD cohort, respiratory viruses were detected in 39...|$|E

Hazard ratios (relative to non-smokers) showed increasing hazards for all-cause mortality (light smokers 1 · 28 [95 % CI 1 · 02 – 1 · 62], heavy cigarette smokers 1 · 59 [1 · 13 – 2 · 24], heavy bidi smokers 1 · 56 [1 · 22 – 1 · 98]), cardiovascular events (1 · 45 [1 · 13 – 1 · 84], 1 · 47 [1 · 05 – 2 · 06], 1 · 55 [1 · 17 – 2 · 06], respectively) and respiratory events (1 · 30 [0 · 91 – 1 · 85], 1 · 21 [0 · 70 – 2 · 07], 1 · 73 [1 · 23 – 2 · 45], respectively) across the smoking categories. Interpretation: Bidi smoking is associated with severe baseline respiratory impairment, all-cause mortality, and cardiorespiratory outcomes. Stricter controls and regulation of bidis are needed to reduce the tobacco-related disease burden in south Asia.

MethodA population sample of 2402 Chinese aged ≥ 55 with and without COPD (characteristic symptoms of chronic <b>cough,</b> <b>sputum</b> <b>or</b> breathlessness and airflow obstruction and FEV 1 /FVC< 0. 70) was assessed on Geriatric Depression Scale (score≥ 5), dependence on basic activities of daily living (ADL), SF- 12 health status, smoking and medication behaviour. ResultsThe 189 respondents with COPD showed higher depressive symptoms prevalence (22. 8 %) than 2213 respondents without COPD (12. 4 %); multivariate odd ratio (OR) was 1. 86; 95 % CI, 1. 25 – 2. 75 after controlling for confounding risk factors. In multivariate analyses of respondents with COPD, those who were depressed (N= 43), compared to those who were not (N= 146), {{were more likely to report}} ADL disability (OR= 2. 89, p= 0. 049) poor or fair self-reported health (OR= 3. 35, p= 0. 004), poor SF- 12 PCS scores (OR= 2. 35, p= 0. 041) and SF- 12 MCS scores (OR= 4. 17, p< 0. 001). ConclusionDepressive symptoms were associated with COPD independent of known risk factors.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{respiratory}} {{diseases such}} as asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), and rhinosinusitis are becoming increasingly prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific Burden of Respiratory Diseases study examined the disease and economic burden of AR, asthma, COPD, and rhinosinusitis across the Asia-Pacific and more specifically India. Objectives: To estimate the proportion of adults receiving care for asthma, AR, COPD, and rhinosinusitis and assess the economic burden, both direct and indirect of these chronic respiratory disease. Subjects and Methods: Consecutive participants aged ≥ 18 years with a primary diagnosis of asthma, AR, COPD, or rhinosinusitis were enrolled. Surveys comprising questions about respiratory disease symptoms, healthcare resource utilization, work productivity, and activity impairment were completed by treating physicians and participants during one study visit. Costs, indirect and direct, that contributed to treatment {{for each of the four}} respiratory diseases were calculated. Results: A total of 1000 patients were enrolled. Asthma was the most frequent primary diagnosis followed by AR, COPD, and rhinosinusitis. A total of 335 (33. 5 %) patients were diagnosed with combinations of the four respiratory diseases; the most frequently diagnosed combinations were asthma/AR and rhinosinusitis/AR. <b>Cough</b> <b>or</b> <b>coughing</b> up <b>sputum</b> was the primary reason for the current visit by patients diagnosed with asthma and COPD while AR patients reported a watery, runny nose, and sneezing; patients with rhinosinusitis primarily reported a colored nasal discharge. The mean annual cost per patient was US$ 637 (SD 806). The most significant driver of direct costs was medications. The biggest cost component was productivity loss. Conclusions: Given the ongoing rapid urbanization of India, the frequency of respiratory diseases and their economic burden will continue to rise. Efforts are required to better understand the impact and devise strategies to appropriately allocate resources...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{total of}} 136 patients, 67 HIV, 69 {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) {{with or without}} (±) end-stage renal disease (ESRD), were registered for tuberculosis treatment at the National Tuberculosis Center (NTBC) from May to December, 2003. Ages ranged from 21 - 78 years (median 57. 7 years) in TB/DM patients, and 21 - 62 (mean 37. 6 ± 8. 3 years) in TB/HIV patients. TB was significantly found in younger and single HIV patients, but in older and married DM patients (p< 0. 05). Male patients in both groups were strongly associated with TB, while females more commonly had TB with DM (p< 0. 05). The majority of these patients were Malays, unemployed, and resided in Kuala Lumpur territory; however, {{no statistically significant difference}} was found between the 2 groups. Smoking, IVDUs and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were more significantly found in TB/HIV patients and further analysis showed that pulmonary TB was strongly associated with HCV infection in these patients (p< 0. 05). Pulmonary TB (62; 89. 9 %) was the most common type found in both groups and was a markedly more common disease location in TB/DM patients, while extrapulmonary TB (21; 31. 3 %) and miliary TB (14; 21 %) were significantly higher in TB/HIV patients. <b>Cough</b> with <b>or</b> without <b>sputum,</b> fever and loss of appetite and/or weight were common clinical presentations in both groups. Nevertheless, fever (54; 80. 6 %) and lymphadenopathy (17; 25. 4 %) were significantly related to TB/HIV patients (p< 0. 05). Interestingly, the presence of BCG vaccination and positive tuberculin skin test were stronger in TB/HIV (27; 40. 3 %) and TB/DM (20...|$|R
