25|$|A <b>chromatogram</b> is {{the visual}} {{output of the}} chromatograph. In {{the case of an}} optimal separation, {{different}} peaks or patterns on the <b>chromatogram</b> correspond to different components of the separated mixture.|$|E
25|$|Retention factor (kappa prime) {{measures}} {{how long}} {{a component of the}} mixture stuck to the column, measured by the area under the curve of its peak in a <b>chromatogram</b> (since HPLC chromatograms are a function of time). Each <b>chromatogram</b> peak will have its own retention factor (e.g. kappa1 for the retention factor of the first peak). This factor may be corrected for by the void volume of the column.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} chromatography is {{a powerful}} technology for analyzing the patterns of constituent compounds in complex samples, but matching chromatographic features for comparative analysis across large sample sets is difficult. Various methods have been described for pairwise peak matching between two <b>chromatograms,</b> but the peaks indicated by these pairwise matches commonly are incomplete or inconsistent across many <b>chromatograms.</b> This paper describes a new, automated method for postprocessing the results of pairwise peak matching to address incomplete and inconsistent peak matches and thereby select chromatographic peaks that reliably correspond across many <b>chromatograms.</b> Reliably corresponding peaks can be used both for directly comparing relative compositions across large numbers of samples and for aligning chromatographic data for comprehensive comparative analyses. To select reliable features {{for a set of}} <b>chromatograms,</b> the Consistent Cliques Method (CCM) represents all peaks from all <b>chromatograms</b> and all pairwise pea...|$|R

25|$|Separation factor (alpha) is a {{relative}} comparison on how well two neighboring components of the mixture were separated (i.e. two neighboring bands on a <b>chromatogram).</b> This factor is {{defined in terms of}} a ratio of the retention factors of a pair of neighboring <b>chromatogram</b> peaks, and may also be corrected for by the void volume of the column. The greater the separation factor value is over 1.0, the better the separation, until about 2.0 beyond which an HPLC method is probably not needed for separation.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{types of}} mass {{spectrometry}} data are best {{represented as a}} mass <b>chromatogram.</b> Types of chromatograms include selected ion monitoring (SIM), total ion current (TIC), and selected reaction monitoring (SRM), among many others.|$|E
25|$|Efficiency factor (N) {{practically}} measures how sharp component peaks on the <b>chromatogram</b> are, as {{ratio of}} the component peak's area ("retention time") relative to {{the width of the}} peaks at their widest point (at the baseline). Peaks that are tall, sharp, and relatively narrow indicate that separation method efficiently removed a component from a mixture; high efficiency. Efficiency is very dependent upon the HPLC column and the HPLC method used. Efficiency factor is synonymous with plate number, and the 'number of theoretical plates'.|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} chromatography is {{a powerful}} technology for analyzing the patterns of constituent compounds in complex samples, but matching chromatographic features for comparative analysis across large sample sets is difficult. Various methods have been described for pairwise peak matching between two <b>chromatograms,</b> but the peaks indicated by these pairwise matches commonly are incomplete or inconsistent across many <b>chromatograms.</b> This paper describes a new, automated method for postprocessing the results of pairwise peak matching to address incomplete and inconsistent peak matches and thereby select chromatographic peaks that reliably correspond across many <b>chromatograms.</b> Reliably corresponding peaks can be used both for directly comparing relative compositions across large numbers of samples and for aligning chromatographic data for comprehensive comparative analyses. To select reliable features {{for a set of}} <b>chromatograms,</b> the Consistent Cliques Method (CCM) represents all peaks from all <b>chromatograms</b> and all pairwise peak matches in a graph, finds the maximal cliques, and then combines cliques with shared peaks to extract reliable features. The parameters of CCM are the minimum number of <b>chromatograms</b> with complete pairwise peak matches and the desired number of reliable peaks. A particular threshold for the minimum number of <b>chromatograms</b> with complete pairwise matches ensures that there are no conflicts among the pairwise matches for reliable peaks. Experimental results with samples of complex bio-oils analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) coupled with mass spectrometry (GCxGC−MS) indicate that CCM provides a good foundation for comparative analysis of complex chemical mixtures...|$|R
2500|$|Herb Wagner {{performed}} a cytological investigation in 1954 {{which showed that}} A.×trudellii was a sterile triploid, wherein about 72 chromosomes paired and about 36 remained unpaired. This confirmed its origins as a hybrid between A.montanum and A.pinnatifidum. Because {{the latter is a}} tetraploid hybrid between A.montanum and walking fern (A.rhizophyllum), half of the chromosomes it contributed to A.×trudellii pair with those contributed by A.montanum and half do not. A subsequent chromatographic analysis showed that A.×trudellii produced <b>chromatograms</b> very similar to A.pinnatifidum; these <b>chromatograms</b> contained all the spots seen on A.montanum and A.rhizophyllum <b>chromatograms.</b> (In other words, the <b>chromatograms</b> showed that both A.pinnatifidum and A.×trudellii were descended from A.montanum and A.rhizophyllum, but could not discern the number of chromosomes contributed by each ancestor.) ...|$|R
25|$|Void {{volume is}} the amount of space in a column that is {{occupied}} by solvent. It is the space within the column that is outside of the column's internal packing material. Void volume is measured on a <b>chromatogram</b> as the first component peak detected, which is usually the solvent that was present in the sample mixture; ideally the sample solvent flows through the column without interacting with the column, but is still detectable as distinct from the HPLC solvent. The void volume is used as a correction factor.|$|E
25|$|They are {{analogous}} to the calculation of retention factor for a paper chromatography separation, but describes how well HPLC separates a mixture into two or more components that are detected as peaks (bands) on a <b>chromatogram.</b> The HPLC parameters are the: efficiency factor(N), the retention factor (kappa prime), and the separation factor (alpha). Together the factors are variables in a resolution equation, which describes how well two components' peaks separated or overlapped each other. These parameters are mostly only used for describing HPLC reversed phase and HPLC normal phase separations, since those separations {{tend to be more}} subtle than other HPLC modes (e.g. ion exchange and size exclusion).|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} various {{molecules}} in an oil sample {{can be determined}} by laboratory analysis. The molecules are typically extracted in a solvent, then separated in a gas chromatograph, and finally determined with a suitable detector, such as a flame ionization detector or a mass spectrometer. Due to {{the large number of}} co-eluted hydrocarbons within oil, many cannot be resolved by traditional gas chromatography and typically appear as a hump in the <b>chromatogram.</b> This unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil. Some of the component of oil will mix with water: the water associated fraction of the oil.|$|E

40|$|Gas-liquid {{chromatography}} (GLC) {{was used}} to study normal serum and serum from patients with septicemia caused {{by a variety of}} bacteria and by Candida albicans. The gas <b>chromatograms</b> of seven sera from six patients with septicemia due to C. albicans were found to be significantly and reproducibly different from those of normal sera. <b>Chromatograms</b> of serum from 19 bacteremic patients were indistinguishable from normals. The major peaks present in <b>chromatograms</b> of normal sera were identified by GLC and mass spectroscopy as the methyl esters of palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and stearic acids. In addition to these peaks, serum from patients with candidemia contained abnormal peaks that were also present in cultures of C. albicans grown in normal serum and in washed C. albicans harvested from cultures in yeast nitrogen base broth. <b>Chromatograms</b> from 11 cases of mucosal candidates differed little from normal and were easily distinguished from those of fungemia patients. <b>Chromatograms</b> of serum from two of four patients with deep-invasive candidiasis were indistinguishable from those of fungemia and reverted to normal after infections were eradicated...|$|R

50|$|The {{base peak}} <b>chromatogram</b> {{is similar to}} the TIC <b>chromatogram,</b> however it {{monitors}} only the most intense peak in each spectrum. This means that the base peak <b>chromatogram</b> represents the intensity of the most intense peak at every point in the analysis. Base peak chromatograms often have a cleaner look and thus are more informative than TIC chromatograms because the background is reduced by focusing on a single analyte at every point.|$|E

A.×wherryi showed the same pattern, as it also contains chromosomes from both of those species. A specimen of A.stotleri was subsequently shown to form the same <b>chromatograms</b> as well. This showed that it was not descended to A.pinnatifidum, whose <b>chromatograms</b> contain compounds inherited from walking fern (A.rhizophyllum), and verified that A.stotleri was simply a form of A.bradleyi.

50|$|A mass <b>chromatogram</b> is a {{representation}} of mass spectrometry data as a <b>chromatogram,</b> where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents signal intensity. The source data contains mass information; however, it is not graphically represented in a mass <b>chromatogram</b> in favor of visualizing signal intensity versus time. The most common use of this dat{{a representation}} is when mass spectrometry is {{used in conjunction with}} some form of chromatography, such as in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In this case, the x-axis represents retention time, analogous to any other <b>chromatogram.</b> The y-axis represents signal intensity or relative signal intensity. There are many different types of metrics that this intensity may represent, depending on what information is extracted from each mass spectrum.|$|E
