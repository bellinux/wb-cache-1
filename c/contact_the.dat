30|$|From a {{mathematical}} point of view, <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> {{problem can be}} solved for both wheel-rail and wheel-roller <b>contact</b> according to <b>the</b> following four steps [11, 12]. The {{first step is to}} solve the geometrical problem, in which the locations of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> points on <b>the</b> <b>contacting</b> bodies are determined. This is followed by solving <b>the</b> normal <b>contact</b> problem, in which the shape and size of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch formed in <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> interface due to body deformation and the corresponding pressure distribution over <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch are determined. The third step is to deal with the kinematic problem, in which normalized kinematic quantities, the so-called creepages, are determined. These quantities measure the relative velocities between <b>the</b> <b>contacting</b> bodies at <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> points. In <b>the</b> final step, the tangential problem is solved; this concerns the prediction of tangential stresses at <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> interface which is generated by friction and creepages within <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> zone [11, 13, 14]. All these steps need to be dealt with differently for the case of wheel-roller <b>contact</b> compared to <b>the</b> wheel-rail case, as described in the next section.|$|R
