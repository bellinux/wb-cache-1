The method used is the model AgriPoliS which is a spatial-dynamic agent-based model.

Farms can choose between different investment options during the simulation. Several scenarios with different interest rates for borrowed capital {{on the one hand}} as well as with different levels of <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the other hand are tested and compared. Results show that higher interest rates have less impact on declining production branches than on expanding ones. If they have the possibility farms invest in the most profitable production branch which relative profitability might have changed with high interest rates. <b>Credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> lead farms to choose smaller and cheaper investments than expensive and large ones. Results also show that income losses in both cases due to under-investment compared to the reference situation are partially compensated by lower rental prices. The impacts on structural change also differ depending on the region and the initial situation. In summary, credit subsidies or imperfections on credit markets might have indirect impacts on the type of dominant investment and therefore on the whole regional agricultural sector as well...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe aim of {{the thesis}} has been to provide what is {{probably}} the first extensive written discussion of the operation of housing credit controls, and specifically regulation X. In a sense, the thesis is completely original in that any written matter a bout it is quite sparse, and, again, there may be little really original works in it as almost all the data came from various Government agencies. In order {{to better understand the}} need for the Regulation and the role, in general, of selective credit controls, a background was set up {{in the early part of}} the thesis. This subject in itself could be the basis of an extensive work, but of necessity, had to be made brief; however, it is hoped that it can be seen from this discussion the need for credit control in an economy. Chapter Six, probably, the only really original work in the thesis, is an attempt to illustrate the role building construction has in influencing inflation. Even though the values derived seem rather large, the concept as put forth in the chapter itself is probably quite realistic. Because of the importance of the building industry in the economy, the building cycle is no myth, and when one considers the effect that building did have in the years studied here, the importance of selective <b>credit</b> <b>restriction</b> on housing is further emphasized. The Regulation could not, as originally intended, be studied in itself, as even though it was the basis of building credit restrictions, it was only one aspect in restrictions on housing and a small part of the large net of credit curtailment throughout the economy. Because of its integration in the credit sector, it was necessary to bring a short discussion of other aspects of the general <b>credit</b> <b>restriction</b> program. Even this chapter did not bring in all the measures involved, but it may help to show the extent to which credit was curtailed in the economy. [TRUNCATED...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the key policy instruments {{to be monitored}} {{in order to avoid}} output collapse in the short run for developing countries that come under the IMF-supported adjustment programmes. Changes in exchange rate and aggregate domestic credit are the standard instruments in a Fund-supported policy package used to target balance of payments (BOP) improvement and inflation reduction. Within a small macroeconometric policy-oriented model of India, this paper carries out optimal control exercises to obtain optimal policies for desired targets. The analysis thus carried out indicates that demand contraction based on domestic <b>credit</b> <b>restriction</b> leads to improvement in the BOP and reduction in inflation rather than increased output. This paper suggests using instruments such as credit flow to the private sector on the monetary side, and public spending on basic infrastructure on the fiscal side, so as to make adjustment programmes growth-oriented even in the short term. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} degree to which Colombian firms face <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> that alter their {{investment}} decisions. It analyzes whether the evolution of the financial sector during the 1990 s, characterized by an intense financial liberalization, an increase in size and a deepening of the activity, reduced the <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> faced by firms and stimulated investment. The paper also explores whether, on the contrary, financial restrictions intensified during the recent 1998 - 2000 crisis. The paper provides empirical evidence suggesting that Colombian firms are indeed restricted by external resources and are compelled to resort to internal resources. The paper demonstrates that financial liberalization and the greater credit availability reduced such restrictions, and that the financial crisis had a strong and negative effect on investment and its financing. It compares the behavior of different groups of firms: (i) firms belonging to conglomerates vs. non-conglomerates, and (ii) firms with direct foreign investment vs. domestic firms. It shows that both groups face fewer financial restrictions and that they benefited less from financial liberalization. Finally, the paper evaluates the effects of indebtedness; the results suggest firms acquire debt before investing and/or that the acquired debt in the past serves as a sign of good credit history for the acquisition of new resources. ...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{literature}} has revealed {{the existence of}} some biases {{in the identification of}} the linkage between the supply of credit and aggregate output in periods of financial turbulence. From this perspective, when a banking crisis occurs a contraction of credit offered by banks generally happens, accompanied by a slowdown in economic activity. In these circumstances, there are different directions of causality that explain the coexistence of these two fundamental phenomena, the credit contraction and the economic slowdown. Throughout the analysis of 76 episodes of systemic banking crises, we research for the main determinants and effects which interested with different intensity 54 countries, in terms of <b>credit</b> <b>restriction</b> and economic slowdown. Evidence obtained from the analysis, by considering different components of demand and supply of credit during financial crises, lead us to significant findings, supporting the hypothesis that, under specific circumstances, credit contraction during financial crises is more to be ascribed to the reduction of credit demand from household and enterprises, rather than to a voluntary reduction of credit from banks. ¬© 2012 The Clute Institute...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{the shape of}} relations between banks and firms has had a detectable effect in mitigating the credit contraction that followed Lehman's default in September 2008. Using micro data on a large sample of Italian firms, we analyze the relation between firms' debt concentration and credit availability. We show that firms borrowing from a higher number of banks suffered on average a larger contraction in bank credit and a higher probability of experiencing a reduction in outstanding bank debt. The same results hold for firms diversifying their borrowing, concentrating a smaller proportion with the main bank. The stability of the bank-firm relationship, measured by its duration, also {{appears to have been}} of some value in mitigating the <b>credit</b> <b>restriction.</b> Our results also suggest the existence of a different regime in credit supply towards firms experiencing a reduction in outstanding bank debt. If there is a contraction in credit, the decrease is limited if relations are more intense i. e. a lower number of financial institutions from which the firm borrows, more concentrated lending and relations of greater duration.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the credit market {{to determine whether}} slow growth was caused by problems in credit markets as many scholars have suggested. In particular, {{the question of how}} a rise in interest rates affects behaviors of the banks and the firms, and how and to what extent <b>credit</b> <b>restriction</b> affects sales and growth were investigated. The model developed in the paper suggests that when loan terms are not restricted, lenders will statistically discriminate against small firms. In other words lenders will charge small firms higher interest rates. When loan contract terms are restricted, lenders might ration credit buy not lending to small firms that have higher risks. However, when interest rates are high, large firms might self-select out of the loan markets because they have other alternatives to cope with credit problem. The analysis from Thai data during the financial crisis reveals that Thailand faced mild credit rationing problems before the crises. The problem became stronger, but not severe, during the crises. Trade credit-borrowing ratio and the results from our regression equation suggest that the self-selection problem was more pronounced during the crises. However, even though problems of credit rationing and adverse selection did occur, the importance of trade credits and borrowing on sales declined during the crises...|$|E

The agent exhibits excess sensitivity of consumption to current period income, even for low probabilities of constraints. Because this sensitivity is inversely related to the maturity of debt contracts, the availability of long-term debt contracts reduces the income-sensitivity of consumption.
