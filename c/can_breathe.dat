5|$|The {{coconut crab}} is {{terrestrial}} and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air. They cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they possess a rudimentary set of gills. They <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> {{on land and}} hold their breath underwater. The branchiostegal lungs {{are seen as a}} developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E

5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that the airway is patent so that the patient <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the airway, {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in the airway in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten the airway, so alternative techniques to visualize the airway, such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the artificial airway. Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E

25|$|Beavers do not hibernate, but store {{sticks and}} logs {{in a pile}} in their ponds, eating the underbark. Some of the pile is {{generally}} above water and accumulates snow in the winter. This insulation of snow often keeps the water from freezing {{in and around the}} food pile, providing a location where beavers <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> when outside their lodge.|$|E
25|$|One {{variable}} is differences between fish. Smaller fish consume more oxygen per gram {{of body weight}} than larger fish. Labyrinth fish <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> atmospheric oxygen and do not need as much surface area (however, some of these fish are territorial, and do not appreciate crowding). Barbs also require more surface area than tetras of comparable size.|$|E
25|$|This normal, human embryologic {{development}} is exceptionally important—because the newborn infant breathes through {{his or her}} nose during the first 6 weeks of life—thus, {{when a child is}} afflicted with bilateral choanal atresia, the blockage of the posterior nasal passage, either by abnormal bony tissue or by abnormal soft tissue, emergency remedial action is required to ensure that the child <b>can</b> <b>breathe.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} crab use a {{respiratory}} organ called a branchiostegal lung.

25|$|The {{principle}} behind IWR {{treatment is}} the same as that behind the treatment of DCS in a recompression chamber: an increase in ambient pressure will reduce the volume of the bubbles allowing better blood transport downstream of the bubbles. If the casualty <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> pure oxygen further improvements will occur because the increase in the proportion of oxygen in the blood may keep previously oxygen-starved tissues alive and the oxygen will remove other inert gases from the bubbles making the bubbles smaller.|$|E

25|$|H. littorale <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> {{both with}} gills and through its intestines. However, {{intestinal}} respiration is not exhibited upon hatching, {{and the development}} of the respiratory intestine occurs throughout the juvenile period (up to 32 days old). Newly hatched larvae do not have the ability to breathe air through their intestines; however, it is possible that they absorb oxygen through their skin at this point, before the armor plates have developed. Soon after, between about 1223 days of age, young have the capacity to breathe air, but their respiratory intestine has not finished developing. The respiratory intestine is well-developed between days 24 and 32.|$|E
25|$|During their flight, however, an {{asteroid}} shower forces their spaceship to crash-land on the now-quarantined Earth, near erstwhile Central America. Both of Cypher's legs are broken, {{and the main}} emergency rescue beacon damaged. Cypher instructs Kitai to locate the tail section of the ship, which broke off on entry to the atmosphere. Inside is the backup beacon which they can use to signal Nova Prime. Cypher gives Kitai his weapon, a wrist communicator, and six capsules of a fluid that enhances the oxygen intake so he <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> in Earth's low-oxygen atmosphere. Cypher warns him to avoid the highly evolved fauna and flora, and to beware of violent thermal shifts. Kitai leaves to find the tail section, with Cypher guiding him through the communicator.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{swimming}} {{calls for}} one breath every third arm recovery or every 1.5 cycles, alternating the sides for breathing. Some swimmers instead {{take a breath}} every cycle, i.e., every second arm recovery, breathing always to the same side. Most competition swimmers will breathe every other stroke, or once a cycle, to a preferred side. However some swimmers <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> comfortably to both sides. Sprinters will often breathe a predetermined number of times in an entire race. Elite sprinters will breathe once or even no times during a fifty-metre race. For a one hundred metre race sprinters will often breathe every four strokes, once every two cycles, or will start with every four strokes and finish with every two strokes. In water polo and water rescue, the head is often {{kept out of the}} water completely for better visibility and easier breathing, at the price of a much steeper body position and higher drag.|$|E

25|$|The {{nervous system}} in beetles {{contains}} all the types found in insects, varying between different species. With three thoracic and {{seven or eight}} abdominal ganglia can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure. Oxygen is obtained via a tracheal system. Air enters a series of tubes along the body through openings called spiracles, and is then taken into increasingly finer fibers. Pumping movements of the body force the air through the system. Some species of diving beetles (Dytiscidae) carry a bubble of air with them whenever they dive beneath the water surface. This bubble may be held under the elytra or it may be trapped against the body using specialized hairs. The bubble usually covers one or more spiracles so the insect <b>can</b> <b>breathe</b> air from the bubble while submerged. An air bubble provides an insect with only a short-term supply of oxygen, but thanks to its unique physical properties, oxygen will diffuse into the bubble and displacing the nitrogen, called passive diffusion, however the volume of the bubble eventually diminishes and the beetle will have to return to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Doctor and Ida use {{the lift}} cable {{to explore the}} pit, {{although}} the Doctor finds nothing but darkness far below. He then chooses to detach himself and fall, landing at the bottom thanks to an air cushion and finds that he <b>can</b> <b>breathe.</b> Finding cave paintings depicting the Beast's final battle and imprisonment, the Doctor discovers two jars on pedestals {{a few feet from}} each other as their light reveals the physical form of the Beast. The Doctor quickly deduces from the unintelligible grunts coming from the Beast that its consciousness has already escaped and that Krop Tor was designed as the perfect prison for the Beast: its jailers devised the jars as a failsafe, since their destruction would cause the planet to plunge into the black hole with the body of the Beast destroyed, and the mind killed in the process. Although the Doctor realises he must also sacrifice Rose and the others to destroy the Beast, he smashes the jars anyway on faith in his companion. As the planet falls out of orbit, the Doctor accepts his fate by mocking the Beast, before stumbling across his TARDIS while fleeing the collapsing cave.|$|E
