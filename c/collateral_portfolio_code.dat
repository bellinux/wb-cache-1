40|$|The {{exchange-traded}} funds (ETFs) {{have become}} very popular investment vehicles among individual and institutional investors alike. However, the international agencies, amongst which the IMF and the Financial Stability Board, have warned about the potential instability issues that may arise from ETFs. This thesis contributes {{to our understanding of}} these funds. First, we describe and quantify an overlooked risk behind direct investment into ETFs. Second, we design tools and methodology to improve investment guarantees. Finally, we explore the determinants of ETF investor choices. The first chapter presents a framework to study counterparty risk and provide empirical estimates for a sample of physical and synthetic funds. We find that counterparty risk exposure is higher for swap-based ETFs, but that investors are compensated for bearing this risk. In the second chapter, we theoretically derive the optimal composition of the <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolio</b> that minimizes the counterparty risk exposure of an ETF investor. Furthermore, we find, for a sample of swap-based ETFs, that the counterparty risk exposure is significantly lower with optimal <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolios</b> than with actual <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Finally, we extract, in the third chapter, a novel investor sentiment measure from index option prices.

40|$|Abstract—The {{behaviour}} of {{the efficient}} frontier for CDOs of bespoke portfolios is investigated under one-factor copula marginal distributional assumptions. This {{approach has been}} thoroughly used in statistical literature. The main feature of these models is that default events, conditional on some latent state variable, are independent. This eases the computation of the aggregate loss distribution, a crucial element in credit portfolio optimisation. Both Gaussian and Clayton copula models are applied to the default dependence structure. The Clayton copula model demonstrates superiority in capturing the default dependence inherent in credit portfolios. The portfolio optimisation problem set-up under the newly defined Copula Marginal Expected Tail Loss (abbreviated as CMETL) risk measure is convex and can be easily solved in terms of linear programming algorithms.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} effects of informational asymmetries on corporate finance. Two distinct settings are considered, one empirical and one theoretical. ^ In the first chapter, I show that strong creditor rights facilitate the financing of innovation, using a novel dataset of patent <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Using the random timing of court decisions {{as a source of}} exogenous variation in creditor rights, I show that patenting companies raise more debt financing when they can more credibly pledge their patents as collateral. Consequently, R 2 ̆ 6 D investment and patenting output also increase, as do the technological diversity and average citation count of the patents produced. These findings demonstrate that low leverage in innovative industries is due to information asymmetry, not incentive problems, and that a strengthening of creditor rights alleviates this friction by increasing collateral values. ^ In the second chapter, we identify three new factors that affect the firm 2 ̆ 7 s decision between equity issuance and asset sales in the presence of information asymmetry. First, equity investors own a claim to the capital raised, which mitigates the information asymmetry of the underlying balance sheet (the 2 ̆ 2 certainty effect 2 ̆ 2). Second, firms can disguise the sale of a low-quality asset as instead motivated by dissynergies, and thus receive a higher price (the 2 ̆ 2 camouflage effect 2 ̆ 2). Third, unlike with an equity issuance, a 2 ̆ 2 lemons 2 ̆ 2 discount on assets need not lead to a low stock price, as the asset is not a carbon copy of the firm (the 2 ̆ 2 correlation effect 2 ̆ 2). The findings demonstrate that information asymmetry {{is a function of the}} nature and purpose of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s financing decisions. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an {{enormous}} {{growth in the}} use of securities as collateral. Purchasing securities with borrowed money secured by other securities or cash itself is called [...] "buying on margin". Where A is owed a debt or other obligation by B, A may require B to deliver property rights in securities to A, either at inception (transfer of title) or only in default (non-transfer-of-title institutional). For institutional loans, property rights are not transferred but nevertheless enable A to satisfy its claims in the event that B fails to make good on its obligations to A or otherwise becomes insolvent. Collateral arrangements are divided into two broad categories, namely security interests and outright collateral transfers. Commonly, commercial banks, investment banks, government agencies and other institutional investors such as mutual funds are significant collateral takers as well as providers. In addition, private parties may utilize stocks or other securities as <b>collateral</b> for <b>portfolio</b> loans in securities lending scenarios.|$|R

The objective is to maximize the growth rate of wealth in repeated investments. We find a single-letter characterization of the incremental growth rate (R), the maximum increase in growth rate when V is described to the investor at rate R. The incremental growth rate specialized to the horse race market is related to source coding with side information of Wyner and Ahlswede–Körner. We provide two horse race examples: jointly binary and jointly Gaussian. The initial efficiency 0 (0) is the maximum possible increase in the growth rate per bit of description. We show that the initial efficiency is related to the dependency between V and the market. In particular, for the horse race market, the initial efficiency is the square of the Hirschfeld–Gebelein–Rényi maximal correlation between V and X. This provides a connection with the hypercontraction of the Markov operator of Ahlswede and Gács.

Securities firms, CDO managers, and financial guarantors participated in the development process by originating and underwriting CDOs, selecting <b>collateral</b> and managing <b>portfolios,</b> and providing protection against default, respectively. Meanwhile, rating agencies and audit companies performed oversight governance by providing basic guidelines on collateral content and CDO structure and signing prospectuses, respectively, to ensure that investors (who buy CDOs) are protected (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Nevertheless, rating agencies’ effectiveness in this governance role is considered poor (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011) because of conflicts of interest arising between these agencies and innovators (Mullard, 2012), as well as flaws in the rating models/methodologies used to assess risk and define rating guidelines (Griffin and Tang, 2011). In addition to self-regulation through rating agencies, there was some statutory regulation in the form of guidelines for calculating net capital reserves (to hold against securities portfolios) and the approval of documents (e.g. prospectuses) by various government institutions (e.g. the SEC). However, these occurred just before commercialisation with very little on-site examination (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011).|$|R

Expectation-driven fluctuations and the multiplicity of steady states occur under a positive bubble on bonds, gross substitutability and large input substitution because of credit market imperfections. Focusing on the stabilizing role of policies, we show that a progressive taxation on capital income may rule out expectation-driven fluctuations and the multiplicity of steady states. In contrast, a monetary policy under a Taylor rule has a mitigated stabilizing role, depending on the reactiveness of the policy rule and the concavity of the utility function. When the monetary authority decides instead to fix the nominal interest rate regardless the inflation, decreasing {{the level of the}} nominal interest rate can rule out expectation-driven fluctuations, restore the uniqueness of steady states, but can damage the welfare at the steady state...|$|R

40|$|In a two-country {{portfolio}} {{model with}} leverage constraints, I focus on private assets {{in order to}} understand how their behaviour can justify an expected excess return as well as the flight-to-safety observed in the data. The specific goal is to study how much these phenomena are {{explained by the fact that}} investors cannot always borrow the same amount of resources pledging domestic assets as pledging foreign collateral. Modeling the leverage constraints accordingly, I propose a methodology to deal with this heterogeneous pledgeability and solve for country portfolios. The central feature of this approach is that any idiosyncratic shocks generate an expected excess returns which compensate the current effects of the shock on the relative riskiness of local versus foreign <b>collateral.</b> The resulting <b>portfolio</b> solution shows that, in equilibrium, investors care for this risk and renounce to a part of the expected excess return - favouring current borrowing. The main consequences are: the home equity bias is smaller than in a model where assets are homogeneously pledgeable; the ex post dynamics of the relative premium paid on collateralized assets contribute to the cross-border transmission of shocks. Given these dynamics, idiosyncratic shocks to the pledgeability of local assets affect the value of external claims and liabilities of the country hit by the shock in such a way that its net foreign assets match those observed in the data during times of flight-to-safety. portfolio choice, riskiness of pledged collateral, return di¤erentials, macroeconomic interdependence...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{that started in}} 2007 has seen central banks play an unprecedented role both to ensure financial stability and to support economic activity. While {{the importance of the}} central bank in ensuring financial stability is well known (see e. g. Padoa-Schioppa (2014)), the unprecedented nature of the {{financial crisis}} led central banks to resort to new instruments for which the literature offered little guidance. This thesis aims to bridge this gap, using both theory and data to better understand one of the main instruments used by central banks: collateralized loans. The general contribution of the thesis is thus both retrospective and forward looking. On a retrospective point of view, it helps understanding the actions of the central bank during the crisis and the mechanisms involved. Looking forward, {{a better understanding of the}} tools used during the crisis allows to better inform future policies. The first chapter starts from the observation that the literature, starting with Bagehot (1873), has generally assumed that the central bank should lend against high quality collateral. However in the 2007 - 2013 crisis central banks lent mostly against low quality collateral. In this chapter, we explore when it is efficient for the central bank to relax its collateral policy. In our model, a commercial bank funds projects in the real economy by borrowing against collateral from the interbank market or the central bank. While collateral prevents the bank from shirking (in the spirit of Holmstrom and Tirole (2011)), it is costly to use as its value is lower for investors and the central bank than for the bank. We find that when the bank has high levels of available collateral, it borrows in the interbank market against low collateral requirements so that the collateral policy of the central bank has no impact on banks' borrowing. However, when the amount of available collateral falls below a threshold, the lack of collateral prevents borrowing. In this case, the collateral policy of the central bank can affect lending, and it can therefore be optimal for the central bank to relax its collateral requirements to avoid the credit crunch. The second chapter focuses on collateralized loans in the context of the euro area. According to the literature on optimum currency area, one of the main drawbacks of currency unions is the inability for the central bank to accommodate asymmetric shocks with its interest rate policy. Suppose that there are 2 countries in an economy and one suffers a negative shock while the other has a positive shock. Theory would suggest an accommodative policy - low interest rates - in the first country and a restrictive policy - high interest rates - in the second one. This is however impossible in a currency union because the interest rate must be the same for both countries (Mundell 1961, McKinnon 1963, de Grauwe 2012). In this chapter I show that collateral policy can accommodate asymmetric shocks. I extend the model of collateralized lending of the first chapter to two banks A and B and two collateral types 1 and 2. I also introduce a central bank deposit facility which allows the interest rate instrument to be compared with the collateral policy instrument in the context of a currency area hit by asymmetric shocks. Macroeconomic shocks impact the investment opportunities available to banks and the value of their collateral and the central bank seeks to steer economy rates towards a target level. I show that when banks have different <b>collateral</b> <b>portfolios</b> (as in a monetary union where banks invest in the local economy), an asymmetric shock on the quality and value of their collateral can increase interest rates in the country hit by the negative shock while keeping them unchanged in the country with a positive shock. The third chapter provides an empirical illustration of this “collateral channel” of open market operations. We use data on assets pledged by banks to the ECB from 2009 to 2011 to quantify the “collateral substitution / smoother transmission of monetary policy” trade-off faced by the central bank. We build an empirical model of collateral choice that is similar in spirit to the model on institutional demand for financial assets of Koijen (2014). We show how the haircut of the central bank can affect the relative cost of pledging collateral to the central bank and how this cost can be estimated using the amount of assets pledged by banks. Our model allows to perform a broad set of policy counterfactuals. For example, we use the recovered coefficient to assess how a 5 % haircut increase on all collateral belonging to a specific asset class (e. g. government bonds or ABS) would affect the type of collateral used at the central bank. The final chapter focuses on the use of loans as collateral by banks in the euro area. While collateral is generally viewed as consisting of liquid and safe assets such as government bonds, we show that banks in Europe do use bank loans as collateral. We identify two purposes of bank loan collateral: funding and liquidity purposes. The main distinction between the two purposes is with respect to the maturity of the instruments involved: liquidity purposes refer to the use of bank loans as collateral to obtain short term liquidity and manage unexpected liquidity shocks. In practice the central bank is the main acceptor of these collateral. The second type of use is for funding purposes, in which case bank loans are used as collateral in ABSs or covered bonds. The collateral in these transactions allow banks to obtain a lower long-term funding cost. Doctorat en Sciences économiques et de gestioninfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the individual experiences of four adult literacy practitioners, Anne, Bill, Candy, and Emily, in the first cohort of the Oregon Field-Based Cohort Master's Program. This program, which Oregon established in 1993 as one venue of professional development for adult literacy and English as a Second Language practitioners, was developed jointly by the Office of Community College Services of the state Department of Education and Oregon State University. The inquiry proceeded from three assumptions. First, effective professional development must be grounded in understandings about how practitioners learn. Second, an understanding of practitioners' learning is attainable only through intensive examination of individual experiences. And third, practitioners' accounts of their learning experiences are legitimate sources of knowledge; they are, in fact, the only accessible avenues for investigating individuals' learning. Transcripts of in-depth interviews and participants' cumulative <b>portfolios</b> were <b>coded</b> and analyzed in the first phase of data analysis to produce stories which integrated Anne, Bill, Candy, and Emily's own words with metaphors they created to frame their experiences. Each story reconstructs a practitioner's construction of the emotional, intellectual, and material experience of learning in a cohort. Together, they represent the uniqueness and complexity of adults' learning. In the second phase of analysis, the stories were compared to reveal relationships of similarity and difference among them. The cross-case analysis generated five themes around the self as learner, the contribution of dissonance to reconstruction of meaning, personal transformations in an academic setting, increased confidence as an outcome of graduate study, and stance as a contributor to the variability and complexity of adults' experiences of learning in a formal setting. The final chapter drew directly on the themes to make suggestions for planning and practice and pose questions which might be used to focus conversations or frame future research about adult learning, graduate programs, or staff development for adult educators. Specific topics included authentic learning situations, reflection, graduate cohorts, collaborative learning, adult learners' stances toward learning situations, distance delivery and professional networks for adult literacy practitioners, and evaluation of professional development programs...|$|R
40|$|D. Ed. This {{research}} study {{focuses on the}} status of educators and aims at determining whether In-Service Education and Training (INSET) will assist in enhancing their professional status. From the researcher’s personal experiences, discussions with fellow educators and review of literature and media reports, it appears that there are a plethora of problems experienced by educators. Awareness of a crisis in education is of great concern, as is the low morale of educators. Credibility of educators needs to be restored. Some educators are unqualified, under-qualified, display poor attitude and mediocre behaviour. It is essential that these educators should be encouraged to improve their teaching skills and performance, build confidence, adopt a positive outlook towards education and perform as professionals. The research design and methodology followed generally, the qualitative, descriptive and exploratory principles. The survey method using structured questionnaires was employed to collect the primary data for the study. The data was collected on the Microsoft Windows 2000 Excel programme and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). During the last decade, a number of countries have addressed reform measures and refocused on educators’ professionalism. A historico-comparative study of various models of INSET was undertaken of the following countries: the United Kingdom, Denmark, Hungary, Hong Kong and Zambia. INSET initiatives undertaken abroad, {{to improve the quality of}} educators, is crucial to this study. INSET structures, provided by various stakeholders in South Africa are discussed. The Code of Professional Ethics, compiled by the “guardian of the profession”, the South African Council for Educators (SACE), was outlined. The study also highlights SACE’s role of monitoring educators who are guilty of transgressions and misbehaviour. The findings of this research, conducted in the Umlazi District of the eThekwini Region within the Province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), based on the questionnaires, are twofold. Firstly, officials are of the opinion that a reduction of staff, increase in iii workloads and a lack of incentives and promotional opportunities have led to educators’ poor performance. Secondly, educators believe that implementing quality INSET programmes would assist them to perform as improved professionals. Educators in the study acknowledge that teaching is stressful and are of the opinion that they are accountable for their behaviour and should be au fait with the Professional Code of Conduct and Ethics. Following on from the analysis of the questionnaires, three training programmes were identified and conducted at a public, secondary school. The programmes were entitled: Coping with Stress, Compiling an Educator’s <b>Portfolio</b> and <b>Code</b> of Conduct for Educators. The study concludes with recommendations and implications for future research...|$|R
40|$|Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) is {{the most}} widely used ab initio method in material simulations. It accounts for 75 % of the NERSC allocation time in the material science category. The DFT can be used to calculate the electronic structure, the charge density, the total energy and the atomic forces of a material system. With the advance of the HPC power and new algorithms, DFT can now be used to study thousand atom systems in some limited ways (e. g, a single selfconsistent calculation without atomic relaxation). But there are many problems which either requires much larger systems (e. g, > 100, 000 atoms), or many total energy calculation steps (e. g. for molecular dynamics or atomic relaxations). Examples include: grain boundary, dislocation energies and atomic structures, impurity transport and clustering in semiconductors, nanostructure growth, electronic structures of nanostructures and their internal electric fields. Due to the O(N{sup 3 }) scaling of the conventional DFT algorithms (as implemented in codes like Qbox, Paratec, Petots), these problems are beyond the reach even for petascale computers. As the proposed petascale computers might have millions of processors, new computational paradigms and algorithms are needed to solve the above large scale problems. In particular, O(N) scaling algorithms with parallelization capability up to millions of processors are needed. For a large material science problem, a natural approach to achieve this goal is by divide-and-conquer method: to spatially divide the system into many small pieces, and solve each piece by a small local group of processors. This solves the O(N) scaling and the parallelization problem at the same time. However, the challenge of this approach is for how to divide the system into small pieces and how to patch them up without the trace of the spatial division. Here, we present a linear scaling 3 dimensional fragment (LS 3 DF) method which uses a novel division-patching scheme that cancels out the artificial boundary effects of the spatial division. As a result, the LS 3 DF results are essential the same as the original full system DFT results (with the difference smaller than chemical accuracy and smaller than other numerical uncertainties, e. g, due to numerical grids), while with a required floating point operation thousands of times smaller, and computational time thousands of times shorter, than the conventional DFT method. For example, using a few thousand processors, the LS 3 DF can calculate a > 10, 000 atom system within an hour while the conventional method might take more than a month to finish. The LS 3 DF method is applicable to insulator and semiconductor systems, it covers a current gap in DOE's material science <b>code</b> <b>portfolio</b> for ab initio ultrascale simulation. We will use it here to solve the internal electric field problems for composite nanostructures...|$|R
