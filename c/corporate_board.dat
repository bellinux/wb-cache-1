40|$|We {{document}} positive {{association between}} earnings management and insider selling after the fiscal year-end for Hong Kong firms. This positive association is especially evident before the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Our {{findings suggest that}} Hong Kong executives manage reported earnings to maximize their private benefits from insider selling. Additionally, we find that {{a higher proportion of}} independent directors (INED) on <b>corporate</b> <b>boards</b> moderate the positive association between insider selling and earnings management. Stricter monitoring of earnings management by INED is especially evident when no member of the family with majority ownership is present on <b>corporate</b> <b>boards</b> as a director. This suggests that the presence of family members with majority ownership on <b>corporate</b> <b>boards</b> significantly reduces INED's monitoring effectiveness. Our findings suggest that strict regulations are needed to control insider trading, and independence of <b>corporate</b> <b>boards</b> is important for monitoring of earnings management associated with insider trading. Furthermore, appointment of family members with majority shareholdings should be avoided to enhance independence and to monitor effectiveness of <b>corporate</b> <b>boards.</b> School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R

The act also covers issues such as auditor independence, corporate governance, internal control assessment, and enhanced financial disclosure.

She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours, but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there. The firm considered her a [...] "rainmaker" [...] because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her <b>corporate</b> <b>board</b> connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges. Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.|$|E

TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law. Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it. Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.|$|E

[...] The appointment was most likely at the recommendation of Senator Sherman. [...] The industrialist's work for the railroad was highly praised by its president, Charles Francis Adams; Hanna's knowledge of the coal business led to him being appointed head of one of the board's committees with responsibility in that area. Hanna was a major campaign adviser and fundraiser for Foraker's successful runs for governor in 1885 and 1887.|$|E

[...] In an early case, Landis fined the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company the maximum $4,000 for illegally importing workers, even though Winifred Landis's sister's husband served on the <b>corporate</b> <b>board.</b> In another decision, Landis struck down a challenge to the Interstate Commerce Commission's (ICC) jurisdiction over rebating, a practice banned by the Elkins Act of 1903 in which railroads and favored customers agreed that the customers would pay less than the posted tariff, which by law was to be the same for all shippers. Landis's decision allowed the ICC to take action against railroads which gave rebates.|$|E
