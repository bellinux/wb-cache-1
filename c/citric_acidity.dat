40|$|Black {{mulberry}} (Morus nigra) is a fruit {{not known}} {{only for its}} nutritional qualities and its flavour, but also for its traditional use in natural medicine as it has a high content of active therapeutic compounds. However, this fruit is not widely produced in Spain but some trees are still found growing in the Canary Islands, particularly {{on the edges of}} the ravine. The inhabitants of these islands (Tenerife, La Gomera, La Palma, El Hierro and Lanzarote) collect the fruit and prepare homemade beverages for medicinal purposes. Numerous authors have reported that type II diabetes mellitus can be controlled by taking a mixture containing black mulberry and water. Apart from that, this fruit has been used for the treatment of mouth, tongue and throat inflammations. In this study we present some characteristics of black mulberry juice (TSS, pH, titratable <b>acidity,</b> <b>citric</b> acid, lactic acid, polyphenols, anthocyanins, the potassium etc.) and alcoholic beverages (alcoholic grade, pH, total acidity, volatile acidity, tannins, phenols etc.) obtained from black mulberry.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of FAO camel project, 22 {{lactating}} camels were monitored for their milk production and composition all over one year. The analyses involved each milking daily for the entire herd and individually once a week. A part of this milk being used for cheese making, the analyses included also whey. The analyses were performed with automatic milk analyzer FOSS-FT 1 calibrated for camel milk. The analyzed parameters were fat, protein, lactose, density, total solids, total non-fat, <b>citric</b> acid, <b>acidity,</b> freezing point and free fatty acids. The individual milk production is recorded by a lactocorder© measuring the total milk flow at the milking time. On average, fat, protein and lactose contents in mixed daily milk were 2. 91 ± 0. 69, 2. 66 ± 0. 20 and 4. 33 ± 0. 28 g/ 100 g respectively while {{the composition of the}} whey was 1. 04 ± 0. 27, 0. 56 ± 0. 07 and 4. 28 ± 0. 18 g/ 100 g for fat, protein and lactose respectively. The pasteurization did not change significantly the main composition. The between-camel variability was high with range of 1. 8 to 3. 75 g/ 100 g for fat, 2. 21 and 3. 26 g/ 100 g for protein and of 3. 31 to 5. 01 g/ 100 g for lactose. A seasonal effect was observed in fat variability contrary to protein and lactose. The higher fat values were reported at winter season, i. e at the end and {{at the beginning of the}} lactation stage. The daily milk yield was 5. 42 ± 2. 71 l with a mean range of 1. 12 to 8. 07 l/day according to the camel. The maximum registered at the peak of lactation was 16. 4 l. Experiments are in course to increase the production and fat and protein contents. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study {{interactions}} between agronomic variables and chemical composition that determine {{the quality of}} tomato fruits, a group of statistical techniques were applied: discriminant analysis (DA), cluster analysis (CA) and princepal component analysis (PCA) combined with ANOVA. The results of DA when characterizing the agronomic parameters were successful, especially when the collection date {{was used as a}} factor for classification. CA showed the importance of the chemical variables related to the metabolic relationships, while the principal component analysis and ANOVA provide information on the interaction between variables related to the production and chemical composition of tomatoes. The combined use of PCA and ANOVA is a suitable tool for studying the complex interactions between agronomy and chemical composition. Collection date was the main agronomic parameter effected the chemical composition, while variety and production system had a minor effect. The application of PCAANOVA showed that the taste of tomato depends on three factors: sugars (glucose and fructose), <b>acidity</b> (<b>citric,</b> malic and ascobirc acids), and minerals (Na and Mg). For the tomatoes with same maturity degree, the taste depends on interaction of date collection and system production...|$|R
40|$|Sensorial {{attributes}} such as color, texture, acidity {{and nutritional}} composition are essential quality components for blackberry (Rubus spp.). The mineral content {{and quality of}} fruits of different blackberry cultivars produced in Lavras, Southern Minas Gerais, in a tropical climate at an elevation (Cwb, according to Köppen) were analyzed. The analyzed minerals were phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and iron (Fe). Additionally, chemical characteristics, the total <b>acidity</b> (<b>citric</b> acid), pH, soluble solids (°Brix) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) level, and sensory characteristics, color (L*a*b) and firmness (N) were also evaluated. According to the results, the Choctaw and Xavante blackberry cultivars demonstrated the highest mineral contents, the Caingangue cultivar showed the highest soluble solid content, and the Ebano cultivar exhibited the highest vitamin C concentration and firmer fruits. The chemical variables in {{the fruits of the}} different blackberry cultivars presented little significant correlation with the contents of macrominerals present, whereas the opposite was obtained for the micronutrients. However, the chemical characteristics combined with the nutritional characteristics can be proposed as an excellent tool for the selection of cultivars of superior quality and high nutritional value. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} ionizing radiation on the taste function in patients submitted to radiotherapy {{in the head and}} neck region. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients diagnosed with head and neck tumors and undergoing treatment in the Division of Radiotherapy at Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, were selected. For their taste function testing, four solutions were manipulated with salt (NaCl), sugar (sucrose), <b>citric</b> acid (for <b>acidity),</b> and urea (for bitterness), at three different (low, medium and high) concentrations. Weekly tests were performed during the first three weeks of radiotherapy, with random administration of the solutions (three drops each) respecting the order of their concentration levels (low, medium and high). After the application of each solution, the patient reported which flavor he/she tasted. Results: A statistically significant difference was observed in the loss of taste function as the results in the 1 st and 4 th weeks of treatment were compared, with salty solution at the three concentration levels, with the sweet solution at low and medium concentrations, and with the sour and bitter solutions, only at low concentration. Conclusion: Ionizing radiation alters the taste function of patients submitted to head and neck radiotherapy. © Colégio Brasileiro de Radiologia e Diagnóstico por Imagem...|$|R
40|$|The diel, {{intracellular}} fluxes of malate {{across the}} tonoplast are a crucial feature of crassulacean acid metabolism. Nocturnally accumulated malate exits the vacuole during daytime and decarboxylation liberates CO 2 for subsequent processing into organic carbohydrates via Rubisco. It is of vital importance that the decarboxylation reactions {{keep up with}} malate efflux from the vacuole to prevent over-acidification of the cytoplasm, which has recently been showed to induce chlorenchyma cell death and leaf necrosis. Although the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) has been found an important determinant of organic acid remobilization out of the vacuole, the precise mechanisms and their interaction with environmental parameters, responsible for this export process are still matter of conjecture. Therefore the influences of light on malate processing were investigated in more detail in the obligate crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) bromeliad Aechmea ‘Maya’. Besides continuous light and dark treatments plants were provided with different low fluence monochromatic light treatments (10 μmol m- 2 s- 1) such as blue (470 nm), green (530 nm), red (630 and 660 nm) and far red (735 nm). Determinations of malic and <b>citric</b> acid, titratable <b>acidities,</b> cell sap pH and cell sap osmolalities were performed to shed more light on the intracellular movements of malate. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} develop {{processed}} products from guapple. Characterization of the guapple fruit was intially conducted before proceeding to formulation studies. The following characteristics of the guapple fruit were observed: color of outer skin - yellow green with Munsell notation of 10 Y 7 / 6, color of inner flesh - off white with Munsell notation of 7. 5 Y 8 / 2; texture, 20. 4 - 37. 1 mm; average weight per piece, from 219 to 420 gms; ph, 3. 7; titrable <b>acidity</b> (<b>citric</b> acid), 0. 34 %, and soluble solids, 2. 6 ° Brix. The identified processed products from guapple were puree, pickles, and preserves. Standardized processes and formulations {{for each of these}} products were developed in semi-pilot scale. Removal of the skin for the guapple preserves and pickles was facilitated using 5 % brine-l % CaCI 2. Suitable packaging materials were also identified. Flexible films were used for guapple puree while glass jars and flexible films were found to be satisfactory both for guapple pickles and preserves. Physico-chemical, microbiological, and sensory evaluation were done after two months of storage.

The modifying sourness effect on the lemon by miracle fruits was carried out by sensory evaluation with the 5 -point scoring method by 12 trained panelists. The lemon became significantly less sour and sweeter after eating the miracle fruit. However, the effect of modifying sourness was weakened after 2 hours. Using methods of coating with edible film, modified atmosphere storage, treatments with ascorbic acid and 1 -methylcyclopropene to get the best storage condition of miracle fruit was studied. Coating the miracle fruit with the edible film resulted in the increase of the rotten rate. The storage stability of miracle fruit treated with ascorbic acid was less good than the control. The modified atmosphere storage could not delay the decline in the protein content of miracle fruits. Among these four methods, the effect of 1 -MCP treatment was better than other methods for delaying the quality decay of miracle fruits. The miracle fruit was further treated with 0, 1, 5, 10 ppm 1 -MCP and stored at 7 ℃ and 25 ℃. The rotten rate of miracle fruits with all treatments stored at 25 ℃ was higher than that of fruits stored at 7 ℃. The physicochemical qualities of fruit stored at 25 ℃were better than the fruit stored at 7 ℃expect the moisture content. Treatment with 1 -MCP delayed the decay and reduced the rotten rate of miracle fruits, and was better when stored at 25 ℃. 10 ppm 1 -MCP was the most effective concentration among the four treatments. The best storage condition of miracle fruit found in this study was to treat the fruit with 10 ppm 1 -MCP and stored at 25 ℃. It could be stored for 16 days. For market surveying, 387 valid samples were collected. 58. 91 % consumers knew miracle fruit before the survey and the main source was from TV, friends and newspaper. 69. 01 % consumers liked miracle fruit while 30. 21 % consumers disliked but accepted miracle fruit. Only 0. 78 % consumers disliked and unaccepted miracle fruit because they couldn't feel the change of sweetness and sourness of the lemon after eating the miracle fruit. 57. 92 % consumers felt that the rational price of miracle fruit should be lower than 25 dollars per each and 12. 21 % consumers felt price may be higher than 51 dollars. Most consumers thought that the factors of degree of fresh, nutritional composition, residues of pesticides and government''''''''s authentication were more important than the attractive of packaging. After factor analysis, the factors of purchase consideration could be simplified as quality and information of miracle fruits. 本研究以神祕果為試驗材料，進行一般成分分析、酸味修飾效果及其貯藏安定性之研究，以及進行消費者對神秘果之消費行為調查，以了解消費者對神秘果的看法。測定結果，神秘果之Hunter L、a、b、水分、粗蛋白、粗脂肪、灰分、可溶性固形物、還原糖、可滴定酸度、檸檬酸、酒石酸、蘋果酸、抗壞血酸及鈉含量分別為 30. 87 ± 2. 76 、 36. 74 ± 7. 04 、 5. 87 ± 2. 59 、 75. 20 ± 2. 84 %、 12. 29 ± 1. 49 %、 0. 27 ± 0. 08 %， 0. 70 ± 0. 04 %、 10. 73 ± 2. 07 oBrix、 164. 16 ± 6. 77 mg/g、 2. 77 ± 0. 16 %、 1881. 95 ± 102. 68 mg/ 100 g、 461. 09 ± 55. 04 mg/ 100 g、 383. 52 ± 29. 02 mg/ 100 g、 38. 25 ± 5. 84 mg/ 100 g以及 0. 25 ± 0. 12 mg/ 100 g。 採用五分評分法並以 12 位試驗分析型品評員進行酸味修飾效果持續時間的探討。結果發現食用神秘果確實會降低檸檬的酸味及提升甜味，但 2 小時後味覺修飾效果會減弱。 在神秘果延長貯藏期限方法之探討，以包覆可食性薄膜、調氣包裝、抗壞血酸處理及 1 -甲基環丙烯處理分別測試。可食性薄膜包覆後會提高神秘果腐爛率，抗壞血酸處理的神祕果貯藏安定性不如控制組的樣品，低溫下進行調氣貯藏也無法有效延緩蛋白質之降低，而 1 -MCP處理樣品是四種試驗方法中最能延緩成份劣變的方法。 進一步以 0 、 1 、 5 、 10 ppm 1 -MCP處理神秘果後貯藏在 7 及 25 ℃下定期分析其物化品質，結果發現所有貯藏在 25 ℃下神秘果的腐爛率均比 7 ℃高，但除水分含量外的各項物化分析值則均優於貯藏在 7 ℃的樣品。使用 1 -MCP處理的神秘果可延緩各物化分析值的改變，並降低腐爛率，且貯藏在 25 ℃下的效果比 7 ℃明顯，四個 1 -MCP濃度以 10 ppm最佳。綜合以上結果，保存神秘果最佳條件為使用 10 ppm 1 -MCP處理後貯藏在 25 ℃下，貯藏壽命可達 16 天之久。 以 387 份有效樣本研究消費者對神秘果的消費行為分析之結果， 58. 91 ％的消費者知道神秘果，消息來源最主要是電視、朋友介紹及報紙。喜歡神秘果的消費者有 69. 01 ％，不喜歡但可接受的消費者有 30. 21 ％，不喜歡也不接受的消費者只有 0. 78 ％。此類不接受神秘果的消費者在食用神秘果後感覺不到檸檬甜味上升及酸味下降的改變，可能是造成他們不接受神秘果的原因。有 57. 92 ％的消費者認為神秘果合理價錢應低於 25 元/顆，只有 12. 21 ％的消費者認為價格可以高於 51 元/顆。大多數的消費者較重視神秘果的新鮮程度、營養成分、農藥殘留及政府認證因素，對包裝精美因素較不重視。消費者購買考量因素經因素分析後可以將因素簡化為神秘果品質及神秘果資訊。中文摘要……………………………………………………………… Ⅳ 英文摘要……………………………………………………………… Ⅵ 圖次…………………………………………………………………… Ⅸ 表次…………………………………………………………………… Ⅹ 壹、緒言………………………………………………. ……………… 1 貳、文獻整理…………………………………………. ……………… 3 一、神秘果簡介………………………………………… [...] …. … [...] 3 （一）神秘果樹生物學特性………………………………. 3 （二）神秘果素的生理活性………………………………. 4 （三）神秘果素的萃取、分離與純化……………………. 4 （四）神秘果素的結構……………………………………. 5 （五）神秘果素的作用機制………………………………. 6 二、乙烯與水果採收後之生理…… [...] . ……………. …………… 7 （一）果實採收後之生理…………………………………. 7 1. 呼吸作用……………………………………… [...] . 7 2. 蒸散作用……………………………………… [...] . 11 3. 果實之化學變化……………………………… [...] . 12 4. 乙烯之影響…………………………………… [...] . 12 （二）乙烯在高等植物體內的生合成路徑及訊息傳送途徑…………………………………………………… 13 1. 乙烯在高等植物體內的生合成路徑………… [...] . 13 2. 乙烯在高等植物體內的訊息傳遞途徑……… [...] . 14 三、水果保鮮技術………………. ……… [...] . ……………………. 18 （一）低溫貯藏……………………………………………. 18 （二）添加物浸漬處理……………………………………. 18 （三）調氣貯藏……………………………………………. 19 （四） 1 -MCP處理…………… [...] . …………………………. 20 1. 1 -MCP之發展… [...] ……………………………… 20 2. 影響 1 -MCP處理之因素 [...] … [...] …………………. 20 3. 1 -MCP處理對果實的影響 [...] . 23 四、消費者行為研究……………………………………………. 26 （一）消費者行為模式……………………………. ………. 26 （二）消費者決策過程…………………………………… [...] 27 （三）市場調查……………………………………………. 31 五、感官品評……………………………………………………. 32 （一）感官品評之定義……………………………………. 32 （二）感官品評之方法…………………………………… [...] 32 1. 消費者型試驗………………………………… [...] . 33 2. 試驗分析型試驗……………………………… [...] . 33 （三）定量描述分析(QDA) ……………………………… [...] 34 參、材料與方法………………………. ……………………………… 36 一、試驗材料………………………. …………………………… 36 （一）原料…………………………. ……………………… 36 （二）試藥…………………………. ……………………… 36 （三）包裝材質……………………………………………. 37 二、試驗設計……………………………………………………. 37 （一）一般成分分析………………………………………. 37 （二）神秘果儲藏期間成分變化與品質特性之探討 [...] . 38 （三）消費者行為調查 [...] . 38 三、試驗方法…………………………………. ………………… 39 （一）神秘果前處理………………………. ……………… 39 （二）物理化學特性分析……………. …………………… 41 1. 外觀色澤測定………………………………… [...] . 41 2. 水分含量測定………………………………… [...] . 41 3. 可溶性固形物測定…………………………… [...] 47 4. 可滴定酸度測定……………………………… [...] . 47 5. 蛋白質含量測定……………………………… [...] . 47 6. 粗蛋白含量測定……………………………… [...] . 47 7. 粗脂肪測定…………………………………… [...] . 48 8. 總還原醣含量測定…………………………… [...] . 49 9. 有機酸測定…………………………………… [...] . 49 （三）感官品評分析………………………………………. 50 1. 試驗分析型品評……………………………… [...] . 50 2. 消費者品評…………………………………… [...] . 50 （四）統計分析……………………………………………. 50 肆、結果與討論………………………………………………………. 52 一、神秘果一般成分分析及酸味修飾效果持續時間之探討……………………………………………………………. 52 （一）神秘果一般成分分析………………………………. 52 （二）酸味修飾效果持續時間之探討……………………. 53 二、神秘果於貯藏期間主要成分變化及最適貯藏條件之探討……………………………………………………………. 58 （一）可食性薄膜包覆試驗…………………… [...] …… [...] 58 （二）調氣貯藏試驗…………………………… [...] . 59 （三）抗壞血酸處理試驗…………………………… [...] . 69 （四） 1 -MCP處理試驗…………………………………… 70 （五）不同 1 -MCP濃度處理貯藏試驗……………… [...] …. 70 1. 腐爛率………………… [...] ………………………. 73 2. 貯藏期間主要成分變化…. ……………………. 73 （ 1 ）可溶性固形物……………………………… [...] . 76 （ 2 ）外觀色澤……………………………… [...] . 77 （ 3 ）水分含量………………………………… [...] 81 （ 4 ）可滴定酸度……………………………… [...] . 85 （ 5 ）蛋白質含量……………………………… [...] . 86 （六）最適貯藏條件之探討……………………………… 91 三、消費者對神秘果喜好性及消費行為之探討 [...] . ……………. 92 （一）有效樣本敘述統計分析 [...] . ……………………… [...] . 92 1. 人口統計變數………………………………… [...] . 92 2. 消費者對神秘果認知分析…………………… [...] . 93 3. 消費者購買神秘果考量因素重視度分析…… [...] . 99 （二）消費行為特性之探討 [...] ………………………. 99 1. 感官品評 [...] ……………………………. 99 2. 消費者購買考量因素分析 [...] ……………… [...] . 101 3. 因素分析 [...] ……………………………… [...] . 107 伍、結論……………………………………………………………… 115 陸、致謝……………………………………………………………… 119 柒、參考文獻…………………………………………………………. 120 附件一………………………………………………………… [...] 131 附件二………………………………………………………… [...] 132 附件三………………………………………………………………… 13...|$|R
