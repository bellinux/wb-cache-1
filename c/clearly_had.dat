5|$|Brazilian meteorologists {{named the}} storm Catarina for its {{proximity}} to (and eventual landfall near) the state of Santa Catarina, although government forecasters initially denied that the storm, which <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> an open eye and various other tropical morphologies, was a hurricane at all. More {{than a year after}} the storm made landfall, Brazilian meteorologists finally classified the storm as a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} of Victory of Faith, Hitler had stood {{side by side with}} the leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA) Ernst Röhm, a man with whom he <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> a close working relationship. Rohm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders a short time later during the purge of the SA {{referred}} to as the Night of the Long Knives. It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E
5|$|An armed {{reconnaissance}} by twelve Wellingtons on 14 December resulted in five being lost as the formation, {{at very low}} level because of the low cloud base, was heavily engaged by both fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery. The RAF believed {{that none of the}} lost Wellingtons had been shot down by fighters, however, and so maintained faith in their defensive capabilities when flown in tight formations. This summation was odd considering the evidence available. The Luftwaffe claimed five bombers for the loss of one fighter while none of the German FlaK units claimed a victory. Several of the returning RAF bombers <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> small arms damage from machine gun rounds, making the summation of the RAF that FlaK did the damage highly suspect.|$|E

5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> more than one manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction seems to come closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of the story {{on the part of the}} revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the earlier version, which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Irataba's family relations, except {{for the name of}} his son Tekse thume, and his nephews Qolho qorau (Irataba's sister's son who succeeded him as leader) and Aspamekelyeho. Olive Oatman, who lived with the Mohave for five years, later stated that Irataba was the brother of the former chief, presumably Cairook, with whom Irataba <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> a close relation. One anecdotal {{description}} states that Irataba had several wives, among them a Hualapai woman who had been taken as a captive and who is also described as having a young son. He also had at least one daughter, the mother of his granddaughter Tcatc who was interviewed in the 1950s. She stated that Irataba had wanted to leave his land deeds and medals to his brother's sons, but that they were eventually lost.|$|E
5|$|Needing to win {{the match}} to prevent an Australian series victory, England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. England {{continued}} to rearrange their team, making three changes {{in an attempt to}} find a combination that could challenge Australia, which made two changes forced by injury. Unlike the preceding Tests, England's openers were able to withstand the Australian new ball attack, and the partnership of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook put on 168 for the opening stand. Washbrook fell for 143 in the last over of the day, but England <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> the better of the play, ending at 268/2 by stumps. Australia's bowlers were heavily criticised for their performance, which was seen as lethargic. The next day, England continued to amass runs, with Australia appearing unthreatening and unable to dislodge Bill Edrich and nightwatchman Alec Bedser, who batted until mid-afternoon. Bedser and Edrich then fell in quick succession for 79 and 111 respectively as England then collapsed and lost 8/73 to be all out for 496 late in the day. The hosts were heavily criticised for the collapse, which was largely due to unforced errors. Among the Australian bowlers, the wickets were shared. Australia then reached 63/1 in reply at stumps on day two.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Brogden was {{chairman}} of the Solway Junction Railway so they <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> a substantial stake in that railway but their precise involvement is not clear. For this railway the Act of Parliament was passed in 1864 and the railway was opened in 1869 (goods only) and 1870 (goods and passengers). James Brunlees, previously noted, was the engineer. It was a failure in the long run because the cast iron viaduct could not withstand the ice-floes which were a regular feature of the winters here.|$|E

25|$|As {{to whether}} the Deakins line or Michler line was the correct meridan, Justice Day conceded that the Michler line more truly {{reflected}} {{the intent of the}} land grant to Lord Baltimore. But Day also noted that maps in that era were inaccurate at best, and little surveying of the land had been done. The location of the Fairfax Stone, however, was known and <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> been referred to as a boundary marker by both states. Indeed, the constitution of Maryland even referred to it as such.|$|E
25|$|John Dickson became {{in effect}} {{the driving force}} of the Dulas Valley Mineral Railway, and he saw that the line would only reach its {{potential}} if it extended at each end. In the1863 session of Parliament, therefore, the company promoted a Swansea and Neath and Brecon Railway. Swansea docks were as yet undeveloped but <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> much greater potential than Neath. Extension north-eastward to Brecon would connect there with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway, itself connecting with a chain of other lines reaching to Hereford and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Factional {{conflict}} dominated Iranian economic politics {{under the}} Ayatollah Khomeini from 1979 to 1989. The two principal factions were a statist-reformist group that favored state {{control of the}} economy and a conservative group that favored the private sector. Both factions claimed Khomeini's support, but by 1987, he <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> sided with the statist-reformists because he believed state capitalism to be the best way of heading off any threat to Islam. Khomeini's death on 3 June 1989 left the factions without their source of legitimation.|$|E

He was elected Abbot of Shrewsbury in August, after the king had been imprisoned by Henry IV, which suggests he was suspected of Lancastrian sympathies. His efforts to mediate before the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 were in vain but he brought great prestige to the abbey as Chancellor of Oxford University. However, even he seems to have lived under the cloud of an accusation of felony.|$|E

Born into a wealthy family, Blanche {{grew up as}} the apple of her father's eye on a plantation outside of Atlanta, Georgia, prior to her relocation to Miami, where she lived with her husband, George, until his death. Their marriage produced six children; two daughters: Janet and Rebecca; and four sons: Doug, Biff, Skippy, and Matthew.

He captained New Zealand's team for three years, with only two Test wins in 18 attempts in what was a difficult tenure as New Zealand struggled to find a replacement for the retired Richard Hadlee and suffered the decline in power of their only world class batsman, Martin Crowe.|$|E

25|$|Dave Bresnahan was {{catching}} for the 1987 Williamsport Bills, {{who were in}} seventh place in an eight-team league, playing the last-place Reading Phillies in late-August game. With a runner on third base, Bresnahan switched catcher's mitts {{and put on a}} glove in which he had secreted a shaved-down potato. When the pitch came in, Bresnahan fired the white potato down the third-base line, enticing the runner to sprint home. Bresnahan then tagged the runner with the baseball, prompting the umpire to award the runner home plate for Bresnahan's deception, even though he <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> been tagged out with the ball.|$|E
25|$|In this {{monograph}} {{they identified}} characteristic fossils of different rock layers {{that they used}} to analyze the geological column, the ordered layers of sedimentary rock, of the Paris basin. They concluded that the layers had been laid down over an extended period during which there <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> been faunal succession and that the area had been submerged under sea water at times and at other times under fresh water. Along with William Smith's work during the same period on a geological map of England, which also used characteristic fossils and the principle of faunal succession to correlate layers of sedimentary rock, the monograph helped establish the scientific discipline of stratigraphy. It was a major development in the history of paleontology and the history of geology.|$|E
25|$|The Free Church of Scotland was a Scottish {{denomination}} {{which was}} formed in 1843 by a large withdrawal from the established Church of Scotland in a schism or division known as the Disruption of 1843. In 1900 {{the vast majority of}} the Free Church of Scotland joined with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland (which itself mostly re-united with the Church of Scotland in 1929). The House of Lords judged that the minority continuing after the 1900 union were entitled to all the assets. While the denomination <b>clearly</b> <b>had</b> a starting date, in their own eyes their leaders had a legitimate claim to an unbroken succession of leaders going all the way back to the Apostles.|$|E
