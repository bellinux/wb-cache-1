Elasto-plastic static analysis of <b>core</b> <b>walls</b> are be realized {{by the program}} CANNY based on the theory of fiber model. Compared with the tests, Results from the simulation anlysis match well with those from the tests. The influence of axial compression ratio and height-width ratio on the bearing capacity and deformation of <b>core</b> <b>walls</b> are analyzed systemically. It is shown that the fiber model is available and successful for the numerical simulation of <b>core</b> <b>walls.</b> The axial compression ratio has distinct affect on the elastic and inelastic behavior of RC <b>core</b> <b>walls.</b> The ratio of height to width not only has effect on the bearing capacity and deformation performance, but also changes the failure mode of RC <b>core</b> <b>walls.</b> The numerical results confirmed the accuracy of this analysis procedure in representing the nonlinear behavior of <b>core</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R

40|$|The use of wide column frame {{analogy to}} analyse coupled wall/frame {{structures}} has been popular for many years. However, since shear deformation {{of the walls}} has not been appropriately considered, the existing frame methods are not applicable to those cases where shear deformation is significant: e. g. <b>core</b> <b>walls</b> subjected to torsion. This problem is studied and {{it is found that}} the shear deformation of the walls should be allowed for in the rigid arms rather than in the column elements which model the wall units. Based on this finding, the frame method is extended to analyse all kinds of coupled wall/frame structures, including partially or completely closed <b>core</b> <b>walls</b> subjected to torsion, and walls subjected to concentrated vertical loads. A new solid wall element incorporating rigid arms that are deformable in shear, with rotational degrees of freedom and with shear deformation taken into account, is developed. The accuracy and versatility of the proposed methods are demonstrated by comparing them with other theoretical and experimental results. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Nuclear gas-core-reactor rockets {{can provide}} much higher {{specific}} impulse than solid core nuclear rockets because their temperature limitations {{are in the}} nozzle and <b>core</b> <b>wall</b> structural temperatures, which are distanced from the hottest regions of the gas core. Consequently, nuclear gas core reactors can provide much higher temperatures to the propellant. Solid core nuclear thermal rockets can develop higher specific impulse than conventional chemical rockets due to the low molecular weight of a hydrogen propellant, but their operating temperatures are limited by the maximum temperature of the solid core because the reactor's temperatures cannot rise above its components' lowest melting temperature.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{common problem}} faced by {{engineers}} nowadays is the restriction on structural member dimensions due to architectural and spatial concerns. Such restrictions {{have resulted in}} the use of high strength concrete in vertical members to reduce sizes, the use of central <b>core</b> <b>walls</b> and peripheral columns to increase window areas, and the use of prestressed floors to increase spans, to name a few. Serviceability problems (e. g. cracking) may, however, arise in the long term. This paper in turn addresses two major issues associated with buildings. Firstly, the differential axial shortening between <b>core</b> <b>walls</b> and columns caused by large differences in stress levels induces additional stresses and strains in horizontal structural members, which are not normally accounted for by traditional design methods. Secondly, the post-tensioning of concrete floors gives rise to additional internal forces induced by several meams such as sequential construction, and secondary “P-δ” effects of the high-strength slender columns. As {{it is almost impossible to}} eliminate these secondary effects completely, a series of studies have been carried out to examine their effects on the structural design of these buildings...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of spray drying conditions on the chemical and biological properties of Morinda citrifolia L. powder.

50|$|The {{shape of}} the fissile gas core can be either cylindrical, toroidal, or counter flow toroidal. Since there are issues {{regarding}} the loss of fissile fuel with the cylindrical and toroidal designs, the counter-flow toroidal gas core geometry is {{the primary source of}} research. The counter flow toroid is the most promising because it has the best stability and theoretically prevents mixing of the fissile fuel and propellant more effectively than the aforementioned concepts. In this design, the fissile fuel is kept mostly in a base injection stabilized recirculation bubble by hydrodynamic confinement. Most designs utilize a cylindrical gas <b>core</b> <b>wall</b> for ease of modeling. However, previous cold flow tests have shown that hydrodynamic containment is more easily achieved with a spherical internal wall geometry design.|$|E
40|$|Precast {{prestressed}} {{hollow core}} units {{are commonly used}} {{in the construction of}} the flooring system in precast buildings. These units without transverse reinforcement bars are designed to resist seismic loading as replacement for fixed-base precast wall panels in the construction of warehouse buildings. Thus, this research seeks to investigate the seismic performance of the units constructed as a subassemblage (single wall) subjected to biaxial loading and as a superassemblage (multi-panel) subjected to quasi-static lateral loading. A design procedure for warehouse building using precast hollow <b>core</b> <b>walls</b> under Damage Avoidance Design (DAD) is proposed. In addition, a risk assessment under Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) is evaluated using the latest computational tool known as Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). A comparative risk assessment between precast hollow <b>core</b> <b>walls</b> and fixed-base monolithic precast wall panels is also performed. Experimental results demonstrate that rocking precast hollow <b>core</b> <b>walls</b> with steelarmouring do not suffer any non-structural damage up to 2. 0 % drift and minor structural damage at 4. 0 % drift. Results revealed that the wall with unbonded fuse-bars and 50 % initial prestressing of unbonded tendons performed the best compared with other types of energy dissipators. Furthermore, 12 mm diameter of fuse-bar is recommended as there is no uplifting of the foundation beam during ground shaking. Hence, this type of energy dissipator is used for the construction of seismic wall panels in warehouse buildings. One of the significant findings is that the capacity reduction factor (Ã˜) which relates to global uncertainty of seismic performance is approximately equal to 0. 6. This value can be used to estimate the 90 th percentile of the structures without performing IDA. Therefore, the structural engineers are only required to compute Rapid-IDA curve along with the proposed design procedure...|$|R

The development of 50- to 60-story buildings became more feasible and efficient because the lighter framing reduced construction time and expense, and allowed for large, column-free spans, giving architects greater freedom in exterior expression. In the early 1960s, Cohen's adaptation of the concrete cooling tower design to high-rise offices required a change in the way the unions worked.
