50|$|The {{implementation}} of environmental certification is expensive, {{the burden of}} which is usually felt by the supplier rather than the retailer who must pay for the <b>certification</b> <b>fees</b> and the increased cost of production.

40|$|An {{analytical}} framework where {{consumers are}} imperfectly {{informed about the}} safety of products is used to investigate the welfare effects of a public certification system. Several <b>certification</b> <b>fees</b> under alternative structures of certification cost are analyzed. By maintaining competition among numerous sellers, voluntary certification financed by a per-unit fee is efficient (and sufficient) to signal product safety. However, mandatory certification linked with a fixed user fee may be necessary if a seller wields monopoly power. Further, certification by a single, private agency results in a distorted fee.

50|$|There are {{complaints}} that the standards relating to paying of price premiums, minimum prices, provision of credit, etc. by importers in rich countries are not enforced. In particular importers can demand {{to get a}} higher quality at the same official Fairtrade price, or withhold other services, threatening to buy from another Fairtrade supplier if the exporter did not agree to this kickback, or if the supplier complains that a kickback is demanded. De Janvry, McIntosh and Sadoulet have quantified this for {{a large group of}} Fairtrade coffee cooperatives in South America over a dozen years. They found that this kickback was 10c a pound over a period when the official price premium was 5c or 10c a pound, and this, plus the <b>certification</b> <b>fee,</b> meant that the cooperatives made a loss in years when a premium was payable, and were paid substantially less than the official minimum prices in years when a minimum price was payable. These should have been identified and rectified by the certification agency.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{markets in}} which consumers do not directly observe {{the quality of}} the products but form their expectations about the quality based on the outcome of voluntary imperfect certification. I analyze how the <b>certification</b> <b>fee</b> impacts the decisions of the producers to apply for a certificate and whether to supply goods of required quality. I find that there are both separating (only high quality producers apply and obtain the certificate) and pooling (both high and low-quality producers apply and obtain) equilibria. I show that the pooling equilibrium exists when the <b>certification</b> <b>fee</b> is low, while the separating equilibrium requires high certification fees. Since the pooling equilibrium is not welfare optimal, excessive competition between certifiers, which lowers the <b>certification</b> <b>fee,</b> is not beneficial. This result complements Strausz (2005) who shows that high certification fees are required to prevent the corruption of the certifier.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a simple theory of segmentation and fee-setting in certification markets. The {{basis for the}} theory is that certifiers offer differentiated tests; for a given object it is more difficult to pass the test of certifier i than the test of certifier j. Given the test standards, certifiers compete for customers via their fee-setting. Segmentation occurs in equilibrium: sellers with low unobservable quality self-select to an easy test and sellers with high unobservable quality self-select to a hard test. Moreover, sellers choosing an easy test pay a lower (endogenous) <b>certification</b> <b>fee</b> than sellers choosing a hard test. These results are consistent with evidence from the market for auditors and other markets, not readily explained by existing theories. ...|$|E

40|$|I compare {{certification}} and self-regulation, two widely used quality assurance mechanisms in markets where consumers do not observe {{the quality of}} goods. Certification is a mechanism in which an external firm oers a certificate to producers who undergo a testing procedure, issues the certificate if they meet the certifier's standards and collects the <b>certification</b> <b>fee.</b> Self-regulation is a mechanism in which a club of firms in the industry adhere (or not) to a self-imposed code of conduct and benefit from the club's reputation. I show that if the testing technology is perfect and costless, the choice of standards and fees by the certifying organization (CO) is welfare inferior, while the self-regulatory organization (SRO) chooses a welfare optimal fee, and I identify conditions under which the SRO also chooses optimal standards. If the testing technology is costly and imperfect, this result is not necessarily valid and depends on the dierence between {{the costs of the}} testing technology available to the CO and SRO.

30|$|Financial support {{usually takes}} the form of area {{payments}} that can be differentiated by crops and regions, depending on the policy objectives (Michelsen et al. 2001). These subsidies are paid for each hectare that is cultivated organically (indicators 11 and 13). The introduction of area payment triggers the initial growth of the organic sector (indicator 10). Area payments for organic farming are co-financed by the EU via the funding of CAP and the higher the payment support, the more profitable organic farming becomes, and the larger the rate of growth (Dabbert et al. 2004). Other forms of financial support, such as reimbursement of <b>certification</b> <b>fees</b> or guaranteed loans, are particularly relevant in the CEEC where most farmers survive on very low profit margins (indicators 15 – 17) (Prazan et al. 2004). Furthermore, financial support should involve research and development because this is what trigger innovations in any market domain and makes it competitive (indicators 18 and 25) (EU 2004).|$|R
