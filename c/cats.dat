5|$|A {{pedigreed cat}} is one whose ancestry is {{recorded}} by a cat fancier organization. A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals {{of the same}} breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred <b>cats</b> are exhibited as show <b>cats.</b> <b>Cats</b> of unrecorded, mixed ancestry {{are referred to as}} domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired <b>cats,</b> by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-cats.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of health {{problems}} may affect <b>cats,</b> including infectious diseases, parasites, injuries, and chronic disease.

5|$|According to a myth in many cultures, <b>cats</b> have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness <b>cats</b> exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling <b>cats</b> often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, <b>cats</b> can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E
5|$|Among {{domestic}} <b>cats,</b> {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral <b>cats,</b> the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic <b>cats</b> is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female <b>cats</b> also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cats</b> {{have a high}} {{breeding}} rate. Under controlled breeding, {{they can}} be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet <b>cats</b> by neutering, {{as well as the}} abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral <b>cats</b> worldwide, requiring population control. In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to the extinction of many bird species. <b>Cats</b> have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and {{may have contributed to the}} extinction of isolated island populations. <b>Cats</b> are thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds, and the presence of feral and free-ranging <b>cats</b> makes some otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cats</b> {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how <b>cats</b> were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed <b>cats</b> {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; <b>cats</b> generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that <b>cats</b> were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cats</b> hunt small prey, {{primarily}} {{birds and}} rodents, {{and are often}} used {{as a form of}} pest control. Domestic <b>cats</b> are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.4–3.7 billion birds and 6.9–20.7 billion mammals annually. The bulk of predation in the United States is done by 80 million feral and stray <b>cats.</b> Effective measures to reduce this population are elusive, meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts. In the case of free-ranging pets, equipping <b>cats</b> with bells and not letting them out at night will reduce wildlife predation.|$|E
5|$|Domestic <b>cats,</b> {{especially}} young kittens, {{are known for}} their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. <b>Cats</b> also engage in play fighting, {{with each other and with}} humans. This behavior may be a way for <b>cats</b> to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we sought to}} {{elucidate}} {{the contribution of the}} Cryptococcus neoformans catalase gene family to antioxidant defense. We employed bioinformatics techniques to identify four members of the C. neoformans catalase gene family and created mutants lacking single or multiple catalase genes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, <b>CAT</b> 1 and <b>CAT</b> 3 encode putative spore-specific catalases, <b>CAT</b> 2 encodes a putative peroxisomal catalase, and <b>CAT</b> 4 encodes a putative cytosolic catalase. Only <b>Cat</b> 1 exhibited detectable biochemical activity in vitro, and <b>Cat</b> 1 activity was constitutive in the yeast form of this organism. Although they were predicted to be important in spores, neither <b>CAT</b> 1 nor <b>CAT</b> 3 was essential for mating or spore viability. Consistent with previous studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the single (<b>cat</b> 1, <b>cat</b> 2, <b>cat</b> 3, and <b>cat</b> 4) and quadruple (<b>cat</b> 1 <b>cat</b> 2 <b>cat</b> 3 <b>cat</b> 4) catalase mutant strains exhibited no oxidative-stress phenotypes under conditions in which either exogenous or endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species were elevated. In addition, {{there were no significant differences}} in the mean times to mortality between groups of mice infected with C. neoformans catalase mutant strains (the <b>cat</b> 1 and <b>cat</b> 1 <b>cat</b> 2 <b>cat</b> 3 <b>cat</b> 4 mutants) and those infected with wild-type strain H 99. We conclude from the results of this study that C. neoformans possesses a robust antioxidant system, composed of functionally overlapping and compensatory components that provide protection against endogenous and exogenous oxidative stresses...|$|R

5|$|Feral <b>cats</b> are {{domestic}} <b>cats</b> {{that were}} born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral <b>cats</b> is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60million. Feral <b>cats</b> may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with <b>cats</b> {{at some of these}} sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Free-fed feral <b>cats</b> {{and house}} <b>cats</b> tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. <b>Cats</b> use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with <b>cats</b> waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E
5|$|However, some pet <b>cats</b> {{are poorly}} socialized. In particular, older <b>cats</b> may show {{aggressiveness}} towards newly arrived kittens, which may include biting and scratching; {{this type of}} behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.|$|E

5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to <b>cats.</b> For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal.

40|$|PCK 1 {{encoding}} {{phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase}} is transcriptionally regulated by two upstream activating elements. By screening for mutants {{that failed to}} derepress a UAS 2 PCK 1 -CYC 1 -lacZ reporter gene we isolated the new recessive derepression mutation <b>cat</b> 5. The <b>CAT</b> 5 gene encodes a protein of 272 amino acids showing a 42 % identity to the ZC 395. 2 gene product of Caenorhabditis elegans whose function is unknown. Deletion of <b>CAT</b> 5 caused a complete loss of glucose derepression affecting gluconeogenic key enzymes. Respiration, but not mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity, was also affected. <b>CAT</b> 5 expression is 5 - to 6 -fold repressed by glucose, and <b>CAT</b> 5 transcriptional activation was dependent on <b>CAT</b> 1 (SNF 1), <b>CAT</b> 8 and <b>CAT</b> 5 itself. The <b>CAT</b> 5 gene is necessary for UAS 1 PCK 1 and UAS 2 PCK 1 protein binding since a carbon source-specific interaction was no longer detectable in <b>cat</b> 5 mutants. Glucose derepression of gluconeogenesis depends on the active <b>Cat</b> 1 (Snf 1) protein kinase and the <b>Cat</b> 8 zinc cluster activator. Mig 1 p-independent overexpression of <b>CAT</b> 8 did not stimulate activation of gluconeogenic promoters in <b>cat</b> 1 and in <b>cat</b> 5 mutants. Since <b>Cat</b> 8 p multicopy expression suppresses the ethanol growth deficiency in <b>cat</b> 1 (snf 1) mutants, {{these results indicate that}} activation of <b>Cat</b> 8 p by the <b>Cat</b> 1 p (Snf 1 p) kinase and the <b>Cat</b> 5 p protein might be necessary for release from glucose repression...|$|R

5|$|On {{the return}} journey, the Clan <b>cats</b> decide, after {{consultation}} with Midnight, {{to go through}} a mountain range which they had avoided in their initial travels. There, they meet a Clan-like group of <b>cats</b> called the Tribe of Rushing Water, who have their own set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe takes the traveling <b>cats</b> in and gives them food and shelter. The Clan <b>cats</b> discover that the Tribe <b>cats</b> have a prophecy: a silver cat will save them from Sharptooth, a savage lion-like creature that has been killing many members of the Tribe.

5|$|Owing to {{the close}} {{similarity}} between play and hunting, <b>cats</b> prefer {{to play with}} objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become habituated) in a toy they have played with before. <b>Cats</b> also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry. String is often used as a toy, {{but if it is}} eaten, it can become caught {{at the base of the}} cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. Owing to the risks posed by <b>cats</b> eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which <b>cats</b> may chase.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral <b>cats</b> vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the <b>cats</b> are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these <b>cats</b> may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these <b>cats</b> throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
