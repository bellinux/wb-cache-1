40|$|Hot {{cracking}} in welding {{is still}} an unresolved problem {{for a wide range}} of materials that restricts their use in production. Although free <b>cutting</b> <b>steels</b> are a prominent example of hot cracking sensitivity, other industrially important materials like high strength aluminium alloys, many austenitic steel grades and several high-temperature alloys are also prone to hot cracking. In all cases the actual forming of a hot crack is not only the consequence of metallurgical reasons but also of special thermomechanical conditions, namely too much tensile strain on the not fully solidified regions. Therefore it is not only possible to avoid the cracks by avoiding the mentioned metallurgical reasons, but also by reducing or counteracting any stress / strain on the hot-cracking critical zones. As the latter approach is much less discussed in the literature and only seldom pursued industrial application research, this article wants to emphasize its importance by introducing a new technique against hot cracks on this basis. A new process technique is presented which aims at reducing or avoiding hot cracking during laser welding. It is based on a tailored temperature field around the molten pool that changes the thermomechanical conditions of the material during the solidification of the weld. The required additional volumetric heat input is realized by inductive heating. The technique was tested successfully on strongly hot cracking sensitive heat treatable free <b>cutting</b> <b>steels.</b> The results of these tests show not only the relation between possible thermal and mechanical influences on the cracking intensity but also give important information about the possibilities and limits of the technique. Typical application areas are presented. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R

50|$|The {{blades of}} both planes and chisels are {{distinguished}} by the hollow, ura in their flat side. This hollow portion {{has a number}} of functions. The primary function is that it ensures a high degree of flatness when sharpening, in that when the flat side is polished it cannot rock or develop a curve because it is only contacting the stone on either side of its width. This then improves the precision with which cuts can be made by the chisel, {{and in the case of}} planes ensures smooth contact with the wedge and therefore even support across the full width of its blade. The hollow also greatly reduces the amount of metal needed to be removed to achieve flatness on the back of the blade, which shortens initial set-up and subsequent re-sharpening considerably. Secondly, in the case of chisels, it reduces the frictional resistance as the chisel is driven into or extracted from the wood. Thirdly, the interaction of the leading edge of the hollow with the edge of the blade is a changing relationship as the tool is re-sharpened. With plane blades, as the edge is sharpened down to the rim of the hollow, the edge can then be 'tapped-out' (ura-dashi), a process where a pointed hammer is used to depress the ha-gane downward slightly along the bevel of the blade. When the blade's back is re-flattened after ura-dashi, the hollow is re-established; thus the hollow acts as a sort of gauge for sharpening as a means of prolonging the life of the thin piece of <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> as long as possible. This in turn tends to keep the geometry of the blade consistent over time,which keeps it fitting the dai over time.|$|E
