Gorczyński’s and Johansson-Ringleb’s formulae were used to derive the <b>continentality</b> <b>index.</b> The study also looked at the annual patterns of air temperature amplitude (A), a component of both of these formulae, and D; {{the difference between the}} average temperatures of autumn (Sep. -Nov.) and spring (Mar. -May). Records of six weather stations representing the climate of Central Europe were included in the study covering the period 1775 - 2012 (Potsdam, Drezden, Prague, Vienna, Krakow, Debrecen). The highest <b>continentality</b> <b>index</b> was found in Debrecen and the lowest in Potsdam.

Averages of annual rainfall and extreme values of low temperatures in winter and high temperatures in summer were used to characterize the climate of each district according to its <b>continentality</b> <b>index</b> and bioclimatic zone. A geographic information system and a local indicator of spatial association were used to summarize the spatial properties of VL distribution. Poisson spatial regression was performed to study the relationship between VL incidence rates and climatic parameters. We identified one hot-spot region of 35 inland districts located mostly in the semi-arid bioclimatic zone and two cold-spots located in coastal regions of the northeastern sub-humid zone and the southeastern arid zone.

40|$|The large landmass of {{northern}} Russia {{has the potential}} to influence global climate through amplification of climate change. Reconstructing the climate in this region over millennial timescales is crucial for understanding the processes that affect the climate system. Chironomids, preserved in lake sediments, have the potential to produce high resolution, low error, quantitative summer air temperature reconstructions. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of modern surface sediments from 100 high-latitude lakes, located in northern European Russia to central Siberia, showed chironomid distribution was primarily driven by July air temperatures. The strong relationship enabled the development of chironomid-inference model based on 81 lake and 89 taxa to reconstruct July air temperature. Analysis of a range of chironomid-inferred temperature model suggest the best to be a two component weighted averaging and partial least squares (WA-PLS model) with r 2 jack = 0. 92 and RMSEP = 0. 89 °C. Comparison of species responses to July temperature with the Norwegian training set showed the temperature optima of individual species was 1 - 3 °C in the Russian data regardless of modelling technique. This suggests that chironomid-based inference models should only be applied to sediment cores collected within the geographic source area of the training set. The differing responses between the Norwegian and Russian faunas {{led to the development of}} a 149 lake, 120 taxa chironomid-continentality inference model. The 2 -component WA-PLS model was the minimal adequate model with r 2 jack = 0. 73 and RMSEP = 9. 9. Recent warming in the Arctic has been spatial and seasonal heterogeneous; in many areas warming is more pronounced in the spring and autumn leading to a lengthening of the summer, while summer temperatures have remained relatively stable. A continentality model {{has the potential to}} detect these seasonal changes in climate. The Russian inference model also improves the representation of a number of taxa, such as Corynocera oliveri-type, Constempellina and Paracladius, which frequently occur in subfossil assemblages from arctic Russian lakes, but are poorly represented in European training sets. These are cold-adapted taxa and their absence from the training sets could lead to overestimations of July temperatures in fossil samples where these taxa form a major component (for example see Andreev et al. 2005). Comparison of reconstructed July air temperatures and <b>continentality</b> <b>indices</b> from a tundra lake in north-east European Russia showed close agreement with local instrumental records over the past 70 years and suggests the models may produce reliable estimates of past climate...|$|R

The basic object of research comprised 60 stands of the studied species, located mainly in the northern and western parts of Poland. The growth results for the studied species, evaluated on the basis of the average height (hg 55), were compared with data describing the local climate and the stand location within the botani-cal and climatic zoning. The results confirm the opinion that the Japanese larch prefers a climate of maritime character and generally shows high degree of flexibility regarding its climatic requirements (very large differ-ences between the growth conditions in the studied area and the country of origin).

In order to characterize the climates of the region of Bahía de Banderas (BB) Mexico, we adopted a methodology that combines the use of the Köppen climate classification modified by Garc. a for Mexico and methods of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We used simple regression between temperature (dependent variable) and height as independent variable. Multiple regressions were applied for rainfall (dependent variable) and geographical data as independent variables (thermal <b>continentality,</b> thermopluviometric <b>index</b> and slope). The temperature and precipitation data were obtained from the Comisión Nacional del Agua, and ERIC III, 2006 database. Information from geographical variables was obtained from a Digital Elevation Model and Gorzynski’s <b>Index</b> of <b>Continentality.</b> The coefficients of simple and multiple regressions were used to construct digital maps of annual temperature and precipitation via GIS. With these maps and using the CCK-EG tool, we generated the final map of climatic characterization. The result was highly representative.

Radiation use efficiency (RUE), optimum temperature (Topt), and leaf area index at emergence (LAIini) were generally ranked as first, second and third most relevant parameters.

LAIini resulted not relevant by the Morris method), or site-continentality pattern (e. g. with intermediate continentality in Spain, LAIini and Topt were second and third ranked; with low continentality in Portugal, RUE was outranked by Topt). Low s values associated with the most relevant parameters indicated limited parameter interactions. The importance of sensitivity analyses by exploring location × climate combinations is discussed as pre-requisite to evaluate either novel crop modelling approaches or the {{application of}} known modelling solutions to conditions not explored previously.

The digitally mapped results were used to 1) assess the relative redistribution of isobioclimates and their magnitude of change, 2) quantify the loss of isobioclimates into the future, 3) identify and locate novel isobioclimates projected to appear, and 4) explore compositional change in vegetation types among analog isobioclimate patches. This study used downscaled climate variables to map the isobioclimates at a fine spatial resolution - 270 m grid cells. Common to both models of future climate was a large change in thermotype. Changes in ombrotype differed among the two models. The end of 20 (th) century climatology has 83 isobioclimates covering the 63, 000 km(2) study area. In both future projections 51 of those isobioclimates disappear over 40, 000 km(2). The ordination of vegetation-bioclimate relationships shows very strong correlation of Rivas-Martinez indices with vegetation distribution and composition. Comparisons of vegetation composition among analog patches suggest that vegetation change will be a local rearrangement of species already in place rather than one requiring long distance dispersal. The digitally mapped results facilitate comparison with other Mediterranean regions. Major remaining challenges include predicting vegetation composition of novel isobioclimates and developing metrics to compare differences in climate space...|$|R

The analysis was based on biomass data in 1236 sample plots as well as both NPP and biomass estimates in 480 sample plots that were established in mixed spruce and fir stands. Data were available for the entire Eurasian territory from the UK to South China and Japan, and included information on both total biomass and various biomass components. The climatic conditions of the sampled forests were characterized by using specific indices of zonality and continentality.

40|$|Le problème de la sédimentation des barrages en Algérie est connu dans {{le monde}} de par de son importance. Devant cet état de fait la mesure de l'envasement des barrages présente un intérêt certain pour la {{quantification}} des sédiments et l'exploitation des ouvrages. L'objectif de cette étude est de contribuer à la quantification de l'alluvionnement afin de mieux cerner le dimensionnement des ouvrages hydrotechniques, d'accroître leur durée de vie et de réduire les coûts de réalisation. L'étude porte sur un échantillon de dix neuf barrages algériens situés dans des bassins versants répartis sur l'ensemble du territoire. Une première réflexion a conduit à identifier la diversité des caractéristiques hydromorphométriques (indice d'altitude, densité de drainage, indice de pente, coefficient d'écoulement, [...] .) et climatiques (sub-humide, semi-aride, aride). L'évaluation des volumes des sédiments à partir des mesures topo-bathymétriques effectuées à deux dates différentes montre une perte dans la capacité initiale, soit 44 % de perte en volume total, qui arrive à la limite de la durée de vie pour certains barrages. Ces derniers résultats ont été exploités dans l'objectif de mettre au point un modèle simple d'évaluation du débit solide accumulé dans les cuvettes des barrages algériens. A partir de cette réflexion, nous avons cherché, graphiquement, les liens préférentiels entre la sédimentation, la superficie et les différents facteurs hydromorphométriques. On distingue trois facteurs déterminants : la superficie, l'indice d'altitude et le coefficient d'écoulement. Ces derniers paramètres ont permis de mettre au point un abaque de classification en fonction de la continentalité et le contexte géographique. Cette taxonomie a été confirmée par l'analyse en composantes principales des données hydromorphométriques des systèmes étudiés. Deposition of sediments reduces available water reserves by 2 to 5 % {{annually in the}} man-made reservoirs of the Maghreb countries. The sedimentation problem in the reservoirs in Algeria is known in the world because of its great importance. Measurement of reservoir siltation is important for quantifying deposits and {{for the management of}} the hydraulic structures. The A. N. R. H. (Agence Nationale des Ressources Hydrauliques) first attempted to monitor sediment loads by measuring the transport of suspended particles (solids) at hydrometric stations in a punctual and irregular manner (draw-off by section without measuring the flow velocity), but the real value of a stream's sediment load is not necessarily well reflected by point sampling (TOUAT, 1989; TOUAT 1991). Therefore, small experimental drainage basins (several hectares in surface area) were equipped to study sedimentation in the hydraulic structures solely by slope erosion (RAMDANE, 1989). The specific rate of erosion in catchment areas in northern Algeria is the highest in the Maghreb. Often it is over 2000 T/km_/year in the majority of the Tellian Altas basins, and it reaches 4000 T/km_/year in the Dahra coastal catchments. These latter values are {{among the highest in the}} world (DERI and HUSSON, 1976; HEUSCH, 1970). Variation of sediment transport across the wetted cross section was demonstrated by gauging the suspended particles transport (Tss). Measurement of the transport of bed material is not reliable, and often it is estimated as a percentage of the Tss. The aim of the present study was to improve sedimentation estimates in order to define proper hydrotechnical structures and to increase their lifetime (reducing the costs). Firstly, we consider information stemming from the topo-bathymetric processing of 19 reservoirs in Algeria. From the temporal point of view, the information is not homogeneous (not synchronous) but has the advantage of integrating all the types of sediments (suspended sediments, bed-load, bank erosion, deposits). The first analysis involved the topo-bathymetric survey of basins done by the A. N. B. (Agence Nationale des Barrages) (DERI, 1977; SOGREAH and A. N. R. H., 1989) whose data were used as the basis for the calibration of our models. These latter data then allow one to predict the lifetime of recent reservoirs. Calibration consists of defining the most influential hydroclimatic or physico-geographic factors affecting the abrasion rate. We therefore considered 19 Algerian reservoirs located on basins distributed over a large part of the country. A first analysis led to the identification of the variability of the hydromorphometric (elevation index, drainage density, slope index, flow coefficient, etc.) and the climatic (subhumid, semiarid, arid) characteristics of the studied sample. The evolution of the volumes of sediments from two topo-bathymetric measurements, which were carried out on two different dates, shows a variation between 0. 017 Mm 3 /year and 2. 490 Mm 3 /year. This sedimentation resulted in a loss of initial capacity, which caused the termination of life for some reservoirs. The initial capacity of the 19 considered reservoirs was about 1900 Mm 3; it was reduced to 1070 Mm 3 in 1986. This constitutes a loss of 44 % of the initial volume. These latter results were exploited with the aim of setting up a simple model for estimating sedimentation and classifying the Algerian reservoirs. To this end, we graphed the preferential links between sedimentation, surface area, and the different hydromorphometric factors. Three determining factors were identified: the surface of drainage basin, the elevation index and the flow coefficient. These latter parameters allowed a spatial partitioning of the examined sample into three groups relating to the <b>continentality</b> (elevation <b>index)</b> and to the geographical context: class Ia represents the catchment basins of the high plateau zone (hard and semiarid climate, a low abrasion rate); class Ib corresponds to an intermediate position (with a moderate physico- geographic characteristic, the cross between two climates: semiarid and subhumid); and class II shows the coastal drainage basins that are influenced by the subhumid climate (an important abrasion rate). Essentially, sedimentation within the hydraulic structures depends on the precipitation, the surface area of the catchment, the inflow (flow coefficient) and the relief (elevation index). In order to validate these first results, we further analyzed the data table corresponding to the hydromorphometric factors and the abrasion rates. The study of such a data table is generally carried out by interpreting the information by means of multidimensional statistical methods (principal components analysis, factorial discriminant analysis, factorial correspondence analysis, etc.). These descriptive methods, which disregard part of the initial information, yield an explanation of the structure of the data table in terms of hydrokinematics (ROLET and SEGUIN, 1986 a and b). Principal components analysis, based on multivariate analysis, implies a mode of deductive reasoning (MUDRY, 1991). Application of this approach showed the presence of sub- groups, based on hydromorphometric criteria, which resembled those obtained earlier in the graphical analysis. This method also corroborated the formulated observations in the classification analysis (graphical analysis). Calibration of the mathematic functions, based on the minimization of errors by the least squares method, on the data series of "abrasion rate surface" according to the observed data of deposits, showed a significant correlation between the observed and calculated values of the abrasion rate. These latter models did not integrate all the determining factors, but they can be useful for predicting the lifetime of recent reservoirs. These last tasks complete the results obtained from the previous models based on the classification (graphical, principal components analysis) and reveal great efficient means. To validate our models, we extended our application to the other sites presenting neighbouring conditions. We then inserted in our abacus the deposition values for seven Tunisian reservoirs and sixteen Moroccan reservoirs. The three countries (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco) are situated in the same physico-geographical conditions. The Tunisian and Moroccan reservoirs behave similarly to those in Algeria and present a high abrasion rate. Another task is the application of the taxonomy already defined (classification abacus model) to recent reservoirs to determine their lifetime. Regarding the obtained results, it turns out that the reservoirs that have a short calculated lifetime must be fitted out first, and a specific protocol for their exploitation must be established. Finally, we can imagine the use of our abacus to include the bathymetric results of the reservoirs in order to analyze the evolution of the abrasion rate in small catchment areas. It is suggested that further investigation be undertaken in order to better understand the hierarchical organization of the factors that govern sedimentation in the Maghreb...|$|R
40|$|Erosive storm {{energy is}} the primary driver of soil detachment, and hence a major {{determinant}} of transfer of sediment and particulate phosphorus (P) to surface waters. Modelling of sediment and P loss at catchment scale, for example for the development of catchment and national mitigation policies, requires a spatially interpolated estimate of variation in erosion risk. To this end we present a method of estimating total rainfall erosivity, as kinetic energy (KE), for any location in England and Wales, from daily rainfall data or monthly climate data. Analysis of detailed, high-resolution records from eleven contrasting sites showed strong predictive correlations between daily rainfall quantity and associated daily total kinetic energy estimated from hourly rainfall intensities. The coefficients showed systematic seasonal variation, with greatest KE per unit of rainfall in late summer and autumn months. In contrast, no systematic spatial variation was found as a function of location or <b>continentality</b> <b>index.</b> The relationships were integrated with probability distributions of rainfall quantity per rain day derived from spatial climate data (monthly rainfall totals and numbers of rain days). The resulting map captures and quantifies the effects of rainfall quantity and intensity patterns on risk of sediment detachment, and as such provides a critical input layer to catchment-scale models of sediment and P transfer. ...|$|E
40|$|Thin oceanic {{crust is}} formed by {{decompression}} melting {{of the upper}} mantle at mid-ocean ridges, but {{the origin of the}} thick and buoyant continental crust is enigmatic. Juvenile continental crust may form from magmas erupted above intraoceanic subduction zones, where oceanic lithosphere subducts beneath other oceanic lithosphere. However, it is unclear why the subduction of dominantly basaltic oceanic crust would result in the formation of andesitic continental crust at the surface. Here we use geochemical and geophysical data to reconstruct the evolution of the Central American land bridge, which formed above an intra-oceanic subduction system over the past 70 Myr. We find that the geochemical signature of erupted lavas evolved from basaltic to andesitic about 10 Myr ago - coincident with the onset of subduction of more oceanic crust that originally formed above the Galápagos mantle plume. We also find that seismic P-waves travel through the crust at velocities intermediate between those typically observed for oceanic and continental crust. We develop a <b>continentality</b> <b>index</b> to quantitatively correlate geochemical composition with the average P-wave velocity of arc crust globally. We conclude that although the formation and evolution of continents may involve many processes, melting enriched oceanic crust within a subduction zone - a process probably more common in the Archaean - can produce juvenile continental crust...|$|E

In this way monitoring of Cladosporium cladosporioides, C. herbarum and Alternaria spp. airborne spores during 2002 was carried out by means of three LANZONI VPPS 2000 pollen traps located in areas of north-west Spain at various altitudes and with various weather patterns.

40|$|A {{long-term}} (1960 - 2013) {{assessment of}} the variability of continentality and aridity conditions over the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region was undertaken. Monthly gridded temperature and precipitation data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) (TS 3. 22 version) were used to compute the Johansson <b>Continentality</b> <b>Index</b> (JCI) and the Marsz Oceanity Index (MOI). In addition, the De Martonne index and the Pinna index were employed to assess recent changes in aridity conditions. All indices revealed a statistically significant increase in continental influences over the region, particularly in the Nile Basin and the Fertile Crescent. For aridity, the results suggested a generally statistically insignificant increase, with the most rapid changes occurring over the most humid regions (i. e. the Ethiopian Highlands and the Fertile Crescent). In order to explain the observed changes in the continentality and aridity conditions, we assessed the relationship between aridity and continentality indices and {{a wide range of}} large-scale circulation patterns. Results indicate that the spatial variability of continentality (as well as aridity) was closely coupled with the Atlantic modes of variability, e. g. the Eastern Atlantic pattern and the Atlantic Meridional Mode, compared to those of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. The results of this work highlight change processes in 2 important climate features in one of the hottest regions on Earth.

40|$|Tree {{phenology}} {{has been}} recognized as an important indicator of climate change, and {{a wide range of}} budburst models have been developed. The models differ in temperature sensitivity, and the choice of model can therefore influence the result of climate impact assessments. In this study we compared the ability of 15 models to simulate budburst of the main forest tree species in Sweden. Records on the timing of budburst, available for 1873 - 1918 and 1966 - 2011, were used for model evaluation. The predefined models, having different chilling, competence and forcing modules, represented different hypothesis on temperature impact on tree phenology. We extracted the model-specific forcing units accumulated by the observed day of budburst, and tested for covariation with bio-climatic gradients. For all tree species, most models indicated a negative relation between forcing requirement and latitude, which may indicate provenance specific adaptations. The thermal <b>continentality</b> <b>index,</b> which in Sweden is highly correlated with latitude, did provide some additional explanation for the period of 1873 - 1918 but not for the period of 1966 - 2011. For most model- and tree species combinations, temperature anomalies explain {{a significant part of the}} variability in forcing units accumulated at day of budburst. This indicates that the budburst models were not able to fully track the response to inter-annual variations in temperature conditions, probably due to difficulties in capturing species and provenance specific chilling requirement, day length response and impact of spring backlashes.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to look for a new method, to obtain the maximum production, and the minimum economic and environmental cost. Scientific advances in bioclimatology have brought a greater understanding of the functioning of plant individuals, populations and communities, and the study and interpretation of bioclimatic indices reveals the close relationship between the values of these indices and crop yields. In cases where insufficient meteorological data are available to allow the various formulas to be applied, thermoclimatic and ombroclimatic bioindicators must be used, some of which have been collected by us in previous works. This paper contains a bioclimatic study of the southern Iberian Peninsula in relation to the main olive varieties grown in these territories. We establish the values of some key indices for cultivation: <b>continentality</b> <b>index</b> (Ic), which determines the annual thermal range and allows us to establish the period of vegetative activity (PAV); the ombrothermic index (Io), which measures the ombrotype in the different sites; and the thermicity and compensated thermicity index, which denote the thermotype in the territory (It/Itc).

[...] I Congreso de la Sociedad Española de Geobotánica (Gijón, 9 - 11 julio, 2014). A first {{approach}} to Bioclimatology and Biogeography of the Antartic {{is carried out}} establishing the diagnostic parameters and indices of thermotypes, chionotypes (ombrotypes) and continentality existing {{in the study area}} following the Rivas-Martínez et al. (2011) proposal. It is also defined a new bioclimatic variant called Semipolar antarctic bioclimatic variant (sepoa). It has the optimal in the euhyperoceanic humid-ultrahyperhumid isles and archipielagoes of the subantarctic isles territories (Circumantarctic Subkingdom, Subantarctic Insular Region), located no far from the influence of the Antarctic Convergence, also afected by the West Wind Drift and the Circumpolar Cold Current, within 46 º and 56 º South latitude. To belong to the semipolar antarctic bioclimatic variant, every coastal island locality (< 100 m) must be in accord with the following six bioclimatic values: T 4. 5 º- 7. 5 º (mean of annual temperature), Tp 380 - 860 (positive annual temperature), Tps 180 - 280 (positive summer temperature), Timax 5 º- 10 º (mean temperature in warmest month), Ic 3. 5 - 8. 0 (<b>continentality</b> <b>index),</b> and Io 10 - 40 (ombrothermic index). Consequently with the bioclimatic values the potential natural vegetation and physiognomical communities (structure), at lower altitudes (< 200 m), correspond with a treeless tundral communities; low thickets (< 2 m), close grass-heaths, dwarf-heaths, wet or peat meadows, megaforbs, etc., in accord with the geomorphology and habitats.

40|$|The {{development}} of new and more precise models for reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimation from minimum climatic data is mandatory, since the application of existing methods that provide acceptable results is limited to those places where large amounts of reliable climatic data are available. The performance quality of empirical equations and their local calibrations is to be questioned in a large variety of climatic contexts. As an alternative to traditional techniques, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly appropriate for the modelling of non-linear processes, which {{is the case of}} evapotranspiration. Nevertheless, temperature-based ANN models do not always provide accurate enough ETo estimations and their performance depends highly on the specific relationships temperature-ETo of the studied continental context. This paper describes the performance improvement of temperature-based ANN models through the consideration of exogenous ETo records as ancillary inputs in different continental contexts of the autonomous Valencia region, on the Spanish Mediterranean coast. The influence on the model performance of the number of considered ancillary stations and the corresponding number of training patterns is also analysed. Finally, this performance is compared with existing empirical and ANN temperature-based models. The proposed models can be used with high accuracy not only for infilling purposes, but also for estimating ETo outside the training station. Concerning models which demand scant climatic inputs, the proposed model provides performances with lower associated errors than the currently existing temperature-based models, which only consider local data. The local performance of the model presents 0. 084 of average absolute relative error (AARE). The external performance of the model presents 0. 1072 of AARE.

40|$|The {{strawberry}} tree (Arbutus unedo L.) displays {{potential to be}} successfully businesslike-cultured in several areas of Portugal and southern Europe, but remains largely a neglected crop. This region is also particularly vulnerable to global warming, reduction of precipitations and a long-term negative effect on vegetation. To investigate interactions between the species’ distribution and ecological factors we used 319 plots (1 km grid level), where the species are present in Portugal, characterized with 8 ecological attributes: ombrothermic Index (OI), thermicity Index (TI) and <b>continentality</b> <b>Index</b> (CI), pH, organic matter (OM), sand, topographic position index (TPI), number of fires (NF) and burned area (BA). The obtained matrix was firstly analyzed through PCA to reduce the space of analysis by a construction of synthesis variables (Spearman’s rank correlation matrix) and thus to detect patterns within the data set and possible collinear covariates. Finally, the vulnerability of {{strawberry tree}} {{to the effects of}} global climate change was examined. For that purpose, two ‘representative concentration pathways’ (RCPs) scenarios were predicted (RCP 2. 6 and RCP 6. 0) using climatic data, extracted from WorldClim, for distribution changes characterization in two periods (2050 and 2070). The MaxEnt allowed spatial Interpolation using the 319 1 K plots. The PCA showed that the climatic attributes (OI, and TI) displayed the highest components’ correlation values. The strawberry tree prefers areas with higher TI and lower acidity values within the mesomediterranean and termomediterranean belts. Additionally, with lower correlation values, the presence of the species is explained by lower OI values, OM, BA and NF. The prediction results revealed reduction of the potential area of the species, providing a key tool to support conservation management decisions, to design regions of provenance, and to manage genetic improvement programs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Ecology, hydrology, {{and natural}} {{resources}} in the source areas of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers (SAYYR) are closely linked to interactions between climate and permafrost. However, a comprehensive study of the interactions is currently hampered by sparsely- and unevenly-distributed monitoring sites and limited field investigations. In this study, the thermal regime of warm-dry permafrost in the SAYYR was systematically analyzed based on extensive data collected during 2010 - 2016 of air temperature (T a), ground surface temperature (GST) and ground temperature {{across a range of}} areas with contrasting land-surface characteristics. Mean annual T a (MAAT) and mean annual GST (MAGST) were regionally averaged at - 3. 19 ± 0. 71 °C and - 0. 40 ± 1. 26 °C. There is a close relationship between GST and T a (R 2 = 0. 8477) as obtained by a linear regression analysis with all available daily averages. The mean annual temperature {{at the bottom of the}} active layer (T TOP) was regionally averaged at - 0. 72 ± 1. 01 °C and mostly in the range of - 1. 0 °C and 0 °C except at Chalaping (~- 2. 0 °C). Surface offset (MAGST-MAAT) was regionally averaged at 2. 54 ± 0. 71 °C. Thermal offset (T TOP -MAGST) was regionally averaged at - 0. 17 ± 0. 84 °C, which was generally within - 0. 5 °C and 0. 5 °C. Relatively consistent thermal conductivity between the thawed and frozen states of the soils may be responsible for the small thermal offset. Active layer thickness was generally smaller at Chalaping than that on other parts of the QTP, presumably due to smaller climatic <b>continentality</b> <b>index</b> and the thermal dampening of surface temperature variability under the presence of dense vegetation and thick peaty substrates. We conclude that the accurate mapping of permafrost on the rugged elevational QTP could be potentially obtained by correlating the parameters of GST, thermal offset, and temperature gradient in the shallow permafrost...|$|E
40|$|An {{equilibrium}} model {{driven by}} climatic parameters, the Siberian Vegetation Model, {{was used to}} estimate changes in the phytomass of Siberian vegetation under climate change scenarios (CO 2 doubling) from four general circulation models (GCM’s) of the atmosphere. Ecosystems were classified using a three-dimensional climatic ordination of growing degree days (above a 5 °C threshold), Budyko’s dryness index (based on radiation balance and annual precipitation), and Conrad’s <b>continentality</b> <b>index.</b> Phytomass density was estimated using published data of Bazilevich covering all vegetation zones in Siberia. Under current climate, total phytomass of Siberia {{is estimated to be}} 74. 1 ± 2. 0 Pg. Note that this estimate is based on the current forested percentage in each vegetation class compiled from forest inventory data. Moderate warming associated with the GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) and OSU (Oregon State Univ.) projections resulted in a 23 – 26 % increase in phytomass (to 91. 3 ± 2. 1 Pg and 93. 6 ± 2. 4 Pg, respectively), primarily due to an increase in the productive Southern Taiga and Subtaiga classes. Greater warming associated with the GFDL (General Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) and UKMO (United Kingdom Meteorological Office) projections resulted in a small 3 – 7 % increase in phytomass (to 76. 6 ± 1. 3 Pg and 79. 6 ± 1. 2 Pg, respectively). A major component of predicted changes using GFDL and UKMO is the introduction of a vast Temperate Forest-Steppe class covering nearly 40 % of the area of Siberia, at the expense of Taiga; with current climate, this vegetation class is nearly non-existent in Siberia. In addition, Subboreal Forest-Steppe phytomass doubles with all GCM predictions. In all four climate change scenarios, the predicted phytomass stock of all colder, northern classes is reduced considerably (viz., Tundra, Forest-Tundra, Northern Taiga, and Middle Taiga). Phytomass in Subtaiga increases greatly with all scenarios, from a doubling with GFDL to quadrupling with OSU and GISS. Overall, phytomass of the Taiga biome (Northern, Middle, Southern, and Subtaiga) increased 15 % in the moderate OSU and GISS scenarios and decreased by a third in the warmer UKMO and GFDL projections. In addition, a sensitivity analysis found that the percentage of a vegetation class that is forested is a major factor determining phytomass distribution. From 25 to 50 % more phytomass is predicted under climate change if the forested proportion corresponding to potential rather than current vegetation is assumed. Part I Climate Chang...|$|E
40|$|Gridded maps of {{meteorological}} {{variables are}} needed {{for the evaluation of}} weather and climate models and for climate change monitoring. In order to produce them, values at locations where no observing stations are available need to be estimated from point-wise observations. For the interpolation of meteorological observations deterministic and stochastic methods are often combined. Deterministic methods can account for ancillary information such as elevation, continentality or satellite observations. Stochastic methods such as kriging reproduce observed values at the station locations and also account for spatial variability. In the first two studies of this thesis, a flexible interpolation method for the gridding of locally observed daily extreme temperatures is developed that also provides an optimal estimate of the interpolation ncertainty. In the third study, an observational dataset is created using this interpolation method and then applied to evaluate a climate simulation for Africa. In the first study, the Regression-Kriging-Kriging (RKK) method is tested for the interpolation of daily minimum and maximum temperatures (Tmin and Tmax) in different regions in Europe. RKK accounts for elevation, <b>continentality</b> <b>index</b> and zonal mean temperature and is applicable in regions of differing station density and climate. The accuracy of RKK is compared to Inverse Distance Weighting, a common deterministic interpolation method, and to Ordinary Kriging, a common stochastic interpolation method. The first step in RKK is to use regression kriging, in which multiple linear regression accounts for topographical effects on the temperature field and kriging minimizes the regression error, to interpolate climatological means. In the second step daily deviations from the monthly climatology are interpolated using simple kriging. Owing to the large climatological differences across the investigation area the interpolation is performed in homogeneous subregions defined according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. Cross validation demonstrates the superiority of RKK over the simpler algorithms in terms of accuracy and preservation of spatial variability. The interpolation performance however strongly varies across Europe, being considerably higher over Central Europe (highest station density) than over Greenland (few stations along the coast line). This illustrates the strong impact of the station density on the accuracy of the interpolation result. Satellites provide comprehensive observations of climate variables such as land surface temperature (LST) and cloud cover (CC). However, LST is associated with high uncertainty (standard error 1 - 2 °C), preventing its direct application in meteorology and climatology. The second study investigates the usefulness of LST and CC as predictors for the gridding of daily Tmin and Tmax. The RKK algorithm is compared with similar interpolation methods that apply LST and CC in addition to the predictors used with the RKK algorithm. The investigation is conducted in two regions, Central Europe and the Iberian Peninsula, which differ strongly in average cloud cover (Central Europe is approximately 30...|$|E
40|$|We present carbon stable isotope, delta C- 13, {{results from}} air and organic matter samples {{collected}} during 98 individual field campaigns across {{a network of}} Carboeuroflux forest sites in 2001 (14 sites) and 2002 (16 sites). Using these data, we tested the hypothesis that delta C- 13 values derived from large-scale atmospheric measurements and models, which are routinely used to partition carbon fluxes between land and ocean, and potentially between respiration and photosynthesis on land, are consistent with directly measured ecosystem-scale delta C- 13 values. In this framework, we also tested the potential of delta C- 13 in canopy air and plant organic matter to record regional-scale ecophysiological patterns. Our network estimates for the mean delta C- 13 of ecosystem respired CO 2 and the related 'discrimination' of ecosystem respiration, delta(er) and Delta(er), respectively, were - 25. 6 +/- 1. 9 parts per thousand and 17. 8 +/- 2. 0 parts per thousand in 2001 and - 26. 6 +/- 1. 5 parts per thousand and 19. 0 +/- 1. 6 parts per thousand in 2002. The results were {{in close agreement with}} delta C- 13 values derived from regional-scale atmospheric measurement programs for 2001, but less so in 2002, which had an unusual precipitation pattern. This suggests that regional-scale atmospheric sampling programs generally capture ecosystem delta C- 13 signals over Europe, but may be limited in capturing some of the interannual variations. In 2001, but less so in 2002, there were discernable longitudinal and seasonal trends in delta(er). From west to east, across the network, there was a general enrichment in C- 13 (similar to 3 parts per thousand and similar to 1 parts per thousand for the 2 years, respectively) consistent with increasing Gorczynski <b>continentality</b> <b>index</b> for warmer and drier conditions. In 2001 only, seasonal C- 13 enrichment between July and September, followed by depletion in November (from about - 26. 0 parts per thousand to - 24. 5 parts per thousand to - 30. 0 parts per thousand), was also observed. In 2001, July and August delta(er) values across the network were significantly related to average daytime vapor pressure deficit (VPD), relative humidity (RH), and, to a lesser degree, air temperature (T-a), but not significantly with monthly average precipitation (P-m). In contrast, in 2002 (a much wetter peak season), delta(er) was significantly related with T-a, but not significantly with VPD and RH. The important role of plant physiological processes on delta(er) in 2001 was emphasized by a relatively rapid turnover (between 1 and 6 days) of assimilated carbon inferred from time-lag analyses of delta(er) vs. meteorological parameters. However, this was not evident in 2002. These analyses also noted corresponding diurnal cycles of delta(er) and meteorological parameters in 2001, indicating a rapid transmission of daytime meteorology, via physiological responses, to the delta(er) signal during this season. Organic matter delta C- 13 results showed progressive C- 13 enrichment from leaves, through stems and roots to soil organic matter, which may be explained by C- 13 fractionation during respiration. This enrichment was species dependent and was prominent in angiosperms but not in gymnosperms. delta C- 13 values of organic matter of any of the plant components did not well represent short-term delta(er) values during the seasonal cycle, and could not be used to partition ecosystem respiration into autotrophic and heterotrophic components...|$|E

Lihué Calel National Park is a national protected area located in the south-center of La Pampa province, Argentina. According to Cabrera (1976) the area belongs to the floristic province of “monte” and the climate is warm and dry. In the interest to achieve the goals of this paper, Thornthwaite and Mather´s water balance was done. The data was collected from a weather station that belongs to the national park, for the period 1995 - 2010. Emberger›s pluviothermic coefficient, Lang´s rainfall index, De Martonne´s aridity index and Currey´s <b>continentality</b> <b>index</b> were analyzed. In addition, ten stands or plots of vegetation were placed to determine the floristic composition and the vegetation physiognomy. Then, plants species were identified as individuals and their adaptive responses were also analyzed. In conclusion, the survey verified that semi-arid climate conditions determine the morphology and the appearance of jarillal. Climate analysis shows that for the period 1995 - 2010 the average annual temperature is 16. 2 ° C and reveals that thermal summers and winters are well differentiated. Large water deficit is defined, because water balance indicates that the evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation during every month of the year. According to Thornthwaite’s criteria, the area is a semiarid climate type. With the analysis of other bioclimatic indices, more information is obtained: Lang´s index value is 25. 7 (arid), Emberger’s index is 41. 8 (semiarid), De Martonne’s index is 15. 9 (that refers to a semi-arid climate) and, at last, Currey’s index certified the existence of a continental climate because the result was 1. 16. Vegetation was surveyed and the result was quite interesting: 1 508 individuals that belong to 33 species. The percentage is: shrubs 57. 6 %, grasses 36. 4 % and trees 6. 1 %. Most of them were evergreen and only some deciduous. The distribution of vegetation in Lihué Calel responds to the semi-arid conditions. Some adaptations were observed like the development of the deep root system with an horizontal pattern in order to absorb the water from the soil, the loss of leafs in the unfavorable season, the replacement of leaves by thorns, small resinous leaves, leaf tilting and extensive roots, among others. The dominant plant of the jarillal is Larrea divaricate and it is considered as a xerofite plant. The process indicates that when stomata are open, transpiration rates increase; when they are closed, transpiration rates decrease.
