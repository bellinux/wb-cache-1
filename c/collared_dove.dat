5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian <b>collared</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian <b>collared</b> <b>dove</b> has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E

In all three species, high haemoglobin concentrations, and respectively high {{red blood cell}} counts were observed. In S. decaocto the {{red blood cell count}} was extremely high, corresponding to the high haemoglobin levels.

5000|$|<b>Collared</b> <b>doves</b> {{typically}} breed {{close to}} human habitation wherever food resources are abundant {{and there are}} trees for nesting; almost all nests are within 1 km of inhabited buildings. The female lays two white eggs in a stick nest, which she incubates during the night and which the male incubates during the day. Incubation lasts between 14 and 18 days, with the young fledging after 15 to 19 days. Breeding occurs throughout the year when abundant food is available, though only rarely in winter in areas with cold winters such as northeastern Europe. Three to four broods per year is common, although up to six broods in a year has been recorded.

We reviewed wild bird mortality incidents (2005 – 2011). Where species composition or post mortem findings were indicative of chlamydiosis, we examined archived tissues for C. psittaci infection using PCR and ArrayTube Microarray assays. Twenty-one of 40 birds tested positive: 8 dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 7 great tits (Parus major), 3 blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), 2 <b>collared</b> <b>doves</b> (Streptopelia decaocto) and 1 robin (Erithacus rubecula). Chlamydia psittaci genotype A was identified in all passerines tested and in a further three dunnocks and three robins diagnosed with chlamydiosis from a previous study. Two <b>collared</b> <b>doves</b> had genotype E. Ten of the 21 C. psittaci-positive birds identified in the current study had histological lesions consistent with chlamydiosis and were positive for Chlamydia spp. antigens by immunohistochemistry.

40|$|The {{current study}} was carried out to {{determine}} the prevalence of avian trichomoniasis in different species of pigeons in Mosul city during 2005 - 2007. In addition, the work aimed to investigate the effects of possible relationships between age, sex, season of the year, weight and health status on the incidence of the disease. Three species of pigeons were included viz, stock dove (Columba oenas), rock mountain dove (C. livia), and <b>collared</b> <b>doves</b> (Streptopelia decaocto). Examination of 250, 200 and 40 doves of the three fore–mentioned groups of birds indicated prevalence rates of 22 %, 17. 5 % and 10 %, for the three species, respectively. High infection rates were reported in squabs of all birds of the three groups. Regarding the effect of sex on the infection rate, the results revealed high percentage of infection were seen in male stock doves and female rock doves in comparison with their counterparts, however similar rates were observed in both sexes of <b>collared</b> <b>doves.</b> Also, {{it was found that}} there was an impact of season of the year on the prevalence rates of the parasite, so the infection was increased in spring and winter more than other seasons, for all birds studied.

40|$|Background: Wildlife is an {{important}} natural reservoir of many tick-borne pathogens. These agents {{have an impact on}} the health of humans and other animals throughout the world. This study was conducted to determine whether and what species of tick-borne agents had infected wild birds collected from Guangxi, in southwest China. Findings: Liver samples obtained from wild birds were tested for the presence of tick-borne pathogens by PCR assays and sequencing of the flagellin and 16 S rRNA genes. Borrelia garinii was detected in Eurasian <b>collared</b> <b>doves</b> (2 / 57, 3. 5 %) from among the 95 wild birds. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected in Eurasian <b>collared</b> <b>doves</b> (2 / 57, 3. 5 %) and Eurasian eagle owls (2 / 13, 15. 4 %). Ehrlichia chaffeensis and a potential novel Anaplasma sp. were identified in Common pheasant (1 / 12, 8. 3 %). These results suggest the involvement of birds in the cycle of tick-borne diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document infection of birds with B. garinii, A. phagocytophilum, E. chaffeensis and the novel Anaplasma sp. in China. Conclusions: Tick-borne zoonotic bacteria B. garinii, A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis, and a potential novel Anaplasma sp., were identified in wild birds in southwest China. The presence of these agents in birds increases the potential spread over long distances and the risk of transmission of infection from birds to new hosts, including humans...|$|R
