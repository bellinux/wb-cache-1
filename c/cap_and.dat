5|$|The {{distinctive}} colour of the <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> pores {{make it hard}} {{to confuse}} with other species. Often found in similar habitats is S.variegatus, though this species has a granular <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> dark olive pores, which are smaller and not decurrent. It can also bruise blue.|$|E
5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> remove nucleotides {{from the}} poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' <b>cap)</b> <b>and</b> 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E

5|$|Mycena arcangeliana is {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} less common Mycena flavescens, a species found in both hardwood and softwood forests on the floor among leaf or needle litter or grassland. M. flavescens typically has a whiter <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> a smell reminiscent of radish. M. peyerimhoffi, known from Algeria, has a similar cap colour to M. arcangeliana, but has a yellow stem. M. limonia, known from the Netherlands, has a lemon-yellow <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> stem and more gills. Another species similar in appearance is M. metata, which has a sweet taste.|$|E
5|$|Mycena flavoalba bears {{resemblance}} to {{some members of}} the genus Hemimycena, such as H.lactea and H.delectabilis. It can be distinguished from these species by its white to yellowish <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> differences in the shape of both its spores and caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem). H.conidiogena, a Spanish species newly described from in 2005, is also similar in appearance, but differs in the distribution of pigment in the <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> the differential staining in response to the dye cresyl blue—M.flavoalba is positive, while H.conidiogena is negative.|$|E
5|$|The African species Roridomyces mauritianus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to R.austrororidus, but can be distinguished by the brownish <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> microscopically by its smaller spores (measuring 7–8 by 3.5–4.0μm), and its shorter (25–40μm), club-shaped basidia.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower stem and cap colors that are various shades of brown. Its darker <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E

5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near the margin of the <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the <b>cap,</b> <b>and</b> in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E
