5|$|The four <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve</b> {{films were}} again {{released}} on November 28, 2006, in new DVD releases {{to coincide with}} Superman Returns, also released in that year. Superman was released in a four-disc 'special edition' similar to Superman II, which was released in a two-disc special edition. Both Superman III and IV were released in single disc 'deluxe editions', and all four releases were available together in The <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve</b> Superman Collection, an 8-disc set that was valued at US$79.92.

The collection was a 2-disc DVD-18 set {{that included the}} first disc of both special editions from the 2006 release and both deluxe editions.|$|E

5|$|Jeff East as {{the teenage}} Clark Kent: As a teenager, he {{is forced to}} hide his superhuman abilities, making him unpopular among his classmates and {{frustrating}} his efforts to gain the attention of classmate Lana Lang (Diane Sherry). Following {{the death of his}} adoptive father, he travels to the Arctic to discover his Kryptonian heritage. East's dialogue in the film is redubbed by <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve</b> for the final cut.|$|E

5|$|<b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve</b> {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993 movie, The Remains of the Day, {{starring}} Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson and <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve,</b> {{references are}} made to Clevedon, where the final scene {{of the film is}} set and was filmed. The 1998 adaptation of Cider with Rosie also featured scenes filmed in the town. Scenes from the 2010 film, Never Let Me Go, starring Keira Knightley were filmed in Clevedon during the summer of 2009. Clevedon has its own comic book superhero, Captain Clevedon.|$|E
5|$|Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} at the Daily Planet, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very specific concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve.</b> Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.|$|E
50|$|As an actress, Barrett has {{recently}} appeared in supporting roles on screen in <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve's</b> last directorial feature film, The Brooke Ellison Story, {{as well as}} New Line Cinema's award-winning motion picture, Secondhand Lions.|$|R
50|$|The {{script was}} written in the 1990s and was optioned. The {{original}} studio let the option expire after hearing about <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve's</b> remake of Rear Window. It was not until 2004 that the script was rewritten and sold.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the film}} {{still managed to}} recoup its budget of $39 million, it was less {{successful}} than the first two Superman movies, both financially and critically. While harsh criticism focused on the film's comedic and campy tone, {{as well as the}} casting and performance of Pryor, the special effects and <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve's</b> performance as a temporarily corrupted Superman were praised.|$|R
5|$|Several {{other people}} and {{elements}} were also involved with {{the production of the}} ceremony. Jeff Margolis served as director for the program. Actress and talk show host Oprah Winfrey interviewed several nominees and other attendees during a seven-minute red carpet arrival segment shown {{at the beginning of the}} telecast. Musician and saxophonist Tom Scott served as musical director for the ceremony. Choreographer Jamie King supervised the performances of the Best Song nominees and two dance numbers. Babe, the pig from the eponymous film, and Miss Piggy participated in a comedy sketch during the proceedings. Actor <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve,</b> who was paralyzed in a horse riding accident nearly a year earlier, made a surprise appearance on the telecast urging filmmakers to make movies that face the world's most important issues head-on.|$|E
5|$|Smallville was {{generally}} positively received when it began. Former Superman star <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve</b> expressed {{approval for the}} series, making two guest appearances before his death. The pilot episode set a ratings record for a WB debut, with 8.4million viewers. Over ten seasons the series averaged about 4.34million viewers per episode, with season two the highest-rated at 6.3million. By {{the end of its}} run, Smallville passed Stargate SG-1 as the longest-running North American science-fiction series. Since its first season, the series received accolades ranging from Emmys to Teen Choice Awards. Smallville spawned a series of young-adult novels, a DC Comics bimonthly comic book, soundtrack recordings and series-related merchandise. All ten seasons are available on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4. In April 2012, it continued in comic-book form with a storyline resuming shortly after the series finale, and ended in November 2014.|$|E
5|$|Ben then visits Jack, {{telling him}} his real name, {{and that he}} has lived on the island all his life. He offers that if Jack cooperates, he can be sent home. Jack {{believes}} the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists that they are in contact with the outside world. He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve</b> and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says that proves he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock.|$|E

Metro lands on Vancouver's North Shore waterfront hosted the shoot for the dramatic oil rig rescue that introduces audiences to Superman. Ucluelet and Nanaimo, British Columbia, feature prominently in the film’s first hour—the trademark winter mist and rough seas are passed off as Alaska in the film. Filming {{took place in the}} Chicago Loop from September 7 to 17. Vancouver production took place from September 21, 2011, to January 20, 2012 to celebrate the 60th birthday anniversary of the late <b>Christopher</b> <b>Reeve</b> who was the first actor who played Superman in films. The Chicago shoot was a unit project, meaning that filming could partake numerous establishing shots as well as cutaways and may not necessarily include principal cast members.|$|E
