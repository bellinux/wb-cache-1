Patients who had diabetes-related co-morbidities had significantly less dispensing of metformin monotherapy and more dispensing of insulin than those without these conditions. Patients who had cardiovascular disease were more likely to have three or more oral antidiabetics dispensed (RR= 1. 16, 95 % CI: 1. 04 - 1. 30), particularly those who had heart failure (RR= 1. 24, 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 1. 47). Patients with renal disease were more likely to have glitazones dispensed (RR= 1. 46, 95 % CI: 1. 24 - 1. 72). Adjunctive <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> were significantly less likely to be dispensed to those with established heart conditions and non-related co-morbidities, particularly dementia.

40|$|People {{living in}} Australia’s {{regional}} areas access cardiovascular disease (CVD) medicines {{at higher rates}} than people in major cities or remote areas The report looks at the supply of medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS/RPBS) to different Australian regions. The report also shows a different pattern {{in the case of}} lipid-lowering (cholesterol-lowering) drugs, with rates of supply highest in major cities. ‘The reasons for these patterns are hard to identify— the relationships between cardiovascular disease, remoteness, seeing a doctor, and supply of CVD medicines are complex,’ said John Woodall of the AIHW’s Cardiovascular, Diabetes and Kidney Unit. ‘One constant we found in our study was that GPs prescribe <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> in a similar pattern across Australia, whether they are based in major cities, regional or remote areas,’ he said. Generally higher rates of supply of CVD medicines in regional areas reflect the fact that cardiovascular health is poorer outside major cities, with higher rates of death and hospitalisation from cardiovascular disease. But the report also shows that people in major cities were more likely to visit a GP for a CVD consultation despite having lower rates of CVD and CVD risk factors. Indigenous Australians have significantly higher rates of CVD deaths and hospitalisations than other Australians. In remote and very remote areas they rely heavily on sources of CVD medicines additional to the PBS/RPBS, with up to one-third of CVD medicines supplied by an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Health Service. ‘Indigenous Australians, who make up a high proportion of the population in remote and very remote areas, who attend a remote area Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Health Service, are able to get medicines from an on-site dispensary at the health service, without the need for a prescription form and without charge,’ Mr Woodall said. Over 70 million prescriptions for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> were dispensed through the PBS/RPBS to 3. 8 million Australians in 2007 – 08.   Report abstract <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> and primary health care: a regional analysis shows how the supply of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> and primary health-care services differs across regions in Australia.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{global burden}} of {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) continues to rise. Successful treatment of CVD requires adequate pharmaceutical management. The aim {{was to examine the}} availability, pricing and affordability of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> in developing countries using the standardized data collected according to the World Health Organization/Health Action International methodology. Methods The following medicines were included: atenolol, captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, losartan and nifedipine. Data from 36 countries were analyzed. Outcome measures were percentage availability, price ratios to international reference prices and number of day's wages needed by the lowest-paid unskilled government worker to purchase one month of chronic treatment. Patient prices were adjusted for inflation and purchasing power, procurement prices only for inflation. Data were analyzed for both generic and originator brand products and the public and private sector and summarized by World Bank Income Groups. Results For all measures, there was great variability across surveys. The overall availability of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> was poor (mean 26. 3 % in public sector, 57. 3 % private sector). Procurement prices were very competitive in some countries, whereas others consistently paid high prices. Patient prices were generally substantially higher than international references prices; some countries, however, performed well. Chronic treatment with anti-hypertensive medication cost more than one day's wages in many cases. In particular when monotherapy is insufficient, treatment became unaffordable. Conclusions The results of this study emphasize the need of focusing attention and financing on making chronic disease medicines accessible, in particular in the public sector. Several policy options are suggested to reach this goal. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{practice}} {{the benefit of}} <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> is less consistent {{than it is in}} clinical trials. This is due to multiple uncontrolled factors that co-determine the efficacy of the new treatment. In statistical terms, they interact with the new treatment. Interaction effects are rarely assessed in cardiovascular trials. Objective: To review (1) important factors that may interact with the treatment efficacy, (2) how to examine such factors, and (3) why so. Results. Important factors include (a) possible risk factors such as specific patient characteristics, and concomitant medications, and (b) study-specific aspects such as heterogeneities of investigators, health centres, and individual patients including patient compliance. Such factors can be assessed by comparing subgroups. A common but incorrect approach is the comparison of the significances of difference between treatment modalities in either subgroup. Instead, a direct comparison of effect sizes relative to the standard errors is adequate. As an alternative, regression modelling is adequate and convenient. Results of interaction assessments are post-hoc and, therefore, of an exploratory and unconfirmed nature. So, why should they be performed? In cardiovascular research the effects of patient characteristics and drug-drug interactions on drug efficacies are numerous. It is valuable to account at least post-hoc for such mechanisms. Second, current cardiovascular trials involve heterogeneous health centres, investigators, and patient groups. Accounting for these heterogeneities can be helpful to better predict individual responses in future patients. Conclusion: Cardiovascular trials enrolling patient groups at risk for heterogeneity should include at least a post-hoc assessment for interaction. Correct and incorrect methods for that purpose are described. Interaction assessments are helpful to better predict the efficacy/safety of new <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> in the future treatment of subgroups of patient...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} persistence, adherence, and time without therapy with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> over all episodes of use among veterans following hospitalization for ischemic heart disease. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using Department of Veterans' Affairs database including 9635 veterans with a hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, angina, or ischemic heart disease, {{and who had}} been dispensed <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> in the 3 months posthospitalization. The main outcome measures were duration of first treatment episode, duration of overall treatment episode, and adherence with recommended therapies: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), lipid-lowering therapy, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers, and antiplatelet therapy. RESULTS: The median duration of overall treatment was 6. 2 years [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 6. 0 - 6. 4] for lipid-lowering therapy, 5. 4 years (95 % CI: 5. 1 - 5. 5) for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, 5. 0 years (95 % CI: 4. 8 - 5. 1) for antiplatelets, 3. 4 years (95 % CI: 3. 3 - 3. 6) for beta-blockers, and 2. 8 years (95 % CI: 2. 6 - 3. 0) for CCBs. Adherence was 72 % for CCBs, 75 % for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, 84 % for lipid-lowering therapy, and 84 % for antiplatelets other than aspirin. The median time without therapy was 4. 5 months or less for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, antiplatelets, and lipid-lowering therapy. CONCLUSION: Problems with medication adherence can relate to either persistence or compliance during treatment. This novel method provides a way to determine which of these factors is most problematic when considering chronic therapies. We found that Australian veterans with established cardiovascular disease are persistent with their cardiovascular therapy, with only small gaps in therapy. Elizabeth E. Roughead, Agnes I.

40|$|Treatment of {{diseases}} such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders are highly dependent on medications and particularly adherence to medications to achieve optimal pharmacotherapy outcomes. Several factors can affect a patient's adherence including: knowledge and beliefs about their illness and medications, concomitant psychological disorders, type of therapeutic regimen, and {{lack of access to}} medicines. In Iran, a middle income country, essential medicines are highly available and affordable. However, adherence to medications has not been emphasized especially for patients with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we reviewed the available literature on adherence to medications used to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disorders in Iran. We systematically searched Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, and IranMedex using a highly sensitive protocol on July 2012. We retrieved 1003 citations; and two independent researchers screened them for relevant publications. Studies were included if they reported rate or determinants of adherence to diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular medications. Trials on improving interventions were also included. The quality of studies was assessed using appropriate guidelines. Fourteen studies were eligible for data extraction and review. The definition of adherence and the measurement tools used were unclear among studies. Methodological caveats including inappropriate sample size, sampling methods, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and high rate of loss to follow-up were also observed. Nevertheless, adherence rate was reported to be 62. 8 - 86. 3 % for oral hypoglycemic medications and 38. 8 - 60. 0 % for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines.</b> Forgetfulness, lack of knowledge about medical condition and prescribed medications, and concerns about medications efficacy and side effects were consistently reported as barriers to adherence. Patient education plus telephone or short message service follow-ups were reported to improve adherence to oral hypo-glycemic medications. We did not find any high quality trials on adherence to <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines.</b> In conclusion, adherence to cardiovascular and diabetes medications is not assured in Iranian patients. Based on the available literature, patient education and reinforcement interventions are required to address this issue. Future studies should employ careful designs and standard tools for assessment of adherence to medications...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{estimated}} {{numbers of}} diabetes mellitus patients in Tanzania are most {{probably going to}} increase {{as a result of}} longer expected life expectancy, urbanization associated with a high prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyle. Drugs cost for the management of diabetes and its complications as a key factor for the determination of patients’ affordability should be looked with critical eye for the better function of the health care system. Study objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} assess drug costs for management of diabetes and its complications at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) outpatient pharmacy. Methodology This was cross sectional retrospective study. Data was collected through Retrieval and review of electronic data of all diabetes outpatients registered from 1 st January 2012 to 31 st December 2012 available in the MNH JEEVA Database. The drug cost – prices was obtained from the Public distributor of drugs (Medical Stores Department), price of the Hospital buying consortium and the retail price at the intramural practice pharmacy at MNH. Results The most commonly prescribed medicines for diabetes, cardiovascular and elevated cholesterol were metformin, losartan and atorvastatin respectively. One third of Diabetes out patients at MNH had cardiovascular and elevated cholesterol complications. The mean cost per prescription for patients prescribed diabetes medicines only was Tshs. 17, 191. 3 /=. Patients prescribed diabetes and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> had a significantly higher mean prescriptions cost of 51. 8 %,(P-value < 0. 01) as compared to patients prescribed diabetes medicines alone. Similarly diabetes patients prescribed both diabetes medicines and lipid lowering medicines drugs also had a significantly higher mean prescriptions cost of 121. 9 %,(P value < 0. 01) as compared to patients prescribed diabetes medicines alone. However the most striking and significant mean prescription cost of 207. 4 % (P value < 0. 01) was seen in patients prescribed Diabetic, Lipid lowering and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> as compared to patients prescribed diabetes medicines alone. Conclusion and recommendation About one third of Diabetes mellitus out patients attended at MNH for the study period were also suffering from cardiovascular or elevated cholesterol complications. The cost of treating these complications is significantly higher compared to the cost of treating patients with diabetes alone. The Government should improve efforts for timely diagnosis of diabetes by mandating community pharmacies to screen for diabetes and elevated cholesterol so as to reduce diabetes complications and reduce the cost of treating diabetes complications...|$|E

A cross sectional study was carried out at a tertiary hospital, where patient files were analyzed for last admission treatment information for the year 2012. Results show that about 56. 3 % of medicines prescribed were dispensed to patients. Out of the dispensed medicines, 730 medicines dosages were wasted. Anti-infective medicines wastage was 18. 9 %, <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> (8. 9 %) and the other categories was 23. 7 % of the total medicines dispensed.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} {{a leading cause of}} death in older people, and the impact of being exposed or not exposed to {{preventive}} <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>medicines</b> is accordingly high. Underutilization of beneficial drugs is common, but prevalence estimates differ across settings, knowledge on predictors is limited, and clinical consequences are rarely investigated. Using data from a prospective population-based cohort study, we assessed the prevalence, determinants, and outcomes of medication underuse based on cardiovascular criteria from Screening Tool To Alert to Right Treatment (START). Medication underuse was present in 69. 1 % of 1454 included participants (mean age 71. 1 ± 6. 1 years) and was significantly associated with frailty (odds ratio: 2. 11 [95 % confidence interval: 1. 24 - 3. 63]), body mass index (1. 03 [1. 01 - 1. 07] per kg/m 2), and inversely with the number of prescribed drugs (0. 84 [0. 79 - 0. 88] per drug). Using this information for adjustment in a follow-up evaluation (mean follow-up time 2. 24 years) on cardiovascular and competing outcomes, we found no association of medication underuse with cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal) (hazard ratio: 1. 00 [0. 65 - 1. 56]), but observed a significant association of medication underuse with competing deaths from non-cardiovascular causes (2. 52 [1. 01 - 6. 30]). Medication underuse was associated with frailty and adverse non-cardiovascular clinical outcomes. This may suggest that cardiovascular drugs were withheld because of serious co-morbidity or that concurrent illness can preclude benefit from cardiovascular prevention.
