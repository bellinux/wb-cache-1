5|$|The {{movement}} of electric charge {{is known as}} an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{would have}} been {{similarly}} equipped to the preceding Deutschland-class ships. The ships would have mounted six of the same /52 C/28 quick-firing guns in the same triple turret mounts. The guns had an actual bore diameter of , and fired both armor-piercing and high-explosive shells; both shells weighed 300kg (661.4lb). The guns used two sets of propellant charges: a 36.0kg (79.4lb) fore <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> a silk bag and a 71.0kg (156.6lb) main <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> a brass case. The shells were fired at 910meters per second (2,986fps), and at maximum elevation of 40degrees, a range of 36,475m (39,890yards). The guns had a rate of fire of 2.5 rounds per minute. However, eight guns were considered, had there been a quadruple turret available. The guns were supplied {{by a total of}} 900 shells, for a total of 150 rounds per gun.|$|E

5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the South Korean and American armies. The eastern half of the border was handled by the South Korean Army while I Corps took <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> the west. For the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only {{occasional}} incidents with the North Korean army. In 1971, under Nixon's détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).|$|E
5|$|Although the State Arms {{were granted}} in 1969, {{municipal}} heraldry {{had already been}} using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with a black swan as a <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> {{the first quarter and}} black swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, black swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms granted by the Crown have included a representation of a black swan, presumably acknowledging the allegiance of each municipality to the state.|$|E

Analysis of rates and profits <b>in</b> {{individual}} <b>charges</b> and comparison within towns is also dealt with. In this comparison are used data from 2007. The work concludes with comparison of structure of profits from local <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> the whole Czech Republic.

The {{result of this}} search is that the share of local <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> the total incomes in individual towns is only on a low level...|$|R
5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor <b>charge.</b> <b>In</b> the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|At Issus in 333BC, {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Darius, {{he used the}} same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels {{to break up the}} phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.|$|E

The 1st Brigade, known as the Household Brigade, {{commanded}} by Major-General Lord Edward Somerset, consisted of guards regiments: the 1st and 2nd Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues), and the 1st (King's) Dragoon Guards. The 2nd Brigade, {{also known as the}} Union Brigade, commanded by Major-General Sir William Ponsonby, was so called as it consisted of an English, the 1st (The Royals); a Scottish, 2nd ('Scots Greys'); and an Irish, 6th (Inniskilling); regiment of heavy dragoons.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a broad}} {{theoretical}} end empirical economic literature {{discussing the}} effects of termination charges on competition and retail prices. Most of this literature {{has focused on the}} telecommunications markets. Termination <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> the international parcel market have not yet received much attention in the economic literature. The aim {{of this paper is to}} fill this gap and to analyze the economics of termination charges for parcels. We find that the economics of termination <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> the international parcel market are different to termination <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> other mar-kets. Based on these findings the paper presents a number of practical solutions and potential regulatory remedies to the dilemma of termination <b>charges</b> <b>in</b> the international parcel market.

5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} that he was {{prepared}} to follow the Lord's calling. A plan was drawn up in which Viret would be appointed to take temporary <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> Geneva for six months while Bucer and Calvin would visit the city to determine the next steps. The city council pressed for the immediate appointment of Calvin in Geneva. By mid-1541, Strasbourg decided to lend Calvin to Geneva for six months. Calvin returned on 13 September 1541 with an official escort and a wagon for his family.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{were playing}} in their seventh League Cup final, having won four, most {{recently}} in 2007. Their most recent appearance in the final was the first at Wembley, which they lost in 2008 to Tottenham. The game was Chelsea's first domestic cup final since their victory in the 2012 FA Cup Final. Incumbent Chelsea manager José Mourinho was in <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> their League Cup wins in 2005 and 2007, and squad members Petr Čech, John Terry and Didier Drogba played in both finals, with the latter scoring in both victories. All three also played in the 2008 defeat by Tottenham.|$|E

Liverpool improved to fourth the following season and won the Football League Cup. In 1998, Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager alongside Evans. The arrangement lasted until November when Evans resigned and Houllier became the sole mananger. The club won a unique treble of trophies in 2001, and a year later finished second to Arsenal, their highest league finish in 11 years. Houllier departed the club in mid-2004.|$|E

5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E
