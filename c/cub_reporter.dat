25|$|Mike McAlary, from 1985 to 1993, bounds {{from one}} New York City {{newsroom}} to another as he achieves career success, covering such stories as the tainted Tylenol {{case and the}} Buddy Boys of the 7-7 scandal. His salary increases as he ascends from being a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> to star crime reporter to star columnist. In 1993, McAlary's suffers a near-fatal auto accident that leaves him physically impaired.|$|E

60|$|Nine {{days later}} the Mariposa {{threaded}} the Golden Gate and docked at San Francisco. Humorous half-columns in the local papers, written in the customary silly way by unlicked <b>cub</b> <b>reporters</b> just out of grammar school, tickled the fancy of San Francisco for a fleeting moment in that the steamship Mariposa had rescued some sea-waifs possessed of a cock-and- bull story that not even the reporters believed. Thus, silly reportorial unveracity usually proves extraordinary truth a liar. It {{is the way of}} <b>cub</b> <b>reporters,</b> city newspapers, and flat-floor populations which get their thrills from moving pictures and for which the real world and all its spaciousness does not exist.|$|R
25|$|In {{his first}} year at GMA Network, 2004, Dan was one of Howie Severino's trainees. But he soon proved to be capable and reliable, and not needing basic {{training}} since he had significant reportorial experience at RPN 9 News and Bombo Radyo Philippines, covering Makati. His superiors first took notice of Dan as a 19-year-old <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> when he spent Christmas Eve and day of 1999 reporting the M/V Asia South Korea tragedy in Daanbantayan, Cebu. His idols were Christiane Amanpour and Larry King of CNN.|$|E
25|$|Ginzburg studied {{journalism and}} {{accounting}} at Baruch College of the City University of New York, was editor-in-chief of its campus newspaper, and on graduation in 1949 became a copyboy and <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> at the New York Daily Compass. Two {{years later he}} was drafted into the Army during the Korean War and assigned to Fort Myer, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, where he both edited the post newspaper, and took wedding photos for base marriages. While still in the Army, he worked at night as a copy editor for the Washington D.C. Times-Herald.|$|E
25|$|Stuart {{attended}} Santa Monica High School {{where she}} was active in theater, and performed the lead role in her senior class play, The Swan. She loved writing as much as acting, and spent her last two summers in high school taking short story and poetry writing classes and working as a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> for the Santa Monica Outlook. After high school, Stuart enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, majoring in philosophy and drama. In college, she appeared in plays, worked on the Daily Californian, contributed to the campus literary journal, Occident, and posed as an artist's model. It was at Berkeley that she began signing her name Gloria Stuart.|$|E
50|$|Wolodarski {{started his}} journalistic {{career at the}} age of twelve, working as one of the <b>cub</b> <b>reporters</b> (a knattereporter) on the Swedish {{television}} programme Barnjournalen (Children's Journal). He studied business administration at the Stockholm School of Economics and in 1999, at age of twenty-one, started as an editorial writer on Expressen and as a TV host with Åke Ortmark on TV8.|$|R

6000|$|For Martin's {{troubles}} were many. The {{aftermath of}} the <b>cub</b> <b>reporter's</b> deed was even wider than Martin had anticipated. The Portuguese grocer refused him further credit, while the greengrocer, who was an American and proud of it, had called him a traitor to his country and refused further dealings with him--carrying his patriotism {{to such a degree}} that he cancelled Martin's account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay it. The talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling, and indignation against Martin ran high. No one would have anything to do with a socialist traitor. Poor Maria was dubious and frightened, but she remained loyal. The children of the neighborhood recovered from the awe of the grand carriage which once had visited Martin, and from safe distances they called him [...] "hobo" [...] and [...] "bum." [...] The Silva tribe, however, stanchly defended him, fighting more than one pitched battle for his honor, and black eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the day and added to Maria's perplexities and troubles.|$|R
25|$|During Lois' adolescence, {{she won a}} youth contest run by the Daily Planet, {{with the}} prize being a trip to Metropolis {{to spend a week}} working as a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> for the newspaper. There, she first met Clark Kent of Smallville, who was the other winner of the contest. Lois found Clark dull and became more {{interested}} in asking him for information about Superboy after learning Clark came from Smallville. During the week in Metropolis, Lois made a bet with Clark to see who would get the most scoops, {{which turned out to be}} Lois, as Clark was forced to constantly go into action as Superboy. Lois met Superboy for the first time while uncovering a criminal enterprise for one of her stories. At the end of the week, Clark paid off Lois' bet (an ice cream sundae), and the two returned to their respective hometowns.|$|E
25|$|Burroughs {{finished}} high school at Taylor School in Clayton, Missouri, and in 1932, left home to pursue an arts degree at Harvard University, where he was affiliated with Adams House. During the summers, {{he worked as a}} <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, covering the police docket. He disliked the work, and refused to cover some events, like the death of a drowned child. He lost his virginity in an East St. Louis, Illinois brothel that summer with a female prostitute whom he regularly patronized. While at Harvard, Burroughs made trips to New York City and was introduced to the gay subculture there. He visited lesbian dives, piano bars, and the Harlem and Greenwich Village homosexual underground with Richard Stern, a wealthy friend from Kansas City. They would drive from Boston to New York in a reckless fashion. Once, Stern scared Burroughs so badly that he asked to be let out of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} journalism career at 16 as a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> at the Marshall News Messenger in Marshall in East Texas. In college, he studied journalism at the North Texas State College in Denton, Texas. In 1954, then-US Senator Lyndon B. Johnson {{employed}} {{him as a}} summer intern and eventually promoted him to manage Johnson's personal mail. Soon after, Moyers transferred to the University of Texas at Austin, where he wrote for The Daily Texan newspaper. In 1956, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism. While in Austin, Moyers served as assistant news editor for KTBC radio and television stations, owned by Lady Bird Johnson, wife of then-Senator Johnson. During the academic year 1956–1957, he studied issues {{of church and state}} at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland as a Rotary International Fellow. In 1959, he completed a Master of Divinity degree at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. Moyers served as Director of Information while attending SWBTS. He was also a Baptist pastor in Weir in Williamson County, near Austin.|$|E
50|$|Janensch {{started as}} a <b>cub</b> police <b>reporter</b> for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a {{cooperative}} news-gathering agency; he subsequently wrote radio newscasts for United Press International. Upon graduation from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Janensch landed his first real newspaper job working for Publisher Barry Bingham Sr. and Executive Editor Norman Isaacs at The Courier-Journal in Louisville. As a reporter, he covered civil rights including Martin Luther King's march to Selma, Alabama. He then served as Washington correspondent and city editor.|$|R
500|$|Like Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis, Hemingway was a {{journalist}} {{before becoming a}} novelist; after leaving high school {{he went to work}} for The Kansas City Star as a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter.</b> Although he stayed there for only six months, he relied on the Stars style guide as a foundation for his writing: [...] "Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1924 in {{our time}} {{collection}} consists of eighteen vignettes. Five center on World War I (Chapters 1, 4, 5, 7, 8), and six on bullfighting (Chapters 2 and 12 to 16); the others center around news stories. Chapter 10 is the longest; it details a soldier's affair with a Red Cross nurse, {{and is based on}} Hemingway's relationship with Agnes von Kurowsky. The piece about a robbery and murder in Kansas City originated in a newspaper story Hemingway covered as a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> at The Kansas City Star; it is followed by the story of the public hanging of the Chicago mobster Sam Cardinelli. The last, [...] "L'Envoi", is about the King of Greece and Sophia of Prussia giving an interview in the palace garden during the Revolution.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{said that}} he learned what he needed as a {{foundation}} for his writing from the style sheet for The Kansas City Star, where he worked as <b>cub</b> <b>reporter.</b> [...] The critic John Aldridge says that the minimalist style resulted from Hemingway's belief that to write authentically, each word had to be carefully chosen for its simplicity and authenticity and carry a great deal of weight. Aldridge writes that Hemingway's style [...] "of a minimum of simple words that seemed to be squeezed onto the page against a great compulsion to be silent, creates the impression that those words—if only because there are so few of them—are sacramental." [...] In Paris Hemingway had been experimenting with the prosody of the King James Bible, reading aloud with his friend John Dos Passos. From the style of the biblical text, he learned to build his prose incrementally; the action in the novel builds sentence by sentence, scene by scene and chapter by chapter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{precocious}} {{and brilliant}} Fraina pursued {{the path of}} self-education, reading broadly. From an early age, Fraina was engrossed {{with the ideas of}} political radicalism and freethought, publishing his first essay, [...] "Shelley, the Atheist Poet," [...] in the agnostic journal The Truth Seeker in 1909. Other articles in The Truth Seeker followed, catching the attention of newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, who offered Fraina a job as a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> at the New York Evening Journal, flagship newspaper of the newspaper chain owned by William Randolph Hearst.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1939, he {{enrolled}} in law school at the University of Rome to please his parents. Biographer Hollis Alpert reports that [...] "there is no record of his ever having attended a class". Installed in a family pensione, he met another lifelong friend, the painter Rinaldo Geleng. Desperately poor, they unsuccessfully joined forces to draw sketches of restaurant and café patrons. Fellini eventually found work as a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> on the dailies Il Piccolo and Il Popolo di Roma, but quit after a short stint, bored by the local court news assignments.|$|E
2500|$|In 1866, Schurz {{moved to}} Detroit, {{where he was}} chief editor of the Detroit Post. [...] The {{following}} year, he moved to St. Louis, becoming editor and joint proprietor with Emil Preetorius of the German-language Westliche Post (Western Post), where he hired Joseph Pulitzer as a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter.</b> In the winter of 18671868, he traveled in Germany; his account of his interview with Otto von Bismarck {{is one of the}} most interesting chapters of his Reminiscences. He spoke against [...] "repudiation" [...] of war debts and for [...] "honest money"—code for going back on the gold standard—during the Presidential campaign of 1868.|$|E
2500|$|Knowland joined The Oakland Tribune in 1954 as a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter,</b> {{and trained}} {{in all aspects}} of running the enterprise. A {{magazine}} article in Time reported in 1963 that a [...] "jet-setty Joseph W. Knowland" [...] had set himself up in a luxurious office with a bar, refrigerator and television, and an expensive walnut desk grander than the dingy ones used by other Tribune staffers. One employee was reported as complaining, [...] "It's like something out of Playboy." [...] An industry veteran would later describe Knowland-the-publisher as [...] "charming but ineffectual." [...] In 1966, Knowland's grandfather died, leaving The Oakland Tribune newspaper to Knowland's father, the former United States Senator. Knowland was named the {{vice president and general manager}} of the paper. In 1974, a hundred years after the founding of the newspaper, and following the suicide of his father, Knowland became editor and publisher. He earned the [...] "Publisher of the Year" [...] award from the California Press Association just one year later.|$|E
2500|$|On July 8, 1955, Rushmore {{appeared}} on The Tom Duggan Show in Chicago. He claimed on air {{that he was}} on a secret mission to uncover the communist assassins of former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. Rushmore told the viewers that the leader of the [...] "Chicago Communist Party," [...] whose name was given as [...] "Lazarovich," [...] was in hiding and that Rushmore needed their help in locating him. Rushmore later disappeared from his hotel room, leading to a nationwide manhunt by the FBI. As the nation speculated that Rushmore was either kidnapped or murdered by communists, he was discovered hiding under the name [...] "H. Roberts" [...] at the Hotel Finlen in Butte, Montana. Meanwhile, news reporters found [...] "Lazarovich" [...] living in Manhattan under his real name of William Lazar. Lazar said [...] "It's a simple fact that I live quite normally in Manhattan and that any green <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> would not have the slightest difficulty in locating me if he honestly wanted to." [...] Associate Director of the FBI, Clyde Tolson, wrote in the margin of a report on the disappearance: [...] "Rushmore must be a 'nut.' We should {{have nothing to do with}} him." [...] J. Edgar Hoover added: [...] "I certainly agree." ...|$|E
60|$|It chanced that a <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> {{sat in the}} audience, {{detailed}} {{there on}} a day dull of news and impressed by the urgent need of journalism for sensation. He was not a bright <b>cub</b> <b>reporter.</b> He was merely facile and glib. He was too dense to follow the discussion. In fact, he had a comfortable {{feeling that he was}} vastly superior to these wordy maniacs of the working class. Also, he had a great respect for those who sat in the high places and dictated the policies of nations and newspapers. Further, he had an ideal, namely, of achieving that excellence of the perfect reporter who is able to make something--even a great deal--out of nothing.|$|E
60|$|The <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> was {{a trifle}} perplexed by this talking {{over him and}} around him and at him. But he had been commended for his {{brilliant}} description of the socialist meeting and had further been detailed to get a personal interview with Martin Eden, {{the leader of the}} organized menace to society.|$|E
60|$|Over the coffee, in {{his little}} room, Martin read next morning's paper. It was a novel {{experience}} to find himself head-lined, {{on the first page}} at that; and he was surprised to learn that he was the most notorious leader of the Oakland socialists. He ran over the violent speech the <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> had constructed for him, and, though at first he was angered by the fabrication, in the end he tossed the paper aside with a laugh.|$|E
6000|$|They called Jake Oppenheimer the [...] "Human Tiger." [...] Some <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> {{coined the}} phrase that will long outlive {{the man to}} whom it was applied. And yet I ever found in Jake Oppenheimer all the {{cardinal}} traits of right humanness. He was faithful and loyal. I know of the times he has taken punishment in preference to informing on a comrade. He was brave. He was patient. He was capable of self-sacrifice--I could tell a story of this, but shall not take the time. And justice, with him, was a passion. The prison-killings done by him were due entirely to this extreme sense of justice. And he had a splendid mind. A lifetime in prison, ten years of it in solitary, had not dimmed his brain.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not know}} what all the talk was about. It was not necessary. Words like {{revolution}} gave him his cue. Like a paleontologist, able to reconstruct an entire skeleton from one fossil bone, he was able to reconstruct a whole speech from the one word revolution. He did it that night, and he did it well; and since Martin had made the biggest stir, he put it all into his mouth and made him the arch-anarch of the show, transforming his reactionary individualism into the most lurid, red- shirt socialist utterance. The <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> was an artist, and it was a large brush with which he laid on the local color--wild-eyed long-haired men, neurasthenia and degenerate types of men, voices shaken with passion, clenched fists raised on high, and all projected against a background of oaths, yells, and the throaty rumbling of angry men.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{meantime}} {{the world had}} begun to ask: [...] "Who is this Martin Eden?" [...] He had declined to give any biographical data to his publishers, but the newspapers {{were not to be}} denied. Oakland was his own town, and the reporters nosed out scores of individuals who could supply information. All that he was and was not, all that he had done and most of what he had not done, was spread out for the delectation of the public, accompanied by snapshots and photographs--the latter procured from the local photographer who had once taken Martin's picture and who promptly copyrighted it {{and put it on the}} market. At first, so great was his disgust with the magazines and all bourgeois society, Martin fought against publicity; but in the end, because it was easier than not to, he surrendered. He found that he could not refuse himself to the special writers who travelled long distances to see him. Then again, each day was so many hours long, and, since he no longer was occupied with writing and studying, those hours had to be occupied somehow; so he yielded to what was to him a whim, permitted interviews, gave his opinions on literature and philosophy, and even accepted invitations of the bourgeoisie. He had settled down into a strange and comfortable state of mind. He no longer cared. He forgave everybody, even the <b>cub</b> <b>reporter</b> who had painted him red and to whom he now granted a full page with specially posed photographs.|$|E
