Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) is considered as the independent predictors of assessing arterial stiffness. Basing on the principles of PWV measurement and equivalent electric circuit model of artery, we designed a low cost noninvasive human pulse wave velocity measuring device. Its <b>clinical</b> <b>experiment</b> involving 123 subjects was carried out. The device can acquire pulse wave signals by means of a self-made measurement circuit and PWV is calculated by custom-designed software based on LabVIEW. <b>Clinical</b> <b>experiment</b> shows that PWV can reflect the differences between hypertension and normal blood pressure. In addition, of the 123 subjects, 27 were detected by this device to have a tendency of artery hardening, 23 of them were validated by Doppler ultrasound diagnostic device.

40|$|Context: Neurofeedback {{represents}} an exciting complementary {{option in the}} treatment of depression that builds upon a huge body of research on electroencephalographic correlates of depression. Objective: the objectives of this article are threefold: review the literature on neurofeedback protocols for depression; introduce a new protocol, which aims to synthesize the best qualities of the currently available protocols; and present the results of a small <b>clinical</b> <b>experiment</b> with the new protocol. Method: Structured survey of the literature; software development; clinical trial with one subject, submitted to ten sessions of neurofeedback (one hour each). Results: Currently there are twenty-one articles in neurofeedback for depression, among which only six present original experimental results. All of them report positive results with the technique. the most used protocols focus on Alpha inter-hemispheric asymmetry, and Theta/Beta ratio within the left prefrontal cortex. Our new protocol integrates both dimensions in a single circuit, adding to it a third programming line, which divides Beta frequencies and reinforces the decrease of Beta- 3, in order to reduce anxiety. the favorable outcome of our <b>clinical</b> <b>experiment,</b> suggests that new research with this protocol is worthwhile.
