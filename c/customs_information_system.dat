Evidence shows that utilising information technology (IT) in customs matters supports import and export practices and ensures that supply chain management flows seamlessly. This paper briefly reviews some practical techniques for measuring performance. Its aim is to recommend a model for measuring the performance of information systems (IS) : in this case, the <b>Customs</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (CIS) used by the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD). The study evaluates the effectiveness of CIS implementation measures in Malaysia from an IT perspective. A model based on IS theories will be used {{to assess the impact of}} CIS.

This is {{significantly different from the}} EDI developments in the western countries in which private sector involvement in EDI is substantial (UNESCAP, 1996). As an initial step to spur EDI implementation in private sector, the Malaysian Government has imposed all companies that engage in international trade to implement EDI by doing electronic customs declarations through CIS (<b>Customs</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System)</b> DagangNet. For this, the Government also spent over RM 300 million to fully implement EDI nationwide (Star, 2003 December 3). Nevertheless, such implementation is not successful and it has been claimed that “EDI is not yet fully implemented even though it had been initiated since late 1990 s, besides electronic data is also still not recognized for legal customs declaration purposes even if it was meant for paperless and electronic customs declarations” (Star, 2003 December 3). To date, there are dual customs declarations, both electronic and manual, in practices where the sole typical electronic transaction is registration of the customs form (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11). This is in contrast with electronic customs declarations by other countries such as Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore where there is a full electronic declaration including electronic payment for declarations charges (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11; Chau, 2001) ...|$|E

40|$|The key {{functional}} operability in the pre-Lisbon PJCCM {{pillar of}} the EU is the exchange of intelligence and information amongst the law enforcement bodies of the EU. The twin issues of data protection and data security within what was the EU’s third pillar legal framework therefore come to the fore. With the Lisbon Treaty reform of the EU, and the increased role of the Commission in PJCCM policy areas, and {{the integration of the}} PJCCM provisions with what have traditionally been the pillar I activities of Frontex, the opportunity for streamlining the data protection and data security provisions of the law enforcement bodies of the post-Lisbon EU arises. This is recognised by the Commission in their drafting of an amending regulation for Frontex, when they say that they would prefer “to return to the question of personal data {{in the context of the}} overall strategy for information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflection to be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between agencies in the justice and home affairs field as requested by the Stockholm programme. ” The focus of the literature published on this topic, has for the most part, been on the data protection provisions in Pillar I, EC. While the focus of research has recently sifted to the previously Pillar III PJCCM provisions on data protection, a more focused analysis of the interlocking issues of data protection and data security needs to be made in the context of the law enforcement bodies, particularly with regard to those which were based in the pre-Lisbon third pillar. This paper will make a contribution to that debate, arguing that a review of both the data protection and security provision post-Lisbon is required, not only in order to reinforce individual rights, but also inter-agency operability in combating cross-border EU crime. The EC’s provisions on data protection, as enshrined by Directive 95 / 46 /EC, do not apply to the legal frameworks covering developments within the third {{pillar of the}} EU. Even Council Framework Decision 2008 / 977 /JHA, which is supposed to cover data protection provisions within PJCCM expressly states that its provisions do not apply to “Europol, Eurojust, the Schengen Information System (SIS) ” or to the <b>Customs</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (CIS). In addition, the post Treaty of Prüm provisions covering the sharing of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data and vehicle registration data pursuant to Council Decision 2008 / 615 /JHA, are not to be covered by the provisions of the 2008 Framework Decision. As stated by Hijmans and Scirocco, the regime is “best defined as a patchwork of data protection regimes”, with “no legal framework which is stable and unequivocal, like Directive 95 / 46 /EC in the First pillar”. Data security issues are also key to the sharing of data in organised crime or counterterrorism situations. This article will critically analyse the current legal framework for data protection and security within the third pillar of the EU...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} how the custom IS organizational culture influences ISD practices in organizations developing tailored <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> We studied four organizations by applying grounded theory and using organizational culture perspective as a lens to the data. The study provides example that illustrate the importance of partnership with customer in the perpetuation of a <b>custom</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> work community. It {{presents a}} community of practice that embodies the beliefs in customer satisfaction, growth from global markets and project work along with values of business domain knowledge, customer closeness and doing things right. This study shows how these beliefs and values are manifested in systems development practices and artifacts. Findings show evidence of traditional and customer driven practices aiming to gain a trusted partnership position among customers. The study reveals also the change process going on in those organizations competing in the global markets. This change manifests itself in more product-driven practices aiming to develop more repeatable solutions for multiple customers.

Overall, the findings suggest that both types of customers are either indecisive and/or doubtful with the performance of the CIS.

Computer-based applications that collect patients 2 ̆ 7 responses and transfer them to the treating health professional in real time {{have the potential to}} improve patient well-being and cancer outcomes. Objective: This study will test the feasibility and acceptability of a newly developed eHealth system which facilitates PRO data capture from cancer patients, data linkage and retrieval to support clinical decisions and patient self-management, and data retrieval to support ongoing evaluation and innovative research. Methods: The eHealth system is being developed in consultation with 3 overarching content-specific expert advisory groups convened for this project: the clinical advisory group, technical advisory group, and evaluation advisory group. The following work has already been completed during this phase of the study: the Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Personalized Treatment and Care (PROMPT-Care) eHealth system was developed, patient-reported outcomes were selected (distress, symptoms, unmet needs), algorithms to inform intervention thresholds for clinical and self-management were determined, clinician PRO feedback summary and longitudinal reports were designed, and patient self-management resources were collated. PROsaiq, a <b>custom</b> <b>information</b> technology <b>system,</b> will transfer PRO data in real time into the hospital-based oncology <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to support clinical decision making. The PROMPT-Care system feasibility and acceptability will be assessed through patients completing PROMPT-Care assessments, participating in face-to-face cognitive interviews, and completing evaluation surveys and telephone interviews and oncology staff participating in telephone interviews. Results: Over the course of 3 months, the system will be pilot-tested with up to 50 patients receiving treatment or follow-up care and 6 oncology staff at 2 hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Data will be collected to determine the accuracy and completeness of data transfer procedures, extent of missing data from participants 2 ̆ 7 assessments, acceptability of the eHealth system and usefulness of the self-management resources (via patient evaluation surveys and interviews), and acceptability and perceived usefulness of real-time PRO reporting (via oncology staff interviews) at the completion of the pilot phase.
