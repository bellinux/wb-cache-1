5|$|After Dumouriez's {{victory at}} Jemappes in November 1792, the French armies rapidly overran {{most of the}} Austrian Netherlands. Rather than driving the Austrians {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine River, Dumouriez and the French {{government}} became preoccupied with a war with the Dutch Republic. During the breathing space offered by her enemy, Austria assembled an army under the Prince of Coburg and struck back. After a French <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> was routed by Coburg at Aldenhoven, Dumouriez began gathering his army for a counterstroke.|$|E
5|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, the 3rd Australian Brigade—of which the 12th Battalion was part—was designated as the <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> for the ANZAC landing, and as such was the first unit ashore on 25 April 1915, at approximately 04:30. Newland {{was wounded in the}} days following the landing, suffering a gunshot wound to his arm, and was evacuated to the 1st General Hospital. While at the hospital, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 22 May, before returning to the 12th Battalion four days later.|$|E
5|$|But within minutes, the Do 17 {{formation}} {{had been}} reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged. Six had been shot down and four were attempting to make a run for home. The remainder dropped their bombs and were met by a <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home. They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E

5|$|C Squadron {{completed}} its training in New Zealand and {{was attached to}} the Second Echelon of the 2NZEF, in adherence with plans to send one squadron of the regiment to Egypt with the Second Echelon. The squadron was diverted to Britain, while en route to Egypt, when Italy entered the war, and arrived on 16 June. The squadron was based near Aldershot and conducted further training there. C Squadron became part of the Second Echelon's Headquarters <b>Covering</b> <b>Force,</b> defending Britain against German invasion. In early September, the squadron was moved to Westwell, Kent; it underwent further training and was sent back to Aldershot in November. C Squadron left Britain for Egypt on 4 January 1941.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, HMS King George V {{deployed}} {{in support of}} Convoy JW 51A, the first Russian convoy to sail direct from the United Kingdom without stopping at Iceland. The journey was completed without incident. On receiving word of the German naval attack on Convoy JW 51B in {{what became known as}} the Battle of the Barents Sea, King George V was dispatched along with nine other ships from Scapa Flow on 31 December to provide cover for the returning Convoy RA 51 and to attempt to catch the German ships engaged in the previous assault. The German ships were ultimately not encountered, and RA 51 was returned safely. King George V later provided a <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> for two further convoys during early 1943, before being transferred to the Mediterranean during May in preparation for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Promoted to commander on 30 June 1943, McNicoll took part in the Sicilian invasion the following month, with King George V serving as part of the <b>covering</b> <b>force.</b> Prior to the invasion, King George V, along with , had executed a bombardment of Trapani and the islands of Favignana and Levanzo on the night of 11/12 July, as part of a deception suggesting landings on the west coast of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Maryland steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to the 7th Fleet under Admiral Kinkaid. The fleet sortied 12 October and Maryland joined Task Group 77.2, which was the gunfire and <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> for the invasion of Leyte. She, along with four other battleships and numerous cruisers and destroyers, steamed into Leyte Gulf on the morning of 18 October. Maryland took position between Red and White Beaches and began bombarding them ahead of the invasion, which began at 10:00 20 October. Securing the beaches quickly, Maryland then took up a sentinel position in Leyte Gulf to guard the beaches against Japanese counterattack by sea.|$|E
50|$|Suomussalmi {{was taken}} with little {{resistance}} on December 7 (only two incomplete companies of <b>covering</b> <b>forces</b> led a holding action between {{the border and}} Suomussalmi), but the Finns destroyed the village before this, to deny the Soviets shelter, and withdrew to the opposite shore of lakes Niskanselkä and Haukiperä.|$|R
5000|$|Shō-Gō 1 {{called for}} Vice-Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa's ships—known as the [...] "Northern Force"—to lure the main American <b>covering</b> <b>forces</b> away from Leyte. Northern Force {{would be built}} around several {{aircraft}} carriers, but these would have very few aircraft or trained aircrew. The carriers would serve as the main bait. As the U.S. <b>covering</b> <b>forces</b> were lured away, two other surface forces would advance on Leyte from the west. The [...] "Southern Force" [...] under Vice Admirals Shoji Nishimura and Kiyohide Shima would strike at the landing area via the Surigao Strait. The [...] "Center Force" [...] under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita—by far {{the most powerful of}} the attacking forces—would pass through the San Bernardino Strait into the Philippine Sea, turn southwards, and then also attack the landing area.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of 11 September two columns {{prepared}} to march against the besieging forces. Jean Alexander Ihler left Maubeuge with 14,000 men, marching through Landrecies and Avesnes where he collected more men, and attacked the <b>covering</b> <b>forces.</b> He was beaten back, his command retreating [...] "in the greatest disorder".|$|R
5|$|For MacArthur's long-awaited {{return to}} the Philippines in October 1944, the Seventh Fleet was massively {{reinforced}} by Nimitz's Pacific Fleet. Kinkaid commanded the assault personally, with Barbey's VII Amphibious Force as Task Force 78, joined by Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson's III Amphibious Force from the Pacific Fleet as Task Force 79. Kinkaid was also given Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Task Force 77.2, a bombardment force built around six old battleships that had survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague's Task Force 77.4, a force of escort carriers. However, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Task Force 38, the <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> of the fast carriers and battleships, remained part of Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet, which was not under MacArthur or Kinkaid's command.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only were}} the {{advisers}} in danger from the enemy, {{but also from the}} men they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, like a number of other advisers subsequently, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied and went over to the Bolsheviks. While Brown was the only Australian to be killed, there was at least one other major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With these incidents becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, this could only be safely completed with the provision of a <b>covering</b> <b>force,</b> and until this could be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter.|$|E
5|$|November 1779 {{saw all the}} {{companies}} of the regiment being transferred to the Southern theatre of operations. In April 1780 the 64th {{was part of the}} <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> besieging Charleston, while the grenadier and light companies formed part of the main siege force. After the capture of Charleston, the grenadier and light companies were withdrawn to New York and as Major-General Cornwallis began to advance on Virginia, the 64th remained in Carolina as guard troops. In 1781 the 64th were involved in the Battle of Eutaw Springs and a year later in one of the last actions of the war, the Battle of the Combahee River. The grenadier company was reunited with the 64th but the light company was among the units that surrendered with Cornwallis at Yorktown.|$|E
25|$|Regardless, {{the much}} larger and better {{equipped}} Peruvian force of 13,000 men quickly overwhelmed the approximately 1,800 Ecuadorian <b>covering</b> <b>forces,</b> driving them back from the Zarumilla and invading the Ecuadorian province of El Oro. Peru also carried out limited aerial bombing of the Ecuadorian towns of Huaquillas, Arenillas, Santa Rosa, and Machala.|$|R
25|$|As {{the convoy}} began its {{preliminary}} movements, the <b>covering</b> <b>forces</b> planned by the Admiralty were moving to positions. Hamilton's First Cruiser Squadron left Seidisfjord {{in the night}} from 30 June-1 July. It arrived in a covering position north of the convoy on 2 July. The cruisers were not sighted by the Germans until late on 3 July.|$|R
50|$|Cimatu mobilized Task Force Inudaran {{from the}} Army 402nd Infantry Brigade and the 1st Marine Brigade under Brig. Gen. Emmanuel Teodosio which recaptured Kauswagan on March 18. The task force also cleared the Iligan-Dipolog highway where rebels {{had set up}} several roadblocks, and set up <b>covering</b> <b>forces</b> to protect {{vulnerable}} town centers while far-flung detachments were forced to hold their own against the enemy attacks.|$|R
5|$|Realizing that he {{had lost}} the initiative, was low on {{ammunition}} and food, and had more than 10,000 of his men killed, wounded, or missing, Beauregard could go no further. He withdrew beyond Shiloh Church, leaving 5,000 men under Breckinridge as a <b>covering</b> <b>force,</b> and massed Confederate batteries at the church and on the ridge south of Shiloh Branch. Confederate forces kept the Union men in position on the Corinth Road until 5 p.m., then began an orderly withdrawal southwest to Corinth. The exhausted Union soldiers did not pursue much farther than the original Sherman and Prentiss encampments. Lew Wallace's division crossed Shiloh Branch and advanced nearly , but received no support from other units and was recalled. They returned to Sherman's camps at dark. The battle was over.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} started advancing {{towards the}} village, the 8th Squadron on the left, and the 10th with the 1st Squadron on the right. Covered by their machine-guns, but under heavy Turkish fire, they gradually moved forward on foot. Troops took turns to run forward {{while the rest}} of the squadron covered them. The intensity of the battle was demonstrated by the Inverness Battery Royal Horse Artillery, which was supporting the brigade and ran out of ammunition at 14:00. Two hours later the division's <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> reported Turkish reinforcements approaching, and Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode, who was commanding the attack, decided to call it off. Almost simultaneously Edward Chaytor, commanding the brigade, ordered another attack. Covered by their machine-guns the men carried out a bayonet charge and the Turks to their front surrendered. By this time the other brigades had started to withdraw, but seeing what had happened, they turned back and also charge, capturing the position. The battle cost the regiment six dead and nineteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|Tri Sviatitelia and Rostislav bombarded Ottoman fortifications at {{the mouth}} of the Bosphorus on 18 March 1915, but only fired 105 rounds before sailing north to rejoin the <b>covering</b> <b>force.</b> Tri Sviatitelia and Rostislav were to have {{repeated}} the bombardment the following day, but heavy fog prevented the operation. On 3 April, Goeben and several ships of the Turkish navy raided the Russian port at Odessa; the Russian battleship squadron sortied to intercept them. The battleships chased Goeben the entire day, but were unable to reach effective gunnery range and were forced to break off the chase. On 25 April Tri Sviatitelia and Rostislav repeated their bombardment of the Bosporus forts. Sviatitelia, Rostislav and Panteleimon bombarded the forts again on 2 and 3 May. However, this time a total of 337 main gun rounds were fired in addition to a total of 528 six-inch shells between the three battleships.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{his command}} {{decision}} was {{the designation of}} the civilian commando unit as the attacking force, while elements of the 15th BCT served as the holding or <b>covering</b> <b>forces.</b> Had it been otherwise, the wily Capadocia {{would have had the}} government forces running around at circles as they were handicapped in the rough terrain. Capadocia's death was the consummation of Major Santos' bold plan.|$|R

She subsequently sailed to the US for permanent repairs, which were completed in August. She {{then returned to the}} UK and joined the 10th Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow, where she was assigned to the <b>covering</b> <b>forces</b> of the Arctic convoys.|$|R
5|$|Another command change {{occurred}} on June 22. In addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant {{had to be}} concerned with Confederate forces in his rear under the command of Joseph E. Johnston. He stationed one division {{in the vicinity of the}} Big Black River Bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as Mechanicsburg, both to act as a <b>covering</b> <b>force.</b> By June 10, the IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at Canton, from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele replaced him at the XV Corps. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson. Sherman would eventually pursue Johnston and (re)capture Jackson on July 17.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00 on August 29, the North Koreans {{attacked}} C Company again. Men on {{the left}} flank of the company position quickly abandoned their positions and soon the entire company was retreating, leaving the North Koreans in possession of the mountain again. Captain Lawrence M. Corcoran, the company commander, was left with only the 17 men in his command post, which included several wounded. All of those who stayed were later given Bronze Star Medals. After daylight on August 30, UN air strikes again came in on Battle Mountain, and US artillery, mortar, and tank fire from the valley concentrated on the North Korean-held peak. A wounded US soldier came down off the mountain where he had hidden for several hours while cut off from escape. He reported that {{the main body of}} the North Koreans had withdrawn to the wooded ridges west of the peak for better cover from the airstrikes, leaving only a small <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> on the mountain itself. At 11:00, B Company, which had to this point been the reserve unit, with the 3rd Battalion in support, attacked toward the heights and retook the top by 13:00. The poor defensive positions were repaired but logistical difficulties continued for the US troops at the top.|$|E
5|$|Force One {{departed}} the Home Fleet's base at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on 30 March, {{three days}} after JW 58 had sailed from Loch Ewe in Scotland. Force Two departed separately later that day. The convoy comprised 49 merchant ships escorted by a powerful force of 33 warships, including two escort carriers. German reconnaissance aircraft located JW 58 on 30 March, {{and all of the}} U-boats in the Norwegian Sea were directed to intercept it. The German aircraft did not conduct wider-ranging sorties in search of the convoy's battleship <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> or other Allied ships. A total of 17 U-boats attacked JW 58 between 1 and 3 April without success; none of the Allied ships suffered any damage, and the escorts sank four U-boats and shot down six German aircraft during the convoy's voyage from Scotland to the Soviet Union. JW 58 reached its destination at Kola Bay on 6 April. While several Allied aircraft were lost during the voyage, mostly to flying accidents, all of the ships arrived unscathed.|$|E
5000|$|Ivanov {{wrote that}} Germans {{exploited}} the Soviet [...] "carelessness, complacency {{and hope that}} Germans will do nothing serious, confining themselves to provocations". He notes that [...] "despite the obvious signs of a large concentration of German troops, {{the commander of the}} Kiev Military District forbade the deployment of <b>covering</b> <b>forces,</b> as well as bringing troops into combat readiness, especially strengthening them even after the shelling of the state border and air raids" [...] began.|$|R
25|$|British naval {{intelligence}} in June reported the Germans' intention {{to bring out}} major naval units to attack the next eastbound convoy, east of Bear Island. Thus German forces would operate close to the Norwegian coast, with support of shore-based air reconnaissance and striking forces, with a screen of U-boats in the channels between Spitsbergen and Norway. Allied <b>covering</b> <b>forces,</b> on the other hand, would be without air support, one thousand miles from their base, and with the destroyers too short on fuel to escort a damaged ship to harbour.|$|R
50|$|For {{the next}} 11 days, the cruiser {{delivered}} fire {{support for the}} right flank of the Army's advance to the Italian frontier. She engaged German shore batteries and fought off air attacks. The raids—conducted by Junkers Ju 88s and Dornier Do 217s singly, or in small groups—usually occurred during the <b>covering</b> <b>force's</b> nightly retirement from the beachheads. Of the high altitude variety, these aerial assaults included the use of radar-controlled glider bombs. However, radar counter-measures and jamming devices, as well as effective evasive action and gunfire, thwarted these twilight and nocturnal attacks.|$|R
5|$|The 49th Battalion was {{originally}} formed on 27 February 1916 {{as part of}} an expansion of the all-volunteer Australian Imperial Force, which took place after the failed Gallipoli Campaign, during the First World War. The expansion was undertaken by raising a new division in Australia– the 3rd Division– and by splitting the battalions of the veteran 1st Division in Egypt, using its experienced personnel to provide cadre staff for new battalions that would form the 4th and 5th Divisions. The 2nd Division, which had been sent to Gallipoli late in the campaign, remained intact. Upon formation, the 49th Battalion was assigned to the 13th Brigade, which was part of the 4th Division. The battalion drew its cadre staff– a total of 14 officers and 500 other ranks– from the 9th, which had been raised primarily from volunteers from the state of Queensland and had been {{in the thick of the}} fighting at Gallipoli, having come ashore during the landing at Anzac Cove in the first wave as part of the <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> provided by the 3rd Brigade. A further three officers and 470 other ranks from Australia brought the battalion up to full strength. The battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Francis Lorenzo, who had previously served with the 10th Battalion, and it had an authorised strength of 1,023 officers and other ranks.|$|E
5|$|McCann {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 24 August 1914 at Morphettville, South Australia. He was allotted to the South Australian-raised 10th Battalion, part of the 3rd Brigade, as a private with the regimental number 405. Within a week he had been {{promoted}} to sergeant. The battalion embarked for overseas in October, and sailed via Albany, Western Australia, to Egypt, arriving in early December. While the force was training in Egypt he was appointed as a platoon sergeant in the battalion's D Company. After completing training, the 3rd Brigade was designated as the <b>covering</b> <b>force</b> for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915, {{and so was the}} first brigade ashore about 4:30 am. Four days later McCann was appointed as company sergeant major. During that period, the 10th Battalion suffered casualties of 13 officers and 453 men. On 19 May the battalion helped fight off a concerted Turkish counter-attack against the landing force, after which it settled into a routine of rotating through various positions in the line. Due to his outstanding service during the period 6 May to 28 June McCann was mentioned several times in Australian and New Zealand Army Corps routine orders. In July, McCann and most of the battalion had a three day rest on the island of Imbros, but were quickly back in the trenches at Anzac. McCann was commissioned in the rank of second lieutenant on 4 August, by which time nearly half of the battalion had been evacuated sick with dysentery. He was promoted to lieutenant on 14 November. McCann remained at Anzac, serving as battalion intelligence and signalling officer, until the unit was withdrawn to the island of Lemnos in late November, followed by evacuation to Egypt the following month.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Battalion was an {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army {{that served as}} part of the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. Among the first units raised in Australia during the war, the battalion was recruited from South Australia in August 1914 and along with the 9th, 11th and 12th Battalions, it formed part of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division. After its personnel completed basic training, the battalion embarked for the Middle East, where further training was undertaken in Egypt before the battalion was committed to the Gallipoli Campaign. On 25 April 1915, the 10th Battalion took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove, coming ashore during the initial stages of the operation {{as part of the}} <b>covering</b> <b>force.</b> Members from the 10th Battalion penetrated the furthest inland of any Australian troops during the initial fighting, before the Allied advance inland was checked. After this, the battalion helped defend the beachhead against a Turkish counter-attack in May, before joining the August Offensive, a failed Allied effort to break the deadlock. Casualties were heavy throughout the campaign and in November 1915, the surviving members were withdrawn from the peninsula and in early 1916 the battalion was reformed in Egypt. After a period of reorganisation, during which the 10th provided a cadre staff to the newly formed 50th Battalion, it was transferred to the Western Front in March 1916, and for the next two-and-a-half years took part in trench warfare in France and Belgium until the Armistice in 1918. The last detachment of men from the 10th Battalion returned to Australia in September 1919.|$|E
50|$|Having {{evacuated}} Milan {{after the}} Five Days of Milan on 22 March 1848, field marshal Radetzky regrouped his {{forces in the}} Quadrilatero, composed of the four supporting fortresses of Peschiera, Mantua, Verona and Legnago. The Piedmontese army advanced across Lombardy, brushing aside the <b>covering</b> <b>forces</b> under major general Wohlgemuth guarding the bridge over the Mincio at Goito during an engagement on 9 April 1848. The Austrians tried but failed to destroy the Goito bridge. Once across the Mincio, the Piedmontese forces fanned out towards the north and south.|$|R
25|$|Marshal Soult's 13:00 letter {{ordering}} Grouchy to {{move quickly}} to join Napoleon and to attack Bülow arrived after 18:00. Grouchy at once began gathering additional divisions and headed to Limal, arriving at 23:00, where he found that Pajol's cavalry had forced the bridge there. Prussian scouting cavalry noticed the strong French columns moving to Limal and the Prussian 12th Brigade moved <b>covering</b> <b>forces</b> to the area. The Prussians made a bayonet charge {{in an attempt to}} retake Limal, but without success. Night closed the major actions of the battle of Wavre, although outposts fired on each other all night.|$|R
