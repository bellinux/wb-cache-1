40|$|GaAs MMICs offer {{significant}} {{advantages for}} space applications. As the technology reaches maturity and as applications are being identified, GMMT together with ESA have embarked upon {{the first stage}} of space qualification of the GMMT GaAs foundry. The most appropriate procedure for qualification of a foundry process which is required to produce relatively small quantities {{of a wide range of}} custom designs is <b>capability</b> <b>approval.</b> This paper presents results from the early stages of the evaluation phase of the ESA <b>capability</b> <b>approval</b> programme which is currently underway...|$|E
50|$|The {{continuation}} {{and end of}} the NATC-A {{mission is}} dependent upon two conditions: the successful development of AAF <b>capabilities</b> and the <b>approval</b> of a defense and security agreement between GIROA and countries participating in the NATC-A mission.|$|R
50|$|SAP NetWeaver Identity Management {{software}} {{is a tool}} used to manage the full identity life cycle of users - from joining the organization, moving across positions inside the organization. It takes care for user access, provide user access according to current business roles, and manage passwords with self-service <b>capabilities</b> and <b>approval</b> workflows. Also when a user is leaving the organization it automatically deprovisions user access rights. Normally the life cycle changes come through integration with SAP Human Capital Management or SAP Success Factors.|$|R
50|$|The Grob G 520 is a {{turboprop}} long endurance, {{high altitude}} reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft built by Grob Aircraft with short runway <b>capabilities</b> and full <b>approval</b> for all-weather IFR/icing operations acc. to LBA/FAA Part 23 regulations. Developed and certified in 1991, the Grob G 520 {{is one of}} the worldâ€™s largest fully composite manned aircraft and a several world record holder, whose production is resumed in 2014.|$|R
40|$|The Technical Work Plan Tracking Tool is {{a web-based}} {{application}} that enables interactive communication and approval of contract requirements that {{pertain to the}} administration of the Science, Engineering, Analysis, and Test (SEAT) contract at Johnson Space Center. The implementation of the application has (1) shortened the Technical Work Plan approval process, (2) facilitated writing and documenting requirements in a performance-based environment with associated surveillance plans, (3) simplified the contractor s estimate of the cost for the required work, and (4) allowed for the contractor to document how they plan to accomplish the work. The application is accessible to over 300 designated NASA and contractor employees via two Web sites. For each employee, the application regulates access according to the employee s authority to enter, view, and/or print out diverse information, including reports, work plans, purchase orders, and financial data. Advanced features of this application include on-line <b>approval</b> <b>capability,</b> automatic e-mail notifications requesting review by subsequent approvers, and security inside and outside the firewall...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{knowledge}} sharing {{has become a}} strategic source of gaining and preserving competitive advantage. Acquiring this advantage requires solutions and approaches that make the organizations capable of measuring their {{knowledge sharing}} capabilities. The initial goal {{of this paper is}} to present an applied model for measuring the knowledge sharing capability through the identification of the most approved and practical measurement indicators in this area. In the next step, there has been an attempt to statistically validate and localize the indicators and keep those indicators, which are sufficiently able to measure the knowledge sharing <b>capability</b> by the <b>approval</b> of the experts in the field. Afterwards, the final model has been evaluated in three public universities of Iran, namely Sharif University of Technology, University of Tehran and Amir Kabir University of Technology for identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each university and specifying knowledge sharing capability and the path for improving quality of knowledge management in these universities. Finally, a set of guidelines and future research directions has been provided for interested practitioners and scholars...|$|R
