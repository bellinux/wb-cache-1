500|$|The {{production}} {{version of}} the AMX-30 was fitted with Hispano-Suiza's HS-110 diesel engine, located {{in the rear of}} the hull. The [...] engine could be replaced on the field in 45 minutes, and produced , offering the tank a maximum velocity of [...] on roads. The fuel efficient engine, in conjunction with a total fuel capacity of , gave the AMX-30 a maximum road range of up to [...] The engine's drive is taken through a Gravina G.H.B.200C twin-plate <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch.</b> The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward gears and five reverse gears. This transmission was heavily influenced by that of the German Panther tank and was based on a project which had begun in 1938. The transmission was one of the AMX-30's major faults and caused a variety of mechanical problems, including that the driver would have to manually change gears at specific times, even if the tank was moving over rough terrain. The tank's weight is distributed over five double, aluminum-alloy, rubber-tyred road wheels on either side, propelled on [...] wide tracks. The tank could ford [...] deep water obstacles without preparation, up to [...] with minor preparation, and up to [...] with full preparation. Full preparation for water operations consisted of the addition of a snorkel tube, the installation of blanking plates, carried on the front of the hull, over the engine compartment's air intake louvers, and the installment of infra-red driving equipment, including a searchlight. In 1969 a single special dive training vehicle was adapted, nicknamed the AMX 30 Gloutte (from French faire glouglou, [...] "gurgle"), without engine and tracks, that over a ramp could quickly be lowered into a reservoir by a winch; it was equipped with an escape tube.|$|E
50|$|Early {{semi-automatic}} systems used {{a variety}} of mechanical and hydraulic systems—including <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches,</b> torque converters, electro-mechanical (and even electrostatic) and servo/solenoid controlled clutches—and control schemes—automatic declutching when moving the gearstick, pre-selector controls, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches</b> with drum-sequential shift requiring the driver to lift the throttle for a successful shift, etc.—and some were little more than regular lock-up torque converter automatics with manual gear selection.|$|R

5|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, {{heavy metals}} {{are used for}} ballast in boats, aeroplanes, and motor vehicles; or in balance weights on wheels and crankshafts, gyroscopes, and propellers, and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches,</b> in situations requiring maximum weight in minimum space (for example in watch movements).|$|R
2500|$|Another {{example of}} a {{rotating}} device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified {{used to describe the}} system behavior is the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch.</b> [...] A <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension. [...] At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the spring tension, due to the outer drum, the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces. [...] The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the output drive shaft that is connected to the drum. Thus the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, {{a second}} {{prototype}} was constructed, {{this time with}} a Metro-Cammell body and, again equipped with a O.350 engine fitted across the frame.

Leyland christened this prototype the Lowloader.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1975, a {{base model}} called the 2CV Spécial was {{introduced}} with the 435cc engine. Between 1975 and 1990 {{under the name}} of AZKB [...] "2CV Spécial" [...] a drastically reduced trim basic version was sold, at first only in yellow. The small, square speedometer (which dates back to the Traction Avant), and the narrow rear bumper was installed. In order to keep the price as low as possible, Citroën removed the third side window, the ashtray, and virtually all trim from the car. It also had the earlier round headlights. From the 1978 Paris Motor Show the Spécial regained third side windows, and was available in red and white; beginning in mid-1979 the 602cc engine was installed. In June 1981 the Spécial E arrived; this model had a standard <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> and particularly low urban fuel consumption.|$|E
50|$|Disneyland, in Anaheim, California, was {{building}} its Autopia automobile track and commissioned Bill Tritt and Glasspar {{to build the}} fiberglass car bodies. They were small, single-seat, self-powered cars using Briggs and Stratton lawn-mower type engines with <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches.</b> The cars were originally designed to use aluminum wrap-around bumpers provided by Kaiser Aluminum, but later changed to the more suitable steel.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the {{centrifugal}} force can be applied in rotating devices, such as centrifuges, centrifugal pumps, centrifugal governors, and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches,</b> and in <b>centrifugal</b> railways, planetary orbits and banked curves, when they are analyzed in a rotating coordinate system. The term has sometimes also been used for the reactive centrifugal force that is a reaction to a centripetal force.|$|R
50|$|Mini {{choppers}} use {{a variety}} of engines although the most typical would be a Briggs & Stratton or Tecumseh horizontal shaft industrial engine with a non-tapered shaft. Other engines include small motorcycle engines and power sport engines such as ATV and dirt bike engines. If an industrial engine is used,some sort of transmission also needs to be used to apply power to the rear wheel. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>clutches,</b> which allow the engine to idle without moving the chopper, are also used however they result in a fixed gear ratio for both low and higher speed operation. However, some people opt to make a jackshaft, which allows the builder to change the gear ratio to his liking or to change which side the axle sprocket is on.|$|R
5000|$|Cars with a Saxomat clutch did {{not have}} a clutch pedal. The Saxomat {{consisted}} of two independent systems: the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch,</b> and the servo clutch.

50|$|Records {{show that}} {{approximately}} {{one hundred and}} sixty-seven Streco Turnpike Cruisers were built, and fourteen amusement parks {{are known to have}} ordered the cars, which were powered by single-cylinder Kohler Company K-Series engines through matched <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches</b> at governed speeds of approximately six to eight miles per hour in single file along pre-fixed guideways and/or on winding pathways and, in some parks, with a fixed center guiderail to limit lateral motion. Streco Turnpike Cruiser bodies were constructed of solid fiberglass, and featured prominent tailfins (in conjunction with the fashion of the period), and also full wraparound bumpers for driver/passenger protection. The first series Streco cars were distinguished by standard twin-headlamp configurations, with the more rugged second series cars distinguishable by their quad headlamps.|$|R
50|$|In April 1953, Simplex added a {{variable}} speed automatic transmission with <b>centrifugal</b> shoe-type <b>clutch</b> and belt-type automatic transmission.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} an {{automatic}} power train for two-wheelers and it is {{carried out in the}} framework of the Italian MUSS project. Environmental issues are currently within the main topics on which vehicle design is focused. In this context, two wheelers have to face many challenges {{and one of them is}} to reduce the loss of efficiency in the power train. Motor-scooters are currently quite always equipped with CVT transmission with rubber belt. This kind of transmission can be very cheap to manufacture, it has good comfort performance but has a mechanical efficiency of just 80 % – 85 % in the best working conditions. In this work the study of an automatic transmission and its application to a small displacement motor-scooter are presented. In order to keep low manufacturing costs and a high comfort typical of the CVT, improving its efficiency at the same time, the studied system is based on a discrete ratio gear box with mechanical control. The transmission has gears and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches</b> and free-wheels which mechanically control the gear shift. A dynamic model of the transmission and results of a typical acceleration manoeuvre are presented and discussed in the paper...|$|R
5000|$|A {{significant}} reason motorcycle drag racers lagged {{in implementing}} delay box electronics {{is due to}} the wide variety of driveline configurations on dragbikes. Of the successful bracket racing drag race cars, most had automatic transmissions equipped with transbrakes. Innovation quickly adapted the delay box to cars with dual line locks (devices which locked the brakes on all four wheels electrically), and manual transmissions {{with the use of a}} hydraulic throw out bearing to hold the clutch plates apart, and also adapted to dragbikes that used pneumatics or hydraulics to actuate the <b>clutch</b> release, or <b>centrifugal</b> dragbike <b>clutches</b> known as [...] "slider clutches" [...] that engage with the engine's revolutions per minute (RPM) increase. When using a delay box on a motorcycle with a slider clutch, the engine RPM is electronically controlled (capped) by an electronic rev limiter connected to a delay box. When the delay box times out, the engine is allowed to freely rev-up engaging the clutch and launching the motorcycle downtrack. As you can see, delay boxes can be used on both cars and motorcycles. A transmission brake is not required to use a delay box for drag racing. When racers were educated to this, and also shown ways to utilize delay boxes on motorcycles, there was some alleviation of the early controversy.|$|R
5000|$|Commercial Motor {{carried a}} review of the Graiseley PCV in 1940, which stated that this model had been in service with {{commercial}} operators, including bakeries and dairies, for two years. It came with a [...] motor, and was designed to travel at 3 mph, with a range of 8 to 10 mi on normal door-to-door delivery work. It could be supplied as a flat platform truck, with an open body suitable for milk delivery, or as a closed van, suitable for delivering bread. The motor, gearbox and an automatic clutch were mounted on the single front wheel forks. A chain formed part of the final drive. The control system included a contactor manufactured by British Thompson-Houston, and the <b>centrifugal</b> drum <b>clutch</b> was designed to engage when the motor reached 250 revs per minute, providing a smooth start without the need for starting resistors. The three-wheeled PCV was produced in three sizes, the Model 60, with a payload of 8-10 cwt, the Model 75, with a 12-15 cwt payload, and the Model 90, which could carry 22 cwt. Because the primary focus was on the dairy industry, the model numbers represented the number of imperial gallons of milk that could be carried.|$|R
50|$|Typically a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> and sprocket.The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> expands with raising {{spinning}} speed towards a drum. On this drum sits either a fixed sprocket or an exchangeable one. The clutch has three jobs to do: When the saw runs idle (typically 2500-2700 rpm) the chain does not move. When the clutch is engaged and the chain {{stops in the}} wood or another reason, it protects the engine. Most important it protects the operator {{in case of a}} kickback. Here the chain break stops the drum and the clutch releases immediately.|$|E
