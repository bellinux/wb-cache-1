50|$|In 1844, the Julien Brothers, Parisian pâtissiers, {{invented the}} Savarin, which is {{strongly}} {{inspired by the}} baba au rhum but is soaked with a different alcoholic mixture and uses a circular (ring) <b>cake</b> <b>mould</b> instead of the simple round (cylindrical) form. The ring form is nowadays often associated with the baba au rhum as well, and the name Savarin is also sometimes given to the rum-soaked circular cake.|$|E

500|$|In 1900, {{antiquarian}} George Clinch {{investigated the}} Biddenden Maids in detail. Examining the costumes {{of the figures}} on the Biddenden <b>cake</b> <b>moulds,</b> he concluded that the style of dress depicted dated from the reign of Mary I (1553–1558), a date roughly consistent with the [...] "two {{hundred and fifty years}} ago" [...] reported in 1775, and concluded that the tradition had originated in the 16th century. He suggested that the [...] "1100" [...] date on Biddenden cakes had originally read [...] "1500", and explained the absence of names on prints of 18th century Biddenden cakes as an engraving error. It is likely that the <b>cake</b> <b>moulds</b> examined by Clinch were not the original moulds, as the designs Clinch examined are strikingly different to the earliest surviving drawings of Biddenden cakes, published in 1775. Writing in the early 1930s, William Coles Finch explains the confusion over the dates, saying [...] "the old-fashioned numeral five is so frequently taken as a one". He lamented the quality of the Biddenden cake then being produced, compared to that of former years. Coles Finch stated that the villagers considered the then-current cake to be unleavened bread.|$|R
50|$|Each set of offerings usually {{contains}} seven traditional items: {{the cigarette}} nipah leaves and tobacco, betel nut and sireh leaves, glutinous rice in a hand-woven leave container (senupat), rice cakes (tumpi), sungki (glutinous rice cooked in buwan leaves), glutinuos rice cooked in bamboo logs (asi pulut lulun), penganan iri (cakes of glutinous rice flour mixed with nipah sugar), ant nest <b>cakes</b> and <b>moulded</b> <b>cakes,</b> poprice (made from glutinous paddy grains heated in a wok or pot), hard-boiled chicken eggs and tuak rice wine poured over or {{contained in a}} small bamboo cup.|$|R
5000|$|The petals of violets {{have long}} been used in {{herbalism}} for their medicinal properties, even mentioned by Dioscorides. [...] "Violet tables", a sugary lozenge flavoured with violets, was made before 1620. During the 18th century, crushed violet petals, rosewater and sugar were combined to make an early type of candy known as flower pastry. These {{could be used for}} flavouring a <b>cake,</b> or <b>moulded</b> into pastils and eaten as sweets. In the Edwardian era, violet flavored chocolate and liquor were used to relieve sickness.|$|R
50|$|Other stories do {{not give}} the cake a Lorraine origin and lay its {{invention}} {{at the feet of}} pastry chef Jean Avice, who worked in the kitchens of Prince Talleyrand. Avice is said to have invented the Madeleine in the 19th century by baking little <b>cakes</b> in aspic <b>moulds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The cake has a firm yet light texture. It is eaten with tea or (occasionally) {{for breakfast}} and is {{traditionally}} flavoured with lemon. Dating back to an original recipe in the 18th or 19th century, Madeira cake {{is similar to a}} pound cake or yellow cake. One of the earliest published recipes was by Eliza Acton in her Modern Cookery for Private Families (1845): [...] "A Good Madeira Cake: Whisk four fresh eggs until they are as light as possible, then, continuing still to whisk them, throw by slow degrees the following ingredients in the order in which they are written: six ounces of dry pounded and sifted sugar; six of flour, also dried and sifted; four ounces of butter just dissolved, but not heated; the rind of a fresh lemon; and the instant before the <b>cake</b> is <b>moulded</b> beat well in the third of a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda: bake an hour in a moderate oven." ...|$|R
40|$|Biorefinery of {{sunflower}} whole {{plant can}} be conducted with water using a nine modules Clextral Evolum HT 53 twin-screw extruder (TSE). Aqueous extraction of oil is an environmentally cleaner alternative technology to solvent extraction. TSE carries out three unit operations: conditioning and grinding, liquid/solid (L/S) extraction and L/S separation. The compressing {{action by the}} reverse screws (CF 2 C) is essential for L/S separation. Positioned in module 9, CF 2 C screws push part of the mixture upstream against the general movement in TSE, and this counter pressure ensures the L/S separation efficiency above the metal filter, located in eighth position. Oil is extracted {{in the form of}} two emulsions, stabilized by phospholipids and proteins, and usable as co-emulsifiers in cosmetic industry. An aqueous extract containing water-soluble components from whole plant is also generated; it could be recycled. As a mixture of fibers and proteins, the <b>cake</b> can be <b>moulded</b> by thermo-pressing into boards, usable in the furniture and building industries. In this study, fractionation was conducted from next inlet flow rates: 54 kg/h solid and 183 kg/h water (3. 4 L/S ratio). The screw speed varied from 249 to 124 rpm, corresponding to a filling coefficient (ratio of the solid inlet flow rate to the screw speed) from 217 to 436 g/h rpm. The filling coefficient directly affects the L/S separation efficiency. The latter can be estimated from next experimental data: the outlet flow rates of both cake and filtrate, the cake moisture content, the residual contents of oil and water-soluble components in the cake, and the extraction yields in dry matter, lipids and water-soluble components. For low filling coefficients (i. e. high screw speed), the L/S mixture compression in CF 2 C screws is insufficient, not allowing a satisfactory L/S separation. Conversely, for high filling coefficients (i. e. low screw speed), solid particles accumulate more upstream from the pressing zone, obstructing part of the filtering screens and thus reducing the filtration surface. A less efficient L/S separation is then observed. From the experimental data evolution, optimal screw speed was estimated at 182 rpm using a second order polynomial regression, corresponding to a filling coefficient of 297 g/h rpm. Extraction yields in dry matter, lipids and water-soluble components were 22 %, 49 % and 40 %, respectively. Such filling would lead to a specific mechanical energy of 103 W/h kg whole plant processed...|$|R
