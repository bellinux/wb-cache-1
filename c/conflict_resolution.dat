5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution,</b> peace movements, war refugees, <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution</b> and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E

The influential interest-based model for <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution,</b> negotiation, and mediation developed by Fisher, Ury, and Patton at the Harvard Negotiation Project in the 1980s {{appears to have}} some conceptual overlap with NVC, although neither model references the other. Little suggests The Gordon Model for Effective Relationships (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based negotiation, based on conceptual similarities, if not any direct evidence of a connection. Like Rosenberg, Gordon had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models' similarities may reflect common influences.|$|E

The contributions are twofold. First, <b>conflict</b> <b>resolutions</b> are classified based on agent types, and formalized in {{an extension of}} Reiter’s normal default logic. Second, several desiderata for <b>conflict</b> <b>resolutions</b> are introduced, discussed and tested on the logic.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, an {{interesting}} area of Brazilian military and civil sectors is the Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV) development. This article tackles the modeling of <b>conflicts</b> <b>resolution</b> of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) using a lightweight Duration Calculus (DC) to verify if the temporal specification and design {{of the system is}} correct and to ensure formally that the system implementation meets all its requirements. Moreover, the article proposes a formal modeling (using DC) of a <b>conflicts</b> <b>resolutions</b> set of rules, adapted from Free Flight concept in Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM). In the adapted approach to UAS, each UAV is surrounded by an imaginary space of two cylinders, which form, respectively, the protected zone and the alert zone. The major contribution of this article is structuring a new scenario application of the <b>conflicts</b> <b>resolution</b> to UAS through formal modeling, using the DC technique to confirm that the models could be implemented without deadlocks and unreachable states, as well as with satisfaction of temporal restrictions. Furthermore, this work uses the state-of-the-art practices in formal methods, including a model checking tool to ensuring correct real-time requirements specification of a real-time critical system.

5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo theme opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to C minor, subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this theme, beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to F major as V of B-flat. The second theme, in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second theme uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) of the remarkable C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of <b>conflict</b> <b>resolution.</b> After an abrupt end to the second theme and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm chordal theme in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third theme is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the C minor sonata, which may not be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This theme evolves into a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main theme of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo theme, is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on C-flat major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main theme. In the coda, the main theme is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the theme. After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with an exceedingly triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E

The departures delay resulting from the optimised runways scheduling is compared to the total ground delay that can be measured by simulation, when all the taxiing constraints of aircraft are introduced. During traffic peaks, the runways capacity appears to be twice less penalizing than the whole airport traffic management process. As a consequence, some optimisation methods are defined and tested to perform the <b>conflicts</b> <b>resolution</b> between taxiing aircraft and make it more consistent with the runways scheduling.
