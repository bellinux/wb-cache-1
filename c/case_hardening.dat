5|$|Among {{the lighter}} metalloids, alloys with {{transition}} metals are well-represented. Boron can form intermetallic compounds and alloys with such metals {{of the composition}} MnB, if n > 2. Ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or <b>case</b> <b>hardening)</b> and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E

25|$|<b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> {{describes}} lumber or timber {{that has}} been dried too rapidly. Wood initially dries from the shell (surface), shrinking the shell and putting the core under compression. When this shell is at a low moisture content it will 'set' and resist shrinkage. The core of the wood is still at a higher moisture content. This core will then begin to dry and shrink. However, any shrinkage is resisted by the already 'set' shell. This leads to reversed stresses; compression stresses on the shell and tension stresses in the core. This results in unrelieved stress called <b>case</b> <b>hardening.</b> Case-hardened wood may warp considerably and dangerously when the stress is released by sawing.|$|E

Finally he had the proof marks relocated to less conspicuous areas of the firearms in keeping with Italian law and enhancing their appearance.|$|E
