5|$|Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for {{products}} such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project {{was picked up by}} 20th Century Fox. Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, Rob Reger {{has been}} trying to make a feature film {{adaptation}} of Emily. In 2005, it was reported that Fox Animation would make a live action/animated feature film, with Chris Meledandri and John Cohen producing it. In 2008, it was reported that Mike Richardson, of Dark Horse Entertainment, had <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> as a producer. The same year it was unofficially reported that the film had moved to Universal Studios' owned Illumination Entertainment, along with the studio's founders, Meledandri and Cohen. In September 2010, it was reported that Universal Studios had acquired the rights to the comic, and that the actress Chloë Grace Moretz had been cast in the role of Emily. In August 2011, it was announced that Melisa Wallack, who wrote the script for Mirror Mirror, had been hired to write the adaptation. Two months later it was confirmed that the film was indeed in the works at Illumination Entertainment. Kealan O’Rourke will rewrite the film's script. In December 2016, it was reported that Universal had abandoned the project, and that Dark Horse Entertainment and Amazon Studios were in negotiations to make an animated film.|$|E

In the official comic book prequel to the 2009 movie Star Trek, Worf is a General in the Klingon Empire who is dispatched to deal with Romulan Captain Nero and his significantly altered mining vessel, the Narada. When the Klingon forces suffer a crushing defeat, Worf agrees to Nero's demand to board a shuttle and <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the Narada. Worf takes the opportunity to surprise Nero, cutting into the Narada's hull and fighting his way to the main bridge for a confrontation with Nero. Already prepared for such a tactic, Nero succeeds in surprising Worf by impaling him through the back with a large mechanical tentacle. When the Enterprise-E arrives to do battle with the Narada, Nero agrees to beam Worf over if the ship will lower its shields. When Captain Data agrees, Worf is beamed back to the ship, giving the Narada time to fire on the Enterprise. The ship suffers heavy damage, but manages to raise its shields in time to prevent a second attack. Nero then leaves the battle to continue his assault on the planet Vulcan. Worf is assumed to have survived, but this is never explicitly mentioned in the comic.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Massive Dynamic founder William Bell was originally {{meant to be}} revealed earlier in the first season, but the writers changed their minds as the show progressed. In early April 2009, Entertainment Weekly announced that Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy had been cast as Bell. He and Fringe co-creator J.J. Abrams already had a relationship after working together on the 2009 film Star Trek; Abrams stated {{in an interview that}} he called Nimoy and begged him to join Fringe, explaining the show and the character. Nimoy sounded interested but wanted to become more familiar with the show, so Abrams and the other producers sent him as much information as they could about Fringe, until Nimoy agreed. This exchange of phone calls, in which Nimoy responded with interest when pitched the idea, was also how Abrams was able to cast him in his Star Trek reboot. Nimoy later explained [...] "When they contacted me about working on Fringe -- the same people, the same attitude, the same creativity, the same creative team – it was very enticing". According to Abrams, [...] "The idea that he will play the mysterious, much-referenced William Bell is a thrill. I know I sound like a goofy fan boy, but I can’t help it: Leonard is an icon of the genre and such a wonderful actor. To have him <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> Fringe is a mind-blowing honor".|$|E

During a {{discussion}} about politics, the veteran Segundo said: [...] "Politics? This new guy [...] is good. The 1930s were rough. That's when we had the really bad times." [...] Segundo was an accomplished guitarist and tres player who started his career playing with established bands of the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1940s, he gained fame as one half of the Los Compadres duo, and then formed Los Muchachos, a band that he led until his death in 2003. For the Buena Vista Social Club recording and performances, Segundo played a unique seven-stringed instrument, a hybrid between a guitar and a tres, which he devised himself and called an armónico. He also sang, mostly doing background vocals, in a number of songs in his baritone voice, including the self-penned opening track, Chan Chan, with Eliades Ochoa as the leading voice. Cowboy hat wearing Eliades Ochoa (b. 1946), who had collaborated previously with Segundo and was a well established traditional Cuban folk performer, played guitar and sang for the group. Omara Portuondo (b. 1930), a bolero singer and the only female in the collective, sang [...] "Veinte Años" [...] on the record and duets with Segundo and Ibrahim Ferrer during live performances.|$|E
