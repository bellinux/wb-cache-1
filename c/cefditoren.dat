40|$|<b>Cefditoren</b> is {{the active}} form of <b>cefditoren</b> pivoxil, an oral {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic {{used for the}} treatment of respiratory tract infections and otitis media caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophi-lus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. -Lactam antibiotics, including <b>cefditoren,</b> target penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are mem-brane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. To envision the binding of <b>cefditoren</b> to PBPs, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of PBP 2 X from S. pneumoniae strain R 6 complexed with <b>cefditoren.</b> There are two PBP 2 X molecules (designated molecules 1 and 2) per asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that the orientation of Trp 374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket. The methylthiazole group of the C- 3 side chain of <b>cefditoren</b> fits into this binding pocket, which consists of residues His 394, Trp 374, and Thr 526 in molecule 1 and residues His 394, Asp 375, and Thr 526 in molecule 2. The formation of the complex is also accompanied by an induced-fit conformational change of the enzyme in the pocket to which the C- 7 side chain of <b>cefditoren</b> binds.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} a possible role of <b>Cefditoren,</b> a recently marketed in Greece third-generation oral cephalosporin in urinary infections of outpatients. Methods During a multicenter survey of Enterobacteriaceae causing UTIs in outpatients during 2005 – 2007, <b>Cefditoren</b> MICs {{were determined by}} agar dilution method in a randomly selected sample of uropathogens. Susceptibility against 18 other oral/parenteral antimicrobials was determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology. Results A total of 563 isolates (330 Escherichia coli, 142 Proteus mirabilis and 91 Klebsiella spp) was studied; MIC 50 /MIC 90 of <b>Cefditoren</b> was 0. 25 / 0. 5 [*]mg/L respectively, with 97. 1 % of the isolates being inhibited at 1 [*]mg/L. All 12 strains producing ESBLs or AmpC enzymes were resistant to <b>cefditoren.</b> Susceptibility rates (%) for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fosfomycin were 93. 1 - 94. 1 - 96. 8 - 93. 1 - 71. 9 and 92. 8 % respectively. <b>Cefditoren</b> MIC was significantly higher in nalidixic/ciprofloxacin non-susceptible strains; resistance to <b>cefditoren</b> {{was not associated with}} resistance to mecillinam, fosfomycin nitrofurantoin and aminoglycosides.

A computerized pharmacodynamic simulation was performed, and colony counts and β-lactamase activity were determined over 48 h. Three strains were used: ampicillin-susceptible, β-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) (also resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) and β-lactamase-positive amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-resistant (BLPACR) strains, with <b>cefditoren</b> MICs of ≤ 0. 12 μg/ml and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid MICs of 2, 8, and 8 μg/ml, respectively. Against the ampicillin-susceptible and BLNAR strains, bactericidal activity (≥ 3 log 10 reduction) was obtained from 6 h on with either total and free <b>cefditoren</b> or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Against the BLPACR strain, free <b>cefditoren</b> showed bactericidal activity from 8 h on. In amoxicillin-clavulanic acid simulations the increase in colony counts from 4 h on occurred in parallel with the increase in β-lactamase activity for the BLPACR strain. Since both BLNAR and BLPACR strains exhibited the same MIC, this was due to the significantly lower (P ≤ 0. 012) amoxicillin concentrations from 4 h on in simulations with β-lactamase positive versus negative strains, thus decreasing the time above MIC (T>MIC). From a pharmacodynamic point of view, the theoretical amoxicillin T>MIC against strains with elevated ampicillin/amoxicillin-clavulanic acid MICs should be considered with caution since the presence of β-lactamase inactivates the antibiotic, thus rendering inaccurate theoretical calculations.

By the three MIC tests, the MICs at which 50 and 90 % of isolates were inhibited (MIC 50 s and MIC 90 s) were, respectively, as follows (in micrograms per milliliter) : for the 65 penicillin-susceptible strains tested, 0. 016 and 0. 03 (by agar dilution), 0. 016 and 0. 03 (by microdilution), and 0. 016 and 0. 03 (by E test); for the 68 penicillin-intermediate strains tested, 0. 125 and 0. 5 (by agar dilution), 0. 125 and 0. 5 (by microdilution), and 0. 25 and 0. 5 (by E test); {{and for the}} 67 penicillin-resistant strains tested, 1. 0 and 1. 0 (by agar dilution), 0. 5 and 1. 0 (by microdilution), and 1. 0 and 1. 0 (by E test). With tentative <b>cefditoren</b> breakpoints (in micrograms per milliliter) of ≤ 2. 0 (susceptible), 4. 0 (intermediate), and ≥ 8. 0 (resistant), all strains were susceptible to <b>cefditoren</b> by agar, microdilution, and E-test results; with breakpoints of ≤ 1. 0, 2. 0, and ≥ 4. 0 μg/ml, 97 % of strains were <b>cefditoren</b> susceptible by agar dilution results, 98 % were susceptible by microdilution results, and 99 % were susceptible by E-test results. When microdilution and E-test results were compared to those from the reference agar dilution method, 191 (95. 5 %) and 183 (91. 5 %) of strains gave essential agreement (± 1 log 2 dilution); 8 (2. 7 %) minor discrepancies were found for both methods with a breakpoint of ≤ 1. 0 μg/ml, and no discrepancies were found with a breakpoint of ≤ 2. 0 μg/ml. Disk test results (breakpoint, ≤ 1. 0 μg/ml) produced 2 major and 30 minor errors, with corresponding zone diameters (in millimeters) of ≥ 20 (susceptible), 17 to 19 (intermediate), and ≤ 16 (resistant); a ≤ 2. 0 -μg/ml breakpoint yielded zone diameters of ≥ 16 mm (susceptible).

40|$|BackgroundSpecific {{antibodies}} mediate humoral {{and cellular}} protection against invading pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae by activating complement mediated immunity, promoting phagocytosis and stimulating bacterial clearance. The emergence of pneumococcal strains {{with high levels}} of antibiotic resistance is of great concern worldwide and a serious threat for public health. Methodology/Principal FindingsFlow cytometry was used to determine whether complement-mediated immunity against three antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae clinical isolates is enhanced in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of <b>cefditoren</b> and ceftriaxone. The binding of acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component, and of complement component C 1 q, to pneumococci was enhanced in the presence of serum plus either of these antibiotics. Both antibiotics therefore trigger the activation of the classical complement pathway against S. pneumoniae. C 3 b deposition was also increased in the presence of specific anti-pneumococcal antibodies and sub-inhibitory concentrations of <b>cefditoren</b> and ceftriaxone confirming that the presence of these antibiotics enhances complement-mediated immunity to S. pneumoniae. Conclusions/SignificanceUsing <b>cefditoren</b> and ceftriaxone to promote the binding of acute phase proteins and C 1 q to pneumococci, and to increase C 3 b deposition, when anti-pneumococcal antibodies are present, might help reduce the impact of antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae infections...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefditoren</b> is a broad-spectrum, oral {{cephalosporin}} that {{is highly}} active against clinically relevant respiratory tract pathogens, including multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study described its pharmacodynamic profile in plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF). Plasma and ELF pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 24 patients under fasting conditions. <b>Cefditoren</b> and urea concentrations were determined in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Concentration-time profiles in plasma and ELF were modeled using a model with three disposition compartments and first-order absorption, elimination, and transfer. Pharmacokinetic parameters were identified in a population pharmacokinetic analysis (big nonparametric adaptive grid with adaptive γ). Monte Carlo simulation (9, 999 subjects) was performed with the ADAPT II program to estimate the probability of target attainment at which the free-cefditoren plasma concentrations (88 %) protein binding and total ELF concentrations exceeded the MIC for 33 % of the dosing interval for 400 mg <b>cefditoren</b> given orally every 12 h. After the Bayesian step, the overall fits of the model to the data were good, and plots of predicted versus observed concentrations for plasma and ELF showed slopes and intercepts {{very close to the}} ideal values of 1. 0 and 0. 0, respectively. In the plasma probability of target attainment analysis, the probability of achieving a time for which free, or unbound, plasma concentration exceeds the MIC of the organism for 33 % of the dosing interval was 0. 06 mg/liter. Similar to plasma, the probability of achieving a time above the MIC of 33 % was 0. 06 mg/liter in ELF. <b>Cefditoren</b> was found to have a low probability of achieving a bacteriostatic effect against MICs of > 0. 06 mg/liter, which includes most S. pneumoniae isolates with intermediate susceptibility to penicillin, when given in the fasting state in both plasma and ELF...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{compare the}} {{clinical}} and bacteriological effectiveness of intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone followed by oral <b>cefditoren</b> pivoxil or IV ceftriaxone for acute pyelonephritis. MethodsA prospective randomized controlled trial {{of patients with}} a presumptive diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis was performed. Daily 2 g IV ceftriaxone was initially given to all patients. After day 3, patients who satisfied the criteria for switch therapy were randomized to either group A (IV ceftriaxone) or group B (oral <b>cefditoren</b> pivoxil 400 mg once daily). ResultsEighty-two patients were enrolled; 41 (50 %) patients in group A and 41 (50 %) patients in group B were evaluated. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Clinical cure was observed in 39 of 41 (95. 1 %) patients in group A and 41 of 41 (100 %) patients in group B (p= 0. 15, 95 % confidence interval (CI) − 0. 12 to 0. 02). Urine bacteriological eradication was found in 63. 4 % in group A and 60 % in group B (p= 0. 75, 95 % CI − 0. 18 to 0. 25). There was no statistically significant difference in adverse effects between the two treatment groups. ConclusionThese data suggest that IV ceftriaxone followed by oral <b>cefditoren</b> pivoxil is highly effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis, even for uropathogens with a high proportion of quinolone-resistant strains...|$|E

40|$|Newly {{developed}} {{coated wire}} electrodes {{have been developed}} for determination of <b>cefditoren</b> pivoxil (CTP) in pure form, pharmaceutical preparations and in biological fluids. The selective electrodes were fabricated based on the incorporation of <b>cefditoren</b> pivoxil with the ion exchangers, phosphomolybdic acid (CTP-PMA), phosphotungstic acid (CTP-PTA) and a mixture of both (CTP-PMA/PTA). The potential responses of the electrodes were influenced by the pH of tested solution. Under the condition of pH 5 - 10, the electrodes exhibit linear response over concentration range 1. 0 × 10 - 7 - 1. 0 × 10 - 2 mol/L with Nernstian slopes (56. 29 ± 0. 09, 54. 60 ± 0. 09 and 58. 17 ± 0. 28 mV / decade at 25 °C) for the three electrodes, respectively. The influence of possible interfering species such as common inorganic cations, amino acids and different pharmacological related compounds was studied. The electrodes were successfully applied to determination of the drug in tablets by direct and standard addition potentiometry. Statistical student's t-test and F-test showed insignificant systematic error between proposed and reported methods...|$|E
