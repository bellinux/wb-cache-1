5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E

He now {{was willing to}} co-operate regularly with the Social Democrats and when necessary, even with the Communists, {{as long as they}} acted democratically. [...] As president, he only once accepted his party, the Conservatives, into the government; and even that government lasted only about six months and was considered more a caretaker or civil-servant government than a regular parliamentary government. Paasikivi even appointed a communist, People's Democrat Mauno Pekkala, as prime minister in 1946.|$|E
2500|$|A new labor {{agreement}} was signed {{just prior to}} World War II on August 22, 1941 that officially recognized the union and stabilized wages for employees. But, the agreement expired in 1943 and the two sides were unable {{to come to an}} agreement in 1945 after the union workers released a set of demands that “no [...] southern cotton mill grant” at the time. [...] Management originally refused to agree to the demands, which included paid holidays, a lunch break and having a person independent of the mill devise the labor agreement. It claimed that the mill could not maintain its profitability if it met the demands of workers and cited the fair treatment it had given them in the past, denying that they violated labor laws.Former Duke University economics professor Frank DeVyver joined management in 1943 specifically to deal with labor disputes and worked out a compromise that satisfied the workers, giving them benefits such as vacation time, lunch breaks and an hourly wage of 65 cents. This was a radical and new type of labor agreement, as few other southern textile mills granted these rights to their workers, especially a 40-minute lunch break. Conditions at the mill had <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> the handful of small children who were toiling in the mill 40 years prior.|$|E
2500|$|... "Second Sons" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 20 {{reviews of}} the episode and judged 100% {{of them to be}} positive with an average score of 8 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, [...] " [...] 'Second Sons' shines through efficient storytelling -- and a comparatively low number of storylines to keep track of this week." [...] Writing for IGN, Matt Fowler rated the episode a 9.0/10, and wrote [...] "This week's well-crafted and wonderfully acted Game of Thrones gave us a cold wedding, a hot bath and a blood-letting." [...] He especially praised the scenes between Sansa and Tyrion and between Ser Davos and Stannis. David Sims and Todd VanDerWerff, both writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode [...] "B" [...] ratings. Sims was frustrated by the episode's meandering pace, but praised the end of the episode, with Sam killing the white walker, as [...] "the most crucial, fascinating, electric moment of the night". VanDerWerff praised the use of nudity in the episode, writing [...] "...I actually think Game Of Thrones has gotten quite a bit better at utilizing nudity and sex in the midst of everything else as a method of telling its story. It’s <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> the 'sexposition' days of season one, when it sometimes seemed like the series would toss some breasts into the background of a scene just in case we got bored of hearing somebody talk at length." ...|$|E
