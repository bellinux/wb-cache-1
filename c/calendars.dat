5|$|Both monthly {{and daily}} Yotsuba&! <b>calendars</b> have been {{released}} every year since 2005, although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma's schedule. The 2005 edition of the monthly calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for a balloon. The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily <b>calendars</b> have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional captions, {{as well as other}} fun items – for example, the 2006 calendar had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily <b>calendars</b> run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year.|$|E
5|$|Many ancient civilizations {{observed}} astronomical bodies, {{often the}} Sun and Moon, to determine times, dates, and seasons. The first <b>calendars</b> {{may have been}} created during the last glacial period, by hunter-gatherers who employed tools such as sticks and bones to track the phases of the moon or the seasons. Stone circles, such as England's Stonehenge, were built {{in various parts of}} the world, especially in Prehistoric Europe, and are thought to have been used to time and predict seasonal and annual events such as equinoxes or solstices. As those megalithic civilizations left no recorded history, little is known of their <b>calendars</b> or timekeeping methods. Methods of sexagesimal timekeeping, now common in both Western and Eastern societies, are first attested nearly 4,000years ago in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Mesoamericans similarly modified their usual vigesimal counting system when dealing with <b>calendars</b> to produce a 360-day year.|$|E
5|$|Most {{historical}} <b>calendars</b> are lunisolar. The 7th-century Islamic calendar is {{an exceptional}} {{example of a}} purely lunar calendar. Months are traditionally determined by the visual sighting of the hilal, or earliest crescent moon, over the horizon.|$|E
50|$|In Fusui, Zhuang people {{celebrate}} many {{exciting and}} meaningful festivals such as “Ancestor worship festival in spring” (2 February-Chinese <b>calendar's</b> agrarian <b>calendar),</b> “Tomb sweeping festival” and “Song Festival” (3 March - Chinese <b>calendar's</b> agrarian <b>calendar),</b> “Wheat heat Festival” (also called “Buddha Bath”or “Bovine soul Festival”, 8 April-Chinese <b>calendar's</b> agrarian <b>calendar),</b> “Ghost festival” (14 July - Chinese <b>calendar's</b> agrarian <b>calendar),</b> “Ancestor worship festival in autumn” (8 August -Chinese <b>calendar's</b> agrarian <b>calendar),</b> “bumper harvest festival” (also called “Ten intofestival”or “Nine into festival”, October - Chinese <b>calendar's</b> agrarian <b>calendar).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} <b>calendar</b> in China is the Gregorian <b>calendar,</b> but {{the traditional}} Chinese <b>calendar</b> still {{plays an important}} role there. The Chinese <b>calendar</b> is known officially as the Rural <b>Calendar</b> (...) , but is often referred to by other names, such as the Former <b>Calendar</b> (...) , the Traditional <b>Calendar</b> (...) , or the Lunar <b>Calendar</b> (...) [...] The Chinese <b>calendar</b> preserves traditional East Asian culture.|$|R

5|$|Other {{peculiar}} <b>calendars</b> include ancient Greek <b>calendars.</b> These were nominally lunar, {{starting with}} the New Moon. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ton theoi, by the moon. The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as games or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism {{may have been used}} as a politically neutral form of timekeeping. Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.|$|E
5|$|The {{calendar}} for the ELCA {{is similar}} to many other Western <b>Calendars</b> in {{that it does not}} commemorate any persons from the Old Testament. The <b>calendars</b> of the Orthodox Churches have Old Testament individuals, and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod has done the same. At one point there was a proposal to include a day on the Episcopal Church calendar (which was taken into consideration by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in developing the Lutheran Book of Worship) for Old Testament saints following the octave of All Saints (November 8), but this idea was ultimately rejected as tokenism.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{non-agricultural}} calendar is the Tzolk'in calendar of the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, which is a cycle of 260 days. This count {{is based on an}} earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of Maya <b>calendars</b> which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.|$|E

50|$|The Vietnamese <b>calendar</b> is a lunisolar <b>calendar</b> that {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} Chinese <b>calendar.</b> As Vietnam's {{official}} <b>calendar</b> is the Gregorian <b>calendar</b> since 1954, the Vietnamese <b>calendar</b> is used mainly to observe lunisolar holidays and commemorations, such as Tết and Mid-Autumn Festival.|$|R
5|$|Many {{scholars}} have gleaned from this passage that the Wicked Priest and the Teacher of Righteousness followed different liturgical <b>calendars,</b> thus enabling the Wicked Priest {{to travel on}} Yom Kippur; some have even suggested that the Teacher of Righteousness was a schismatic High Priest during the pre-Jonathan intersacerdotium.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the {{measurement}} of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of {{the positions of the}} Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of <b>calendars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of George's life, two <b>{{calendar}}s</b> were used: the Old Style Julian calendar and the New Style Gregorian calendar. Before 1700, the two <b>calendars</b> were 10 days apart. Hanover switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar on 19 February (O.S.) / 1 March (N.S.) 1700. Great Britain switched on 3/14 September 1752. George was born on 30 October Old Style, which was 9 November New Style, but because the calendar shifted forward a further day in 1700, the date is occasionally miscalculated as 10 November. In this article, individual dates before September 1752 are indicated as either O.S. or N.S. or both. All dates after September 1752 are N.S. only. All years are assumed to start from 1 January and not 25 March, which was the English New Year.|$|E

5|$|The {{previous}} North American {{calendar of}} the ELCA {{was different from}} its European counterparts in {{that it does not}} give equal weight (and sometimes gives no mention) to persons who may be commemorated in Scandinavian regions. One example would be the absence of St. Lucia on December 13, although she enjoys particular popularity in Sweden. But Lutheran <b>calendars</b> also differ amongst one another in North America, with some individuals commemorated on multiple <b>calendars</b> but on different days (e.g., St. Bernard of Clairvaux on August 19 in the LCMS and August 20 in the ELCA) or individuals commemorated on one calendar and not the other (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. on January 15 for the ELCA and C. F. W. Walther on May 7 for the LCMS); with the 2006 publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELW) as a replacement to the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW), some of these deficiencies in the ELCA calendar have been corrected. Within the ELCA, This Far by Faith and Libro de Liturgia y Cantico both prescribe <b>calendars</b> with additional commemorations specific to the ethnic communities they were intended to be used in (African Americans and Latinos respectively). The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has a different, somewhat minimized calendar when compared the LCMS and especially the ELCA.|$|E

5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for astronomy {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, <b>calendars</b> appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological <b>calendars,</b> which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather {{as well as political}} events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E
