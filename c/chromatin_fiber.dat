50|$|In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is coiled into protein-DNA {{complexes}} called chromatin. Histones, {{which are}} the most prevalent type of protein found in chromatin, function to condense the DNA; the net positive charge on histones facilitates their bonding with DNA, which is negatively charged. The basic and repeating units of chromatin, nucleosomes, consist of an octamer of histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) and a 146 bp length of DNA wrapped around it. Nucleosomes and the DNA connecting form a 10 nm diameter <b>chromatin</b> <b>fiber,</b> which can be further condensed.|$|E
50|$|Histones {{are basic}} nuclear {{proteins}} {{that are responsible}} for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes.

50|$|The {{existing}} models commonly {{accept that}} the nucleosomes lie perpendicular to the axis of the fibre, with linker histones arranged internally.A stable 30 nm fibre relies on the regular positioning of nucleosomes along DNA. Linker DNA is relatively resistant to bending and rotation. This makes the length of linker DNA critical to {{the stability of the}} fibre, requiring nucleosomes to be separated by lengths that permit rotation and folding into the required orientation without excessive stress to the DNA.In this view, different lengths of the linker DNA should produce different folding topologies of the <b>chromatin</b> <b>fiber.</b> Recent theoretical work, based on electron-microscopy imagesof reconstituted fibers supports this view.|$|E

Recognizable fiber densities, most likely of the <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers,</b> with the width of ~ 30  nm are readily visible with good contrast (Fig.  4 E, red boxes and circles) in the TEM image. The reconstructed tomograms also display fiber densities with width {{in the range of}} 30  nm, suggesting the presence of 30 -nm <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> in Hela nuclei (Fig.  4 F). The <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> in the cryo-tomograms of Hela nuclei in situ appear similar to those observed in the chemically fixed and high-pressure frozen Hela nuclei, and in accordance with the conventional mechanical cryo-sections of isolated chicken erythrocyte nuclei (Scheffer et al. 2011). These results provide further evidence to the presence of 30 -nm high-order <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> in vivo and shed lights on the three-dimensional structure of <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> in situ. Although the resolution of the cryo-tomograms is not high enough for us to track the path of DNA and to identify individual nucleosomes, our study suggests that it is technically feasible for a large-scale observation of isolated Hela nuclei with SEM–FIB and cryo-electron tomography.|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of chromosomes (certain rod-shaped structures) {{is highly}} reproducible despite the high condensation of <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> (∼ 1 mm) into chromosomes (∼ 1 μm). However, the mechanism underlying the condensation of <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> into chromosomes is unclear. We assume that {{investigation of the}} internal structure of chromosomes will aid in elucidating the condensation process. In order to observe the detailed structure of a chromosome, we stretched a human chromosome by using a micromanipulator and observed its morphology along the stretched region by scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We found that the chromosome consisted of some fibers that were thicker than <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers.</b> The found fiber was composed of approximately 90 -nm-wide beads that were linked linearly. To explore {{the components of the}} fiber, we performed immunofluorescence staining of the stretched chromosome. Fluorescence signals of topoisomerase (Topo) IIα, which is known to interact with and support <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers,</b> and DNA were detected both on the found fiber and beads. Furthermore, after micrococcal nuclease and trypsin treatments, the fibers were found to be mechanically supported by proteins.

30|$|It is well {{recognized}} that the isolated chromatins from chicken erythrocyte nuclei present a fiberic form in width of ~ 30  nm (Scheffer et al. 2011). For the Hela S 3 cells, the arrangement of 30 -nm fibers had also been observed in the isolated chromatins (Langmore and Paulson 1983). Nevertheless, how the chromatin is organized in situ {{still needs to be}} elucidated (Eltsov et al. 2008; McDowall et al. 1986). Besides the in vitro assembled 30 -nm <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> (Song et al. 2014), our study suggested that chromatin fibers isolated from Hela nuclei present a similar two-start double helix form (unpublished data). In this study, we tried to examine the <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> in Hela cells in situ to clarify if 30 -nm <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> present in nuclei in vivo (Giannasca et al. 1993; Horowitz et al. 1994).|$|R
30|$|We then {{isolated}} Hela nuclei {{from the}} cells following the previously reported protocols (Athey et al. 1990; Giannasca et al. 1993; William and Langmore 1991; Woodcock et al. 1984), and performed a similar chemical fixation, ultrathin-sectioning, and electron microscopic imaging analysis. The ultrathin sections of isolated Hela nuclei displayed distinctly separated fibers, most likely {{attributed to the}} <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers,</b> as shown in representative EM images (Fig.  1 D). Compared {{with those in the}} ultrathin-sections of the whole Hela cell, the <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> in isolated nuclei present similar architectures as in the cell. Different orientations of the <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers,</b> e.g., cross sections and longitudinally sections, can also be visualized. It is worth noting that the ultrathin sections of isolated nuclei present a much cleaner background than that of nuclei in the cell. The contrast and signal-to-noise ratio of EM images of isolated nuclei are also better than that of whole cell. The chromatin-like fibers appear more apparent in the isolated nuclei (Fig.  1 D), which was previously noticed in the study of <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> in starfish sperm (Horowitz et al. 1994). The 11  nm nucleosome-like dots can be recognized in the isolated nuclei sections. Unlike the chromatin in starfish sperm in which the <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> appear with sharp turns and folds (Horowitz et al. 1994), most of the fibers in the sectioned Hela nuclei appear with the longitudinal orientation. However, it is hard to track the fibers’ tendency in the EM images of Hela S 3 cells, possibly due to the high variability and aggregation of chromatins. The diversity, flexibility and aggregation of native chromatin (Woodcock et al. 1984) and the hierarchical folding of chromatin at different cell cycle stages make it difficult to recognize the 30 -nm fibers in the electron microscopic images. Our results suggest that an optimization on the cell cycle and sample preparations are necessary for the <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> characterization in vivo.|$|R

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{a living}} cell requires a permanent transport of various macromolecules. In the cell nucleus, this transport is accomplished by diffusion and {{takes place in a}} dense network of <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers.</b> This work deals with connections between the structure of <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers,</b> their dynamics and the diffusional transport of macromolecules in the cell nucleus. The <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> are represented on a Cartesian lattice, based on the model of a semi-flexible chain polymer. Using a Monte Carlo procedure, specific lattice chain conformations that correspond to <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> in interphase are generated. Thereafter, random walks simulate the macromolecular diffusion in the thus created chromatin network The influences of chromatin structure on the mobility of diffusing macromolecules are investigated, particularly those arising from the folding into spatially separated subvolumes of the cell nucleus. This folding principle is known as compartmentalization and can be induced by the formation of specific chromatin loops. The simulations show that the fiber structure governs the spatial distribution of chromatin on different length scales in the cell nucleus. A measure of inhomogeneity is introduced to connect the spatial distribution of chromatin to the diffusion coefficient, the anomaly parameter and the characteristic length scale of anomalous diffusion. The determinability of this measure of inhomogeneity with confocal microscopy and DNA sequence analyses is examined, and different models of diffusion in polymer systems are compared to the simulations. Further, the effects of chromatin dynamics and a high concentration of diffusing macromolecules on the diffusion behavior are analyzed. Chromatin dynamics enhances the accessibility of the chromatin network, particularly {{in the case of a}} high concentration of mutually obstructing diffusing macromolecules. The obstruction of individual diffusing macromolecules by <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> can be distinguished from the obstruction caused by other diffusing macromolecules in terms of diffusion coefficients and the characteristic length scales of anomalous diffusion. The dynamics of chromatin is only slightly decelerated by a high concentration of diffusing macromolecules. A high density of chromatin and the entanglement of <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> cause much greater deceleration...|$|R

50|$|Past studies {{going back}} to 1970s showed that, in general, NRL is {{different}} for different species and even for different cell types of the same organism. In addition, recent publications reported NRL variations for different genomic regions of the same cell type. Recent works have compared the NRL around yeast transcription start sites (TSSs) in vivo and that for the reconstituted chromatin on the same DNA sequences in vitro. It was shown that ordered nucleosome positioning arises only {{in the presence of}} ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. Furthermore, it was reported that the NRL determined around yeast TSSs is an invariant value universal for a given wild type yeast strain, although it can change when one of chromatin remodelers is missing. In general, NRL depends on the DNA sequence, concentrations of histones and non-histone proteins, as well as long-range interactions between nucleosomes. NRL determines geometric properties of the nucleosome array, and therefore the higher-order packing of the DNA into the <b>chromatin</b> <b>fiber,</b> which might affect gene expression.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{cancer has}} been viewed as a genetic disease that is driven by {{sequential}} acquisition of mutations, leading to the constitutive activation of proto-oncogenes {{and the loss of}} function of tumor suppressor genes. However, it has become increasingly evident that tumor development also involves epigenetic changes. These epigenetic changes include both genome-wide losses and regional gains of DNA methylation, as well as altered patterns of histone modification. The state of compaction of the <b>chromatin</b> <b>fiber</b> governs DNA accessibility and therefore has a crucial function establishing, maintaining, and propagating distinct patterns of gene expression. Perturbations of chromatin structure can cause inappropriate gene expression and genomic instability, resulting in cellular transformation and malignant outgrowth. Polycomb group proteins (PcG) function as transcriptional repressors that silence specific sets of genes through chromatin modification. Although they are primarily known for their role in maintaining cell identity during the establishment of the body plan, several mammalian PcG members are implicated in the control of cellular proliferation and neoplastic development.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above the histone tails {{have been shown}} to directly interact with the DNA of the nucleosome. Each histone in the octamer has an N-terminal tail that protrudes from the histone core. The tails play roles both in inter and intra nucleosomal interactions that ultimately influence gene access. Histones are positively charged molecules which allow a tighter bonding to the negatively charged DNA molecule. Reducing the positive charge of histone proteins reduces the strength of binding between the histone and DNA, making it more open to gene transcription (expression). Moreover, these flexible units direct DNA wrapping in a left-handed manner around the histone octamer during nucleosome formation. Once the DNA is bound the tails continue to interact with the DNA. The parts of the tail closest to the DNA hydrogen bond and strengthen the DNA’s association with the octamer; the parts of the tail furthest away from the DNA, however, work in a very different manner. Cellular enzymes modify the amino acids in the distal sections of the tail to influence the accessibility of the DNA. The tails have also been implicated in the stabilization of 30-nm fibers. Research has shown removing certain tails prevents the nucleosomes from forming properly and a general failure to produce <b>chromatin</b> <b>fiber.</b> In all, these associations protect the nucleosomal DNA from the external environment but also lower their accessibility to cellular replication and transcriptional machinery.|$|E
30|$|The folding of {{chromatin}} in eukaryotic {{cells is}} closely related to the genetic transcription, replication and repair (Horn and Peterson 2002; Luger et al. 1997). Packaging of DNA in eukaryotic cells is hierarchical. The linear “beads-on-string” arrangement of nucleosomes, which is formed by histone octamers (H 2 A:H 2 B:H 3 :H 4  =  2 : 2 : 2 : 2) (Luger et al. 1997) wrapped by DNA, is regarded as the first level arrangement of chromatin (Huynh et al. 2005). Although the nucleosome had been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography at 1.9  Å (Davey et al. 2002), how polynucleosomes are folded into 30 -nm <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers,</b> which are typically regarded as the secondary structure of DNA, is inconclusive. Based on the early studies of chromatin in different cells using a variety of methods (Bednar et al. 1995; Daban 2011; Gerchman and Ramakrishnan 1987; Grigoryev and Woodcock 2012; Kruithof et al. 2009; Robinson and Rhodes 2006; Schalch et al. 2005; Simpson and Stafford 1983; Widom et al. 1985; William et al. 1986; William and Langmore 1991), researchers had proposed two major types of model for the secondary chromatin structure, i.e., “one-start” solenoid model and “two-start” zig-zag model (Finch and Klug 1976; Horowitz et al. 1994; Robinson et al. 2006). Recently, using cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis, we reconstructed the 3 D structure of in vitro reconstituted 30 -nm <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> at 11  Å resolution and found that <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> with two different nucleosome repeat lengths (NRLs, 12  ×  177 and 12  ×  187  bp) present a left-handed double helix structure (Song et al. 2014), which represents a considerable advance on the structure characteristics of <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers.</b> However, the existence of 30 -nm <b>chromatin</b> <b>fibers</b> in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells is still remained to be elucidated in vivo (Eltsov et al. 2008).|$|R
