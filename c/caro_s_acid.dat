(S) -AP 4 was a potent and selective mGlu 4 agonist (EC 50 = 0. 91 [*]μM) being inactive at mGlu 1, mGlu 2 and mGlu 5 both as agonist and antagonist. (S) -AP 5 displayed very weak agonist activity at mGlu 4.

Quantitative determinations of cathepsin activities were done by flow cytometry and spectrofluorometry using synthetic dipeptidyl substrates coupled to fluorogens.
