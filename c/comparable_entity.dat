Differentiating products having same job but differing in their capabilities or properties is difficult task. Consider someone want to purchase online mobile phone then {{he or she should}} know which mobile phone to compare with how many and which alternatives. This is common activity but requires high knowledge skills. So to deal with this difficulty we developed a novel way to automatically get comparable entities from comparative questionsThe proposed system will consider comparators which are alises of each other. Given users input entity, we find comparable entities for that entity. This method achieves high precision and high recall.

40|$|Abstract [...] Comparing {{entities}} is {{an important}} part of decision making. Several approaches have been reported for mining <b>comparable</b> <b>entities</b> from Web sources to improve user experience in comparing entities online. However, these efforts extract only entities explicitly compared in the corpora, and may exclude entities that occur less-frequently but potentially comparable. The prerequisite step of this task is to find <b>comparable</b> <b>entities.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel Bootstrapping algorithm to address the task by mining <b>comparable</b> <b>entities</b> from comparative questions in a collection of questions (e. g., that users posted on-line). For example, a weakly-supervised bootstrapping method can be used to identify comparative questions, comparative patterns, and extract <b>comparable</b> <b>entities.</b> The <b>comparable</b> <b>entities</b> can be used to help users make alternate decisions by comparing relevant mining entities, instead of providing merely recommendation, as is currently provided. By using bootstrapping technique entities has to be extracted with a specific relation. However, our task is different from the previous one that it requires not only extracting entities but also ensuring that the entities are extracted from comparative questions (comparative question identification), which is generally not required in information extraction task. Finally, the ranking is provided based on the user’s perspective for entities listed. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework can outperform the baseline systems...|$|R

40|$|Abtract- Comparison of {{one thing}} among things is a usual part of human {{decision}} formation process, particularly during an online purchase order. Without comparing it is not fair to buy a product, since it won’t give an ideal performance. For instance, if somebody is fascinated in definite products such as cameras, then he /she would need to identify what another possibility are and compare dissimilar cameras before purchasing. This way of comparison action is very common in our day-to-day life but wants high knowledge ability. So, in order to solve this trouble, we are presenting an idyllic way for inevitably mine comparable entities using comparative questions that users dispatched online. It gives a chance to improve the search knowledge by automatically offering comparisons to user. A weakly supervised bootstrapping procedure is employed here for comparative problem identification and <b>comparable</b> <b>entity</b> abstraction by assembling a large online question collection. This result also provides users to enhance new attributes of their interest to the explanation form, so that the next search recovers the provided new attribute information. This technique would overtake the existing system of online shopping...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Making Comparisons between {{things is}} a typical part of human {{decision}} making process. But however, {{it is difficult to}} know what are to be compared and what can be the alternatives. For e. g., if someone is interested in certain products such as digital cameras, then he /she would want to know what the alternatives are and compare different cameras before making any purchase. This type of comparison activity is very common in our daily life but requires high knowledge skill in order to make much better choice. Therefore, to address this difficulty, we are presenting a system to automatically mine comparable entities from comparative questions that users posted online. In this paper, we focus on finding a set of comparable entities provided a user’s input entity. For example, provided an entity like Nokia N 95 (a mobile phone), we want to find comparable entities such as Nokia N 82, Blackberry and so on. To ensure high precision and high recall, we are developing a system that uses weakly-supervised bootstrapping method for comparative question identification and <b>comparable</b> <b>entity</b> extraction by leveraging a large online question archive. Our system calculates the precision and recall for a particular session depending on the correct comparators suggested. The result varies depending on the sessions. The results will prove to be very useful in helping users ’ exploration of alternative choices by suggesting comparable entities based on other users ’ prior requests...|$|E
40|$|New York City and Los Angeles County {{have the}} largest health systems in the United States, but they differ {{significantly}} in structure. This study compares and analyzes the structural and workforce differences between the two. The health system in New York City is centered around its large hospitals, {{and as a result}} New York employs many more health workers than Los Angeles County, where the health system is centered around physician groups. Health care is a significant contributor to the economy of both areas, but a larger contributor to the economy in New York City. Although federal health spending accounts for almost 50 percent of health care in the United States, there is no national system of health care. The Medicare program operates in the same way across the country, but hospital and physician reimbursements differ substantially from one county to another. And the Medicaid program differs in each of the 50 states. As a result, it is not surprising to find large differences among health systems {{in different parts of the}} country. Los Angeles and New York City, as the largest cities in the nation, {{have the largest}} health care sectors. Yet while they are both large, they are extremely different in operation and focus. In this article we examine the similarities and the differences between the health care workforces in the two areas. We chose to compare the county of Los Angeles and New York City. Since the county is responsible for health and public health services in Los Angeles, it is the appro-priate <b>comparable</b> <b>entity</b> to study...|$|E

40|$|In {{the fifty}} {{or so years}} since the Treaty of Rome, the European Union has evolved far {{beyond the scope of}} any other <b>comparable</b> <b>entity.</b> The EU is now a unique model of {{international}} cooperation and integration, and its reach extends into almost every sphere of the lives of its half a billion citizens. As well as the establishment of a single market, the Union has its own currency, is developing a foreign policy, and has a growing role in justice and cultural matters. Scholarly work on the European Union has undergone a similarly rapid evolution. For example, with the major expansions of the Union {{since the end of the}} Cold War, there has been a huge growth in the range and depth of research into the many challenges of integration. As serious thinking about and around this and other crucial aspects of the European Union continues to flourish and develop, this new title in Routledge’s acclaimed Critical Concepts in Political Science series meets the need for an authoritative reference work to make sense of the subject’s vast literature and the continuing explosion in research output. Edited by Simon Usherwood, a leading EU scholar, it is a five-volume collection of foundational and cutting-edge contributions. The first volume in the collection (‘The Development of the European Union’) assembles the key work on the historical evolution of the European Union from the end of the Second World War to the present day. Even before the Constitutional Treaty proposed in 2004, there was much academic and political discussion about the degree and manner to which the EU transcended traditional political units and the materials gathered in Volume II (‘The Organization of the European Union and the Constitutional Turn’) explore the nature of the Union at this most fundamental level. The third volume in the collection (‘The Institutions of the European Union’) collects the most important research on the institutional structure of the EU. Here, the focus is on the dynamic processes at work within institutions and the models of understanding that academics have developed. Volume IV (‘Member States as Actors in the European Union’), meanwhile, brings together the best work on particular member states, considering, for example, why certain states have remained dominant actors within the Union, despite the scope and depth of EU expansion. In addition, the processes and outcomes which underpin this dominance—such as europeanisation—are also explored. The final volume in the collection (‘Citizens as Actors in the European Union’) concentrates on a very particular feature of the Union: the role of individual citizens. The material gathered here probes issues such as the perceived ‘democratic deficit’ in the Union. Fully indexed and with comprehensive introductions to each thematic part, newly written by the editor, which place the collected material in its historical and intellectual context, The European Union is an essential work of reference. It is destined to be valued by political science scholars and researchers—as well as by EU specialists and policy-makers—as a vital one-stop research tool...|$|E

40|$|Comparing and {{contrasting}} is {{an important}} strategy people employ to understand new situations and create solutions for new problems. Similar events can provide hints for problem solving, as well as larger contexts for understanding the specific circumstances of an event. Lessons {{can be learned from}} past experience, insights can be gained about the new situation from familiar examples, and trends can be discovered among similar events. As the largest knowledge base for human beings, the Web provides both an opportunity and a challenge to discover comparable cases in order to facilitate situation analysis and problem solving. In this paper, we present Compare&Contrast, a system that uses the Web to discover comparable cases for news stories, documents about similar situations but involving distinct entities. The system analyzes a news story given by the user and builds a model of the story. With the story model, the system dynamically discovers <b>entities</b> <b>comparable</b> to the main entity in the original story and uses these <b>comparable</b> <b>entities</b> as seeds to retrieve web pages about comparable cases. The system is domain independent, does not require any domain specific knowledge engineering efforts, and deals with the complexity of unstructured text and noise on the web in a robust way.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a sequence}} of investigations in parasitology, botany, pharmacology, psychometrics and ethnopsychology focused on Kenyan village children's knowledge of medicinal herbs. We follow this work of making and ordering of knowledge, showing that the different disciplinary perspectives on bodies, medicines, knowledges, children and cultures produced by this research all sought the foundation of knowledge in reference to objective reality, and that they aimed {{to make the world}} known in the specific form of distinct and <b>comparable</b> <b>entities</b> with individual properties and capacities. Based on subsequent ethnographic observations of healing in the same village, we outline a different, contrasting modality of knowing, which places ontology above epistemology. Medicinal knowledge and its transformational capacity are here not located within entities but between them; not in objective reality but in effects; `to know' means `to come together' with the implication of having an effect on one another. We use this ethnographic sketch of a different form of knowing as a foil against which to contrast the imaginary that had shaped our previous research. Beyond the stark contrast between herbal village healing and pharmacological laboratory analysis, we expand our argument by moving from natural science to social science, from studies of plants and substances to those of humans, minds and cultures; from laboratories to ethno-psychological tests, cultural models, and eventually econometrics. We suggest that by reiterating a particular scientific imaginary, remaking humans (and non-human beings) as known things, a specific notion of man and a related political economy of knowledge is naturalized. Looking back at our involvement with this sequence of research, we realize that, contrary to our intentions, our inclusion as `social scientists' into a multidisciplinary scientific project may have exacerbated rather than mitigated its potentially problematic effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{community}} work method {{of social work}} is a method requiring creativity, application of specialised skills and knowledge, sound planning and administration and a persuasiveness to reach the various sectors of the community {{in order to accomplish}} broad based goals. Public relations is an occupation that has a sound body of literature and theory, a code of ethics or conduct, a host of tools and methods and also requires sound planning and administration, bound together with persuasiveness to reach the various publics in order to accomplish goals affecting image, quality of service rendering and marketing of services. The present study was concerned with identifying the commonalities and the differences between the profession of {{community work}} and the occupation of public relations in order to enhance the content of community work theory for practical application by community workers. The differences between the two would, in fact, teach content to community work. It was hypothesised that public relations has a necessary function and is an occupation that can be internalised with and applied to community work for the effective marketing of organisational services. A model for incorporating public relations into community work was designed and implemented in a direct service welfare organisation with positive results. This design is applicable to other direct service welfare organisations with innovative and flexible management teams. The results of an empirical research study, making use of random sampling and questionnaires, was analysed. The results indicated that public relations and community work were <b>comparable</b> <b>entities</b> with reference to knowledge bases, values, skills, tools, methods, techniques, ethics and programmes. A third group of respondents emerged in this study - community workers practising public relations firmly within the realm of community work. This group advocated the use of marketing and communication strategies in applying the community work method effectively. The primary difference to emerge from the work research was one of emphasis in applying methods and subsequently, community work can learn a great deal from these differences which will enhance service rendering correspondingly. The culmination of this study led to several highly relevant conclusions and recommendations for welfare organisations in a Post-apartheid South Africa. The most worthwhile conclusion was that community work has a great deal to learn from public relations, and that they are combinable entities at every level. KMBT_ 22...|$|R

Procuramos aqui trazer a diÃlogo as quatro obras e, fundamentando-nos em uma anÃlise do congresso de suas poÃticas, contribuir para o estudo de um processo que nos parece contemporaneamente inescapÃvel, a relaÃÃo entre cinema e literatura. Para tanto, a presente dissertaÃÃo consistirÃ do estudo das regularidades de comportamento do processo tradutor apresentadas no corpus que nos Ã possÃvel analisar de modo a deduzir e descrever as possÃveis normas sistÃmicas que subjazem e regulam as transposiÃÃes entre o sistema literÃrio beat e o sistema cinematogrÃfico contemporÃneo.

Esperamos demonstrar que estes lados do problema se interligam se criarmos um campo tenso comum em que as obras possam dialogar, o que buscamos fazer atravÃs do estabelecimento de um princÃpio organizador, o tema comum da loucura.

Our goal is to bring forth a dialogue established by these four objective elements, based on the analysis of the congress of their individual poetics, and, in light of this, to contribute to a process that appears to be contemporarily inescapable, the relations between cinema and literature. To this end, the following dissertation will consist of the study of regularities of behavior in the adaptation process presented in the corpus before us as a means of deducing and describing possible systemic norms that underlie and regulate the transpositions between the beat literary system and the contemporary cinematographic system. On the other hand, but not separately, as we understand adaptation as rounded semiotic systems, we must consider the contexts in which they are inserted and what relations they actualize within their arrival system, not only that but investigate possible analogies to the departure system, We hope to demonstrate that these different strands of the problem are intertwined and connected if we create a common filed of tension in which the art-works are able to sustain dialogue â this we endeavored to do with the stablishment of an organizing principle, the common theme of madness.

NMFS continues to pursue, through international <b>entities,</b> <b>comparable</b> international management measures with respect to fishing for highly migratory species and incidental catch reduction. At the 1998 ICCAT meeting, SCRS was tasked with developing rebuilding schedules for swordfish for 5, 10, and 15 years. The 1999 swordfish stock assessment included that information (SCRS, 1999) and NMFS prepared a foundation for negotiation of a ten-year rebuilding plan {{based on the results of}} the assessment. In 1999, the United States and other ICCAT fishing member nations agreed to a rebuilding plan for North Atlantic swordfish. This rebuilding plan sets landings quotas and requires member nations to reduce swordfish discards. Country catch allocation...|$|R
