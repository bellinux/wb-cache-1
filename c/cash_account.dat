Since the company has paid say £x in dividends per share out of its <b>cash</b> <b>account</b> on the left hand side of the balance sheet, the equity account on the right side should decrease an equivalent amount.

In this paper, we present an empirical survey to understand whether we can choose accrual or <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> system. The proposed study designs a questionnaire among 220 experts in area of accounting affairs. The survey considers four sub hypotheses and one main hypothesis to see whether there are reliable rules and regulations in accrual-based <b>accounting</b> compared with <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> or not. Similarly, the survey investigates whether accrual-based accounting is more informative, comprehensive and provides better comparative results compared with <b>cash</b> <b>accounting.</b> The results indicate that accrual-based account performs better in terms of all mentioned criteria and it is a better method for managing accounting affairs compared with <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> systems...|$|R

60|$|One {{discovery}} of importance he had certainly made. A horse {{withdrawn from the}} sale was the only horse that had met with Hardyman's approval. He had secured the animal at the high reserved price of twelve thousand francs--being four hundred and eighty pounds in English money; and he had paid with an English bank-note. The seller (a French horse-dealer resident in Brussels) had returned to Belgium immediately on completing the negotiations. Sharon had ascertained his address, and had written to him at Brussels, inclosing {{the number of the}} lost banknote. In two days he had received an answer, informing him that the horse-dealer had been called to England by the illness of a relative, and that he had hitherto failed to send any address to which his letters could be forwarded. Hearing this, and having exhausted his funds, Sharon had returned to London. It now rested with Moody to decide whether the course of the inquiry should follow the horse-dealer next. Here was the <b>cash</b> <b>account,</b> showing how the money had been spent. And there was Sharon, with his pipe in his mouth and his dog on his lap, waiting for orders.|$|E

Due to instruments, like information technology, simplified <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> or outsourcing compliance activities to tax advisers, private businesses {{have a set of}} strategies to optimize their tax compliance cost burden. Under the assumption of rational choice a private business should choose a cost-optimal administration strategy. In spite of that we find empirical evidence for small German businesses using only insufficiently the support of external tax advisers. Therefore, a considerable number of small businesses in Germany could reduce their compliance cost burden by a higher degree of outsourcing tax processes. In contrast, we find no significant evidence for a cost reduction by an electronic data interchange with the tax and social insurance authorities or by a simplified <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> method for tax purposes.
