50|$|Phlebopus tropicus {{has been}} shown to form a crust of {{mycelium}} around the roots of species of Citrus in Brazil covering colonies of the <b>comstock</b> <b>mealybug</b> Pseudococcus comstocki which attack the roots of these plants after they have been carried there by ants (Solenopsis saevissima var. moelleri); these mycelial crusts are called criptas by Brazilian writers. The Pseudococcus living in symbiosis with the fungus {{is believed to be the}} immediate reason for the subsequent death of the affected trees, but the action of an endotrophic mycorrhizal fungus weakens the plant before the attack of the Pseudococcus takes place.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Comstock</b> <b>mealybug</b> (CMB) Pseudococcus comstocki (Kuwana) (Rhynchota Pseudo-coccidae) is {{a highly}} {{polyphagous}} species widespread in Central Asia, Eastern Europe, USA and other regions. It {{is one of the}} most serious pest of apple, pear and other agricultural crops. Scientific investigations and field tests demonstrated that 2, 6 -dimethyl-l, 5 -heptadien- 3 -yl acetate is the most attractive one for these species. According to literature, synthesis of this pheromone suffers from low overall yield (cca 9 %), as well as increases the self-cost of this compound. Hereby, we report an efficient synthetic route for obtaining of 2, 6 -dimethyl-l, 5 -heptadien- 3 -yl acetate with total yield more than 60 %...|$|E
40|$|NYS IPM Type: Fruits IPM Fact SheetThe <b>Comstock</b> <b>mealybug</b> (CMB) {{was first}} {{reported}} in the United States in 1918 concurrently in New York and California, and has since spread to all coastal states and the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. Its fruit hosts include pear, apple, and peach, {{and it is also}} a pest of several ornamental plants such as catalpa, mulberry, pine, and others. CMB was first recognized as a fruit pest in the 1930 s. From 1950 to 1980, it was infrequently noticed as a fruit pest, but in the early 1980 s it caused damage to apple crops in the Hudson and Champlain valleys, and to pears in western New York later in the eighties...|$|E
40|$|Experiments on {{the process}} of {{intraspecific}} competition in two parasitoids of <b>Comstock</b> <b>mealybug</b> were performed under controlled laboratory conditions which led to the phenomenon of superparasitism. The process to eliminate supernumeraries is strikingly dissimilar between Clausenia purpurea and Pseudaphycus malinus. The former, a solitary parasitoid, kills excess individuals by physiological suppression in the early stage of development, whereas the latter, a gregarious parasitoid, eliminates others through selective starvation in the older stages. The typical processes of elimination of excess parasitoids in solitary forms are deliberate physical attack and physiological suppression in their early stages, whereas in gregarious forms it takes place typically by selective starvation or asphyxiation in the older stages. These processes seem to be characters which have been developed adaptively in relation to the phases of solitary and gregarious parasitism...|$|E
40|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{is a major}} concern in almost all human activities relating to plant and animal breeding. The biological control of pests with natural enemies is no exception, because populations of biocontrol agents experience a series of bottlenecks during importation, rearing, and introduction. A classical biological control program for the <b>Comstock</b> <b>mealybug</b> Pseudococcus comstocki (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) was initiated in France in 2008, based on the introduction of an exotic parasitoid, Allotropa burrelli Mues. (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae), a haplodiploid parasitoid imported from Japan. We evaluated the sensitivity of A. burrelli to inbreeding, to optimize rearing and release strategies. We compared several morphological and life-history traits between the offspring of siblings and the offspring of unrelated parents. We took into account the low level of genetic variability due to the relatively small size of laboratory-reared populations by contrasting two types of pedigree: one for individuals from a strain founded from a single field population, and the other generated by hybridizing individuals from two strains founded from two highly differentiated populations. Despite this careful design, we obtained no evidence for a negative impact of inbreeding on laboratory-reared A. burrelli. We discussed the results in light of haplodiploid sex determination and parasitoid mating systems, and classical biological control practices...|$|E
