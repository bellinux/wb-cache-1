40|$|The {{trends in}} chatter {{prediction}} are to compute stability lobes showing the maximal {{depth of cut}} versus spindle speed, following the work of Tlusty, Tobias and, more recently, Altintas. For mass production such as the production of automotive parts, this kind of approach is not suitable because {{the goal is to}} find cutting conditions stable and independent of perturbations inherent to machining (<b>clamping,</b> rough part <b>dimensions</b> [...] .). Still, in this method, the greatest allowable depth of cut to avoid chatter at any spindle speed is considered. The model is based on Tlusty's theory and the local stiffness of the machined surface is computed through a static finite element analysis. The result is a chatter map of the machined surface showing the maximal depth of cut at each node. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, construction {{and application of}} a novel magneto-optical tweezers with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy for manipulation, force/torque measurement and imaging of single biomolecules. The optical tweezers component offers force or position <b>clamping</b> in three <b>dimensions.</b> The 3 D-printed magnetic tweezers is designated for rotation in the vertical plane. The separation of rotation from force transduction results in the capability of precise torque measurement. The filamentous biomolecules {{to be used in}} the device will lie in a transverse direction in the imaging plane to allow fluorescence imaging with techniques including Blinking assisted Localisation Microscopy (BaLM) and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF). Also included are features such as acousto-optic deflection and multiplexing of laser traps, interferometry based tracking with quadrant photodiode and piezoelectric actuated nanostage for active feedback. These tweezers have been developed to enable direct observation of molecular topological transformation and protein binding event localisation with mechanical perturbation, which traditional tweezers could not achieve...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is {{the design of the}} {{production}} process and tools for production of two grooves in coats of concrete clamp. Shell anchors are made of longitudinally welded stainless steel tubes 17 240. The size of the production of all types of shell of concrete clamps is 18 000 PCs per year. The number and the dimensions of grooves in the coats of anchors were determined {{on the basis of a}} practical verification. To the present day the grooves are made by cutting on a band saw, which is little productive and on finishing operations demanding way. The grooves in the coats of anchors will be newly manufactured by technology of shearing, which was a literary study. On the basis of the calculations was selected for the production a hydraulic press of CUPS 25 D. The grooves will be produced on the newly designed shearing tool.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{generators}} (TEGs) {{are increasingly}} employed in large-scale applications, therefore accurate performance data {{are necessary to}} permit precise designs and simulations. However, {{there is still no}} standardized method to test the electrical and thermal performance of TEGs. This paper presents an innovative test system to assess device performance in the “real world. ” The fixture allows the hot temperature to be increased up to 800 °C with minimal thermal losses and thermal shock; the clamping load can be adjusted up to 5  kN, and the temperatures are sensed by thermocouples placed directly on the TEG’s surfaces. A computer program controls all the instruments in order to minimize errors and to aid accurate measurement and test repeatability. The test rig can measure four TEGs simultaneously, each one individually controlled and heated by a maximum electrical power of 2  kW. This allows testing of the effects of series and parallel connection of TEGs under mismatched conditions, e. g., <b>dimensions,</b> <b>clamping</b> force, temperature, etc. The test rig can be employed both as a performance evaluator and as a quality control unit, due to the ability to provide nonparametric testing of four TEGs concurrently. It {{can also be used to}} rapidly characterize devices of different dimensions at the same time...|$|R

40|$|Incisional hernia is {{a severe}} {{complication}} post-laparoscopic/laparotomy surgery that is {{commonly associated with}} the linea alba. However, the few studies on the mechanical properties of the linea alba in the literature appear contradictory, possible due to challenges with the physical dimensions of samples and variations in protocol. This study focuses on the tensile mechanical characterisation of the porcine linea alba, as determined by uniaxial and equi-load biaxial testing using image-based strain measurement methods. Results show that the linea alba demonstrated a non-linear elastic, anisotropic behaviour which is often observed in biological soft tissues. The transverse direction (parallel to fibres) {{was found to be}} approximately eight times stiffer than the longitudinal (cross-fibre) direction under both uniaxial and equi-load biaxial loading. The equi-load biaxial tensile tests revealed that contraction could occur in the transverse direction despite increasing load, probably due to the anisotropy of the tissue. Optical surface marker tracking and digital image correlation methods were found to greatly improve the accuracy of stretch measurement, resulting in a 75 % change in the apparent stiffness compared to using strain derived from machine cross-head displacement. Additionally, a finite element model of the experiments using a combination of an Ogden and fibre exponential power law model for the linea alba was implemented to quantify the effect of <b>clamping</b> and tissue <b>dimensions</b> (which are suboptimal for tensile testing) on the results. The preliminary model results were used to apply a correction factor to the uniaxial experimental data prior to inverse optimisation to derive best fit material parameters for the fibre reinforced Ogden model. Application of the model to the equi-load biaxial case showed some differences compared to the experimental data, suggesting a more complex anisotropic model may be necessary to capture biaxial behaviour. These results provide an improved assessment of the mechanical properties of the porcine linea alba for wound closure and other studie...|$|R

Lewis studied and illustrated the development of the basidia in order to compare the nuclear behavior of the two-spored with that of the four-spored forms. Initially (1), the young basidium, appearing as a club-shaped branch from the subhymenium, is filled with cytoplasm and contains two primary nuclei, which have distinct nucleoli. As the basidium grows larger, the membranes of the two nuclei contact (2), and then the membrane disappears at the point of contact (3). The two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time, but eventually the two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single secondary nucleolus (4, 5). The basidium increases in size after the primary nuclei fuse, and the nucleus migrates towards the end of the basidia (6, 7). During this time, the nucleus develops vacuoles [...] "filled by the nuclear sap in the living cell". Chromosomes are produced from the nucleolar threads, and align transversely near the apex of the basidium, connected by spindles (8-10). The chromosomes then move to the poles, forming the daughter nuclei that occupy different positions in the basidium; the daughters now have a structure similar to that of the parent nuclei (11). The two nuclei then divide to form four nuclei, similar to fungi with four-spored basidia (12, 13). The four nuclei crowd together at some distance from the end of the basidium to form an irregular mass (14). Shortly thereafter, the sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia that attach the spores) begin to form (15), and cytoplasm begins to pass through the sterigmata to form the spores (16). Although Lewis was not able to clearly determine from observation alone whether the contents of two or four nuclei passed through the sterigmata, he deduced, by examining older basidia with mature spores, that only two nuclei enter the spores (16, 17).|$|R
