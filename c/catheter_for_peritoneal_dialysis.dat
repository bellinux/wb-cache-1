40|$|The Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) {{classification}} system correlates hospital performance with their relative costs and encourages more efficient productive processes. We report the following parameters: a) {{the distribution of}} hospital discharges according to the Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs) and DRGs; b) the relationship between mean length of stay and threshold values; c) economic analysis of the cost-reimbursement pay-off. The results showed that 71. 3 % of DRGs belonged to nephro-urological MDC 11 and 28. 7 % in other internal MDCs (mainly involving cardiac and respiratory system). Of the latter, 67. 7 % were utilized for dialysis and transplant patients and kidney donors. In MDC 11 the most common DRGs were: the surgical DRG 315, produced by the vascular accesses for hemodialysis and by insertion of Tenckoff <b>catheter</b> <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis,</b> DRG 316 by cases of acute and chronic renal failure, DRG 332 by biopsy-proven glomerulonephritides. The length of stay was most commonly within range of one-third of threshold value for specific DRG; there was a low percentage of one-day stays and outlier cases. The economic analysis demonstrated that mean daily reimbursement sum was 590, 714 ITL. Analysis of the overall costs yielded a mean daily cost of 455, 838 ITL. In conclusion, quality indicators show that, appropriately, our specialist activity is largely devoted to the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} acute and chronic nephropathies and complications following dialysis and renal transplant...|$|E
50|$|Originally {{isolated}} from patients with otitis media, A. xylosoxidans {{has since been}} periodically described as a pathogen of humans.

40|$|Primary {{preventive}} measures for patients undergoingdialysis for kidney failure have previously been over-shadowed by concerns about more urgent health problems. In the last 3 to 4 decades, improvements in dialysis and transplantation have reduced {{morbidity and mortality}} among patients with end-stage renal disease.

40|$|Objective: Peritoneal {{dialysis}} {{remains the}} only available option for patients which need immediate dialysis {{and it could be}} a bridge between end-stage renal failure (ESRD) and transplantation. There is a paucity of published experience of children with immediate use of permanent Tenckhoff <b>Catheter</b> <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> from developing countries. In this study we report our experience on immediate use of permanent peritoneal access and continued peritoneal dialysis for a prolonged time. Methods: Fifty six patients were studied including 30 males and 26 females within the age range of 1 month to 14 years with mean age of 6. 5 years in Urmia, Northwest Iran. Findings: No operative morbidity was seen. During a total of 499. 5 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis months, 16 patients had 28 episodes of peritonitis, which means a overall result of one episode per 17. 8 months. There were 3 patients (5. 35 %) with catheter site leakage, 12 (21. 4 %) catheter obstructions (which led to omentectomy), 4 (7. 2 %) exit site infections (2 patients in the early postoperative period and 2 patients in during follow up). Death due to catheter related complications occurred in 1 per 56 patients and due to non-catheter related causes in 10 per 56 patients. Conclusion: Present results indicate that catheter-related complications were not higher than those previously reported and peritoneal dialysis could be initiated immediately after catheter implantation and could be a safe bridge between end-stage renal failure (ESRD) and transplantation...|$|E

MC exhibited a phenotype different from macrophages, but MHC class II molecules were well expressed. Therefore MC lines were tested for antigen-presenting capacity by pulsing with soluble antigens (tetanus toxoid and {{purified protein derivative}} (PPD)) or with a corpusculate antigen (Candida albicans bodies). Autologous {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) depleted of adherent monocytes and cloned T cells generated from an individual matched for the MHC class II antigen DR 2 were used to test antigen-presenting function. MC effectively presented the soluble and corpusculate antigens to autologous and MHC-compatible allogeneic lymphocytes, indicating that they are endowed with both endocytic/phagocytic activity and with processing/presenting capacity. Preincubation of MC with human recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) up-regulated MHC class II and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) expression, but the effect on antigen-presenting function was not consistent.

40|$|Background: At present {{there are}} various more or less in-vasive {{surgical}} and laparoscopic ways to place a <b>catheter</b> suit-able <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> (PD); however, once the catheter is in place, there is no possibility to inspect the peritoneal cavity without de novo laparotomy or laparoscopy. ¤ Patients and Methods: To establish a minimally invasive technique and allowing for maximal options, we used a PD catheter with an extra large inside diameter of 3. 5 mm. Because of the enlarged inner diameter of 3. 5 mm (com-pared to 2. 6 mm in standard Tenckhoff catheters), this de-vice can be passed by a very thin video-endoscope with an external diameter of 2. 8 mm. Using a stepwise approach, we applied this device in placing PD catheters in 2 patients. The procedure could be done without complications. Both patients were doing well 4 and 6 months later, respectively, without any PD-related complications. Intraperitoneal view by the endoscope was limited; an attempt to obtain a peri-toneal biopsy failed. ¤ Conclusions: If the drawbacks of this method can be over-come {{it will have a}} wide spectrum of applications (i. e., in-spection of the peritoneal cavity and obtaining peritoneal biopsies at any time during PD treatment). In this way it can be used scientifically and clinically when a problem of flow or ultrafiltration occurs or when encapsulating scle-rosing peritonitis is suspected...|$|R

The most important non-infectious gastrointestinal complications in patients on <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> are: gastrointestinal bleeding, herniation and leaking of the dialysate from the abdomen (increased intra-abdominal pressure), impaired lung function (intra-abdominal hypertension), acute pancreatitis, and encapsulating sclerosis of the peritoneum. Intra-abdominal hypertension is defined as IAP ≥ 12 mmHg. Pouring the <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> solution leads to increased intra-abdominal pressure, which results {{in the development of}} hernias, pleuro-peritoneal dialysate leakage (hydrothorax), and restrictive pulmonary dysfunction. Risk factors for the development of acute pancreatitis in this patient population include: uraemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, features of the <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> solution (osmolarity, acidity, glucose, chemical irritation, and calcium in the solution <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> lead to “local hypercalcemia”), toxic substances from the dialysate, the bags and tubing, and peritonitis and treatment of peritonitis with antibiotics and anticoagulants.

40|$|Pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil in {{patients}} with end-stage renal failure. BackgroundMycophenolate mofetil (MMF) acts as a prodrug for the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic acid (MPA). It is rapidly converted to MPA following oral ingestion. MPA is metabolized to MPA glucuronide (MPAG), which is renally excreted. This study examines the pharmacokinetics of MPA and MPAG {{in patients}} with end-stage renal failure who were on hemodialysis (N = 10) or <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> (N = 10) treatment. MethodsAfter an overnight fast, a single oral dose of 1 g MMF was given. Plasma concentrations of MPA and MPAG were measured from 0 (predose) to 36 hours after administration, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from 0 to 36 hours was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. ResultsMean (± SD) AUC for MPA was 55. 7 ± 32. 6 mg/L · h for hemodialysis patients and 44. 7 ± 14. 7 mg/L · h <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> patients, {{which is similar to}} expected values for subjects with normal renal function. The mean (± SD) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for MPA was lower than would be expected for subjects with normal renal function (16. 01 ± 10. 61 mg/L for hemodialysis, 11. 48 ± 4. 98 mg/L <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis).</b> MPAG clearance was prolonged with AUC approximately five times what would be expected in subjects with normal renal function (1565 ± 596 mg/L · h for hemodialysis, 1386 ± 410 mg/L · h <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis).</b> There was no significant difference for any of the pharmacokinetic parameters between subjects on hemodialysis and those on <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> Plasma concentrations of MPA and MPAG did not fall significantly during hemodialysis.
