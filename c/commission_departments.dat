40|$|Its {{purpose is}} to prepare the ground for the discussions within the Solvency Subcommittee on the case for drawing on risk-based capital models to {{formulate}} new European solvency rules. In this connection, {{a number of questions}} to which the delegations are asked to reply in writing are set {{out at the end of}} the note. The <b>Commission</b> <b>departments</b> would, as far as possible, like to receive these written replies by 7 December 2001 in order to be able to present a summary of them at the meeting scheduled for 19 December. More generally, the delegations are asked to make any comments they deem expedient on this note or on the matter at issue (risk-based capital systems). A risk-based capital system is a system in which the minimum capital requirement is based on the risk – or risks – facing an insurance company. This is thus a very broad definition. It may include the European minimum margin rule: using simple indicators, this rule seeks to set a capital requirement in terms of the "business fluctuations " 1 that occur once a company has set aside sufficient technical provisions and holds appropriate investments...|$|E

The widespread use of MT in the Commission is fairly recent. In 1988 only 4 000 pages were processed by MT. In 1994 this figure had risen to 140 000 pages {{as a result of}} a promotion campaign and improvements to the Commission's computer infrastructure. An in-depth study of our use of MT reveals that there are about 2, 500 users, 20 % of whom are in the Translation Service and 80 % in the other <b>Commission</b> <b>departments.</b> The majority of users are non-linguist staff who help themselves to {{machine translation}} as and when they need it. Users ’ expectations of the product of the machine should not be unduly high. MT can be entrusted with only short-lived documents required urgently for information or preparatory work. The professional translator must continue to be responsible for all texts which are legally binding or which are for publication. Raw machine translation has three distinct applications within the operational departments of the institution. First, for translation, particularly for short or urgen...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} we construct security threats. Theoretically, {{it contributes to}} the literature on securitization and threat construction, which has hitherto overlooked how influential bureaucracies that – in contrast to the police and the military – have little to gain from widened threat perceptions, may still contribute to threat construction. The dissertation studies the European Commission and the issue of irregular immigration. By using frame analysis, it firstly explores what constructions of irregular immigration that the Commission generates and to what extent these contribute to threat construction. Using the Bourdieusian concepts of field, capital and habitus, it secondly analyzes how certain constructions of irregular immigration are authorized at the expense of others, due to the inner bureaucratic logic of the Commission. The empirical result reveals that the Commission mostly defines irregular immigrants as victims, yet simultaneously favors policy solutions that mainly seek to avert immigration. The Commission thus contributes to threat construction primarily through its policy solutions. Studying the inner logic of the Commission field highlights how informal routines and tacit power relations between <b>Commission</b> <b>departments</b> authorize certain frames over others. Importantly, the analysis shows how the naming of irregular immigrants as victims tends not to cost the officials anything in terms of symbolic capital, whereas the suggesting of less restrictive solutions tends to do so. Definitions and policy solutions thus follow different bureaucratic logics, which enables a mismatch between them. Moreover, the threat construction appears not because Commission officials believe that restrictive measures are the only way to solve problems linked to irregular immigration. On the contrary, officials believe that a multitude of solutions are needed. Instead, the threat construction is an unintended consequence of the logic of the field.

40|$|Popularization is a {{controversial}} field which, like modality, {{appears to be}} rather slippery and fuzzy, therefore still in need of much investigation as {{to the definition of}} its proper boundaries, its own linguistic markers, the ‘operationalization’ of control and power relations and embedding of political implications in it. Variation due to the co-existence of different types of popularization in the dissemination of specialized knowledge to lay people renders the whole matter all the more so. In an attempt to provide some new insights with particular reference to institutional discourse, this study aims to investigate features of popularization in the dissemination of legal knowledge in Summaries of EU legislation within the areas of freedom, security and justice. The Summaries, which are retrievable from the EU website, are in the form of factsheets which, following a standardised template, are drafted by a team of legal writers, who take account of any amendments to the law, and then validated by the relevant <b>Commission</b> <b>departments.</b> Adoptions of related acts are included in the Summaries. Each Summary thus simplifies one specific piece of legislation in force, e. g. Directive, Regulation or Decision (summaries of preparatory and other acts, communications, etc. are also provided as well as a link to the official and full-length version of the legislative provision on the EUR-Lex or PreLex site) and provides up-to-date coverage of EU legislation, except legal decisions having only temporary interest. It is worth noticing that the Summaries of EU legislation have only an informative and popularizing function and no legal value, as is underlined in the EU website. As to web users, {{it is not easy to}} identify and define the target audience of the Summaries since it will presumably include both experts and lay people. In fact, the Summaries provide specialized knowledge through links for the former, or anyone wishing to approach legislative provisions more closely, and general information for the latter. It is due to the peculiar nature of this type of popularization that the boundaries between the target (the Summary) and the source text (the Directive) are rather flexible...|$|E
