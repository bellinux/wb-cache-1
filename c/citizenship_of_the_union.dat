It focuses on both the ‘integration’ and the ‘constitution’ dimensions. The paper thus has two substantive sections. The first addresses the role of <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union,</b> examining the dynamic relationship between this concept, the role of the Court of Justice, and the free movement dynamic of EU law. The second turns to citizenship in the Union, looking at some recent political developments under which concepts of citizenship, and democratic membership as a key dimension of citizenship, have been given greater prominence. One key finding of the paper is that there is a tension between <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union,</b> as part of the EU's ‘old’ incremental constitutionalism based on the constitutionalisation of the existing Treaties, and citizenship in the Union, where the possibilities of a ‘new’ constitutionalism based on renewed constitutional documents have yet to be fully realise...|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} of the <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> was rooted {{in an effort to}} increase democratic legitimacy and, in the work of some authors, {{there seems to be an}} implicit agreement that the common practice of citizenship rights could become the basis for the development of a positive solidarity that might generate an independent source of legitimacy for the EU. This paper explores whether the <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> may become an autonomous source for Union legitimacy by focusing on two issues. Firstly, it seems that some Union citizenship rights, particularly the rights to freely move and reside within the EU, do establish legitimacy basis for the EU. That is, the praxis of such rights may create a substrata of acceptance of European Union. Political rights, though, are the essential citizenship rights; therefore it is necessary to determine to which extent the political participation afforded by EU citizenship establishes a legitimacy channel autonomous from nationality. On the catalogue of rights included by the Treaty on European Union, the legitimacy deficit in the concept and implementing elements of political rights created by their reliance on nationality will be examined (ID. Secondly, the difficulties to develop social rights or redistributive entitlements, on the other hand, mean that <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> will not substitute the individuals perception of material belonging around nationality (IIl). In either case, it seems evident that the traditional attachment of citizenship (as a status of rights) to the idea of nation provides legitimacy grounds for the development of certain rights which constitute the essence of citizenship. If citizenship is built up as a set of rights without no reference to the community identity contained in the idea of nationality, there will be a lack of legitimacy to include certain rights. Anticipating the conclusion (IV), a concept of citizenship that goes further than the mere harmonization of certain secondary political rights seems to require the previous development of forms of pan-Union identity if it is to avoid legitimacy deficits. The reasoning will commence establishing a conceptual difference between citizenship and nation as two different ways of relating individuals to public power in their legitimacy function (I) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two aspects}} of the 'citizenship dimension' of the IGC agenda, {{in the light of}} a broader argument about the role of <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> in feeding the construction and development of a 'European polity'. It is argued that citizenship was always likely to become a salient issue of debate in the 1990 s EU, but that the concept which exists so far in Treaty form is extremely weak in nature. Against this background, the paper develops the arguments in favour of amendments to the EU Treaties to incorporate a 'non-discrimination' clause and enhanced individual access to EU institutional documents, concluding that such changes represent a fundamental aspect of polity-formation within the EU, so far as concerns the vital role of citizens.

40|$|The {{prohibition}} of discrimination, {{at least on}} grounds of nationality, {{has always been a}} constitutional principle of Community law. Such discrimination can take many forms, since Community law prohibits not only direct discrimination but various forms of indirect discrimination. Furthermore, the Court of Justice has indicated that where discrimination on grounds of nationality is in issue, the requirement of proof is not a heavy one on the complainant. All that is needed to place the burden on the respondent to justify the potentially differential treatment is that complainants show that the requirement applied to them is intrinsically likely, or susceptible by its very nature, to affect them adversely in comparison with the State's own nationals.

40|$|Despite the {{ultimatum}} {{delivered in}} October 2010 to the French government by Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the European Commission, to adapt its national immigration law ‘to the letter’ of the Citizens Directive 2004 / 38, {{the country has}} continued to evict and expel Romanian and Bulgarian nationals of Roma origin. This paper examines the state of affairs with respect to France’s policy on eviction and expulsion of Roma and assesses {{the way in which}} the controversy has developed and can be understood from the perspective of citizenship of the EU. On the basis of an examination of the subsequent responses by the European Commission and the EU member states involved, as well as of a recent bilateral agreement concluded between France and Romania on the reintegration of families of Romanian citizens belonging to the Roma minority who have exercised their freedom to move, the paper suggests that there has been a paradigm shift in the priorities driving EU policy responses and politics. This shift has led to an ethnicisation of <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union,</b> where ethnicity increasingly plays a decisive role in the allocation and attribution of responsibility to secure and safeguard the union freedoms...|$|E

In many of those cases, Gordon Slynn was the Advocate General. The advent of formal recognition of Union citizenship in the Treaty of Maastricht has not obviated the need to consider the range of rights which flow from such citizenship when an individual is in a Member State other than that of his nationality. These rights still, though to a lesser extent than before, turn on economic activity, or a close link to economic activity.

40|$|Being {{nationals}} of a Member State, such as Romania, {{we all are}} {{citizens of}} the European Union. But, is being European citizens important for us? Does it change in any way our regular life? At European level, the usual remark is that “the importance of <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> {{lies in the fact}} that the citizens of the Union have genuine rights under Community law. ” In other words, this is as much as saying that the importance of citizenship lies in its consequences. But the content given to European Citizenship will be absolutely relevant to understand its meaning and though its importance: if rights conferred by citizenship were, for example, insignificant, what would be the added value of being European citizen? So, starting from the article 20. 2 of the Consolidated Version of the T. F. U. E. (ex Article 17 TEC) “Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights and be subject to the duties provided for in the Treaties”, we shall focus the presentation on the EU core rights.

40|$|While {{citizenship}} and nationality {{have historically been}} tied very closely to the nation state, the introduction of Union citizenship in the early 1990 s has introduced a European dimension to citizenship rights in the EU. This chapter {{provides an overview of}} the legal basis in EU primary and secondary law for Union citizenship, while examining the relationship between Union and national citizenship, as well as the independent content of Union citizenship, and its impact on student mobility. It finds that because <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> is derived from and based upon national citizenship, the EU's Member States retain broad discretion over the criteria for granting citizenship, as well as many of the rights that go along with it. Nonetheless, this chapter also highlights that increasingly, Member States exercise these rights subject to the principles of mutual recognition and proportionality, as enforced by the ECJ. At the same time, by expanding longstanding rights of movement and enhancing protections against {{discrimination on the basis of}} nationality, Union citizenship has significantly expanded access to social services by EU nationals living in another EU Member State, and to dependents living elsewhere in the Union. For students, all of this means that access to higher education institutions is guaranteed to Union citizens, while maintenance grants and other social services are guaranteed after a minimum period of continuous residence...|$|E
40|$|The {{provisions}} of the EC Treaty on <b>citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> introduce a fundamental democratic element {{in the process of}} European political integration. The focus of integration is no longer on an economic factor of production (workers) but on politically self-determined citizens. <b>Citizenship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union,</b> however, does not constitute a full status of European citizenship, because of its incompleteness in terms of entitlements and its dependence on Member States' nationality. The development of Union citizenship into a complete status of citizenship depends on Member States' determination to transfer essential aspects of sovereignty to the Community and achieve full political integration. If Union citizenship is to evolve from the current form of derived status of Member States' nationality into a more complete and independent European citizenship, it must be followed by a parallel evolution in the field of collective identity of the citizens. In the EU legal order, citizenship, if taken in its `national meaning', could be a fundamental element in the consolidation of the Union as a `state-like phenomenon'. The current `national understanding' requires the existence of a common national identity (based on culture, language, traditions and in some cases ethnicity) to sustain the legal and political framework made of rights and obligations of membership. At European level, however, this approach is unlikely to work because of the different national and cultural identities of the people of Europe. Alternatively it is argued that Europe needs a radical change in the conception of citizenship and democracy to proceed in the direction of political integration. Only a strictly political European identity based on association and participation could co-ordinate the different allegiances that European citizens already have towards institutions and groups other than the Union, {{and at the same time}} create a common political bond among them. Despite this fundamental change, the extension of citizenship beyond the national boundaries should take place without endangering those citizens' rights, which have been developed in the context of the nation-state, in particular the principles of liberty and equality. The great challenge faced by the European Union consists in dissociating those rights from the tie of nationhood. On a point of eligibility, European political identity could not be used to exclude `cultural outsiders' from European citizenship, regardless of whether they come from a Member State or a third country. As European identity would lack a common cultural basis, the same concept of `cultural outsider' would not apply to European citizenship. As a result such type citizenship would be naturally open to non-European immigrants, who already reside in the Union, but who are excluded from national citizenship, and to prospective third country immigrants. The openness of a politically based European citizenship and identity contrasts with the restrictive European Union immigration and asylum policies (fortress Europe). In the absence of cultural or ethnic common grounds, fortress Europe seems to be based mainly on contingent economic reasons, such as the protection of the European labour markets and welfare systems. It appears that in the long term, due to demographic changes, these economic reasons might disappear together with the restrictive immigration policies. In the meanwhile, however, there seems to be no excuse for the non-integration of resident third country nationals into European citizenship...|$|E
