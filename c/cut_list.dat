50|$|When {{the film}} {{workprint}} {{had been cut}} to a satisfactory state, it was then used to make an edit decision list (EDL). The negative cutter referred to this list while processing the negative, splitting the shots into rolls, which were then contact printed to produce the final film print or answer print. Today, production companies {{have the option of}} bypassing negative cutting altogether. With the advent of digital intermediate ("DI"), the physical negative does not necessarily need to be physically cut and hot spliced together; rather the negative is optically scanned into computer(s) and a <b>cut</b> <b>list</b> is conformed by a DI editor.|$|E

5000|$|Originally {{shot with}} 8 IMAX cameras {{outfitted}} {{with the first}} long load film magazines, for 5 concerts in 3 cities. The magazines were so huge and the ballistics of the loading so unpredictable, there was no guarantee of complete coverage of any song in any single concert. Eventually trying to cut this on a flatbed proved impossible. Recently re-released EditDroids were in Toronto on various projects and one was custom configured {{with the help of}} the folks at Lucas in Los Angeles. All 35mm [...] "twist reduction" [...] work print was reassembled in original rolls, transferred to video and recorded on one-off laser videodiscs. The 8-headed Droid could load all data bases and imaging for a single song in all concert locations. The editors could jump to any point in a song, see what was available (or not) then jump to the same spot in all subsequent concerts. The trick was tracing back from the Droid data through LaserDisc data through video data back to 35mm stepdown print edge code and ultimately to the original IMAX neg - frame accurately to produce the neg <b>cut</b> <b>list</b> that needed to sync with the original 64 track digital recordings.|$|E

50|$|Reverse {{telecine}} {{is crucial}} when acquiring film material into a digital non-linear editing system such as Lightworks, Sony Vegas Pro, Avid, or Final Cut Pro, since these machines produce negative <b>cut</b> <b>lists</b> which refer to specific frames {{in the original}} film material. When video from a telecine is ingested into these systems, the operator usually has available a “telecine trace,” {{in the form of}} a text file, which gives the correspondence between the video material and film original. Alternatively, the video transfer may include telecine sequence markers “burned in” to the video image along with other identifying information such as time code.|$|R

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} was discontinued in 1920, when {{responsibility for}} the light was transferred to Trinity House, who decided {{to establish a new}} beacon at Burry Holms. However, after pleas from local yachtsmen, the light was relit in the 1980s. This gave an additional point of reference when navigating the waters between the Gower Peninsula and Burry Port: on dark nights, boat crews often found themselves on top of Whiteford Point before realizing the fact. The cost was £1,300, with £1,000 being funded by the Harbour Commissioners and the balance by Burry Port Yacht Club. The new light was fully automatic and switched on when daylight faded to a pre-determined level.
