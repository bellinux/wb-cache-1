The <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> generated by the portfolio {{for the first year}} would be $100,380. This consists of the principal of the bond maturing on February 15 next year plus the coupon interest payments flowing from all the other bonds.

It differs from a “benchmark-driven” strategy, which is based on achieving better returns than an external index such as the S&P 500 or a combination of indices that invest in the same types of asset classes. LDI is designed for situations where future liabilities can be predicted with some degree of accuracy. For individuals, the classic example would be the stream of withdrawals from a retirement portfolio that a retiree will make to pay living expenses from the date of retirement to the date of death. For companies, the classic example would be a pension fund that must make future payouts to pensioners over their expected lifetimes (see below).|$|R

Despite these findings, observed evidence indicates many producers choose not to retain ownership. Three reasons that may explain this include tradition, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>needs</b> of the business and risk. Producers who choose to retain ownership of their cattle face the risk of volatile markets and production challenges. This investigation explores the possibility that cow-calf producers may be able to mitigate a portion of these risks by selectively screening calves with specific physical characteristics. The driving logic behind this study is that physical characteristics of calves are commonly expected to predict physical performance.

As the international visibility of localities cannot be increased unless thoughtful and well-funded investment plans are implemented to remediate local infrastructure, local public authorities must see that citizens are still satisfied with the level of taxation and the public services provided. Local public authorities must prove fully responsible with the public money and grant low-income people the possibility to pay taxes by installments. Additionally, they must innovate, granting citizens various methods of payment of taxes and duties due: at the cash desk, through bank transfer or by credit card. Within the research conducted among local public authorities in Transylvania, the authors attempt to highlight to what degree these objectives are implemented in localities studied by decision-makers, as well as citizens’ degree of satisfaction with these objectives...|$|R

The main financial objective of a pension fund is to ensure the benefit payments by investing money from contributions. To do this, the investment policy must assure two conditions: equilibrium and liquidity- long and short term solvency. Several articles in literature have proposed stochastic programming models for optimal investment allocation. However, in all those works, the equilibrium risk is measured at the end of the planning horizon by comparing the final wealth in each scenario to a fixed capital requirement obtained independently from the investment policy adopted, assuming a portfolio of one fixed income contract without risk. We propose a method for measuring and controlling the equilibrium risk that takes into account the fact that the pension fun...|$|E
40|$|Selected Paper {{prepared}} for {{presentation at the}} Agricultural & Applied Economics Association’s 2009 AAEA & ACCI Joint AnnualSmallholder farmers {{in many areas of}} the semiarid tropics are planting exotic tree species that provide alternative income sources, fuel, and building materials. While providing other benefits, these trees often occupy land that could produce annual food crops. This study uses a polyperiod, linear programming model, to explore the opportunity cost of planting Eucalyptus grandis and Grevillea robusta trees compared to crops in the Nyando watershed of western Kenya. Results of the ten-year period wealth maximization model suggest that a representative farmer’s decisions on farm resource allocation are sensitive to changes in the relative prices of short rotation tree products and annual crops. The model also suggests that there are economic tradeoffs between planting trees and crops, as well as between planting different tree species. Timber production is not likely to replace food crops for two main reasons: (1) the high cost of meeting household subsistence requirements from marketed grains, (2) household <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>needs</b> met by annual crops.

40|$|What {{economic}} and political factors have made cost recovery for rural water systems so difficult in the Nsuuka district of Anambra State? This paper found that households in the region {{do not want to}} pay for water in advance or commit themselves to a fixed monthly payment for water. They want the freedom to buy water only when they use it - partly because {{they do not want to}} buy water in the rainy season and partly because they want control of their cash flow in the event of more pressing needs. Equally important, they do not trust the government to provide a reliable public water supply. If required to pay a fixed fee every month, households are willing to pay only relatively small amounts for improved services. Current arrangements for cost recovery - fixed monthly fees for both public taps and unmetered private connections - are inappropriate. Kiosk systems or kiosk systems with metered private connections for some households are the most promising way to improve cost recovery and meet consumers's <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>needs.</b> Kiosk systems can provide less expensive, more reliable, and better quality water than water vendors do.

40|$|Executive Summary] The {{fisheries}} of Sierra Leone {{is usually}} subsumed under agriculture but contributes about 10 % of GDP which is considerably {{higher than the}} African average. Thus, the subsector is generally considered as having the potential to significantly contribute to poverty reduction/societal wellbeing. The artisanal fisheries sector with an annual catch of about 120, 000 mt {{is the focus of}} this investigation. The subsector has been plagued by disorganization and lack of post-harvest infrastructure which meant huge losses either in the form of low prices or outright putrefaction of harvest. As a means of overcoming such problems, the GoSL and ADB conceived and implemented AFDEP which provided fish receiving and processing facilities at Goderich, Tombo, Shenge and Bonthe. This study sets out to gauge the economic viability of these facilities under a PPP arrangement. In carrying-out the study, we examined the ‘Commercial’; ‘Cooperative’ and ‘Hybrid’ options of PPP arrangements concluding after extensive consultation with stakeholders that the ‘Cooperative’ approach fits better in the Sierra Leone context. This is so because under this arrangement, the interests [equity stake and capacity rights] are allocated to participating private sector parties at the time of ‘Shareholders Agreement’ execution and it’s more flexible in terms of upfront <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>needs</b> {{on the part of the}} private sector participants at the time of initial investment.

This example is a couple who wants to retire this year (call it 20XY, such as 2018) and has already set aside cash to cover their expenses. Social security will supply some income, but the rest {{will have to come}} from their portfolio. They have accumulated a retirement portfolio worth $2,000,000 in addition to this year's expenses. Typically, retirement portfolios have a higher percentage of bonds in their portfolio than portfolios owned by younger people who are not yet approaching retirement. Probably the most common retirement portfolio would be a 60/40 stock/bond allocation compared to an 80/20 or 90/10 stock/bond allocation for younger investors. Following a common rule of thumb for retirement withdrawal rates to make a retirement portfolio last at least 30 years, they should withdraw no more than 5 percent from their portfolio next year ($100,000). They can increase it each year by the amount of the previous year’s inflation. To be conservative, they will plan for an annual inflation rate of 3 percent (they may not spend it, but want the protection just in case). Table 1, lists the projected stream of withdrawals.

40|$|This version {{represents}} {{an updated version}} of our original article that appeared in the Journal of Wealth Management (Winter 2009). We added a step to our framework, which suggests a critical analytical method be used in the case where an investor faces a large degree of portfolio liabilities relative to overall assets. A majority of private client practitioners rely on mean-variance optimization (MVO), rules of thumb, or model portfolios for making asset allocation recommendations. Considerations for income levels and other constraints figure into the typical approach. However, not enough attention is given to the nature of an investor’s multiple time horizons and implications for <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> These are the future demands placed upon the portfolio. The risks that these demands will not be met need to be clearly understood in order to validate any asset allocation decision. This study presents an approach of incorporating MVO within a multi-horizon, asset-liability management risk model. This approach allows for cash-flow matching of a portion of an investor’s portfolio within the optimization framework. This allows an individual’s portfolio to provide short-term <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> as <b>needed,</b> while also considering the longer-term demands on the portfolio. ...|$|R
