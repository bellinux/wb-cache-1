5|$|A {{number of}} <b>citrus</b> plants yield pressed oils. Some, such as lemon and orange oil, {{are used as}} {{essential}} oils, which is uncommon for pressed oils. The seeds of many if not {{most members of the}} <b>citrus</b> family yield usable oils.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, President of the United States Barack Obama {{issued a}} {{disaster}} declaration for Baker, Bradford, <b>Citrus,</b> Clay, Columbia, Duval, Franklin, Gilchrist, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lafayette, Manatee, Nassau, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, Suwannee, Taylor, Union, and Wakulla Counties of Florida. In <b>Citrus</b> County, total individual assistance of $127,000 was paid out to 140residents, including $112,000 in damage to housing. A total of 1,671applications for individual assistance were filed in Pinellas County, totaling $900,000.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Needham noted a Chinese text {{dating from}} 304 AD, Records of the Plants and Trees of the Southern Regions, by Hsi Han, which {{describes}} mandarin oranges protected by large reddish-yellow <b>citrus</b> ants which attack and kill insect pests {{of the orange}} trees. The <b>citrus</b> ant (Oecophylla smaragdina) was rediscovered in the 20th century, and since 1958 {{has been used in}} China to protect orange groves.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{control is}} first {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in <b>citrus</b> plantations to control beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, <b>citrus</b> trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in <b>citrus</b> plantations in California to control scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and biological pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli <b>citrus</b> farmers, damaged the local <b>citrus</b> industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of the Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E

5|$|In Jones' sophomore season, Tech powered {{through their}} {{schedule}} {{and won the}} ACC. The four game unbeaten streak in 1989 extended {{all the way through}} 1990 and into the 1991 <b>Citrus</b> Bowl. The key victory in the streak was a huge 41-38 come from behind upset victory over then No.1 ranked Virginia in Charlottesville before a nationwide TV audience. Tech demolished Nebraska 45–21 in the 1991 <b>Citrus</b> Bowl, finishing the season 11–0–1, and earning a share of the 1990 National Title with the Colorado Buffaloes.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the point}} of its first landfall, few {{structures}} were destroyed and ocean overwash across the barrier island was limited, though {{the extent of the}} damage far exceeded that of Hurricane Charley. Wind damage to <b>citrus</b> groves led to a near total loss near the coast of east-central Florida between West Palm Beach and Melbourne, with lesser damage farther to the west across the Kissimmee River basin. Between Hurricane Charley and Frances, <b>citrus</b> losses totaled $2billion (2004 dollars). Significant tree damage was reported within golf courses along the Treasure Coast, with an average of 300-500 trees experiencing damage per course.|$|E
5|$|A lot of Israelis keep {{fruit trees}} in their yards, <b>citrus</b> (especially orange and lemon) {{being the most}} common. Mangos are also now popular as {{household}} trees. Mulberry trees are frequently seen in public gardens, and their fruit is popularly served alongside various desserts and as a juice.|$|E
5|$|A {{similarly}} {{enormous number}} of lac bugs are {{needed to make a}} kilogram of shellac, a brush-on colourant and wood finish. Additional uses of this traditional product include the waxing of <b>citrus</b> fruits to extend their shelf-life, and the coating of pills to moisture-proof them, provide slow-release or mask the taste of bitter ingredients.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{losses were}} heavy. In Florida, the second-largest {{producer}} of oranges in the world, {{damage to the}} <b>citrus</b> crop was estimated at $200million, and caused a 50% increase {{in the price of}} grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other storms that hit Florida during 2004, caused a total agricultural loss of $2.2billion. Other crops, nurseries, buildings, and agricultural equipment also suffered.|$|E

5|$|Ants perform many {{ecological}} {{roles that}} are beneficial to humans, including {{the suppression of}} pest populations and aeration of the soil. The use of weaver ants in <b>citrus</b> cultivation in southern China {{is considered one of}} the oldest known applications of biological control.

5|$|In 1860, a {{much closer}} gold rush {{occurred}} in the San Bernardino Mountains when prospector William Holcomb discovered significant deposits, just over the northern drainage divide of the Santa Ana River. This discovery exploded into a full-scale gold mining operation in days. The Santa Ana River served as a conduit for miners traveling to the region {{and many of the}} forests in the upper basin experienced clearcutting {{as a result of the}} high resource demands of the boom. Gold was also discovered in Lytle Creek in that same year. Following the gold rush, the cultivation of <b>citrus</b> became the mainstay of the economy of the lower Santa Ana River area. Through the late 19th century, <b>citrus</b> fields covered much of the coastal plain and led to the naming of Orange County.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Deir al-Balah had a {{population}} of 2,560, all Arabs, with 14,735 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 327 dunams were for <b>citrus</b> and bananas, 472 plantations and irrigable land, 14,438 used for cereals, while 39 dunams were built-up land. In the lead-up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, residents of Deir al-Balah participated in a local attack against the nearby kibbutz of Kfar Darom, despite being discouraged by Egyptian Army officers, but they were repelled and suffered casualties. During the war, Egypt captured the town along with other towns {{in an area that}} became known as the Gaza Strip. The Egyptians later established a sharia court system that held jurisdiction over personal affairs. Egyptian rule introduced relative prosperity to Deir al-Balah. The town witnessed a booming <b>citrus</b> industry made possible by the discovery of a substantial reservoir of ground water in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Isdud had a {{population}} of 4,620 Arabs and 290 Jews, {{with a total of}} 47,871 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 3,277 dunams were used <b>citrus</b> and bananas, 8,327 for plantations and irrigable land, 23,762 for cereals, while 131 dunams were built-up land.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring {{the sweetness of the}} wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more <b>citrus</b> tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having a higher level of ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, {{the company}} {{became one of}} the first {{companies}} to offer a frozen energy drink: Banzai Energy Ice, which it created with using the then popular energy drink Banzai. Though the 4-ounce product received good reviews for its <b>citrus</b> flavor and convenient squeeze-up container for on-the-go consumer, the product was a financial failure and was dropped.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, {{recurrent}} mouth ulcers may be {{a manifestation}} of an allergic reaction. Possible allergens include certain foods (e.g., chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, tomatoes, cheese, <b>citrus</b> fruits, benzoates, cinnamaldehyde, and highly acidic foods), toothpastes, and mouthwashes. Where dietary allergens are responsible, mouth ulcers usually develop within about 12–24 hours of exposure.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{also caused}} severe {{agricultural}} damage in southeastern Florida totalling to $338million Floodwaters killed 30cattle at one farm, though the owners protected {{the rest of}} their 1700cattle by raising the feeding areas above the flood plain. According to an initial estimate, the flooding destroyed between 5% and 15% of fruit groves along its path. The flooding delayed the winter planting of corn and bell peppers and damaged tomato plants, forcing Miami-Dade County growers to replant damaged crops. The hurricane also damaged sugar cane, vegetables, and <b>citrus</b> crops, with <b>citrus</b> canker spreading after the storm passed through the area. Due to the crop damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared Broward, Collier, Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties as disaster areas. This qualified eligible farmers for low-interest emergency loans.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong {{is a major}} {{production}} {{centre of}} gladioli in India, and orchids, which are exported to {{many parts of the}} world.

5|$|Near its {{landfall}} location, Charley destroyed 290 of the 300houses in the village, while over 70,000homes in Havana {{were either}} damaged or destroyed. Numerous hotels reported damage, potentially impacting the important tourism {{industry in the}} country. Agricultural damage was heavy, with the hurricane damaging more than 3,000 agricultural institutions. <b>Citrus</b> officials estimated a loss of 15,000metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000metric tons of <b>citrus</b> trees in the Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000acres (230km²) of fruit trees in the Havana area. Approximately 95% of the sugar cane, bean, and banana crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was directly responsible for four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.|$|E
5|$|Such {{behavior}} has been witnessed, {{as well as}} documented from stomach contents, with the American alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and <b>citrus</b> fruits directly from the trees. The discovery of this unexpected part of the American alligator diet further reveals that American alligators {{may be responsible for}} spreading seeds from the fruit it digests across its habitat. Additionally, American alligators engage in what seems to be cooperative hunting.|$|E
