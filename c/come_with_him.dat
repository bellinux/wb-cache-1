5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor.
