5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> our real nature.|$|E

Alex {{introduces}} her mother to Dr. Linus because he's been hurt after being battered by Desmond. Danielle and Alex bring him home for dinner. While Alex is doing her homework, Danielle and Dr. Linus talk about her. She tells him that {{since the death of}} her father when she was two, he's the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> a father figure that she has. Dr. Linus is visibly touched.|$|E

50|$|Bophuthatswana began issuing its own Postal Orders {{shortly after}} gaining {{independence}} from South Africa in 1977. As Bophuthatswana {{did not have}} its own banknotes (because its currency was the Rand), postal orders are the <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> banknotes Bophuthatswana ever had. The last day of issue was 26 April 1994.|$|R
50|$|The Bulldogs have {{established}} {{a reputation as one}} of the stronger teams in college basketball, having played in 16 consecutive NCAA tournaments and ascending to the #1 ranking in both major polls during the 2012-13 season.

5000|$|Summers and Swan {{claimed that}} Turner had gushed of a [...] "very serious affair" [...] between the two, {{and that they}} had only faked {{splitting}} up their relationship to oblige to MGM's concerns. Turner later denied the claims in her 1992 autobiography, saying that [...] "the <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> dates Frank and I enjoyed were a few box lunches at MGM".|$|R
25|$|In late 2005, Kines {{entered a}} pitch in a one-minute film {{competition}} sponsored by stock photo company Getty Images. His pitch, a bittersweet sci fi-tinged tone poem entitled The <b>Closest</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Time Travel, {{was selected as}} one of only 30 pitches (out of over 240 entries) to be turned into short films using Getty stock footage material. In early 2006 Kines finished his film, and when the competition was {{open to the public}} for final voting, The <b>Closest</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Time Travel won Kines the Grand Prize of $10,000 and trips to New York City, Chicago, and Bozeman, Montana, where Kines was a speaker at HATCHfest.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the party's independent, [...] "national communist" [...] course, the {{absolute}} control that Ceaușescu {{had over the}} party and the country led to some non-Romanian observers describing the PCR as one of the <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> an old-style Stalinist party. [...] For instance, Encyclopædia Britannica referred to the last 18 years of Ceaușescu's tenure as a period of [...] "neo-Stalinism," [...] and the last edition of the Country Study on Romania referred to the PCR's [...] "Stalinist repression of individual liberties." ...|$|R
25|$|Since Simpson's 1945 classification, the paleontological {{record has}} been recalibrated, and the {{intervening}} years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself, partly through the new concept of cladistics. Though field work gradually made Simpson's classification outdated, it remained the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> an official classification of mammals. See list of placental mammals and list of monotremes and marsupials for more detailed information on mammal genera and species.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} of the mythic past after the creation, Ra dwells on earth as king of the gods and of humans. This period is the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> a golden age in Egyptian tradition, {{the period of}} {{stability}} that the Egyptians constantly sought to evoke and imitate. Yet the stories about Ra's reign focus on conflicts between him and forces that disrupt his rule, reflecting the king's role in Egyptian ideology as enforcer of maat.|$|E
25|$|During these investigations, {{numerous}} witnesses {{came forward}} with damning testimony, almost all of which was corroborated by other witnesses. One witness, Captain Silas Soule, who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons, was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony. However, despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars' recommendation, no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre. Chivington was {{beyond the reach of}} army justice because he'd already resigned his commission.

50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the Communist Party—and indeed, nearly all other {{institutions}} in Romania—had become completely subordinated to Ceaușescu's will. This was {{in contrast to}} the situation in other Communist countries. Most ruling Communist Party leaders were merely first among equals, even with the great power that came with their posts. Although Ceaușescu was a national Communist, his absolute control over the country and the pervasiveness of the cult led several non-Romanian observers to describe his regime as one of the <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> an old-style Stalinist regime.|$|R
25|$|The Israelite {{system of}} {{measuring}} area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown {{with a certain}} volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 seahs of barley. The <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> a formal area unit was the yoke (Hebrew semed) (sometimes translated as acre), which referred {{to the amount of}} land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.|$|E
25|$|The son of Constantine was T'oros I, {{who succeeded}} him in around 1100. During his rule, he faced both Byzantines and Seljuks, and {{expanded}} the Rubenid domain. He transferred the Cilician capital from Tarsus to Sis after having eliminated the small Byzantine garrison stationed there. In 1112, {{he took the}} castle of Cyzistra in order to avenge {{the death of the}} last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. The assassins of the latter, three Byzantine brothers who governed the castle, were thus brutally killed. Eventually, there emerged a type of centralized government in the area with the rise of the Rubenid princes. During the twelfth century, they were the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> a ruling dynasty, and wrestled with the Byzantines for power over the region.|$|E
25|$|He {{had gained}} near-total control of RKO {{by the end}} of 1954 at a cost of nearly $24million, {{becoming}} the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> a sole owner of a Hollywood studio seen in three decades. Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions {{thanks in part to the}} limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5million in personal profit.|$|E

25|$|Schopenhauer {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met {{during the winter of}} 1813–1814 in Weimar at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of Herder, and an early Indologist. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in Dresden. This was through his neighbor of two years, Karl Christian Friedrich Krause. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered Sanskrit, unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned meditation and received the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> expert advice concerning Indian thought.|$|E
25|$|Luis Hernando de Larramendi gained no {{dedicated}} scholarly work; the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> a monograph are chapters {{dedicated to}} his father by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, Así se hizo MAPFRE (2000). Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they {{paint a picture of}} a Catholic taking communion almost every day, a profoundly idealist person, extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence. Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect, though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The Red Party was {{established}} by a merger of the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party in 2007. Torstein Dahle, {{the leader of the}} Red Electoral Alliance, was elected party leader. In the 2007 county election, Red received 1.9% of the vote, increasing its share by 1.6%. In an opinion poll conducted by TNS Gallup for TV2 in late August 2009, the party received 2.7% of the popular vote, an increase of 0.7%. Such a result in the election would mean that the party would have two parliamentary representatives, one from Oslo and one from Hordaland. In total, 12 opinion polls claimed that Red would win two seats in parliament. On seeing these poll results, Dahle said he would support the Red-Green Coalition, acknowledging that he couldn't topple the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> socialism to the right of Red. On 11 September, three days before election day, Jens Stoltenberg told the media that he didn't want the Red-Green Coalition to become dependent on Red in Parliament. Earlier, Ola Borten Moe from the Centre Party told Klassekampen that neither he nor his party would collaborate or affiliate themselves with Red.|$|E
