5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E
5|$|The darting <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> so {{forceful}} {{that the}} dart ends up {{buried in the}} internal organs. It can also happen that a dart will pierce the body or head entirely, and protrude on the other side.|$|E
2500|$|A {{historic}} British Rail Class 201 [...] "Thumper" [...] <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> seen (and heard) on historic runs to {{and from}} Hastings.|$|R

5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a {{temperature}} inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> felt or observed as a {{discharge from the}} nose or ear.|$|E
5|$|Carey <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> seen on {{the sidelines}} of U.S. National Team soccer games as a press photographer. His images are sold via wire {{services}} under the pseudonym Brooks Parkenridge. He was at the 2006 FIFA World Cup {{in the summer of}} 2006, for his television show Drew Carey's Sporting Adventures.|$|E

5|$|Disjunct {{populations of}} the giant {{freshwater}} stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another; though the species occurs in brackish environments, {{there is no evidence}} that it crosses marine waters. This is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat. Unexpectedly, it <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> found near heavily populated urban areas.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|Inversions. When on a {{clear and}} calm night, a {{radiation}} inversion is formed near the ground, the friction does not affect wind above {{the top of the}} inversion layer. The change in wind can be 90degrees in direction and 40kt in speed. Even a nocturnal (overnight) low level jet <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> observed. It tends to be strongest towards sunrise. Density differences cause additional problems to aviation.|$|E
25|$|Dual-purpose {{stations}} <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> still <b>be</b> found today, {{though in}} many cases goods facilities are restricted to major stations.|$|R

5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{problems}} due to Wilson's {{disease may}} include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These symptoms are often poorly defined and <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present.|$|E
5|$|Statives are a {{class of}} predicative words expressing a quality or state, whose {{syntactic}} properties fall in between those of verbs and adjectives in Indo-European languages. Like verbs, statives <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> inflected for person but normally lack inflections for tense, aspect and other purely verbal categories. Statives can be adjectives, positionals or numerals.|$|E

25|$|The Parnassius {{species of}} {{butterflies}} are often hard {{to identify and}} <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> only <b>be</b> identified by dissection of the genitalia.|$|R
5|$|The katipo is {{restricted}} to a highly specialised habitat and is only found near the seashore living among sand dunes. They generally reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where they are most sheltered from storms and sand movement. They <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> associated with dunes several kilometres from the sea when these dunes extend inland for long distances.|$|E
5|$|A third protein <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> {{involved}} in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In {{the case of}} the aforementioned MazEF addiction module, in addition to the toxin and antitoxin there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known}} to kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage may {{extend beyond}} an {{aircraft}}'s airframe. High-flying aircraft <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> detected by their vapor contrails. Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced {{with the use}} of chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if the plane was creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E
5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E
50|$|Usually, a facet or a vertex {{figure is}} assumed to be a finite polytope, but <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> itself <b>be</b> {{considered}} a tessellation.|$|R
