40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) site {{is located}} in Tennessee, on the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), south of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) main plant across Haw Ridge in Melton Valley. The MSRE was run by ORNL to {{demonstrate}} the desirable features of the molten-salt concept in a practical reactor that could be operated safely and reliably. It introduced {{the idea of a}} homogeneous reactor using fuel salt media and graphite moderation for power and breeder reactors. The MSRE reactor and associated components are located in cells beneath the floor in the high-bay area of Building 7503 (Figure 1). The reactor was operated from June 1965 to December 1969. When the reactor was shut down, fuel salt was drained from the reactor circuit to two drain tanks. A ''clean'' salt was then circulated through the reactor as a decontamination measure and drained to a third drain tank. When operations ceased, the fuel and flush salts were allowed t o cool and solidify in the drain tanks. At shutdown, the MSRE facility complex was placed in a surveillance and maintenance program. As a result of the S&M program, it was discovered in 1994 that gaseous uranium (233 U/ 232 U) hexafluoride (UF 6) had moved throughout the MSRE process systems. The UF 6 was generated when radiolysis of the <b>fluorine</b> <b>salts</b> caused the individual constituents to dissociate to their component atoms, including free fluorine. Some of the free fluorine combined with uranium fluorides (UF 4) in the salt to form UF 6.

Since the salt was transferred to the FDTs in 1969, radiological and chemical reactions have been converting the uranium and <b>fluorine</b> in the <b>salt</b> to UF{sub 6 } and free fluorine. Significant amounts of uranium (at least 3 kg) and fluorine have migrated out of the FDTs and into the off-gas system (OGS) and the auxiliary charcoal bed (ACB). The loss of uranium and <b>fluorine</b> from the <b>salt</b> changes the chemical properties of the salt sufficiently to possibly allow the reduction of the UF{sub 4 } in the salt to uranium metal as the salt is remelted prior to removal. It has been postulated that up to 9 kg of the maximum 19. 4 kg of uranium in one FDT could be reduced to metal and concentrated.

40|$|Polyethylene {{has been}} treated in a CF 4 plasma using two {{configurations}} for the electrodes: parallel-plate electrodes at 13. 56 MHz, and a nonsymmetrical configuration of electrodes at 70 kHz. The chemical species involved in the plasmas and the subsequent surface modifications were characterized. Comparison of the emissions in the range 200 - 450 nm was made with optical emission spectroscopy. The excited radicals' CF 2 bands and the CF+ broad continuum were detected and a comparison of their relative intensities indicated a more energetic aspect to the low-frequency discharge. This was confirmed by comparing the ratio of N 2 +/N 2 in the two cases. Analysis of the surface properties by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS), and contact angle measurements showed rapid fluorination of the surface (t = 0. 1 s) for the nonsymmetrical electrodes. Longer treatment times (up to 15 s) led to more fluorinated surfaces, thereby decreasing the wettability of the treated substrates; fluorine incorporation was, however, more significant at equivalent treatment times in the diode reactor. SSIMS analysis indicated the formation of more <b>complex</b> <b>fluorine</b> compounds {{with an increase in}} the treatment time with no notable modification other than replacement of H by F. Further increases in the treatment time for low-frequency treated samples in the nonsymmetrical configuration of electrodes caused an increase in the surface roughness, as observed by SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis.

Batteries containing lithium metal, eschewed the use of carbon supporting materials can lead to as much as a ten-fold improvement in anode storage capacity from 360 mAh g- 1 to 3860 mAh g- 1 and would open up opportunities for high energy un-lithiated cathode materials such as sulfur and oxygen, among others. Unfortunately, significant improvements in safe and stable battery performance are needed due to the non-uniform lithium deposition on the negative electrode. These uneven dendritic structures increase the potential risk of cell short-circuiting, energy fading or even fire hazards. Recent discoveries and advances have focused on electrolyte reconfigurations for the sake of suppressing or even eliminating dendrite formation. Of the various options, ionic liquids offer multiple synergetic properties that make them attractive electrolytes for extending lifetime and safety of LMBs. Their inherently low vapor pressure, non-flammability, good electrochemical stability in the presence of metallic lithium make ILs excellent choice in fail-safe LMBs. When anchored to metal oxide nanoparticle surface, it promotes the mechanical strength as well as maintaining the advantages of ILs. This dissertation researches ionic liquid-tethered hybrid nanoparticle electrolytes with several goals: improving room temperature ionic conductivity of the electrolytes while maintaining chemical and mechanical stabilities, improving lithium-ion transference number, and studying the dendritic lithium metal growth as a function of electrolyte properties. It is found that all types of IL electrolytes show improvements over the conventional electrolytes such as propylene carbonate in LiTFSI. It also found that untethered IL has comparable cell lifetime to tethered IL and piperidinium-based IL suppresses dendrite growth more efficiently than imidazolium-based IL.

The {{influence of}} different photoinitiators on the adhesion properties {{of both a}} rigid and a soft epoxide is examined. Depending on the substrates to be joined, different decomposition products of the initiators are concentrated in the interphase. This accumulation of decomposition products in the interphase leads to a decreased adhesion. On gold surfaces the sulfur of sulfonium salts is concentrated as expected. But surprisingly the iodine of the iodonium salts is also concentrated on gold. It could be shown by immobilization experiments that organic iodine compounds with the iodine in any oxidation state reacted with gold surfaces. Due to this reaction iodide anions are formed.

30|$|While Fe-based {{materials}} offer advantages {{with respect}} to environmental and economic considerations, the major difficulty in the electrochemistry of Fe is the lower voltage obtained {{when compared to other}} transition metals such as Co or Ni. A way to overcome this issue was demonstrated in 1989 on a comparative study between the three iron analogues Fe 2 (MoO 4) 3, Fe 2 (WO 4) 3 and Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 [101]. Since all three compounds possess very similar metal–oxygen distances and formal charge, the increased redox potential with lithium from around 3.0  V for the molybdate and tungstate to 3.6  V for the sulfate, came as a surprising effect. The “inductive affect”, as it became known, was originating from the significantly larger electronegativity of the sulfate groups resulting in an increase of the ionic character of the Fe–O bonds. Thus, it is thanks to the inductive effect that sulfide-based electrode materials always display a lower potential than the corresponding oxides, as well as why the fluoride analogues show even higher potentials. In this last case in particular, manipulations axed on the increase of Fe–F bond ionic character by replacement of the anion would be <b>complex</b> since <b>fluorine</b> is already the most electronegative element. Instead, one way to act on the iron-fluorine bond could be the application of chemical pressure [102]. When smaller cations are replaced by larger ones in a close-packed structure, the result {{from the point of view}} of the smaller ion is comparable to an elongation of the bond thereby increasing its ionic nature. This is why accurate doping with Co, Ni or Cu would probably give some result in this direction.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} based on the {{chemical}} synthesis of fluorosaccharide end-products, which could be used potentially as substrates for the combinatorial biosynthesis of novel complex structures like antibiotics. Although fluorine is the most abundant halogen in the earth's crust, the incidence of fluorinated natural products is extremely low. There are no examples of fluorosaccharide end-product molecules in nature, so novel architecture will result from their incorporation within oligosaccharides or <b>complex</b> antibiotics. Introducing <b>fluorine</b> into pharmaceutical compounds can increase the biological activity and stability to metabolism. Enantiomerically enriched and racemic 6 -fluoro and racemic 6, 6 -difluoro analogues of amicetose and rhodinose have been synthesized successfully using different and scaleable strategies from commercially available starting materials. The equilibria between furanoses and pyranoses favoures the smaller rings, due to the inductive electron withdrawing effects of fluorine, so it was necessary to use protection to deliver pyranoses exclusively. Two very efficient new fluorinating methods have been developed, one with in situ cis/trans-isomerisation of a double bond with a mixture of TBAI and TBAF, and another one with high regioselective epoxides ring-opening with a mixture of KHF 2 and TBAF. In addition to the synthesis of 6 -deoxy- 6 -fluorosugars, a long lived difluoroenol was discovered and fully characterised, methanolysis rates and solvent isotope effect were measured...|$|R

Fluorine NMR {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful tool for}} studying biomolecular structure, dynamics, and ligand binding, yet the origins of F- 19 chemical shifts are not well understood. Herein, we use electronic structure calculations to describe the changes in 19 F chemical shifts of 2 F- and 4 F-histidine/(5 -methyl) -imidazole upon acid titration. While the protonation of the 2 F species results in a deshielded chemical shift, protonation of the 4 F isomer results in an opposite, shielded chemical shift. The deshielding of 2 F-histidine/(5 -methyl) -imidazole upon protonation can be rationalized by concomitant decreases in charge density on fluorine and a reduced dipole moment. These correlations do not hold for 4 F-histidine/(5 -methyl) -imidazole, however. Molecular orbital calculations reveal that for the 4 F species, there are no lone pair electrons on the fluorine until protonation. Analysis of a series of 4 F-imidazole analogues, all with delocalized fluorine electron density, indicates that the deshielding of 19 F chemical shifts through substituent effects correlates with increased C-F bond polarity. In summary, the delocalization of fluorine electrons in the neutral 4 F species, with gain of a lone pair upon protonation may help explain the difficulty in developing a predictive framework for fluorine chemical shifts. Ideas debated by chemists over 40 years ago, regarding <b>fluorine's</b> <b>complex</b> electronic effects, are shown to have relevance for understanding and predicting fluorine NMR spectra.

40|$|Tin {{and nickel}} can be codeposited in {{approximately}} equi-atomic proportions from solutions containing stannous chloride, nickel chloride, and fluorides. The alloy de-posits thus obtained are almost fully bright and are single phase, having a nickel ar-senide type of structure. Below 300 ~ the deposits are quite stable, but on annealing at higher temperatures recrystallization takes {{place and a}} duplex structure of Ni 3 Sn~ and Ni~Sn 4 results. In the absence of fluorides, satisfactory alloy deposition is not possible from chloride solutions. Evidence is adduced that the <b>fluorine</b> <b>complexes</b> both the tin ions and the nickel ions. The constancy of composition of the cathode deposit that is {{a feature of the}} recommended electrolyte suggests that deposition is associated with the presence in the electrolyte of a tin-nickel-fluorine complex. Complex ion formation is followed through the medium of cathode potential-current density curves. The effect of the variables of the process on deposit composition is discussed. The conductivity and throwing power of the electrolyte have been determined. The x-ray structure of tin-nickel alloy deposits covering a range of composition has been examined, and it is shown that bright deposits are characterized by a preferred orien-tation of the crystallites. From solutions of this type, tin-nickel alloys can only be obtained by operating at a temperature above 45 ~ the optimum temperature being 65 ~ The metastable struc-ture of these deposits is thought to be explained by the high activation energy of the discharging cations resulting from the high temperature of operation. Tin-nickel alloy deposits as normally obtained contain approximately 65 per cent of tin and 35 per cent of nickel. Such deposits have a pleasing color, showing evidence of a faint rose-pink tint, and are equally as resistant, or even more resistant, than elec-trodeposited chromium to atmospheric tarnishing. The progress made to date in the industrial development of the tin-nickel alloy plating process is briefly reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Lithium ion {{batteries}} {{are widely used}} as energy storage devices {{in a variety of}} products such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other portable electronics. Thanks to their high energy density and cyclability, they are currently being used by and developed for electric vehicles. There is a growing need for cost reduction; increase in energy density; wider operating temperature range; and improved safety characteristics of the batteries. Organic carbonates are the primary solvents used in lithium-ion battery electrolytes along with electrolyte additives. The reversibility of current lithium-ion batteries is dependent upon the electrolyte used in the batteries. During the initial charging cycles of the cell, a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is formed by reduction of organic carbonates, electrolyte salts and/or electrolyte additives {{on the surface of the}} graphitic anode in lithium-ion batteries. The generation of a stable anode SEI prevents continuous electrolyte reduction on the surface of the anode. The SEI functions as a Li ion conductor but an electrical insulator. The reduction reactions of the electrolytes on the graphitic anode surface have been investigated for many years and it been proposed to contain a complicated mixture of products including lithium oxalate, lithium alkoxides, and lithium oxide from the carbonate solvents and LiF and lithium fluorophosphates from the reduction of LiPF 6. Similar ambiguity exists about the components of SEI formed from electrolyte additives and other electrolyte salts. Despite the extensive investigations, the structure, formation mechanisms and evolution of the SEI are poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms of the reduction reactions of organic carbonates, electrolyte salts and electrolyte additives along with the products of the reactions which result in the generation of the SEI is essential for the development of safer lithium-ion batteries with wider operating temperature range. Lithium naphthalenide has been investigated as a one electron reducing agent for organic carbonates solvents, some of the most robust additives and salts used in lithium ion battery electrolytes. The reaction precipitates have been analyzed by IR-ATR, XPS and solution NMR spectroscopy. The evolved gases and the volatile components have been analyzed by GC-MS. The reduction products of ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate are lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC) and ethylene and lithium propylene dicarbonate (LPDC) and propylene, respectively. The reduction products of diethyl and dimethyl carbonate are lithium ethyl carbonate (LEC) and ethane and lithium methyl carbonate(LMC) and methane, respectively. Electrolyte additives, FEC and VC reductively decompose to HCO 2 Li, Li 2 C 2 O 4, Li 2 CO 3, and polymerized VC. All the <b>fluorine</b> containing <b>salts</b> generate LiF upon reduction. In addition to LiF, LiBF 4 generates LixByFz species; LiBOB and LiDFOB generate lithium oxalate and boron-oxalatoesters; LiPF 6 yields LiPF 2 species and LiTFSI produces lithium bis[N-(trifluoromethylsulfonylimino) ] trifluoromethanesulfonate. The poor thermal stability of the SEI layer has been attributed to exothermic reactions between lithium alkyl carbonates and LiPF 6. While the relationship between capacity fade and SEI instability is clear, and there have been some investigations of SEI component evolution, the mechanism of SEI component decomposition is complicated by the presence of many different components. The thermal stability of Li 2 CO 3, LMC, and LEDC in the presence of LiPF 6 in dimethyl carbonate (DMC), a common salt and solvent, respectively, in lithium ion battery electrolytes, has been investigated to afford a better understanding of the evolution of the SEI. The residual solids from the reaction mixtures have been characterized by a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (IR-ATR), while the solution and evolved gases have been investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography with mass selective detection (GC-MS). The thermal decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 and LiPF 6 in DMC yields CO 2, LiF, and F 2 PO 2 Li. The thermal decomposition of LMC and LEDC with LiPF 6 in DMC results in the generation of a complicated mixture including CO 2, LiF, ethers, phosphates, and fluorophosphates...|$|R
