40|$|Abstract Background Neck pain {{is related}} to {{impaired}} postural balance among patients and is highly prevalent among workers with high postural demands, for example, cleaners. We therefore hypothesised, that <b>cleaners</b> <b>with</b> neck pain suffer from postural dysfunction. This cross-sectional study tested if <b>cleaners</b> <b>with</b> neck pain have an impaired postural balance compared <b>with</b> <b>cleaners</b> without neck pain. Methods Postural balance of 194 <b>cleaners</b> <b>with</b> (n = 85) and without (N = 109) neck pain was studied using three different tests. Success or failure to maintain the standing position for 30 s in unilateral stance was recorded. Participants were asked to stand on a force platform for 30 s in the Romberg position with eyes open and closed. The centre of pressure of the sway was calculated, and separated into a slow (rambling) and fast (trembling) component. Subsequently, the 95 % confidence ellipse area (CEA) was calculated. Furthermore a perturbation test was performed. Results More <b>cleaners</b> <b>with</b> neck pain (81 %) failed the unilateral stance compared <b>with</b> <b>cleaners</b> without neck pain (61 %) (p Conclusions Postural balance is impaired among <b>cleaners</b> <b>with</b> neck pain and the current study suggests a particular role of the slow component of postural sway. Furthermore, the unilateral stance test is a simple test to illustrate functional impairment among <b>cleaners</b> <b>with</b> concurrent neck and low back pain.

Mild agitation was not sufficient to remove rosin _flux effectively from the exposed su@ace of {{printed circuit board}}s.
