40|$|A {{technique}} is described for making dielectric spectroscopy measurements of very small quantities (< 1 μl) of oil. The technique utilises surface tension {{to hold the}} oil between the plates of a capacitor, the inter-electrode distance being controlled by a micrometer. Breakdown strength can also be estimated using this technique. Three samples of silicone oil, used in <b>cable</b> <b>sealing</b> ends, were tested: virgin, used and failed. A major component in the frequency dependent impedance had the form Z(ω) =B(1 -b) (iω) /sup. 1 -p/). This component was interpreted {{in terms of a}} fractal percolation model, and the anomalous thickness dependence predicted by the model verified by varying the inter-electrode distance. The difference observed for the three different samples indicate that conducting contaminants are responsible for the percolation system...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of ground return current in fault occurrence {{plays a key}} role in the dimensioning of the earthing grid of substations and of <b>cable</b> <b>sealing</b> end compounds, in the computation of rise of earth potential at substation sites and in electromagnetic interference (EMI) on neighbouring parallel metallic conductors (pipes, handrails, etc.). Moreover, the ground return current evaluation is also important in steady-state regime since this stray current can be responsible for EMI and also for alternating current (AC) corrosion. In fault situations and under some assumptions, the ground return current value at a substation site can be computed by means of k-factors. The paper shows that these simplified and approximated approaches have a lot of limitations and only multiconductor analysis can show the ground return current behaviour along the cable (not only the two end values) both in steady-state regime and in short circuit occurrence (e. g., phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase-to-ground). Multiconductor cell analysis (MCA) considers the cable system in its real asymmetry without simplified and approximated hypotheses. The sensitivity of ground return current on circuit parameters (cross-bonding box resistances, substation earthing resistances, soil resistivity) is presented in the paper...|$|E

40|$|Expanding clay/polyacrylamide {{composites}} {{have the}} capacity to absorb large amounts of water while retaining good mechanical strength and high damping characteristics, and therefore represent a new and promising class of hydrogel materials. Bentonite (montmorillonite) has been used as expanding clay mineral and a superabsorbent poly(acrylamide) -bentonite composite (SAPC) material has been prepared using electron beam and UV light irradiation. Characterization of SAPC using XRD, SEM, DSC, TGA, FTIR and NMR (27 Al, 29 Si and 12 C) showed that the structure of SAPC was that of acrylamide combined with montmorillonite in three different ways: a. AM intercalated in the lamina of montmorillonite in bimolecular layers bound by van der Waals force and hydrogen bonds; b. AM bonded to the montmorillonite surface by hydrogen bonds; c. AM in free state as a polymer string network. Experimental results of rheological, mechanical, and thermal properties of SAPC showed a fully cross-linked structure and higher mechanical strength and thermal stability. Application of SAPC in oilfields (enhanced oil recovery), for environmental protection (acid mine tailing abatement), agriculture (plantation, seedling), in electric industry (<b>cable</b> <b>sealing),</b> petrochemical industry (fuel dewatering), civil engineering (concrete additives) and sensor industry (sensor materials) showed a high potential of this class of materials for environmentally compatible and economically viable uses.

50|$|Outside plant cabling, whether copper or fiber, is {{generally}} installed as aerial cable between poles, in an underground conduit system, or by direct burial.Hardware {{associated with the}} outside plant must be either protected from the elements (for example, distribution frames are generally protected by a street side cabinet) or constructed with materials suitable for exposure to the elements. Installation of the outside plant elements often require construction of significant physical infrastructure, such as underground vaults. In older large installations, cabling is sometimes protected by air pressure systems designed to prevent water infiltration. While {{this is not a}} modern approach, the cost of replacement of the older <b>cabling</b> with <b>sealed</b> <b>cabling</b> is often prohibitively expensive.

40|$|The cable {{equation}} is solved in the Laplace transform domain for arbitrary initial and boundary conditions. The cable potential is expressed directly {{in terms of}} the impedance of the terminations and the cable electrotonic length. A computer program is given to invert the transform. Numerical solutions may be obtained for any particular model by inserting expressions describing the terminations and parameter values into the program, without further computation by the modeler. For a finite length <b>cable,</b> <b>sealed</b> at one end, the solution is expressed {{in terms of the}} ratio of the termination impedance to the impedance of the finite length cable, a generalization of the steady-state conductance ratio. Analysis of a model of a soma with several primary dendrites shows that the dendrites may be lumped into one equivalent cylinder if they have the same electrotonic length, even though they may vary in diameter. Responses obtained under voltage clamp are conceptually predictable from measurements made under current clamp, and vice versa. The equalizing time constants of an infinite series expression of the solution are the negative reciprocals of the roots of the characteristic equation. Examination of computed solutions shows that solutions which differ theoretically may be indistinguishable experimentally...|$|R

40|$|We present herein a {{new class}} of resin {{formulations}} for stereolithography, named FlexSL, with a broad bandwidth of tunable mechanical properties. The novel polyether(meth) acrylate based material class has outstanding material characteristics in combination with the advantages of being a biocompatible (meth) acrylate based processing material. FlexSL shows very promising results in several initial biocompatibility tests. This emphasizes its non-toxic behavior in a biomedical environment, caused mainly by the (meth) acrylate based core components. A short overview of mechanical and processing properties will be given in the end. The herein presented novel FlexSL materials show a significant lower cytotoxicity in contrast to commercial applied acrylic stereolithography resins. Further biocompatibility tests according to ISO 10993 protocols are planned. On the one hand, there are technical applications for this material (e. g. flaps, tubes, hoses, <b>cables,</b> <b>sealing</b> parts, connectors and other technical rubber-like applications), and on the other hand, broad fields of potential biomedical applications in which the FlexSL materials can be beneficial are obvious. Especially these could be small series production of medical products with special flexible material requirements. In addition, the usage for individual soft hearing aid shells, intra-operative planning services and tools like intra-op cutting templates and sawing guides is very attractive. The possibility to modify the FlexSL resins also for high-resolution applications makes it possible to manufacture now very flexible micro-prototypes with outstanding material characteristics and very fine structures with a minimum resolution of 20 mym and a layer thickness of minimal 5 myrn.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} our {{recently developed}} humanoid neck {{system that can}} effectively mimic motion of human neck with very low motion noises. The feature of low motion noises allows our system to work like a real human head/neck. Thus the level of acoustic noises from wearable equipments, such as donning respirators or chemical-resistant jackets, induced by human head motion can be simulated and investigated using such a system. The objective of this investigation is to facilitate using head-worn communication devices {{for the person who}} wears the protective equipment/uniform that usually produces communication-noise when the head/neck moves. Our low motion-noise humanoid neck system is based on the spring structure, which can generate 1 Degree of Freedom (DOF) jaw movement and 3 DOF neck movement. To guarantee the low-noise feature, no noise-makers like gear and electrodriven parts are embedded in the head/neck structure. Instead, the motions are driven by seven cables, and the actuators pulling the <b>cables</b> are <b>sealed</b> in a sound insulation box. Furthermore, statics analysis of the system has been processed completely.

Plant construction on Unit 1, begun in 1980, was in its last stages when a severe cable fire occurred on January 27, 1984. As a result, the plant's initial operations were delayed until late 1984 (November[AI° 4] or December[A 10 5]). The plant began commercial operations in April 1985.

40|$|Heat {{shrink tubing}} {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create <b>cable</b> entry <b>seals</b> in wire harnessing industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operator’s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operators’ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a heat shrink tubing prototype machine that benefits the wire harnessing industry. The prototype consists of an instrumented heat chamber on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two heat guns. The chamber design allows for the directing of hot air from the heat guns onto the wire harness uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the heat chamber along the wire harness as the proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the heat shrink tubing process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the heat chamber. A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamber’s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform. The control unit performance is examined and its responses follow the simulation results with adequate accuracy...|$|R
