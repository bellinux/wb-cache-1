40|$|Immediately {{after the}} Second World War, the word ‘consumer’ was an {{ill-defined}} signifier. By the early eighties, citizens’ interests were often routinely equated with consumer interests. We can attribute this {{in no small}} amount {{to the rise of}} <b>consumer</b> <b>movements,</b> who published comparative tests in monthly periodicals. These private organizations became the proverbial ‘consumer trade unions’: they drew attention to the producer consumer-cleavage and raised consumer awareness. In Belgium there were two separate <b>consumer</b> <b>movements.</b> Test-Achats (1957 -present) promoted individual foresight as the best strategy for consumer protection. The working-class Union Féminine pour l’Information et la Défense du Consommateur (hereafter ufidec, 1959 - 1984) was an organization led by social-democratic women. ufidec demanded more legal solutions from consumers and believed in strong collective action. This article investigates how and why consumer organizations gained influence and legitimacy within the welfare state. The government initially rebuffed organized consumerism, only to accommodate it somewhat after the oil crisis in 1973. However, if institutions (or proposed institutions) for consumer politics in Belgium remained relatively weak or ineffective, it was because they represented a compromise between a civil society intent upon its own survival, and a government more than willing to let consumers fend for themselves. </p...|$|R
40|$|Because emotion plays such a {{large part}} in the {{creation}} of the hegemony of consumerist ideology, we contend that any complete understanding of <b>consumer</b> resistance <b>movements</b> must also take into account the role of emotion in fighting against consumerist ideologies and global corporate control. In this article, we theorize about the role emotion plays in <b>consumer</b> resistance social <b>movements</b> – especially those using the resistance tactic of culture jamming. Drawing upon the frameworks of emotional hegemony and emotion management, we present an emotion cycle of resistance associated with consumer resistance activism. We illustrate the cycle by using examples from culture jamming enacted by groups such as Adbusters and Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping.

40|$|The {{passage of}} the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and {{subsequent}} establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau marked an unexpected victory for consumers across America {{at the expense of}} the well-financed business lobby. Although classical social scientists, such as Mancur Olson, claim that <b>consumer</b> <b>movements</b> should fail to emerge due to the difficulty of providing public goods for large constituencies, consumer victories – like the passage of Dodd-Frank — have occurred in waves throughout the last century. In conducting this study, I thus sought to answer why it is that some <b>consumer</b> <b>movements</b> are able to push through consumer legislation while others fail. In order to answer this question, I conducted two cases studies, comparing Ralph Nader’s failed attempt to establish a Consumer Protection Agency in the 1970 s with Elizabeth Warren’s successful push to create Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010. Ultimately my research demonstrates that three variables are critical to the passage of consumer legislation: 1) the opening of a policy window via key events, 2) the existence of favorable structural conditions in the policy making process, and 3) the ability of political entrepreneurs to utilize successful legislative and framing strategies that help them advance their agenda within the broader environmental context. Based upon these determinants, I suggest that a policy window has been opened for the consume...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{the role}} of journalistic {{investigation}} and <b>consumer</b> <b>movements</b> should not be underestimated. It may be in companies’ enlightened self-interest not only to profess a concern for worker rights and working conditions, healthy products, honest dealings, and the environment but actually to act on that concern. Global companies including Nike, Citibank, Merck, Wal-Mart, Starbucks, Monsanto, Interface, and others have found that “principles pay” (Heal, 2008).

5000|$|Another {{way that}} social <b>consumer</b> <b>movements</b> hope to utilize culture jamming {{effectively}} is by employing a metameme.
