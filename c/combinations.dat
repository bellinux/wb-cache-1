5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} <b>combinations</b> to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative <b>combinations</b> is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E

5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a type}} {{of genetic}} recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA. It is most widely used by cells to accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands of DNA, known as double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination also produces new <b>combinations</b> of DNA sequences during meiosis, the process by which eukaryotes make gamete cells, like sperm and egg cells in animals. These new <b>combinations</b> of DNA represent genetic variation in offspring, which in turn enables populations to adapt during the course of evolution. Homologous recombination is also used in horizontal gene transfer to exchange genetic material between different strains and species of bacteria and viruses.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{analyzes}} {{a particular}} type of notes observed in securitization transactions: <b>combination</b> notes. <b>Combination</b> notes are formed by combining parts of two or more tranches of securitization transactions, where one part usually consists of a share of the first loss piece. It is analyzed whether <b>combination</b> notes are purely demand driven, or whether <b>combination</b> notes also appear to be structured to enable equity transfer. Results indicate that <b>combination</b> notes serve both purposes: market segmentation severely determines the structuring of <b>combination</b> notes, but risk transfer needs seem to be catered by <b>combination</b> notes as well. Further, an analysis of launch spreads indicates, that the observed equity transfer via <b>combination</b> notes has an impact on the pricing of the ordinary tranches of each deal. This paper makes use of unique data on 126 deals containing 1385 tranches, thereof 398 <b>combination</b> notes. ...|$|R
