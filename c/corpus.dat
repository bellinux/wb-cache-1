5|$|For {{transportation}} on the bay, steamboats were commonplace between <b>Corpus</b> Christi and Ingleside {{during the}} 1930s. Native Americans used a route {{made up of}} a series of shallow oyster beds, dubbed Reef Road. The passage, which was about 18 to 24inches in depth, could be navigated on foot or horseback during low tides to travel across the opening of Nueces Bay into <b>Corpus</b> Christi Bay. White settlers discovered the road in the 1860s, and it became a common way to pass from Portland to <b>Corpus</b> Christi via buggy, although its jagged course had to be marked with posts and horses would sometimes fall off the beds and drown. A wooden causeway connecting Portland and <b>Corpus</b> Christi was first constructed in 1915, but was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed by several storms. A permanent concrete bridge was erected in the 1950s, and a double lane was added in 1988. The approximately mile long structure is today known as the Nueces Bay Causeway.|$|E

5|$|The bay {{has been}} {{strategically}} {{important for the}} military. General Zachary Taylor stationed his men on Rincon Point during the Mexican-American War, and a Union invasion was halted by Confederates on the same point in 1862, during the American Civil War. The Port of <b>Corpus</b> Christi {{was used by the}} Confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the Union bombarded <b>Corpus</b> Christi and occupied the bay and port from 1863 to 1870. In 1940, the Naval Air Station <b>Corpus</b> Christi was established on the bay, and by 1944 had transformed into a major base with one main air station and six additional stations.

40|$|International audienceAn {{attempt to}} {{determine}} the influence of the <b>corpora</b> cardiaca on sustained flight tendency shown by Schistocerca gregaria imagos reared in dense groups has been made, taking into consideration {{the presence or absence of}} <b>corpora</b> allata. Thus, nerves have been cut to isolate the <b>corpora</b> cardiaca from the brain (in the presence or absence of <b>corpora</b> allata) or from both brain and <b>corpora</b> allata. A brain isolated from the <b>corpora</b> cardiaca is often filled with neurosecretory tracts: these are found in the median ocellar nerve, <b>corpora</b> cardiaca nerves, and circum-oesophageal connectives among others. The effects of <b>corpora</b> cardiaca ablations with or without the <b>corpora</b> allata have been studied. These different interventions show that the glandular lobes do not seem to have any influence on sustained flight tendency, but after isolating the <b>corpora</b> cardiaca from the brain, or after cardiacectomy, the majority of locusts do not fly continuously any more. The neurohaemal part would therefore seem to be concerned. Some operated individuals are able to fly continuously for several hours; histologically these show <b>corpora</b> cardiaca regenerates (the neurohaemal part). Therefore cerebral neurosecretory material must be able to pass into the regenerated <b>corpora</b> cardiaca and probably be stocked there. This is necessary for flight but in itself not sufficient, as these conditions are fulfilled in intact individuals which do not fly. Insects without <b>corpora</b> allata express their flying tendency later. Possible reasons for the disappearance of sustained flight are discussed especially in connexion with energetic reserves and their possible utilization...|$|R

5|$|The first {{trading post}} on <b>Corpus</b> Christi Bay was {{established}} by Henry Kinney in 1838 in present-day <b>Corpus</b> Christi. By the 1840s, the area developed into a settlement named after the bay, and a deepwater port {{was established in the}} 1870s. A bayfront that included a 32-foot overlooking statue of Jesus Christ was designed by Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum in 1928, but was turned down by the city in 1930. Later efforts to build a statue on the shore were also rejected. The bayside port would later grow into a major city, and had a population of 277,454 people during the 2000 U.S. census. In addition to <b>Corpus</b> Christi, Kinney also found Nuecestown (known to settlers as The Motts) in 1852, near the confluence of the Nueces River and Nueces Bay. The town was attacked by Mexican robbers in 1875, and underwent a steep decline. It is now a ghost town located in the <b>Corpus</b> Christi city limits. The city of Ingleside was founded on the northern shore of the bay in 1854, and grew slowly. It had a population of 9,388 in the 2000 census. Likewise, the city of Portland located on the northeastern bluff between the Nueces and <b>Corpus</b> Christi Bays, did not grow as rapidly as <b>Corpus</b> Christi, following its 1891 founding.

40|$|Summary. <b>Corpora</b> lutea induced in pigs on Day 6 regressed {{with the}} {{naturally}} formed <b>corpora</b> lutea {{towards the end}} of the cycle. Hormonal induction of <b>corpora</b> lutea on Days 8, 10 or 16 significantly prolonged the cycle despite involution of the original <b>corpora</b> lutea about 16 days after ovulation.

The estimated functional life span of the <b>corpora</b> lutea induced on Days 6, 8, 10 and 16 was 12 =. 14 =., 15 =. and 19 =. days respectively. That these induced <b>corpora</b> lutea were fully functional was shown by the luteal progesterone levels estimated using the protein-binding and u. v. spectrophotometric techniques.
