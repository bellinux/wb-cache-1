By {{the study}} of {{construction}} of casting box girder of Songpu Bridge in Harbin, and the actual site geology, hydrology and the corresponding norms, this paper designed temporary support with the method of allowable stress. It was proved that the temporary support met the need of the site construction, both to ensure <b>casting</b> <b>construction</b> quality, but also save construction costs and speed up the construction progress, which provided a new way {{for the construction of}} large-span continuous box girder...|$|E

40|$|Attempts by sports {{medicine}} professionals to return {{high school athletes}} with hand and wrist injuries to competition quickly and safely have {{been the source of}} confusion and debate on many playing fields around the country. In addition to the differing views regarding the appropriateness of playing cast usage in high school football, a debate exists among {{sports medicine}} professionals as to which material is best suited for playing <b>cast</b> <b>construction.</b> Materials used in playing <b>cast</b> <b>construction</b> should be hard enough to provide sufficient stabilization to the injured area and include adequate padding to absorb blunt impact forces. The purpose of the biomechanical portion of this investigation was to attempt to determine the most appropriate materials for use in constructing playing casts for the hand and wrist by assessing different materials for: 1) hardness using a Shore durometer, and 2) ability to absorb impact using a force platform. Results revealed that RTV 11 and Scotchcast were the “least hard” of the underlying casting materials and that Temper Stick foam greatly increased the ability of RTV 11 to absorb impact. Assessment of the mechanical properties of playing cast materials and review of current developments in high school football rules are used to aid practitioners in choosing the most appropriate materials for playing <b>cast</b> <b>construction...</b>|$|R

Tilt-up differs from prefabrication, or plant <b>cast</b> <b>construction,</b> in that all elements are constructed on the job site.

The thesis is divided in the following parts; preparation, construction and production of the metal mold, experimental test of casting foundry, measurement and casting control.

The vehicle cell suffered deformation in the forecast area, the driver’s door could be opened without any problems after the crash. The front wheel swinging arm collapsed and came loose because, to save time and money, a welded aluminum construction was used rather than a <b>cast</b> <b>construction.</b> This problem will not occur on the standard solution.|$|R

50|$|Several {{competing}} {{designs were}} offered, {{and even more}} were drawn up prior to reaching prototype stage. All had heavy armour, torsion-bar suspension, wide tracks, and were of welded and <b>cast</b> <b>construction.</b> One of the main competing designs was the SMK, which in its final form had two turrets, mounting one 76.2 mm and one 45 mm weapon. The designers of the SMK independently drew up a single-turreted variant and this received approval at the highest level. Two of these, named after the People's Defence Commissioner, were ordered alongside a single SMK. The smaller hull and single turret enabled the designer to install heavy frontal and turret armour while keeping the weight within manageable limits.|$|R

5000|$|The first turrets were of <b>cast</b> <b>construction</b> {{and were}} rounded in shape, {{providing}} sufficient space {{to accommodate the}} relatively small 2 pounder gun. To fulfil its role as an infantry support vehicle, the first models were equipped with a 3-inch howitzer in the hull in a layout {{very similar to the}} French Char B. This enabled the tank to deliver a useful high-explosive capability while retaining the anti-tank capabilities of the 2 pounder. However, like other multi-gun tanks, it was limited by a poor fire arc - the entire tank had to be turned to change the aim of the hull gun. The Mk II dispensed with the howitzer and replaced it with a bow machine gun and on the Mk III, the 2 pounder was replaced with the 6 pounder, significantly increasing the tank's anti-tank capabilities. The tank underwent field modification in North Africa with several Churchills being fitted with the 75 mm gun of destroyed M4 Shermans. These [...] "NA75" [...] variants were used in Italy. The use of the 75 mm increased the effectiveness of the tank, as it was a generally superior weapon to the 6 pounder, possessing similar anti-tank capabilities, while also being considerably more effective when used in infantry support roles.|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} of structural fire safety {{of cast iron}} structures in historical buildings is difficult because the available information on the fire behaviour is limited, whilst the fire design assumptions (if any) often are not well docu-mented. A complicating factor with regard to protective measures is that gen-erally the <b>cast</b> iron <b>construction</b> - in view of its historical value - must remain visible. In other words: fire insulation by spray or boards. which is quite com-monly applied for steel structures, is no realistic option for cast iron in historical building...|$|R
50|$|In 1685, {{a wooden}} {{drawbridge}} {{was built on}} the site {{in the course of the}} creation under Elector Frederick William I of Hohenzollern of a new western suburb of the city, Dorotheenstadt.
