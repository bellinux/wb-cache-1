5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh <b>Caledonides.</b> The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the clay minerals recrystallised, developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage, making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures. Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the Variscan orogeny, a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E

The Iapetus Ocean was finally closed, and subduction activity had migrated south to the Rheic Ocean by early Devonian times. Continental rifting and deposition of the Lower Old Red Sandstone fluvial-lacustrine succession, accompanied by basaltic-andesitic volcanism, occurred across Scotland.

40|$|International audienceThe geochemical and isotopic {{characterization}} of an eclogite {{and the associated}} retrogressive amphibolite at Vårdalsneset, WGR, Norwegian <b>Caledonide</b> was undertaken to investigate the mobility of REE and Hf and the behavior of Lu–Hf and Sm–Nd geochronometers during metamorphic dehydration/rehydration. Eclogitic garnets display a distinct core–rim chemical zoning. Thermodynamic modeling indicates that both cores (13 – 22 kbar, 500 – 580 °C) and rims (> 16 kbar, 610 – 660 °C) crystallized under eclogite-facies conditions. The core–rim zoning corresponds to the dehydration of the system. This petrographic disequilibrium is associated with Lu–Hf and Sm–Nd disequilibrium, which prevents dating of the eclogitic stages. At the rock scale, the incoming fluid responsible for eclogite–amphibolite retrogression brought in Sm and Nd, leached Lu, and had no influence on Hf. At the grain scale, mass balance shows that Sm and Nd were stored in clinozoisite since the first eclogitic stage, whereas Lu and Hf, which were more thoroughly redistributed among minerals during retrogression, enable the dating of the amphibolitic facies at 378 ± 17 Ma...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the geology of a Lower Palaeozoic terrain, situated {{west of the}} town of Fishguard, SW Dyfed, Wales. The area is dominated by the Fishguard Volcanic Complex (Upper Llanvirn), and sediments that range in age from the Middle Cambrian to the Lower Llandeilo. The successions represent an insight into sedimentation and volcanism for c. 100 Ma. along the south-western margin of the Lower Palaeozoic Welsh Basin. The stratigraphy of the sedimentary sequence has been completely revised and the existing volcanostratigraphy modified. The observed complexity of the stratigraphy is primarily the consequence of Caldedonide deformation which resulted in large scale repetition. Fold-thrust tectonics dominates the structural style of the area. <b>Caledonide</b> trending (NE-SW) cross-faults complicate preexisting structures. Middle Cambrian (?) sedimentation is documented by shallow marine clastics and red shales deposited within tidal - subtidal environments. Upper Cambrian sedimentation was dominated by shallow marine `storm' and `fair weather' sedimentation within a muddy shelf environment. Shallow marine conglomerates and heterolithic intertidal siliciclastics mark the onset of Ordovician sedimentation during the lower Arenig transgression. Mid-Arenig sediments reflect deposits influenced by storm, fair-weather and wave related processes in various shallow marine environments, including; shoreface, inner shelf, shoaling bar, and deltaic. Graptolitic marine shales were deposited from the upper mid-Arenig through to the lower Llandeilo; during which time sediments accumulated by pelagic processes and fine grained turbidites. The varied nature of sedimentation reflects both localised change within the depositional system and the influence of larger regional eustatic events. Ordovician subaqueous volcanic activity produced thick accumulations of lavas, pyroclastics, hydroclastics, and hyaloclastics. The majority of volcanism was effusive in nature, erupted below the Pressure Compensation Level. Basaltic volcanism was characterised by pillowed lavas and tube networks, whilst sheet-flow lavas, pillow breccias and minor hyaloclastites developed locally. Silicic volcanism was dominated by rhyolitic clastics of various affinities, although coherent silicic obsidian lavas, sheet-flow lavas and pyroclastics developed. Hypabyssal intrusives of variable composition and habit occur throughout the volcanic successions. Low-grade regional metamorphism has variably affected the area, conditions of the prehnite-pumpellyite and greenschist facies having been attained. Numerous secondary phases developed in response to the conditions imposed, which collectively indicate that P-T conditions were of low-pressure facies series in the range P= 1. 2 - 2. 0 kbars and T= 230 - 350 oC, under an elevated geothermal gradient of 40 - 45 oC km- 1.

40|$|International audienceIn this reply, {{we address}} {{the issues raised by}} the comment of Chalmers et al. (2010) {{regarding}} our ICE hypothesis for the evolution of western Scandinavia. We reject their conjectures as based, uncritically and without consideration of physical mechanisms, on the long-standing dogma of late Cenozoic tectonic uplift. Our hypothesis, in contrast, honours well-documented physical laws and the present wealth of actual data constraints (as opposed to dogma-biased inferences). After careful consideration of the points raised by Chalmers et al. (2010) we maintain our simple explanation for the evolution of Scandinavian topography, as it honours well-documented actual data constraints, such as crustal structure (including its spatio-temporal variability), thermal history in the eastern North Sea, global and regional climatic change (including eustacy) and sedimentation in the adjacent basins. The inevitable conclusion is that, although more data constraints are desirable, the current best fit hypothesis, is that the Scandinavian topography is of <b>Caledonide</b> origin, and has been shaped by fluvial and glacial buzzsaw and periglacial processes, and most recently (last few Myr) been re-invigorated by extensive glacial erosion in the fjords and on the shelf...|$|R

40|$|The Proterozoic Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt {{along the}} east coast of India shares a thrusted lower contact with the {{surrounding}} cratons. The thrust, known as the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone, is associated with two large lateral ramps resulting in a curved outline on the northwestern corner of the mobile belt. The Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt is divided into two lithotectonic units, the Lathore Group and the Turekela Group, based on their lithological assemblages and deformational history. On the basis of published data from a Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) profile of the Eastern Ghats crust, the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone is considered to be listric in nature and acts as the sole thrust between craton and mobile belt. The Lathore and Turekela Groups are nappes. With this structural configuration the NW part is described as a fold thrust belt. However, the thrusting postdates folding and granulite metamorphism that occurred in the Eastern Ghats, as in the <b>Caledonide</b> type of fold thrust belt of NW Scotland.

40|$|The {{age of the}} Ox Mountains Granodiorite {{has proved}} {{controversial}} in the past.

The syn-kinematic nature of the Ox Mountains Granodiorite has been clearly demonstrated by several workers, with the pluton being emplaced {{as a series of}} sheets in a major transpressive sinistral shear zone. Knowledge of the age of crystallisation of the Ox Mountains Granodiorite would thus constrain the timing of strike-slip movement along this shear zone, which forms part of a major <b>Caledonide</b> structure known as the Fair Head-Clew Bay Line. A U-Pb zircon age (conventional isotope dilution TIMS) of 412. 3 ± 0. 8 Ma from a tonalitic facies of the pluton is presented here.

40|$|The Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt of India {{displays}} fold-thrust {{belt structure}} with a prominent salient on its NW margin. The salient consists of Lathore nappe and Turekela klippe that have overthrust the craton to NW. The rocks of the nappes have undergone granulite facies metamorphism and multiple phases of folding {{corresponding to the}} Eastern Ghats orogeny, prior to thrusting. As a result the granulites along the thrust are retrograded to amphibolites and the axial traces of the folds have been truncated against the thrust plane. The basal decollement of the fold-thrust belt {{is represented by the}} Terrane Boundary Shear Zone that defines the tectonic margin between the craton and the mobile belt. It occurs as a ductile thrust affecting the cratonic basement as well as the mobile belt suggesting that the basement did not behave as a rigid body during thrusting. Thus the study area is comparable with the <b>Caledonide</b> fold-thrust belt. Further, two large lateral ramps namely Khariar and Paikamal lateral ramps have been developed on the decollement at the lithological contact between tonalite-trondhjemite gneisses/granite gneisses and the latetectonic potassic granites of the craton. Fault-bend folds associate with these ramps too. It is suggested that the salient structure of the fold-thrust belt is the combined result of (I) lateral ramps on the decollement and (2) differential displacement along the sole thrust due to lateral variation in detachment strength.

5000|$|The dyke is {{associated}} with volcanism which {{took place at the}} Isle of Mull igneous centre in western Scotland during the early Palaeogene Period at a time of regional crustal tension associated {{with the opening of the}} north Atlantic Ocean and which resulted in the intrusion of innumerable dykes. The Cleveland Dyke has been dated to 55.8+/- 0.9 Ma. Though generally from 22-28 m wide, in places it is up to 30 m wide and has been mapped over a distance of 430 km. [...] It is the most significant of a swarm of such intrusions associated with the Mull centre which extend southeastwards through this region, the others being the Acklington Dyke and the Blyth and Sunderland subswarms of Northumberland and Tyne and Wear. It was thought traditionally that the entire dyke comprising some 85 km3 of rock was emplaced as a single pulse of magma over a few days, moving southeastwards from Mull but also rising vertically through the country rock, this mechanism leading in places to the development of en echelon segments of dyke. However, more recent work suggests that vertical emplacement as a series of thin blades of magma from a series of high level chambers within the crust is more likely. Offsets of the alignment occur within Scotland where the dyke crosses <b>Caledonide</b> fault systems. The dyke is composed of basaltic andesite which is amygdaloidal in places.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} Carboniferous {{basement}} rocks of northern Britain has {{concentrated on the}} dominantly clastic rock succession which unconformably overlies the Lower Palaeozoic basement and occurs beneath the lowermost Carboniferous limestones in areas surrounding the Vale of Eden. The clastic rocks exposed at Shap, the Mell Fells (Ullswater), Sedbergh and Cross Fell, mainly reflect fluvial deposition over an Upper Palaeozoic landscape which locally had considerable topographic relief. Within each clastic rock succession, which throughout the region varies in thickness from ca 4 m to over 250 m, overall largescale fining upward sequences document the evolution from gravel-dominated braided fluvial to sand-dominated braided fluvial deposits. This evolution is shown to {{be representative of the}} downstream transition from localised alluvial fans into a more extensive fluvial braidplain system, the latter also containing marked proximal to distal variations. Palaeocurrents are consistently toward the north and north-east throughout the region, demonstrating the existence of a broad northerly palaeoslope during clastic deposition. Proximal to distal relationships and clast provenance data for each area are used to predict fades variations across the Vale of Eden region and to reconstruct the Palaeogeography. Areas of high ground are shown to be underlain by deep-seated <b>Caledonide</b> granite plutons, evolution of the fluvial braidplain demonstrating that with time denudation of high ground developed fining upward sequences by the superposition of progressively finer grained sediment on coarse. The development of the braidplain system is related to post-intrusive uplift of the granites underlying the highest ground with deposition mainly taking place prior to marine limestones associated with the basal Carboniferous marine transgression.

40|$|The Dolaucothi {{gold deposit}} occurs in thin bedded turbidites of Upper Ordovician to basal Silurian age {{deposited}} near the southern {{margin of the}} lower Paleozoic Welsh basin. The host rocks were deformed during the Caledonian orogeny (390 - 410 Ma) {{into a series of}} inclined asymmetrical, commonly overturned, tight southeast-facing folds with associated cleavage. Reverse dip-slip faults accompanied the folding and the whole area is cut by late tensional faults. The miueralization is controlled by structures produced during the Caledonian orogeny, iu particular a thrust fault which formed the host to the Roman lode, a flat-lying auriferous quartz reef up to 6 m thick. Gold occurs in a variety of hosts iucluding pyritic shales containing both euhedral and framboidal pyrite, quartz-carbonate stringer veins, in steeply or gently iuclined veins associated with shear zones and in planar quartz veins associated with the Roman lode. The mineralogy is simple, with pyrite and arsenopyrite being the dominant sulfides. Ankeritic carbonates, hydromuscovite, and the lithium silicate, cookeitc, are also present. It is proposed that, during prograde metamorphism associated with early stages of the <b>Caledonide</b> orogeny, fluids circulated through the basement below the southeast margin of the Welsh basin and leached gold, and associated metals, from rocks of igneous or volcanic origin. These overpressured fluids were released to high crustal evels during later orogenic movements and uplifts, perhaps related to reactivation of such basement faults as the infra-Tywi fault. Geothermometric studies indicate that the host rocks experienced upper anchizone facies metamorphism whereas the temperatures of the mineralizing fluids were in the range of 345 ø to 450 øC. Isotopic studies point to a common origin for the sulfides in both the shales and the veins and also indicate that the host rocks provided the source of the carbon now incorporated in the carbouates...|$|R
