5|$|All three {{crew members}} aboard the MARC train were killed along with eight passengers. 26 people were injured. The {{collision}} destroyed both MARC passenger <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> control car {{as well as}} one of the two Amtrak locomotives, EMD F40PHR #255. The turnouts at Georgetown Junction were damaged and had to be replaced. The total damage was estimated at $7.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} January 2008. To pass over Strømmen, a fourth Nygård Bridge {{was built for}} <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> oldest was {{upgraded}} and used by the light rail line. In several places the road needed to be dug up to remove pipes and cables. In November 2009, Gulating Court of Appeal ruled that the power company BKK had to pay 80 million NOK for the moving of power lines, and could not charge the costs to the project. By June 2008, the first tracks had been laid.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} a control system is a car's cruise control, which is a device {{designed}} to maintain vehicle speed at a constant desired or reference speed provided by the driver. The controller is the cruise control, the plant is <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> system is <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cruise control. The system output is <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> speed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> control itself is the engine's throttle position which determines how much power the engine delivers.|$|R
5|$|Other {{performing}} arts and theater organizations in Massachusetts include the Boston Ballet, the Boston Lyric Opera, and the Lenox-based Shakespeare & Company. In addition to classical and folk music, Massachusetts has produced musicians and bands spanning {{a number of}} contemporary genres, such as the classic rock band Aerosmith, the proto-punk band The Modern Lovers, the new wave band The <b>Cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> alternative rock band Pixies. Film events in the state include the Boston Film Festival, the Boston International Film Festival, {{and a number of}} smaller film festivals in various cities throughout Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Other service truncations {{also occur}} in the system during rush hour service only. On the Red Line, every other train bound for Shady Grove terminates at Grosvenor-Strathmore, in {{addition}} to the alternating terminations at Silver Spring mentioned above. For the Yellow Line, all trains bound for Fort Totten terminate at Mount Vernon Square. These are primarily instituted due to a limited supply of rail <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> locations of pocket tracks throughout the system.|$|E
5|$|Some {{teams had}} made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Honda introduced a more powerful version of its V10 engine for Saturday's qualifying session and the race.

40|$|Wind energy {{generated}} from the wake of moving cars has a large energy potential {{that has not yet}} been utilized. In this study, a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) was used to recover energy from the wakes of moving cars. The turbine was designed to be planted by the side of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> lane <b>and</b> driven by <b>the</b> wake produced by the car. Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the VAWT. The influence of two main factors on the performance of the VAWT, the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gap between <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rotor, were studied. The simulations confirmed the feasibility of this plan, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> tested cases, the VAWT was able to generate a maximum energy output of 100. 49 J from the wake of a car. The results also showed that the performance of the VAWT decreased with the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> increased gap between <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> VAWT...|$|R
5|$|The {{existing}} Dreamworld {{car park}} was redesigned to accommodate more <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{addition of a}} water park in the southern portion. Construction of the water park began in January 2006. In June, {{two of the three}} slide towers were complete, with several slides in the early phases of construction. One month later, several attractions were announced by the park with others being speculated upon. Some attractions were nearing completion in September and all the planned attractions had been revealed by October.|$|E
5|$|The first Superliner I cars entered {{service in}} February 1979, with {{deliveries}} continuing through 1981. Amtrak assigned the cars to both long-distance and short-distance trains in the Western United States. The first permanent assignment, in October 1979, {{was to the}} Chicago–Seattle Empire Builder. Superliner II deliveries began in 1993; the additional cars enabled the retirement of the aging Hi-Level <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> assignment of Superliners to trains in the Eastern United States. Tunnel clearances prevent their use on the Northeast Corridor.|$|E
5|$|Acoli {{then drove}} the car (a white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates)—which {{contained}} Assata Shakur, who was wounded, and Zayd Shakur, who was dead or dying— down the road. The vehicle was chased by three patrol <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> booths down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli then exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, {{fled into the}} woods as the trooper emptied his gun. Assata Shakur then walked towards the trooper with her bloodied arms raised in surrender. Acoli was captured after a 36-hour manhunt—involving 400 people, state police helicopters, and bloodhounds. Zayd Shakur's {{body was found in}} a nearby gully along the road.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in the region, in 2015 plug-in hybrids (95,140) outsold all-electric cars (89,640) in the {{passenger}} car segment, however, when light-duty plug-in utility vehicles are accounted for, the all-electric segment totaled 97,687 registrations in 2015, up 65,199 in 2014, and ahead of the plug-in hybrid segment. Also in 2015, the European market share of plug-in electric cars passed the 1% mark for {{the first time}}, with a 1.41% share of new car sales that year. This trend continue during 2016. Since April 2016 plug-in hybrids have outsold all-electric <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gap has continued to widen. Accounting for passenger plug-in car sales in Western Europe between January and July 2016, plug-in hybrids captured almost 54% of the region's plug-in market sales. During 2016 the all-electric car segment ended with a market share of 0.57% of new car sales, while plug-in hybrids reached a market share of 0.73%.|$|E
5|$|Further {{down the}} field, {{there was an}} intense battle between Audi and Toyota for {{positions}} three to six. Audi struggled to find an optimum set-up for their cars as they secured fourth and sixth positions. They were separated by the two Toyota vehicles in third and fifth places. André Lotterer was slowed by another car on {{the start of his}} first timed lap and was affected by oversteer on his second lap of the circuit. Marcel Fässler took over the No. 7 Audi entry from Lotterer and abandoned his first attempt because his vehicle's rear-end became excessively light and later lost downforce behind two cars in Blanchimont corner which restricted the car to starting sixth. The two Rebellion Racing <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> No. 4 ByKolles Racing CLM P1/01 rounded out the LMP1 qualifiers. Qualifying was stopped for ten minutes when the ByKolles car collided with the No. 43 Manor entry at La Source and debris coming from the former's rear bodywork littered the track at Radallion corner.|$|E

5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{steps were}} taken to better protect the tankers from attack, but losses {{continued}} to mount until, in April 1942, they were banned by the Navy from operating the north-east sea routes. The government and industry took steps to maximise {{the use of the}} railroads, increasing the amount of oil carried on them more than ten-fold, but there were shortages of rail tank <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> existing fleet of cars was in poor condition. Instead, the United States government began to examine options for the use of pipelines to fulfil the demand for petroleum in the north-east.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 2012, Cedar Point {{announced}} that Disaster Transport would close on July 29, 2012. It {{was the second}} roller coaster at Cedar Point to close in 2012. A charity auction was held for the final riders, benefiting the Give Kids the World charity foundation. The last ride was given at 11:53 PM on July 29, with the lights turned on. The ride started demolition on August 6, using about 380 trucks to transport scrap materials. A portion of track, two <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> main entrance sign will be donated to the National Roller Coaster Museum. Less than a month later on August 29 at around 9:30 AM, the last section of Disaster Transport was demolished. The 12E {{part of the building}} was the last section left standing.|$|E

5|$|Quantum of Solace was {{the last}} in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 {{returned}} for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of {{his work on the}} second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in Casino Royale. He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159. After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen. Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it only looked like two Romeos were chasing Bond. Six Aston Martins were destroyed during filming, {{and one of them was}} purchased by a fan.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins at}} the Calexico East Border Station, which is open from 6 am to 10 pm, seven days a week. Just north of the border, the highway splits into two roads {{to pass through the}} customs checkpoints before the two roads merge back together; the fork to the west is for <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fork to the east is for {{commercial}} vehicles. SR 7 takes the western fork, which passes over the other fork at the northern end and merges into that highway. From here to I-8, SR 7 is an expressway known as Orchard Road. Before reaching I-8, SR 7 travels north and has an at-grade intersection with SR 98 and a few other roads. At its northern end, SR 7 turns into County Route S32 (still Orchard Road) as it intersects with I-8. The entire route runs through the Sonoran Desert and is built to expressway standards.|$|E
