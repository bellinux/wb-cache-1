40|$|Abstract: Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii) is host to {{a variety}} of {{pathogenic}} fungi. At least 21 species are identified. Isolation and identification of these fungi is done from symptoms on the tree and by culturing the fungi in the lab. Many are foliar pathogens that are not a serious threat to the tree’s health. In recent years several canker fungi have caused damage, and even death, of large madrone trees in urban areas. Three pathogens most likely to <b>cause</b> <b>tree</b> death are a root rot (Phytophthora cactorum), Arbutus canker (Nattrassia mangiferae) and madrone canker (Fusicoccum aesculi). Diseases of Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii) are classified into root rots, stem and branch cankers, branch dieback, wood decay and foliage diseases. The fungi that cause the diseases are also taxonomically organized by class (Table 7 - 1). Many of the fungi in a given class affect the same parts of the tree. An understanding of the life cycles of fungi is necessary in learning how to control diseases (Alexopoulos, et al. 1996). Many fungi that attack madrone are foliar pathogens that are not a serious threat to the tree unless repeated defoliation occurs. In recent years several canker fungi have caused damage, and even death, of large madrone trees in urban areas. In this paper I discuss identification, life cycles and disease symptoms on madrone of the 3 pathogens [Phytophthora cactorum (Plates 7 - 1 and 7 - 2), Nattrassia mangiferae (Plates 7 - 3, 7 - 4 and 7 - 5) and Fusicoccum aesculi] most likely to <b>cause</b> <b>tree</b> death. In addition, techniques for isolating and culturing the fungi are discussed. Plate 7 - 1 (page 49, upper). A tree that was killed quickly by Phytophthora.

30|$|There was {{temporal}} and spatial variation in fuel deposition, suggesting that winter storm activity {{during the course of}} the study may have been an important source of localized surface fuel loads (Keane 2013, Stalling et al. 2017). Deposition of 100 -hour fuels at one litter basket resulted in a 10 -fold higher total fuel load in 2010. The total precipitation from 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011 was approximately 36 to 67 % higher than the several years prior, and this may have contributed to high deposition rates of litter in 2011, which was the main contributor to total fuel loading (Table  3). High winds and rainfall and snowfall amounts may <b>cause</b> <b>tree</b> mortality and damage to canopies of trees, transferring aerial fuels to surface fuels (Brown and See 1981, Grier 1988) in relatively shorts periods, contributing to the spatially clumped distribution of coarse fuel loads (Lundquist 2007, Fry and Stephens 2010, Lydersen et al. 2015). A limited sample size and low snag densities (Stephens and Gill 2005) in this study area prohibited an examination of relationships with coarse fuels (1000 -hour).|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora spp. de Bary {{are being}} {{increasingly}} recognised as pathogens that <b>cause</b> <b>tree</b> death, without necessarily having any {{clear understanding of}} how this happens. Suggested mechanisms include: •	 extensive fine-root necrosis especially on wet or drought prone sites, leading to reduced water uptake, crown decline and death, e. g. Phytophthora quercina T. Jung infection of European oaks; •	 root and stem cankers resulting from phloem invasion and cambial death, leading to death of basal buds and carbon starvation of the root system, e. g. Phytophthora alni Brasier & S. A. Kirk infection of alders; •	 xylem invasion, leading to reduced conduction, hydraulic failure and death, e. g. Phytophthora ramorum Werres, De Cock & Man in ‘t Veld infection of tanoaks; and •	 hormonal imbalance and/or damage from toxins, e. g. Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands infection of eucalypts. These possible mechanisms are reviewed, together with different hypotheses of why trees die, and the predisposing environmental stresses that contribute to tree death. Extensive xylem invasion provides a mechanistic explanation of how death occurs, but is the least frequently reported symptom of Phytophthora infection...|$|E
