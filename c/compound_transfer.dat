40|$|A {{sensitive}} and selective method for {{the determination of}} the whole congener distribution of polybromodiphenyl ethers in environmental and biological samples in one single instrumental run is described.

A programmed temperature vaporization injector has been used to ensure maximum <b>compound</b> <b>transfer</b> to the chromatographic column while maintaining low thermal degradation levels of the more brominated congeners. Selectivity was increased by modification of the MS source parameters for optimization of the abundance of the high mass fragment ions.

Like honeybees they live in large eusocial colonies and rely on complex chemical recognition and communication systems. In contrast to honeybees, their ecology and especially their chemical ecology have received only little attention, particularly in the Old World. We previously have analyzed the chemical profiles of six paleotropical stingless bee species from Borneo and revealed the presence of species-specific cuticular terpenes— an environmentally derived compound class so far unique among social insects. Here, we compared the bees’ surface profiles to the chemistry of their nest material. Terpenes, alkanes, and alkenes were the dominant compound groups on both body surfaces and nest material. However, bee profiles and nests strongly differed in their chemical composition. Body surfaces thus did not merely mirror nests, rendering a passive <b>compound</b> <b>transfer</b> from nests to bees unlikely. The difference between nests and bees was particularly pronounced when all resin-derived compounds (terpenes) were excluded and only genetically determined compounds were considered. When terpenes were included, bee profiles and nest material still differed, because whole groups of terpenes (e. g., sesquiterpenes) were found in nest material of some species, but missing in their chemical profile, indicating that bees are able to influence the terpene composition both in their nests and on their surfaces...|$|E

It {{was found that the}} values of the binding enthalpy are linearly correlated to those of entropy, and that this correlation arises from a real phenomenon of chemical compensation. On the other hand, no compensatory chemical effect was found for the process of thrombin acylation. Additional experiments showed that binding to thrombin of two competitive thrombin inhibitors, i. e. proflavin and p-aminobenzamidine, is characterized by a change in the standard heat capacity change (delta Cp), approximately equal to - 1 kcal/mol K. By analogy with model <b>compound</b> <b>transfer</b> studies and protein folding investigations, it is proposed that a burial of a large surface area of non-polar residues, roughly equal to 3000 A 2, brings about the observed heat capacity change. Altogether, the observed phenomena of the chemical compensation and heat capacity change, although qualitatively different, are interpreted as expressions of the same property of the enzyme, i. e. the capacity to undergo conformational transitions upon ligation of the catalytic domain.

40|$|The Dongying {{anticline}} is an E-W striking complex fault-bounded block unit which {{located in}} the central Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin. The anticline covers an area of approximately 12 km 2. The overlying succession, which is mainly composed of Tertiary strata, is cut by normal faults with opposing dips. In terms of the general structure, the study area {{is located in a}} <b>compound</b> <b>transfer</b> zone with major bounding faults to the west (Ying 1 fault) and east (Ying - 8 and - 31 faults). Using three-dimensional seismic data, wireline log and checkshot data, the geometries and kinematics of faults in the transfer zone were studied, and fault displacements were calculated. The results show that when activity on the Ying 1 fault diminished, displacement was transferred to the Ying - 8, Ying - 31 and secondary faults so that total displacement increased. Dynamic analysis shows that the stress fields in the transfer zone were complex: the northern portion was a left-lateral extensional shear zone, and the southern portion was a right-lateral extensional shear zone. A model of potential hydrocarbon traps in the Dongying transfer zone was constructed based on the above data combined with the observed reservoir rock distribution and the sealing characteristics of the faults. The hydrocarbons were mainly expulsed from Minfeng Sag during deposition periods of Neogene Guantao and Minghuazhen Formations, and migrated along major faults from source kitchens to reservoirs. The secondary faults acted as barriers, resulting in the formation of fault-bound compartments. The high points of the anticline and well-sealed traps near secondary faults are potential targets.

40|$|Pour lutter contre les pollutions diffuses en milieu rural, de nombreux {{programmes}} d'action se mettent en place. Le développement de recherches sur les connexions parcelle - cours d'eau devrait permettre de mieux comprendre le transfert et la dissipation des polluants dans ce milieu. En particulier, les fossés, structures relativement fréquentes dans les territoires cultivés, peuvent, a priori, avoir une fonction de court-circuit et donc faciliter le transfert des produits phytosanitaires, ou {{au contraire}} constituer des éléments de pondération de la pollution. Afin d'éclaircir ce point, une première série d'expérimentations a été menée par le Cemagref (Institut français de recherche pour l'ingénierie de l'agriculture et de l'environnement) dans des fossés de drainage agricole. Une solution aqueuse contenant trois herbicides aux caractéristiques physico-chimiques différentes (isoproturon, diuron et diflufénicanil), et un traceur (chlorures) a été injectée pendant quelques minutes dans quatre fossés. Des échantillons d'eau ont été prélevés à pas de temps fins à deux emplacements en aval du point d'injection. Après dosage par chromatographie au laboratoire, les résultats indiquent une diminution du flux et de la concentration maximale du pic de polluants comparativement à un traceur. En outre, la variation observée est corrélée aux propriétés physico-chimiques des produits, en particulier au coefficient de partage Koc. L'étude présentée montre que la surface de contact (liée à la nature du substrat) et le temps de contact (dépendant essentiellement des conditions d'écoulement) entre les polluants et le substrat sont les paramètres qui influent majoritairement sur la dissipation des produits phytosanitaires. The use of pesticide {{may lead to}} the contamination of surface and groundwaters. Agricultural nonpoint source pollution originates from land areas which intermittently contribute to the <b>compound</b> <b>transfer</b> to water. Several studies report on the occurrence of pesticides in surface water resources, with concentrations over the limit set by the 80 / 778 EEC directive for drinking water (0. 1 µg/L for each substance and 0. 5 µg/L for all pesticides). Numerous herbicides of different chemical families are detected in surface waters, especially triazines and ureas. Their concentrations vary with time and space partly in relation with application patterns and pluviometry. Maximum concentrations are linked to runoff, originating from agricultural fields and primarily occur right after the application periods. Many methods and levels of actions can be used to reduce water pollution. First, better agricultural practices can be set up, such as choosing the best dose and application period, controlling toxic substance impacts, combining with non-chemical practices. However, pesticide losses from fields can't be totally cancelled because of the complexity of the involved parameters (agricultural practices, climatic conditions, soil physical, chemical and biological properties …). In fact drift during application, runoff or drainage systems may still occur and have an effect on water quality. It may be then pertinent to evaluate to which extent the non treated areas between the fields and the surface water bodies can dissipate pesticide concentrations before they reach them. Pesticides leaving a plot in surface runoff may pass through various landscape components before reaching rivers; including another field, a ditch, a small brook, a vegetative buffer zone. Besides, pesticide leaving the plot through drainage straightly moves agricultural ditches or streams. However, the contribution of each of these elements in pesticide dissipation is not well known, except for buffer zones (grassed or forest strips) (PATTY (1997). Cemagref (a French research institute), CEH Wallingford and ITCF (Institut Technique des Cereales et des Fourrages) attempt to extend their study to the other elements as agricultural ditches. This paper deals with the role of farm ditches and small streams in the transport and retention of pesticides from fields to the main river network. Their presence seems to {{play a significant role in}} the transfer of nonpoint source pollution (especially in the West of France). Indeed they can either accelerate pesticide transport or reduce it, according to their characteristics (length, flow, bottom sediment or soil characteristics, plants and organic matter contents, etc.). Since 1998, Cemagref has been investigating the retention of pesticides by several natural ditches with varied flows and substratum. A water solution containing three herbicides with different physico chemical properties (diflufenican, diuron and isoproturon) and potassium chloride, a tracer, is introduced with a pump in each ditch for about five minutes with a constant concentration. Water samples are collected in the ditches every two or five minutes at two distances from the injection point. The samples are stored in amber polyethylene terephtalate bottles and frozen. Laboratory analysis is performed by liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane and then liquid or gas chromatography depending on the compounds. The analysis of the water samples highlights a reduction of the maximum concentration and of the accumulative mass of each pesticide with distance compared to the tracer. Indeed, even if all the chloride ions used as tracers are not recovered at each sampling point (due to infiltration or lateral losses), we notice more significant losses for all the studied herbicides. The reduction can reach 70 % of the applied mass for diflufenican compared to the tracer. The retention of pesticides is also linked to their own physical and chemical properties. Thus, diflufenican, which has the highest sorption coefficient value, Koc, is also the most retained pesticide, whereas the total injected mass of isoproturon is recovered in most cases. Diuron has an intermediate behaviour. In brief, this field experiment proves that the surface and time of contact between pollutants and substratum are likely to play a major role in pesticide retention. An estimated adsorption capacity of each ditch has been assessed, which is based on laboratory sorption experiments on different natural substratum. Despite the few data, a relationship between diflufenican retention in ditches and the estimated adsorption capacity of each ditch has been underscored. This study also highlighted major limits of field experiments. For example, accurate flow measurements are really difficult to carry out with simple methods for low values. The conventional techniques can't be used with small water height or in ditch where the bottom is filled with plants or grass. Chloride ion was chosen in this study because it is easy to analyze, but the results showed an initial presence of chloride ion in the natural ditch water which incites to replace it by another tracer such as bromide with is not found in the environment in future field experiments. For all these reasons, some pilot experiments with a physical model (an artificial ditch of 8 m long and 0. 4 m wide) are now designed. This equipment allows to adjust and control hydrodynamic parameters such as water flow, water height, and the nature and structure of the substratum. Then, it is possible to quantify both the role played by the substratum, mainly the organic matter content, and the role of the contact time. These parameters could be then taken into account in order to optimize further experiments on adsorption. The primary tests without substratum already give references for hydrodynamic measurements, as the stability of the water flow and the homogeneity of the initial solution concentration...|$|E

It is suggested that the mechanism of this electrooxidation involves the transformations amine to nitro <b>compound.</b> The <b>transfer</b> coefficients for all compounds were also reported...|$|R

Under prolonged reaction periods, these first examples of charge <b>transfer</b> <b>compounds</b> incorporating the distorted TMTCNQ electron acceptor, undergo further reaction at the acrylonitrile functionality promoting the synthesis of novel thiomorpholine-based charge <b>transfer</b> <b>compounds</b> via a sulfur mediated cyclisation reaction. This second reaction illustrates a fundamentally new type of TCNQ-based chemistry as confirmed by X-ray crystallography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. A possible reaction mechanism for the formation of the thiomorpholine-based chromophores is considered...|$|R
30|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{above-mentioned}} results, it is suggested that In either in as-grown compound or driving out from Cu–In compound can work for the growth of In 2 O 3. During annealing at ~ 550 °C, Cu–In <b>compound</b> <b>transfers</b> to the liquid form in an In–rich condition according to Cu–In phase diagram. Hence, Cu–In liquid droplets can be formed in the part of Cu–In compound in the initial stage of annealing. And then, the rest of Cu–In compound is possibly “passivated” by oxidation, and ultimately retains a solid phase. In this case, the first solid–liquid interface between solid and liquid Cu–In compound is formed. Later, supersaturated In in Cu–In compound will segregate from the liquid droplets to interact with oxygen and to form In 2 O 3 solid. A second liquid–solid interface between liquid Cu–In compound and In 2 O 3 solid is formed, resulting in the growth of In 2 O 3 nanowires [26]. This growth mechanism is related to two liquid–solid interfaces and three different phases, so-called solid–liquid–solid (SLS) mechanism, which is analogous to vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism. Since the In source supply is diffusion-limited, the In 2 O 3 nanostructure is thicker at the bottom and snagged thinner and thinner at the top as annealing time increases, as indicated in Figs. 1 b and 4 a.|$|R
