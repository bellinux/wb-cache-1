The total cost is $99.6 million, with $15 million coming from the 2005–2009 <b>capital</b> <b>budget</b> (phase one) and $84.6 million from the 2010–2014 <b>capital</b> <b>budget</b> (phase two). The installation is a joint venture between Siemens and Thales Group, and is used to test the track's new signaling on R143s and R160s that are already equipped with CBTC. The estimated completion date was scheduled for March 2015; the installation is expected to be permanent. If Culver Line express service is implemented in 2017 as it was proposed, the express service would not initially use CBTC, and testing of CBTC on the express track will be limited to off-peak hours. The local tracks in this section would also get CBTC as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program.|$|E
