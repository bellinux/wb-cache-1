50|$|When a {{customer}} {{does not pay}} the car rental company to waive damage, and a rented car is stolen, or damaged by accident, vandalism, weather (hail), etc., the customer or other insurance must pay to the rental company {{the full cost of}} repair, plus administrative charges and, in some states, loss of use. From some companies, in some states and countries, there are <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> <b>towing,</b> storage, impound, administrative fees and diminution of value of the car (Avis, Budget, National, Thrifty). Some companies even say they alone will decide the diminution (Dollar, Hertz").|$|R
5000|$|Lincoln uses {{state of}} the art {{technology}} including satellite tracking to provide <b>towing</b> services <b>for</b> landlords with tenant parking problems and for commercial property owners with similar problems. The primary business is removing unauthorized vehicles from parking spaces. [...] The business claims the largest fleet of wheel-lift and flatbed towing vehicles in Chicago. [...] The business model is such that towing companies engage in exclusive <b>towing</b> contracts <b>for</b> properties and collect fees from owners of unauthorized vehicles that have been towed. However, the company also provides vehicle repossession services and parking lot management services which include snow removal, pot hole patching, striping, and complete parking lot construction. [...] As a private company enforcing private property parking, the company does not issue parking tickets in addition to <b>charging</b> <b>for</b> <b>towing</b> and storage, unlike the City of Chicago, which does <b>for</b> parking in <b>tow</b> zones. It has towed over 30,000 unauthorized parked cars since September 5, 2005, which makes it Chicago's leading relocator.|$|R
6000|$|Falk was a Dane {{or perhaps}} a Norwegian, I can't tell now. At all events he was a Scandinavian of some sort, and a bloated {{monopolist}} to boot. It is possible he was unacquainted with the word, {{but he had a}} clear perception of the thing itself. His tariff of <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> <b>towing</b> ships in and out was the most brutally inconsiderate document of the sort I had ever seen. He was the commander and owner of the only tug-boat on the river, a very trim white craft of 150 tons or more, as elegantly neat as a yacht, with a round wheel-house rising like a glazed turret high above her sharp bows, and with one slender varnished pole mast forward. I daresay there are yet a few shipmasters afloat who remember Falk and his tug very well. He extracted his pound and a half of flesh from each of us merchant-skippers with an inflexible sort of indifference which made him detested and even feared. Schomberg used to remark: [...] "I won't talk about the fellow. I don't think he has six drinks from year's end to year's end in my place. But my advice is, gentlemen, don't you {{have anything to do with}} him, if you can help it." ...|$|R

[...] Harrison picked up a steel hawser from the bark and commenced towing Swanmore away from the surf to a point [...] off shore. [...] Harrison then proceeded to Astoria, arriving on Monday morning, November 19, and alerted the tug Relief, which proceed out to Swanmore. [...] The captain of the Swanmore said that he’d agreed with Schrader to <b>charge</b> $900 <b>for</b> the <b>tow,</b> but Schrader said there hadn’t been any time for bargaining.|$|R
