50|$|Differences in {{preservation}} and diagenesis {{make it difficult}} to confidently identify eggshell pathologies in the fossil record. Multilayered eggshell identification can be complicated if the secondary eggshell is disconnected from the original.

40|$|Abstract—When {{observers}} face {{directly toward}} the incline of a hill, their {{awareness of the}} slant of the hill is greatly overestimated, but motoric estimates are much more accurate. The present study examined whether similar results would be found when observers were allowed to view {{the side of a}} hill. Observers <b>viewed</b> the <b>cross-sections</b> of hills in real (Experiment 1) and virtual (Experiment 2) environments and estimated the inclines with verbal estimates, by adjusting the cross-section of a disk, and by adjusting a board with their unseen hand to match the inclines.
