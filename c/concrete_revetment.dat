50|$|In {{the months}} that followed, this {{volunteer}} group, which Alderman Hairston called The Community Task Force for Promontory Point met and elected officers, called the executive committee. This Executive Committee met privately with the CPD, the City, and the ACOE. The result of these meetings was that the executive committee agreed to nine largely symbolic concessions that modified the CPD's new proposal. Included in these nine points were limited water access, limitations on {{the height and width}} of the <b>concrete</b> <b>revetment,</b> and a staged construction plan that would keep some part of the Point open for use during the two-year construction. The plan still mandated the destruction of the historic limestone revetment, to be replaced with a uniform concrete seawall. When the executive committee presented their agreement to the Community Task Force, it was rejected and the Task Force voted to not ratify the agreement. In protest against the executive committee operating without consultation with the Task Force members, the Task Force then immediately elected four new members of the executive committee. The original executive committee members then quit the group in protest. The nine-point agreement was rejected by the Task Force as without substantial compromise.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 400 {{kilometres}} of Dutch sea dikes {{are protected}} by bituminous concrete revetments to prevent damage from erosion and repeated wave attacks during storms. The numerical analysis of sea dikes subjected to cyclic wave loading needs to consider the behaviour of the bituminous <b>concrete</b> <b>revetment,</b> and the behaviour of the subsoil including the generation and dissipation of the excess pore pressures, {{as well as the}} interaction between the revetment and subsoil. This thesis develops and evaluates numerical methods for investigating this problem, using the dynamic Finite Element Method with the coupling of plate and volume elements. In dynamic finite element analysis, the arbitrary selected boundary generates wave reflections which normally causes oscillation problems. Absorbing boundary conditions are therefore adopted to minimise the wave reflection at the artificial boundaries. The effects of the absorbing boundary conditions are investigated in detail for both solid and water phases, and appropriate sets of parameters are recommended. In order to model the bituminous <b>concrete</b> <b>revetment,</b> which is a thin layer of material with a high stiffness, a very fine mesh is often needed in order to obtain accurate results. However, an explicit time integration algorithm is normally needed for dynamic analysis, which reduces the critical time step size required for numerical stability if the same element type is used for both the revetment and the soil, severely affecting simulation performance. In order to avoid this problem, in this thesis a structural plate element is developed based on the classical Kirchhoff thin plate bending theory for modelling thin layer materials instead of the volume element. For consideration of both stretching and bending problems, the Kirchhoff thin plate bending theory has been extended. Specifically, a more conventional 3 -noded triangular plate element, with 1 translational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom per node, has been extended to include 2 extra translational degrees of freedom per node, i. e. giving a total of 3 translational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom per node. Moreover, an enhanced lumped mass matrix for the plate element has been constructed by considering both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Numerical validations indicate that the use of plate elements for simulating the thin layer material provides a great improvement on the accuracy of the results, as well as a significant decrease in the computational cost. For the limit state design of some engineering problems, non-linear material models provide more accurate results than elastic material models. Here an elastic viscoplastic model is investigated and implemented for the new plate element, using the Drucker-Prager yield condition and a non-associated flow rule. Typical creep behaviour of the bituminous concrete is presented and a parametric study of the viscoplastic model has been carried out for modelling the behaviour of Delft bituminous concrete. It is concluded that the viscosity value for a particular material changes from different conditions, that it depends not only on the material model and stress level, but also on the temperature. The developed numerical methods have been used to investigate the behaviour of sea dikes subjected to wave attacks. The results of the bending moments and stresses in the bituminous concrete, as well as the excess pore pressures and displacements in the soil, are presented. The tendency of a so-called "shake down" behaviour is observed after 10 cycles of wave attack during a severe storm, indicating that the displacement of the dike converges asymptotically to a particular final deformation.

The present tests were conducted with a double layer of mattress, placed one on top the other so that the interstices between adjacent blocks were symmetrically staggered. Test runs were made over a 32 -ft length of a full-scale double mattress installed over a 15 -in. sand bed in a 9 -ft test channel with water depths of 2. 1 to 3. 2 ft and mean velocities of 3. 2 to 10. 0 fps. Turbulence was induced into the flow stream to simulate the random pressure pulsations which have been measured in revetted areas in the Lower Mississippi River. Pressure measurements indicated that the pressures at the bottom surface of the lower layer of blocks and in the sand beneath them remained essentially constant and that the differential pressures across the double mattress essentially followed the pulsating pressures above the top layer. No underscour of sand was observed after a total of 18. 7 hr of test runs at a mean flow velocity of 5 - 1 / 2 fps.

Residual water level around revetments has been decided by only considering tidal level change. However, groundwater level higher than this design level has sometime been observed in cases of heavy rainfall or where water is stored in coastal sand pits, and this causes high water pressure on the revetment and large seepage velocity sea-ward. This paper deals with such groundwater flow around revetments where the groundwater level in coastal reclaimed areas {{is higher than the}} sea level. The residual water level change and the velocity distribution of groundwater flow around sheet-pile revetments are calculated numerically by using finite element method in various conditions, and the effects of rainfall and landward boundary conditions are examined. Applying this numerical model to practical steel sheet-pile revetment which stability may be reduced by high residual water level, the effect of the proposed countermeasure method mainly composed of drainage method is discussed and the reinforcement work is executed. As a result of investigation of the practical situations of cellular <b>concrete</b> block-type <b>revetment,</b> cavitations under the pavement are found out where the armor stone and rubble foundation of revetment were damaged and the groundwater level at a distance of 19 in from revetment has risen lm by heavy rainfall. Back filling materials of this gravity-type revetment may be washed away, because seepage velocity larger than critical seepage velocity can be estimated numerically at this section...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the INDOT new {{materials}} department has received numerous erosion control products (mostly geosynthetics) to evaluate as alternatives to riprap and concrete in ditch liners. Potential benefits include lower construction costs and better aesthetics over current products. Unfortunately, no specification, design methodology, or classification system currently exists for these erosion control blankets. In this project 2 ̆ 7 s phase I, existing information and knowledge on erosion control materials used to line highway side drainage ditches were investigated. From the available technical 1 iterature (journal and conference publications, other DOTs specifications, manufacturer documentation, independent test laboratory test data), design methodologies, classification system, product approval procedures, and installation methods were reviewed for temporary and permanent geosynthetic erosion control materials. Based on the synthesis of these reviews a design methodology was proposed including design aids (tables, flow charts, and graphs) necessary to perform flexible liner computations. A classification system based on product performance was also proposed. In addition, current design procedures for hard armor materials (fabric formed <b>revetments,</b> <b>concrete</b> block systems, gabions, and riprap) were reviewed. A tentative specification for both flexible and hard armor ditch liners was drafted...|$|R
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to develop a <b>concrete</b> <b>revetment</b> block which can cater for environment {{and at the same}} time it will be effective in protecting river banks (stabilize the slope of banks) from scouring during flood. In the present study, the environmental and hydraulic performance of the proposed revetment block was evaluated through laboratory and field tests. The tested revetment block is called bio-composite because it is composed of concrete, plastic mesh and biological material (coconut husk). The dimensions of the bio-composite revetment block are 400 mm x 400 mm x 100 mm (length x width x thickness) and has a central opening with a dimensions of 280 mm x 140 mm that has a 10 mm layer of coconut husks protected by two layers of plastic mesh. The coconut husk was selected based on laboratory experiments. The experiments showed that the coconut husk is a good media for grass growth and it allows faster growth of grass compared with other tested types of biological wastes (sugar cane husk and oil palm husk). Field tests were conducted on a selected stream which is located at the Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia. The stream banks were protected from scouring by using the bio-composite blocks and monitoring after installation revealed that rate of grass growth was 15 % per week. However, it was found that the rate of grass growth is depends on the slope of stream banks. This confirms that the proposed bio-composite block is friendly to the environment and can give a good aesthetic appearance. For a given water depth, hydraulic tests showed that the value of Manning coefficient of roughness for the bio-composite revetment blocks depends mainly on the rate of grass growth. The values of Manning coefficient roughness for the stream were found to range from 0. 031 to 0. 05...|$|E
