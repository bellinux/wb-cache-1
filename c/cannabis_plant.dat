25|$|THC, the {{principal}} psychoactive constituent of the <b>cannabis</b> <b>plant,</b> has an extremely low toxicity {{and the amount}} that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death. In dogs, the minimum lethal dose of THC is over 3 g/kg.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Cannabis</b> <b>plant</b> in the {{vegetative}} {{growth phase}} {{of its life}} requires more than 12–13 hours of light per day to stay vegetative. Flowering usually occurs when darkness equals at least 12 hours per day. The flowering cycle can last anywhere between nine and fifteen weeks, depending on the strain and environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis, {{also known}} as {{marijuana}} among other names, is a psychoactive drug from the <b>Cannabis</b> <b>plant</b> intended for medical or recreational use. The main psychoactive part of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); one of 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids. Cannabis {{can be used by}} smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>Cannabis</b> <b>plant,</b> THC occurs {{mainly as}} tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA, 2-COOH-THC, THC-COOH). Geranyl {{pyrophosphate}} and olivetolic acid react, catalysed by an enzyme to produce cannabigerolic acid, which is cyclized by the enzyme THC acid synthase to give THCA. Over time, or when heated, THCA is decarboxylated, producing THC. The pathway for THCA biosynthesis {{is similar to}} that which produces the bitter acid humulone in hops.|$|E
25|$|Hash oil is a {{resinous}} {{matrix of}} cannabinoids {{obtained from the}} <b>Cannabis</b> <b>plant</b> by solvent extraction, formed into a hardened or viscous mass. Hash oil {{can be the most}} potent of the main cannabis products because of its high level of psychoactive compound per its volume, which can vary depending on the plant's mix of essential oils and psychoactive compounds. Butane and supercritical carbon dioxide hash oil have become popular in recent years.|$|E

That same year, the International Narcotics Control Board commended the Government of Morocco for its efforts to eradicate <b>cannabis</b> <b>plant</b> cultivation on its territory, which has resulted in the total potential production of cannabis resin in the Rif region decreasing by 10 per cent over the previous year. At the same time the board called upon the international community to support its efforts where possible.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{marijuana}} {{refers to}} the use of the <b>Cannabis</b> <b>plant</b> as a physician-recommended herbal therapy as well as synthetic THC and cannabinoids. So far, the medical use of cannabis is legal only in a limited number of territories, including Canada, Belgium, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and several U.S. states. This usage generally requires a prescription, and distribution is usually done within a framework defined by local laws. There is evidence supporting the use of cannabis or its derivatives in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, neuropathic pain, and multiple sclerosis. Lower levels of evidence support its use for AIDS wasting syndrome, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, and glaucoma.|$|E

Having moved to South Australia in 2003, Brooks started Local, which he billed as the state's leading lifestyle magazine. The venture was run solely by him and his wife, and was dominated by advertising. Journalist Peter FitzSimons criticised the lack of grammar checking and copyediting, citing a quote from Kieren Perkins, which was rendered thus in the publication: [...] "I was over the moon. Winning is something you strive to do but when I consider all the factors being married two children twenty seven years of age competing in my third Games and I broke fifteen minutes twice in two days it really was quite outstanding and whichever way you cut it Grant Hackett was just the next generation of swimmer [...]" [...] Brooks stood 200cm and weighed 95kg during his career, but {{in the early part of}} the 21st century fought a battle with obesity, after ballooning to 150kg.

500|$|The {{decision}} of the United States Congress to pass the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was based on poorly attended hearings and reports based on questionable studies. In 1936 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) noticed an increase of reports of people smoking marijuana, which further increased in 1937. The Bureau drafted a legislative plan for Congress seeking a new law, {{and the head of}} the FBN, Harry J. Anslinger, ran a campaign against marijuana. Newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst's empire of newspapers used the [...] "yellow journalism" [...] pioneered by Hearst to demonize the <b>cannabis</b> <b>plant</b> and spread a public perception that there were connections between cannabis and violent crime. Several scholars argue that the goal was to destroy the hemp industry, largely as an effort of Hearst, Andrew Mellon and the Du Pont family. They argue that with the invention of the decorticator hemp became a very cheap substitute for the wood pulp that was used in the newspaper industry. However, Hearst newspapers owed large debts to Canadian suppliers of paper, who used wood as raw material. If an alternative raw material for paper had emerged, it would have lowered the price of the paper needed to print Hearst's many newspapers—a positive thing for Hearst. Moreover, by the year 1916 there were at least five [...] "machine brakes" [...] for hemp and it is unlikely that in 1930s hemp became a new threat for newspapers owners.|$|E

Combs accused police of planting evidence to support their charge and initially denied that he had ever used marijuana. He later admitted to using the drug to help with insomnia, but maintained he had only been using it since retiring from the Supreme Court in 1993. Reporters later uncovered testimony from Combs' psychiatrist in a 1992 civil case that Combs had told him after a 1989 motorcycle accident that he used marijuana for insomnia. Combs later blamed his inconsistency on his Alzheimer's-like memory disorder that {{made it difficult for}} him to remember details like when he began smoking marijuana. Charges against Combs were dismissed on the condition that he have no further legal issues with drugs for two years.|$|E

2500|$|There is some {{speculation}} that George Washington smoked the flower of the <b>cannabis</b> <b>plant</b> {{in order to}} achieve a recreational high ("Like all farmers, Washington probably sampled the quality and potency of what he grew, and he may have used this hemp to treat his chronic tooth aches"), but there is no evidence in any of his writings that he grew hemp for anything other than industrial purposes. It is sometimes supposed that an excerpt from Washington's diary, which reads [...] "Began to [...] the Male from the Female hemp at Do. too late" [...] is evidence {{that he was trying to}} grow female plants for the THC found in the flowers. However, the editorial remark accompanying the diary states that [...] "This may arise from their [...] being coarser, and the stalks larger" [...] In subsequent days, he describes soaking the hemp (to make the fibers usable) and harvesting the seeds, suggesting that he was growing hemp for industrial purposes, not recreational.|$|E
2500|$|It {{takes over}} one hour for Marinol to reach full {{systemic}} effect, compared to seconds or minutes for smoked or vaporized cannabis. Some people accustomed to inhaling just enough cannabis smoke to manage symptoms have complained of too-intense intoxication from Marinol's predetermined dosages. Many people using Marinol {{have said that}} Marinol produces a more acute psychedelic effect than cannabis, {{and it has been}} speculated that this disparity {{can be explained by the}} moderating effect of the many non-THC cannabinoids present in cannabis. For that reason, alternative THC-containing medications based on botanical extracts of the <b>cannabis</b> <b>plant</b> such as nabiximols are being developed. Mark Kleiman, director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, [...] "It wasn't any fun and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine." [...] Mr. Kleiman's opinion notwithstanding, clinical trials comparing the use of cannabis extracts with Marinol in the treatment of cancer cachexia have demonstrated equal efficacy and well-being among subjects in the two treatment arms. United States federal law currently registers dronabinol as a Schedule III controlled substance, but all other cannabinoids remain Schedule I, except synthetics like nabilone.|$|E
