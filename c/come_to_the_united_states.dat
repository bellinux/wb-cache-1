His father, Michael, had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> from Turkey in 1915, fleeing the Armenian Genocide during World War I and settling in part of the country where there was a large Armenian population. Despite his mother's protectiveness, Parseghian became involved in sports from an early age, and developed a reputation as the toughest kid in his class.

5|$|The family's {{frequent}} moves later spawned {{accusations that}} Chester Arthur {{was not a}} native-born citizen of the United States. When Arthur was nominated for vice president in 1880, a New York attorney and political opponent, Arthur P. Hinman, initially speculated that Arthur was born in Ireland and did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> until he was fourteen years old. Had that been true, opponents might have argued that Arthur was constitutionally ineligible for the vice presidency under the United States Constitution's natural-born-citizen clause. When Hinman's original story did not take root, he spread a new rumor that Arthur was born in Canada. This claim, too, failed to gain credence.|$|E

He served as a minor official of the local Turkish government in Mezire, a village near Kharpert. He was then invited {{to work in the}} Persian consulate in Mezire until he was recalled by the Turkish government to serve as supervisor of eleven villages in the region of Kharpert. Kevork Juskalian felt that there was no secure future for him in Ottoman Turkey and subsequently fled to the United States with his family, arriving at Ellis Island on November 15, 1887. Consequently, the Juskalian family became some of the first Armenians to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Kevork found a job at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in Worcester, Massachusetts. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Armenian Church of Our Savior on January 18, 1891.|$|E

25|$|Like {{most major}} cities at the {{beginning}} of the 20th-century, Detroit's immigrant neighborhoods were stricken with poverty and some became breeding grounds for crime and violence. From the Hastings Street neighborhood known as Paradise Valley in Detroit's lower east side, most of the Purple Gang's core members went to Bishop School where all were placed in the division for problem children. The gang members were the children of immigrants from eastern Europe, primarily Russia and Poland, who had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in the great immigration wave from 1881 to 1914.|$|E

Also, when many parishes were {{set up in the}} United States, separate churches were built for parishioners from Ireland, Germany, Italy, etc. In Iowa, the development of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, the work of Bishop Loras and the building of St. Raphael's Cathedral illustrate this point.|$|E

His father had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> without obtaining naturalization papers and young Louis had decided against filing later due to his 1917 conviction as a conscientious objector.

25|$|In 1928, {{while still}} an undergraduate, Dunham {{began to study}} ballet with Ludmilla Speranzeva, a Russian dancer who had settled in Chicago, having <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> with the Franco-Russian {{vaudeville}} troupe Le Théâtre de la Chauve-Souris directed by impresario Nikita Balieff. She also studied ballet with Mark Turbyfill and Ruth Page, who became prima ballerina of the Chicago Opera. Through her ballet teachers, she was also exposed to Spanish, East Indian, Javanese, and Balinese dance forms. In 1931, {{when she was only}} 21, Dunham formed a group called Ballets Nègres, one of the first black ballet companies in the United States. After a single, well-received performance in 1931, the group was disbanded. Encouraged by Speranzeva to focus on modern dance instead of ballet, Dunham opened her first real dance school in 1933 called the Negro Dance Group. It was a venue for Dunham to teach young black dancers about their African heritage.|$|E
