Building <b>corporate</b> <b>memories</b> for conserving and sharing knowledge has become a rather common practice. However, we often forget that the efficiency of these activities is strictly connected to the appropriation capacities and learning of the organizational actors. It is through this learning that new skills can be acquired.

40|$|Knowledge {{management}} (KM) systems manipulate organizational {{knowledge by}} storing and redistributing <b>corporate</b> <b>memories</b> that are acquired from the organization's members. In this paper, we introduce a textual casebased reasoning (TCBR) framework for KM systems that manipulates organizational knowledge embedded in artifacts (e. g., best practices, alerts, lessons learned). The TCBR approach acquires knowledge from human users (via knowledge elicitation) and from text documents (via knowledge extraction) using template-based information extraction methods, {{a subset of}} natural language, and a domain ontology. Organizational knowledge is stored in a case base and is distributed {{in the context of}} targeted processes (i. e., within external distribution systems). The knowledge artifacts in the case base have to be translated into the format of the external distribution systems. A domain ontology supports knowledge elicitation and extraction, storage of knowledge artifacts in a case base, and artifact translation...|$|R

CO 4 is presented here as addressing three claims about corporate memory: (1) it must be formalised to the greatest possible extent so that its semantics is clear and its manipulation can be automated; (2) it cannot be totally formalised and thus formal and informal knowledge must be organised such that they refer to each other; (3) in order to be useful, it must be accepted by the people involved (providers and users) and thus must be non contradictory and consensual.

40|$|Communities of {{practice}} [...] groups of individuals {{interested in a}} particular job, procedure, or work domain [...] informally swap insights on work-related tasks, often through quick chats by the water cooler. They act as <b>corporate</b> <b>memories,</b> transfer best practice, provide mechanisms for situated learning, and act as foci for innovation. 1, 2 Increasingly, organizations are harnessing communities {{of practice}} to carry out important knowledge management functions. 3 However, a significant first step is identifying the community, which often doesn?t designate itself as such, and its members, who don?t know they belong? So, this step involves determining which people {{in a community of}} practice have common interests in particular practices or functions and producing sets or clusters of related individuals. Community identification traditionally demands heavy resources and often includes extensive interviewing. In this article, we describe Ontocopi (Ontology-Based Community of Practice Identifier), a tool to help identify communities. Ontocopi lets you infer the informal relations that define a community of practice from the presence of more formal relations. For instance, if A and B have no formal relation but they have both authored papers with C (formal relation), they might share interests (informal relation). Because Ontocopi works in this way, we cannot claim without qualification that it identifies communities of practice. Significant informal relations might have little or no connection to the formal ones. Here, we refer to the networks uncovered by Ontocopi as COPs and to informal social networks as communities of practice. We work under the assumption that COPs are sometimes decent proxies for communities of practice...|$|R

Many of the variables may interact in complicated ways, making determination of strategic action difficult. This paper introduces a new method for mining knowledge from historical company data we call "IC mapping". IC mapping attempts to crystallize a database of historical company data into a 3 D map. Using the map, managers can examine the surrounding company landscape, view past progress as a trajectory across the landscape, anticipate future location, and calculate what parameters need to be changed to reach new locations. We argue that IC maps provide an excellent knowledge management tool for supporting historical data analysis, path planning, and what-if analysis. Topic a.

Just like the web evolved from a text-based system to a web of multimedia and online services, intrawebs now include multimedia resources and, for instance, corporate forms moved from online static copies to dynamic front-ends of web applications directly linked to the corporate information system. Even latest web tools meet application scenarios on corporate webs: wikis can be used to edit and maintain corporate documents and directories in a very simple way, blogs can be used for news and technological watch, web services are being used to allow enterprise application integration and workflow management, semantic web frameworks are used for information and data integration and exchanges for instance to materialize <b>corporate</b> <b>memories</b> as <b>corporate</b> semantic webs, etc.Intrawebs are webs dedicated to the community of a corporation. Being on a private network of the company, intrawebs can include a whole family of applications that could not be made available on the public web for confidentiality reasons: corporate applications. The corporation is an existing community that needs to set up and maintain collaboration to attain professional objectives. Web technologies propose shared application supporting communities of practice, of interest, and more generally speaking, knowledge management. They can support collaborations: synchronous communication, expert matching, internal FAQ, collaborative document edition, case-based memories, project management, workflows, etc. Within a company the existence of such community and of its shared professional interests makes the intraweb a selected place to develop and experiment new web-based solutions.Historically {{there has always been a}} synergy between World Wide Web evolutions and intra-webs experiments. Many evolutions of the World Wide Web have been adopted and used in internal webs and, vice versa, many local initiatives on intrawebs turned out to be seeds of new web applications.|$|R

40|$|Organizational Memory Studies (OMS) {{is limited}} by its managerialist, presentist preoccupation with the utility of memory for {{knowledge}} management. The dominant model of memory in OMS {{is that of a}} storage bin. But this model has been rejected by psychologists because it overlooks the distinctly human subjective experience of remembering, i. e. episodic memory. OMS also fails to take account of the specific social and historical contexts of organizational memory. The methodological individualism that is prevalent in OMS makes it difficult to engage with the rapidly expanding sociological and historical literature in social memory studies, where a more social constructionist approach to ‘collective memory’ is generally favoured. However, for its part social memory studies derived from Maurice Halbwachs neglects organizations, focusing primarily on the nation as a mnemonic community. From a critical perspective organizations can be seen as appropriating society’s <b>memory</b> through <b>corporate</b> sites of <b>memory</b> such as historical visitor attractions and corporate museums. There is scope for a sociological and historical reorientation within OMS, drawing on social memory studies and focusing on <b>corporate</b> sites of <b>memory,</b> such as The Henry Ford museum complex, as well as the mnemonic role of founders and beginnings in organizations. Taking a social constructionist, collectivist approach to social remembering in organizations allows connections to be made between memory and other research programmes, such as organizational culture studies...|$|R
