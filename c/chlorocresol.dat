40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{defect in}} the ryanodine (Ry 1) {{receptor}} Ca 2 + channel has been implicated {{as one of the}} possible underlying causes of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a pharmacogenetic disorder characterized by sustained muscle contracture. The disease is triggered by common halogenated anesthetics and skeletal muscle relaxants, such as succinylcholine. This study tested whether the functional properties of the Ry 1 receptor Ca 2 + channel are affected by <b>chlorocresol,</b> a preservative added to a commercial preparation of succinylcholine (Midarine) and other parenteral compounds. METHODS: In vitro contracture testing was carried out on muscle biopsies from malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS) and -negative (MHN) individual according to the protocol of the European MH group. Ca 2 + flux studies on isolated rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum fractions were measured spectrophotometrically by following the A 710 - 790 of the Ca 2 + indicator antipyrylazo III. RESULTS: <b>Chlorocresol</b> causes muscle contracture in MHS muscles at a concentration of 25 - 50 microM and potentiates the caffeine contracture response in human MHS muscles. Sub-threshold (20 microM) concentrations of <b>chlorocresol</b> increase both the Kd and the Vmax of caffeine-induced Ca 2 + release from isolated rabbit terminal cisternae. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in muscle from MHS individuals, the enhanced Ca 2 + released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum may not be due to the effect of succinylcholine alone but rather to the action of the preservative <b>chlorocresol</b> added to the drug...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to verify}} the effect of {{physically}} removing the outer surface of contaminated concrete on total contents and on potential mobility of pollutants by means of leaching tests. Reclaimed concrete from 3 industrial sites in Sweden were included: A tar impregnated military storage, a military tar track-depot, as well as concrete constructions used for disposing of pesticide production surplus and residues. Solid materials and leachates from batch and column leaching tests were analysed for metals, Cl, F, SO 4, DOC and contents of suspected organic compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAH, and pesticides/substances for pesticide production such as phenoxy acids, chlorophenols and <b>chlorocresols,</b> respectively). In case of PAH contaminated concrete, results indicate that removing 1 or 5 mm of the surface lead to total concentrations below the Swedish guidelines for recycling of aggregates and soil in groundwork constructions. 3 out of 4 concrete samples contaminated with pesticides fulfilled Swedish guidelines for contaminated soil. Results from batch and column leaching tests indicated, however, that concentrations above environmental quality standards for certain PAH and phenoxy acids, respectively, might occur at site when the crushed concrete is recycled in groundwork constructions. As leaching tests engaged in the study deviated from leaching test standards with {{a limited number of}} samples, the potential impact of the leaching tests' equipment on measured PAH and pesticide leachate concentrations has to be evaluated in future work...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were (1) {{to study the}} cancer risks in Swedish {{pesticide}} applicators, {{which is one of}} the occupational groups that is most exposed to pesticides in Sweden. This could be done by utilizing a complete register kept by the Swedish Board of Agriculture which include 20, 245 subjects with licenses issued between 1965 and 1976, for epidemiological studies. This was possible by linkage between different registers and identifying cancer cases in the Swedish Cancer Register; (2) to compare cancer risk in farmers- an occupational group with a similar life style, but with less use of pesticides; (3) to study the effect of use of protective equipment as regards cancer risk when handling pesticides; (4) to update and perform a critical analysis of the overall risk of cancer after occupational use of pesticides; (5) to study the use and composition of phenoxy acid herbicides in Sweden. This is of significant value because phenoxy acid herbicides have been used to a great extent for several decades, and are thought to be risk factors of malignant lymphoma (Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), and soft tissue sarcoma; (6) test the hypothesis that exposure to phenoxy acid herbicides and chlorophenols is a risk factor of malignant lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma. Studies on the risk of cancer after exposure to pesticides were reviewed concerning epidemiological and experimental animal studies. It was found that further epidemiological studies with detailed exposure assessment for individual pesticides were needed, taking into consideration work practices, use of protective equipment, and other measures to reduce risk (Paper I). Calculations of the total composition of commercial phenoxy acid herbicides purchased Sweden from the late 1940 s and onwards have been performed. It was found that the estimated sales increased until the early 1980 s and Swedish studies had previously found that old formulations mainly of 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxy acetic acid contained toxic dioxins such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetra- chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, as well as chlorophenols, <b>chlorocresols</b> and dimethylnitrosamines in some products (Paper II). Register studies using the pesticide applicator cohort with a random sample of the cohort and then regarding inquires on the use of pesticides and protective equipment, tobacco habits, and occupations during the 1950 s, 1960 s, and 1970 s were analyzed for risk of malignant lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma. Although there was rather poor use of protective equipment during pesticide application during the 1950 s and 1960 s these studies with a mean observation time of 13. 9 and 12. 2 years, respectively, and corresponding person- years 282, 000 and 248, 000 of follow-up could not find any increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma or non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. and found only a non-significant increased risk of Hodgkin's disease (Papers III and IV). The overall risk of cancer was analyzed on the same cohort and a statistically significant decreased risk was found. Significantly decreased risks were also found for liver, pancreas, lung, and kidney cancers. No significant increase in risk was found. Higher risks for pesticide applicators than for agricultural workers were found for testicular cancer, tumors of the nervous system and endocrine glands, and for Hodgkin's disease (Paper V). The unclear etiology of the increasing incidence of prostate cancer worldwide has provoked much attention and several incidence and mortality studies have found an association between farming and prostate cancer. This study, a follow-up study of Swedish pesticide applicators until 1991, found a statistically significant increase in risk of prostate cancer compared with the general population (Paper VI). The aim of the case-control study was to test the hypothesis that occupational exposure to phenoxy acid herbicides is a risk factor for malignant lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma and that the use of protective equipment would reduce the risk of cancer. The case- control study was performed nested within the cohort of Swedish pesticide applicators. No increased risk due to the use of phenoxy acid herbicides was found, but a striking finding was that cases wore protective equipment considerably less often than controls and that poor protection increased the risk of malignant lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma compared to nonusers of phenoxy acid herbicides. CONCLUSION. This thesis concludes that no evidence of association between the use of any pesticide and increased risk for malignant lymphoma or soft tissue sarcoma, or other cancers was found, but supports the recommendation that protective equipment should be worn in order to minimize the uptake of potentially dangerous pesticides...|$|R

40|$|An axenic amastigote culture {{system was}} {{utilized}} to directly assess the stage-specific antileishmanial effects of antimony on amastigotes of Leishmania donovani devoid of the macrophage host cell. Pentostam, which contains antimony {{in the form}} of sodium stibogluconate and the preservative <b>chlorocresol,</b> was used. Cell density was quantified by measuring the activity of the stable enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Dose-response curve analyses show that Leishmania promastigotes are susceptible to Pentostam, with the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) being 104 microg/ml, while amastigotes are more susceptible, with the IC 50 being 24 microg/ml. Promastigotes and amastigotes are also susceptible to <b>chlorocresol,</b> with IC 50 s being 1. 27 and 1. 82 microg/ml, respectively. Given that promastigotes are insensitive to antimony, these results suggest that the increased susceptibility of amastigotes to Pentostam is due to the stage-specific activity of sodium stibogluconate. To further study this phenomenon, spontaneous resistance to Pentostam was induced in L. donovani promastigotes by increasing the concentration of Pentostam in the growth medium in a stepwise fashion. Two mutants, Ld 1 S. 04 and Ld 1 S. 20, grew at 0. 4 and 2. 0 mg of Pentostam per ml, respectively. Promastigotes of these mutants were 11 and 21 times, respectively, more resistant to Pentostam than the wild type. Amastigotes were 40 and 148 times, respectively, more resistant than the wild type. The mutants were also <b>chlorocresol</b> resistant; promastigotes were 6 and 9 times, respectively, more resistant than the wild type, and amastigotes were 14 and 35 times, respectively, more resistant than the wild type. These data show that resistance to Pentostam induced in antimony-insensitive promastigotes is manifested in amastigotes as resistance both to pentavalent antimony and to <b>chlorocresol.</b> The axenic amastigote system is a unique tool which enables direct evaluation of the activity of antileishmanial compounds on the amastigote devoid of its host cell...|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} effect on the leakage of low {{molecular}} weight cytoplasmic constituents from Staphylococcus aureus using phenolics singly and in combination, and to see if the observations could be modelled using a non-linear dose response. Methods and Results: The rate of potassium, phosphate and adenosine triphosphate leakage was examined in the presence of <b>chlorocresol</b> and m-cresol. Individually, leakage was observed only at long contact times or high concentrations. Combined at these ineffective concentrations, the cytoplasmic pool of all constituents studied was released within minutes. Both <b>chlorocresol</b> and m-cresol were shown to have non-linear dose responses. A rate model for the combinations, which takes account of these non-linear responses, accurately predicted the observations. Conclusions: Antimicrobials, which when used alone exhibit a non-linear dose response, will also give a non-linear dose response in combination. The simple linear-additive model ignores the concept of the dilution coefficient and will always describe the phenomenon of synergy for combinations where {{one or more of the}} components has a dilution coefficient greater than one. This has been borne out by examination of the purported prime lesion of <b>chlorocresol</b> and m-cresol, alone and in combination. Significance and Impact of the Study: Studies aimed at producing synergistic mixtures of antimicrobials, which ignore the non-linear additive effect, may waste valuable research effort looking for a physiological explanation for an apparent synergy, where none, in-fact, exists. Patents granted on the basis of analyses using the linear-additive model for combinations of compounds with non-linear dose responses may no longer be supportable...|$|E

Using primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures, the CBF was recorded with a computerized microscope photometry system and a high-speed digital imaging system. To obtain a wide range of frequencies, glycocholate (0. 5 %) and <b>chlorocresol</b> (0. 005 %) were used as ciliostimulatory and cilio-inhibitory reference compounds, respectively. The mean values in hertz (+/- s. d.) obtained with the photometry and high-speed digital imaging systems were: controls 8. 2 +/- 0. 9 and 7. 9 +/- 1. 1; <b>chlorocresol</b> 5. 0 +/- 0. 9 and 5. 1 +/- 1. 1; glycocholate 9. 8 +/- 1. 0 and 9. 7 +/- 0. 8. A similar increase (by 20 and 24 %) and decrease (by 38 and 35 %) in CBF was determined by the two methods after glycocholate and <b>chlorocresol</b> treatment, respectively. The mean difference between the photometry and high-speed digital imaging methods was 0. 2 +/- 0. 6 Hz, and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were from - 1. 0 to + 1. 4 Hz, suggesting that the results obtained by these two methods could be used interchangeably. These results show the reliability of the high-speed digital imaging system and the software developed for in-vitro CBF measurements.

In skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, 4 -chloro-m-cresol was found to be a potent activator of Ca 2 + release mediated by a ruthenium red/caffeine-sensitive Ca 2 + release channel. In cerebellar microsomes, this compound released Ca 2 + from an inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate-insensitive store, suggesting that there too it was acting at the ryanodine receptor level.

40|$|PURPOSE: To test two {{in vitro}} human nasal {{epithelial}} cell culture systems {{for their ability}} to screen the effects of pharmaceutical compounds on ciliary beating. METHODS: Human nasal epithelial cells were cultured as monolayer and in a sequential monolayer-suspension culture with in vitro ciliogenesis. The influence of reference cilio-stimulatory compounds (glycocholate, isoprenaline), reference cilio-inhibitory compounds (<b>chlorocresol,</b> diphenhydramine) and pH on ciliary beating was investigated using computerized microscope photometry. RESULTS: Sodium glycocholate (0. 5 % w/v) maximally and reversibly increased CBF of the cells in both culture systems by 26 +/- 4 % (monolayer) and 18 +/- 6 % (suspension). Similarly, isoprenaline (10 (- 3) M) maximally, but irreversibly increased CBF of the cells by 14 +/- 3 % (monolayer) and 17 +/- 4 % (suspension). <b>Chlorocresol</b> (0. 005 % w/ v) reversibly reduced the CBF of the cells by 50 +/- 6 % (monolayer) and 34 +/- 4 % (suspension); at a higher concentration (0. 1 % w/v) it resulted in instantaneous and irreversible ciliostasis. Diphenhydramine (0. 1 % w/v) reversibly reduced CBF in both culture systems by 45 +/- 13 % (monolayer) and 69 +/- 5 % (suspension); irreversible cilio-stasis occurred in less than 2 minutes in both culture systems upon cell exposure to diphenhydramine (1. 0 % w/v). In the monolayer culture system, CBF was stable only within the physiological pH range of 6. 5 - 8. 0; ciliary beating in the suspension culture remained stable within a pH range of 4. 0 - 10. 0. CONCLUSIONS: Both cell culture systems are suitable for screening the effects of pharmaceutical compounds on ciliary beating.

40|$|PURPOSE: Explore the {{usefulness}} of a perfusion system {{in order to establish}} human nasal epithelial cell cultures suitable for long-term in vitro ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and cilio-toxicity studies. METHODS: The cells were obtained by protease digestion of nasal biopsy material. The cells were plated at a density of 0. 8 - 1 x 10 (6) /cm 2 on Vitrogen-coated polyethylene terephthalate membranes, and cultured under submerged conditions in a CO 2 incubator or in a perfusion system (initiated on days 8 - 9 after plating). The CBF was determined at 24. 1 +/- 0. 8 degrees C by a computerized microscope photometry system. The morphology of the cultured cells was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: Under CO 2 incubator culture conditions, stable ciliary activity was expressed and maintained from day 2 to day 24. Under perfusion system culture conditions, the CBF (mean+/-S. D., n = 4) amounted to 8. 4 +/- 0. 9 and 8. 8 +/- 0. 4 Hz on days 7 and 14, respectively. These values were lower as compared to the corresponding CBF obtained in the CO 2 incubator cultures (9. 5 +/- 0. 6 and 9. 9 +/- 1. 0 Hz, respectively). Reference cilio-stimulatory (glycocholate) and cilio-inhibitory (<b>chlorocresol)</b> compounds were used to assess CBF reactivity. In the CO 2 incubator and 7 - and 14 -days perfusion system cultures, glycocholate (0. 5 %) showed a reversible cilio-stimulatory effect of 23, 26 and 21 %, respectively, while <b>chlorocresol</b> (0. 005 %) exerted a reversible cilio-inhibitory effect of 36, 40 and 36 %, respectively.

40|$|As the EU ban on {{conventional}} cages (1999 EU-directive) drew closer, most European countries moved towards alternative systems.

Accordingly, recent reports have unanimously shown that prevalence of round worm infection, in particular Ascaridia galli has increased dramatically. Although management practices have shown to be somehow efficient with regard to parasite control in caged system, at this time there is no effective way to prevent and eliminate the existing parasite in non-caged system. For better understanding the infection dynamics of A. galli a series of experiments was carried out to study the environmental factors (temperature, relative humidity, pH and oxygen) influencing the fate of A. galli eggs within the environment. In addition, two more experiments were run to evaluate the efficacy of thiabendazole and commercial broad spectrum disinfectant <b>Chlorocresol</b> (Interkokask). Survivability of the eggs {{with regard to the}} age of the parasite eggs was investigated as well.

40|$|A stability-indicating {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic method with on-line clean-up {{has been}} developed {{for the analysis of}} betamethasone 17 -valerate in topical dosage forms. A short pre-column containing 10 μm octadecylsilane mounted into the sample loop position of an injection valve was used as the primary clean-up step. The utilization of a diode-array UV detector allowed the quantitative analysis of betamethasone 17 -valerate together with its degradation product, betamethasone 21 -valerate, as well as the qualitative analysis of these compounds, relevant internal standards and the preservatives <b>chlorocresol</b> and methyl hydroxybenzoate contained in the cream and lotion formulations, respectively. Typically, cream and lotion dosage forms were dissolved in acetonitrile and ointments in tetrahydrofuran, internal standards added and aliquots injected onto the analytical system. Dosage form excipients were retained on the loop column and back-flushed to waste {{with the aid of a}} second solvent pump while components of interest were allowed to transfer to the analytical column for quantitative analysis. The method is accurate, precise and stability indicating and permits the rapid on-line analysis of betamethasone 17 -valerate from complex topical formulation matrices without prior extractions...|$|E
40|$|A simple, specific, {{and precise}} {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic method is developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of <b>chlorocresol</b> (CC), mometasone furoate (MF), and fusidic acid (FA) in a cream formulation. The isocratic mobile phase consists of 1. 5 % w/v aqueous ammonium acetate buffer–acetonitrile, 55 : 45 (v/v) of pH 3. 8. The column contains octylsilyl chemically bonded to porous silica particle (Symmetry C 8, 150 × 3. 9 mm, 5 µm). The detection {{is carried out}} using variable wavelength UV–vis detector set at 240 nm. The solutions are chromatographed at a steady flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. The current method separates CC, MF, and FA in less than 8 min with good resolution and peak shapes, minimal tailing, and with retention factors between approximately 1 and 5. Linearity range and percent recoveries for CC, MF, and FA are 10 – 30, 10 – 30, and 200 – 600 µg/mL; and 100. 31 %, 100. 38 %, and 100. 34 %, respectively. The method is validated according to International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and proven to be suitable for stability testing, content uniformity testing, and quality control of these compounds in pharmaceutical preparations...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of the synthetic glucocorticosteroid betamethasone under UVB light was studied both in vitro (water and methanol solution and in topical and injectable commercial formulations) and ex vivo (pig skin). From irradiated methanol solutions three main photoproducts were isolated by HPLC and TLC and characterized by NMR/MS analyses. The modifications involve parts of the molecule peculiar for the therapeutic activity, that is, rearrangement of ring A ("lumi"- and "photolumiderivatives"), and Norrish Type I fragmentation of the ketolic chain ("androderivative"). Two clinically used esters of betamethasone were also studied, namely the 17 -valerate and 21 -phosphate, and their photoproducts identified. The HPLC method developed for the photolysis studies in solution was also applied {{to the analysis of}} commercial formulations. In a cream and a solution for parenteral use, betamethasone highly decomposed under UVB irradiation, even {{in the presence of the}} bactericidal agents <b>chlorocresol</b> and phenol, which are able to absorb part of the incoming radiation. As a model for the UV exposed skin to which the drug is applied, ex vivo pig skin was used; not only the yield of photodegradation was evaluated, but the photoproducts were also identified. A test on THP- 1 cells demonstrated the loss of anti-inflammatory activity of betamethasone, when modified by UVB light...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the extraction method employed in traditional herbal medicine by comparing the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of the leaf extracts of Piliostigma reticulatum and Piliostigma thonningii. The suitability of the two species as substitute was also determined. The agar dilution method was employed to compare the activity of crude leaf extracts of the two species against sixty bacterial and fungal isolates selected from diverse genera. The antimicrobial spectra of the extracts from both species were very similar. In 44 (73. 3 %) of the test strains, MIC values for the two extracts were identical and in 6 (10. 0 %) the MIC values differed by only one dilution factor. <b>Chlorocresol</b> was used as standard. The crude extract and solvent fractions obtained from the leaf of P. reticulatum were evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity using the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema model. The aqueous fraction at 100 mg kg 1 produced the highest inhibition of oedema (61. 2 %), while the crude extract at 100 mg kg 1 exerted a low anti-inflammatory effect (13. 2 %). Indomethacin at 5 mg kg 1 inhibited oedema by 86. 2 %. This study has established that P. reticulatum and P. thonningii have similar antimicrobial spectra and anti-inflammatory activity. The traditional extraction method is not effective in extracting the antimicrobial agents from the plants...|$|E
40|$|A stability-indicating reverse phase-HPLC {{method has}} been {{developed}} and validated for the simultaneous determination of Clobetasol propionate (CLOB) and <b>Chlorocresol</b> (CHLOR) in pharmaceutical dosage form (cream). Beclomethasone dipropionate monohydrate (BEC) was used as internal standard. The column (Luna) C 18 (250 mm × 4. 6 mm, 5 μm particle size) was used for chromatographic separation. The gradient elution system was performed using mobile phase A: Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate pH 4. 5 and methanol in the ratio of 80 : 30 respectively, and Acetonitrile as mobile phase B. The flow rate was adjusted to 1. 5 ml/min. The column oven was set at 25 °C and the detection wavelength at 240 nm. The retention times of CHLOR, CLOB and BEC {{were found to be}} 8. 86 min, 13. 36 min and 15. 6 min respectively. The linearity was performed in the concentration ranges of 64. 0 - 96. 0 μg/ml (CHLOR), 32. 0 - 48. 0 μg/ml (CLOB), and 80 μg/ml (BEC) with squared correlation coefficient of 0. 9995 and 0. 9996 for CHLOR and CLOB respectively. The percentage purity of CHLOR and CLOB was found to be > 99. 5 %. The analytical method has been validated for specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, ruggedness and robustness which were found to be within the acceptance limit according to ICH guidelines. The developed method was successfully employed for routine and stability analysis of CHLOR and CLOB in pharmaceutical cream...|$|E
40|$|To {{develop an}} in vitro system to {{simultaneously}} assess transport through the human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) {{and the effect}} on ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Cells were grown in ThinCertTM tissue culture inserts in 12 -well Cellstar® cell culture plates. The membrane consisted of transparent polyethylene terephthalate (3 µm pores) and was coated with collagen. The cell number was determined using a Bürker chamber and 1 - 1. 3 * 106 cells were plated in each ThinCertTM. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Five days after plating, HNEC formed microscopically confluent layers. Transport experiments were performed on day 10 or 11. Transport was assessed for 3 compounds: atenolol (paracellular transport), talinolol (P-glycoprotein substrate) and propranolol (transcellular transport). Concentrations were determined by HPLC (fluorescence detection). Data for CBF calculation were collected using an inverted microscope coupled with a high-speed digital camera; 1054 images were captured during 2 seconds. CBF values were determined for each pixel site separately by spectral analysis of the variation of the pixel intensity over time. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) {{was applied to the}} intensity signal and CBF was computed as the frequency corresponding to the maximal FFT amplitude value in the range from 0 to 20 Hz. Viability of cells obtained by enzymatic dissociation from nasal biopsies ranged from 91. 8 % to 97. 1 %. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) increased as a function of time in culture and reached a plateau level after 7 - 9 days. Transport inserts with TEER values over the cell layer below 600 &[Omega]. cm 2 were excluded from transport experiments. Absorptive apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) values amounted to 0. 3 ± 0. 2, 0. 6 ± 0. 2 and 16 ± 5 x 10 - 6 cm/s for atenolol, talinolol and propranolol, respectively, illustrating the ability of the system to discriminate between compounds with different transport properties. No statistically significant differences in CBF could be observed when measuring CBF at defined days in culture. Inclusion of <b>chlorocresol</b> (0. 01 %) decreased CBF (to 55 %), but did not alter transport. For the first time, a system was developed in which the effect of compounds on CBF could be followed simultaneously with transport through the HNEC layer. This system could become an interesting tool to study drug candidates for nasal administration. status: publishe...|$|E
