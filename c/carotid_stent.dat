The FDA has approved 7 <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> systems as safe and effective in patients at increased risk of complications for carotid surgery and 1 <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> system for patients at average or usual risk of carotid surgery. The SAPPHIRE study of patients at high surgical risk for carotid surgery demonstrated non-inferiority for carotid stenting compared to carotid surgery. The CREST trial, the largest trial comparing carotid surgery to carotid stenting in over 2,500 patients found that carotid artery stenting resulted in a stroke rate of 6.4% versus 4.7% for endarterectomy at 4 years. However, carotid endarterectomy {{was associated with a}} slightly higher rate of myocardial infarction {{around the time of the}} procedure (2.3% versus 1.1%). Although the study's composite index including death, stroke, and myocardial infarction is not significantly different between the two groups, myocardial infarction was associated with less impact on quality of life as compared with stroke at one year.|$|E
5000|$|The largest {{clinical}} trial performed, CREST, randomized patients {{at risk for}} a stroke from carotid artery blockage to either open surgery (carotid endarterectomy) or <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> placement with embolic protection. This trial followed patients for 4 years and found no overall difference in the primary end point of both treatment arms (myocardial infarctions, any perioperative strokes or ipsilateral strokes within 4 years, or death during procedure). Patients assigned to the surgical arm experienced more perioperative myocardial infarctions compared to the stenting group; however, {{the difference was not}} statistically significant (6.8% vs or 7.2% HR for stenting is 1.1 CI 0.81-1.51 P value 0.51) whereas patients assigned to the <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> arm experienced more periprocedural strokes compared to endarteretomy (6.4% vs 4.7% HR for stenting 1.5 P-0.03). There was no mortality difference and no difference for major (disabling) strokes between surgery and stenting. It was noted that there did seem to exist an age cutoff where below 75 years old endarterectomy provided more positive outcomes and over 75 stenting offered a better risk profile. However, {{it should be noted that}} the CREST trial was not designed for subgroup analysis and thus not powered enough to draw any statistically significant conclusions. [...] A later study published in 2013 evaluated how these perioperative complications affect long-term survival. This study showed that experiencing a stroke within the first year conferred a two-fold lower survival rate (Hazard Ratio(HR) 6.6 3.7-12) than those who experienced a perioperative myocardial infarction at two years post intervention (HR 3.6 2-6.8). This difference in mortality, however, converges and becomes negligible at 5 years (HR 2.7 1.7-4.3 vs HR 2.8 1.8-4.3).

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Carotid</b> artery <b>stenting</b> (CAS) is a {{worldwide}} diffuse intervention, {{but may be}} associated with distal plaque component embolization, and sometimes major and minor stroke. Statin use has been demonstrated to reduce atherosclerotic plaque burden, but its effect in reducing distal embolization during <b>carotid</b> <b>stenting</b> has not yet been well validated. AIMS: With the Rosuvastatin Pretreatment to Reduce Embolization during <b>Carotid</b> Artery <b>Stenting</b> trial, we aim to discover if a pretreatement with high doses of rosuvastatin in dyslipidemic patients is able to reduce periprocedural cerebral ischemic complications following <b>carotid</b> <b>stenting.</b> METHODS: This is a phase III prospective, randomized controlled trial. All consecutive patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis at least 80 % will be randomized to a 6 -week rosuvastatin treatment followed by <b>carotid</b> <b>stenting,</b> and to direct <b>carotid</b> <b>stenting.</b> <b>Carotid</b> <b>stenting</b> will be performed following common practice with distal or proximal embolic protection. The primary efficacy end point of the trial will be the prevalence of 'relevant' embolization during CAS, as a surrogate end point for cerebral ischemic complications.

40|$|SUMMARY: This report {{describes}} {{the cases of}} 2 patients with failed retrieval of an AngioGuard distal protection device after <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> placement with rescue retrieval by use of a vertebral catheter. An AngioGuard was deployed before carotid angioplasty and stent placement. Attempted removal of the device with the provided recapture sheath was unsuccessful. A 5 F 120 -cm vertebral catheter was used to recapture and remove the AngioGuard. This technique is a simple and readily available solution for the retrieval of failed removal of a protection device. Symptomatic carotid stenosis is a disease process that hasbeen traditionally treated with carotid endarterectomy and {{has been shown to}} be superior to medical management (the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study). 1, 2 The first reported placement of a <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> was performed in the mid- 1990 s, 3 but <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> placement has truly come into the realmof treatment of carotid artery disease with the advent of self-expanding stents and distal protection devices. In 2004, the SAPPHIRE trial was published, suggest-ing that <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> placement is at least equivalent to carotid endarterectomy in the measured outcomes of death, stroke, andmyocardial infarction for the high-risk patient population enrolled in the study. 4 Recently, the Precise RX microcatheter-based, self-ex-panding, nitinol stent (Cordis, Miami Lakes, Fla) received ap-proval from the US Food and Drug Administration for use in carotid stenosis. With the application of this stent placement technology combined with balloon angioplasty and the An-gioGuard (Cordis) distal protection device, this technique has allowed for the treatment of patients who are deemed at high surgical risk on the basis of their medical comorbidities. Dur-ing the recent use at our institution of the AngioGuard distal protection device in 2 patients requiring carotid angioplasty and stent placement, the manufacturer-provided retrieval de-vice failed to remove the protection device. In the cases of both of these patients, we were able to insert another sheath and remove the AngioGuard using a 5 F vertebral catheter without complication...|$|E

Methods The <b>Carotid</b> <b>Stenting</b> Trialistsâ Collaboration is a pooled individual patient database including all patients recruited in 3 randomized trials of stenting versus endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis (Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty in patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis trial, Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy trial, and International <b>Carotid</b> <b>Stenting</b> Study). Lifetime <b>carotid</b> artery <b>stenting</b> experience, lifetime experience in stenting procedures excluding the carotid, and annual number of procedures performed within the trial (in-trial volume), divided into tertiles, were used to measure operator experience. The outcome event was the occurrence of any stroke or death within 30 days of the procedure. The analysis was done per protocol. Results Among 1546 patients who underwent <b>carotid</b> artery <b>stenting,</b> 120 (7. 8 %) had a stroke or death within 30 days of the procedure. The 30 -day risk of stroke or death did not differ according to operator lifetime <b>carotid</b> artery <b>stenting</b> experience (P= 0. 8) or operator lifetime stenting experience excluding the carotid (P= 0. 7). In contrast, the 30 -day risk of stroke or death was significantly higher in patients treated by operators with low (mean â¤ 3. 2 procedures/y; risk 10. 1 %; adjusted risk ratio= 2. 30 [1. 36 â 3. 87]) and intermediate annual in-trial volumes (3. 2 â 5. 6 procedures/y; 8. 4 %; adjusted risk ratio= 1. 93 [1. 14 â 3. 27]) compared with patients treated by high annual in-trial volume operators (> 5. 6 procedures/y; 5. 1 %).

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical relevance of carotid artery stentfracture. Methods: Commercially available carotid stents were implanted in this prospective, observational study that began inJanuary 2004. Indications included asymptomatic patients (stenosis > 80 %), symptomatic patients (stenosis > 60 %), andulcerated lesions (> 50 %). Stent integrity was assessed with plain radiography at 12 months. Data were analyzed in April 2009 on a series of 341 consecutive patients treated with carotid artery stenting with at least 12 months follow-up. Results: Stent fracture prevalence was 3. 4 % at 12 months (95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 %- 6. 1 %). The median clinicalfollow-up was 30 months (range, 12 - 64 months) for 323 eligible patients. Treatment included 23. 6 % of symptomaticpatients. According to univariate analysis, calcification type III increased the odds of stent fracture by more than 4. 5 times(odds ratio [OR], 4. 74; P. 006) and angulation > 45 Â° increased the odds of stent fracture by 6. 5 times (OR, 6. 51; P. 008). <b>Carotid</b> <b>stent</b> cell type, stent length, and stent over-sizing were not correlated with stent fracture incidence.

40|$|Rapid {{arterial}} rethrombosis {{is associated}} with high-grade residual stenosis and usually occurs {{at the site of}} the initial occlusion, resulting in reocclusion of the recanalized artery.

Given that glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockers, like tirofiban, prevent thrombus formation by inhibiting the final common pathway of platelet aggregation, they may be helpful for treating rethrombosis after thrombolysis. A 64 -year-old man presented with an acute ischemic stroke due to internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion.

We examined the prevalence and clinical significance of <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> fractures or deformations following CAS. MethodsTwo hundred thirty-one CAS performed in 219 patients at one academic institution between August 2000 and March 2009 were reviewed. One hundred sixteen stents (57 closed cell, 59 open cell) were evaluated with multiplanar plain {{films of the}} neck to assess for stent fracture or deformation. Stent fracture was identified by wire strut disruption. Deformation was defined as an increase in stent-cell area from stent strut distortion. Study endpoints included rate of stent fracture or deformation determined using KaplanâMeier and life table analysis. Factors associated with stent fracture or deformation were identified by Cox regression. Effect of stent fracture or deformation on recurrent carotid artery stenosis > 70 % requiring reintervention and postoperative stroke was studied. ResultsThere were five stent fractures (4 %) and 27 deformed stents (23 %). Rate of stent fracture or deformation was 15 % at 2 years and 50 % at 4 years. Deformations were significantly more common in open cell stents than in closed cell stents (58 % vs 5 % at 4 years, P <. 00005). Presence of calcified plaque on plain film {{was significantly associated with}} increased rate of stent fracture or deformation (P =. 0006). At median follow-up of 25 months, restenosis requiring treatment occurred in four (5 %) and late stroke in one (1 %).

Methods: Electronic and hand-searching of the published literature and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Results: Thirteen articles were published. There are 10 case reports and 3 clinical studies. There are 26 reports of fractured stems in the MAUDE database. Fifty-five cases of <b>carotid</b> <b>stent</b> fractures are reported in total. A total of 201 carotid stents were examined in the 3 studies, and the incidence of fractures was 8. 9 % (18 / 201). Fractured stents were 22 Xact, 20 Acculink, 6 Precise, 2 Exponent, 1 Nexstent, 1 Genesis, 1 Symbiot, and 2 nonspecified nitinol self-expandable stents. Twenty-seven of the treated carotid lesions were atherosclerotic, 3 restenoses after carotid endarterectomy, 2 postradiational, 1 pseudoaneurysm, and 22 lesions of unknown pathology. Calcification was reported in 15 of the 27 atherosclerotic lesions (55. 5 %). Time from implantation to fracture ranged from 0 days (fracture during implantation) to 37 months. In 55 % of the cases, stent fracture was associated with restenosis. Six patients presented with symptoms. Treatment was reported for 32 patients: 14 patients underwent de novo stent placement, 2 balloon angioplasty, 2 carotid endarterectomy, 2 bypass graft (1 vein, 1 polytetrafluoroethylene), 1 anticoagulation, and 11 patients were followed up.

40|$|Background: <b>Carotid</b> artery <b>stenting</b> is {{now used}} as an {{alternative}} to surgical endarterectomy. This study was done to assess the feasibility, safety, and immediate and late clinical outcomes in patients undergoing <b>carotid</b> <b>stenting.</b> Methods: Between July 2008 and December 2009, a total of 40 patients (20 male, mean age: 65 Â± 11 years, 19 symptomatic, and 90 % high risk for endarterectomy) underwent <b>carotid</b> artery <b>stenting</b> with different embolic protection devices and <b>carotid</b> <b>stents.</b> Thirty-seven patients had coronary artery disease. Technical success rate, stroke/death / myocardial infarction rate at 30 days, access-site complications, and contrast-induced nephropathy were assessed. For the evaluation of the influence of experience in <b>carotid</b> artery <b>stenting</b> on complications, the patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 included the first 20 treated patients and Group 2 comprised the remainder of the patients. Results: The overall technical success rate was 100 %. The cumulative in-hospital stroke death rate was 7. 5 % (n = 3 : 2 deaths and 1 major stroke). Complications were more frequent in Group 1 (2 / 20, 10 %; 2 deaths) than in Group 2 (1 / 20, 5 %; 1 major stroke), but this was not statistically significant (p value = 0. 09). No access-site complications occurred, and mild contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 3 patients (7. 5 %). No major stroke or neurological deaths occurred during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Conclusion: <b>Carotid</b> <b>stenting</b> seemed feasible and relatively safe in our experience. Advanced experience in carotid arter...|$|R
