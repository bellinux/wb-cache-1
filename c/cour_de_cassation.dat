25|$|On 20 September 1792, all {{restrictions}} regarding interracial marriage were {{repealed by}} the Revolutionary government. On 8 January 1803, a Napoleonic governmental circular forbade marriages between white males and black women, or {{black men and}} white women, although the 1804 Napoleonic code did not mention anything specific about interracial marriage. In 1806 a French court validated an interracial marriage. In 1818, the highest French court (<b>cour</b> <b>de</b> <b>cassation)</b> validated a marriage contracted in New York between a white man and a colored woman. All administrative prohibitions were canceled by a law in 1833.|$|E
25|$|A {{judiciary}} is {{a number}} of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this authority is the Supreme Court; in Australia, the High Court; in the UK, the Supreme Court; in Germany, the Bundesverfassungsgericht; and in France, the <b>Cour</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cassation.</b> For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the Council of Europe member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} events, the public {{prosecutor}} in Nîmes {{got to work}} to trace witnesses. He investigated 70, including 17 Italians, and opened 41 files leading to indictments against 17 accused, only eight of whom had previous criminal records. Charges were laid on 10 September and, {{at the request of}} the prosecutor, the <b>Cour</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cassation</b> agreed to hold the trials in Angoulême. Among the defendants was an Italian worker, Giordano, defended by M. Guillibert, a lawyer from Aix. The trial was due to open on 11 December 1893 but, due to the complexity of the case, it was not actually started until the 27 December.|$|E

25|$|Although {{war crimes}} {{committed}} during the Algerian War are amnestied in France, this was publicised by the newspapers Le Canard Enchaîné, Libération, and Le Monde, and by Michel Rocard (ex-Prime Minister) on TV (TF1 1993). Le Pen sued {{the papers and}} Michel Rocard. This affair ended in 2000 when the <b>Cour</b> <b>de</b> <b>cassation</b> (French supreme jurisdiction) concluded that it was legitimate to publish these assertions. However, because of the amnesty and the statute of limitations, {{there can be no}} criminal proceedings against Le Pen for the crimes he is alleged to have committed in Algeria. In 1995, Le Pen unsuccessfully sued Jean Dufour, regional counselor of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (French Communist Party) for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 reform, {{effective}} on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial {{to question the}} constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as question prioritaire de constitutionnalité, is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, it is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, <b>Cour</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cassation</b> for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law to be unconstitutional, this law is struck down from the law books; this decision is valid for everybody and not only for the cases at hand.|$|E

6000|$|The {{public had}} been alarmed this morning, by rumours of an {{intention}} {{on the part}} of government to declare Paris in a state of siege, which is tantamount to bringing us all under martial law. This savours more of the regime Napoleon, than of the promised liberty that was to emanate from the three days. The opposition are beginning to examine the charter, in order to ascertain what their rights are on paper: but what avails a written compact, or indeed any other compact, against the wants and wishes of those who have the power? The <b>Cour</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cassation,</b> however, is said to be composed of a majority of Carlists, and, by way of commentary on the wants of the last two years, the friends of liberty have some hopes yet from these nominees of the Bourbons! We live in a droll world, dear ----, and one scarcely knows on which side he is to look for protection, among the political weathercocks of the period. In order to comprehend the point, you will understand that a clause of the charter expressly stipulates that no one shall be condemned by any [...] "but his natural judges," [...] which clearly means that no extraordinary or unusual courts shall be established for the punishment of ordinary crimes. Now, while it is admitted that martial law brings with it military tribunals and military punishments, it is contended that there is no pretext for declaring martial law in the capital, at a moment when the power of the present government is better assured than it has been at any time since its organization. But the charter solemnly stipulates that the conscription shall be abolished, while conscripts are and have been regularly drafted yearly, ever since the signature of Louis XVIII. was affixed to the instrument.|$|E
