40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a generalization of the connected facility location problem where the clients must {{be connected to}} the open facilities via shared capacitated (tree) networks instead of independent shortest paths. This problem arises in the planning of fiber optic telecommunication access networks, for example. Given a set of clients with positive demands, a set of potential facilities with opening costs, a set of capacitated access <b>cable</b> <b>types,</b> and a core <b>cable</b> <b>type</b> of infinite capacity, one has to decide which facilities to open, how to interconnect them using a Steiner tree of infinite capacity core cables, and which access <b>cable</b> <b>types</b> to install on which potential edges such that these edges form a forest and the installed capacities suffice to simultaneously route the client demands to the open facilities via single paths. The objective is to minimize the total cost of opening facilities, building the core Steiner tree among them, and installing the access cables. In this paper, we devise a constant-factor approximation algorithm for problem instances where the access <b>cable</b> <b>types</b> obey economies of scale. In the special case where only multiples of a single <b>cable</b> <b>type</b> can be installed on the access edges, a variant of our algorithm achieves a performance guarantee of 6. 72. 1...|$|R

40|$|We study two {{versions}} of the single sink buy-at-bulk network design problem. We are given a network and a single sink, and several sources which demand a certain amount of flow to be routed to the sink. We are also given a finite set of <b>cable</b> <b>types</b> which have different cost characteristics and obey the principle of economies of scale. We wish to construct a minimum cost network to support the demands, using our given <b>cable</b> <b>types.</b> We study a natural integer program formulation of the problem, and show that its integrality gap is O(k), where k is the number of <b>cable</b> <b>types.</b> As a consequence, we also provide an O(k) -approximation algorithm...|$|R

40|$|We {{initiate}} the algorithmic study {{of an important}} but NP-hard problem that arises commonly in network design. The input consists of (1) An undirected graph with one sink node and multiple source nodes, a specified length for each edge, and a specified demand, dem v, for each source node v. (2) A small set of <b>cable</b> <b>types,</b> where each <b>cable</b> <b>type</b> is specified by its capacity and its cost per unit length. The cost per unit capacity per unit length of a high-capacity cable may be significantly {{less than that of}} a low-capacity cable, reflecting an economy of scale, i. e., the payoff for buying at bulk may be very high. The goal is to design a minimum-cost network that can (simultaneously) route all the demands at the sources to the sink, by installing zero or more copies of each <b>cable</b> <b>type</b> on each edge of the graph. An additional restriction is that the demand of each source must follow a single path. The problem is to find a route from each source node to the sink and to assign ca [...] ...|$|R

Saddle-shaped cable net is {{a new type of}} large-span prestressed structure, but there is little study on the impact of different <b>cable</b> <b>types</b> on the mechanical properties of saddle-shaped cable net during the construction. In order to meet the thought of integration of design and construction, a finite element model of saddle-shaped cable net has been established. The four <b>types</b> of <b>cables</b> such as semi-parallel steel tendon cable, steel wire rope cable, steel strand cable and full-locked coil rope are chosen.

50|$|Several {{other types}} of wiring systems are used for {{building}} wiring in the United States; these include corrugated metal armored cable, mineral-insulated <b>cable,</b> other <b>types</b> of power <b>cable,</b> and various <b>types</b> of electrical conduit.

Special wiring rules apply to wet or corrosive locations, and to locations which present an explosion hazard.

40|$|Abstract—Many models {{proposed}} in the literature to describe low-voltage power distribution networks in consumer premises as communication media require knowledge of the electrical parame-ters of the cables comprising these networks. These parameters are nevertheless affected by {{a large number of}} factors which may vary greatly from case to case, making it thus very difficult to achieve an exact estimation about them. In this work, a study of the elec-trical parameters of two <b>cable</b> <b>types</b> widely used in residential low-voltage power distribution networks is presented. Moreover, a fi-nite-element approach is used for the verification {{of the results of the}} theoretical model concerning the series impedance per unit length of the <b>cable</b> <b>type</b> under study with respect to its normal op-erational conditions.

40|$|Polychaete annelids {{collected}} in San Quintin Bay were analyzed. Thir- ty-nine stations were sampled with a geological <b>type</b> <b>corer</b> in December 1992, in depths of 2 to 6 m. A total of 677 polychaetes (17 families, 28 genera and 32 species) were recognized. Sixteen species and four genera were recorded {{for the first}} time in the area. The best represented families were: Syllidae (124 speci- mens), Lumbrineridae (100), Flabelligeridae (75), Nereididae (74), Cossuridae (73), Spionidae (58), Capitellidae (49), Cirratulidae (44) and Maldanidae (29). The most abundant species were Scoletoma tetraura, Brada villosa, Cossura Can- dida, Neanthes acuminata, Pionosyllis sp., Notomastus sp., Exogone lourei, Prion- ospio heterobranchia, Chaetozone sp. and Exogone dispar. The eastern arm of San Quintin Bay presented slightly higher values of species richness and polychaete abundances. Of the 28 families previously reported for this lagoon, 17 were found and the families Trichobranchidae and Apistobran- chidae are added. To date, there are 81 polychaete species, belonging to 30 fam- ilies, reported from San Quintin Bay...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to minimize the emissions of electromagnetic fields {{to assure that the}} electrical equipment work properly. This thesis examines how to minimize electromagnetic fields with different <b>cable</b> <b>types</b> and placing of the cables. The cables are intended to be used in a hybrid heavy duty vehicle, for 600 V DC. Three different <b>cable</b> <b>types</b> was examined, one unshielded type, one shielded type and one type with two conductors with a common shield. The emissions of electric field from the cables were measured separately from the magnetic field emissions. The results of the measurements show that the electric field emissions are minimized by a shielded cable. The unshielded cables have a difference of 8 dBμV to the shielded cables at 0. 15 MHz, and at 0. 60 MHz is the difference increased to 18 dBμV. The magnetic field emissions are not affected by the <b>cable</b> <b>type</b> it is only affected by the placing of the cables. At 10 A is the magnetic field 28 μT when the cables are placed with 5 cm between them. When the cables have no distance between them the magnetic field is cancelled. Both the electric field and the magnetic field are minimized by a placing of the cables with no distance between them. If the cables are placed next to a grounded girder the electric field emissions is lowered with about 5 dBμV. If the girder is made of a material which conducts magnetic flux the magnetic field emissions is increased. The girder prevents the electromagnetic field to spread in four directions; it limits the emissions to three dimensions...|$|R
