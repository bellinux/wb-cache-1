5|$|Neurostimulation may {{be another}} option in {{those who are not}} {{candidates}} for surgery. Three types {{have been shown to be}} effective in those who do not respond to medications: vagus nerve stimulation, anterior thalamic stimulation, and <b>closed-loop</b> responsive stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a <b>closed-loop</b> circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop {{throughout}} the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|The oil-fired Turkey Point power {{stations}} were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from {{the discharge of}} hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. In 1964 FP announced plans for two 693 MW nuclear reactors at the site, which were expected to compound the cooling water problem. Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay, the {{power stations}} were projected to consume {{a significant proportion of}} the bay's waters each day for cooling. After extensive negotiations and litigation with both the state and with Ludwig, who owned lands needed for cooling water canals, a <b>closed-loop</b> canal system was built south of the power plants and the nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In {{negative}} feedback systems, the dominant <b>closed-loop</b> response is often well-modeled by a second-order system. The phase {{margin of the}} open-loop system sets the quality factor Q of the <b>closed-loop</b> system; as the phase margin decreases, the approximate second-order <b>closed-loop</b> system is made more oscillatory (i.e., has a higher quality factor).|$|E
25|$|A common <b>closed-loop</b> {{controller}} {{architecture is}} the PID controller.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} surplus encirclements (greater than N+P) {{is exactly the}} number of {{unstable}} poles of the <b>closed-loop</b> system.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{amplifiers}} requiring external compensation, {{such as the}} μA748, {{may require}} external compensation or <b>closed-loop</b> gains significantly higher than unity.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>closed-loop</b> reuse are {{primarily due to}} low additional transport costs being involved, the empty lorry returning with the empty crates.|$|E
25|$|This {{assumes that}} the <b>closed-loop</b> system is {{controllable}} or that the unstable eigenvalues of A can be made stable through appropriate choice of K.|$|E
25|$|In some systems, <b>closed-loop</b> and {{open-loop}} control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the {{open-loop control}} is termed feedforward and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.|$|E
25|$|A <b>closed-loop</b> {{artificial}} pancreas regulating glucose through algorithms {{and by the}} way of coordinated glucose and insulin deliveries has been introduced in Japan by the Japanese company Nikkiso.|$|E
25|$|Some devices (μA748, LM301, LM308) are not {{internally}} compensated (require {{an external}} capacitor from output to some point within the operational amplifier, if used in low <b>closed-loop</b> gain applications).|$|E
25|$|Having the PID {{controller}} {{written in}} Laplace form {{and having the}} transfer function of the controlled system {{makes it easy to}} determine the <b>closed-loop</b> transfer function of the system.|$|E
25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} is also manufactured from N-methylformamide and air. In {{the latter}} process, it is immediately consumed in a <b>closed-loop</b> process to make methomyl. Other manufacturing {{methods have been}} reported.|$|E
25|$|Input {{and output}} {{impedances}} of a negative-feedback amplifier (<b>closed-loop</b> amplifier) become {{sensitive to the}} gain of an amplifier without feedback (open-loop amplifier)—that exposes these impedances to variations in the open-loop gain, for example, due to parameter variations or nonlinearity of the open-loop gain.|$|E
25|$|The {{speakers}} {{are driven}} {{by a series of}} audio amplifiers that are usually powered by a portable diesel generator. The system is safely and accurately controlled by a <b>closed-loop</b> feedback control system {{that can be used to}} limit and/or abort if an over-test condition is detected.|$|E
25|$|Below, {{the voltage}} gain of the {{amplifier}} with feedback, the <b>closed-loop</b> gain AFB, is derived {{in terms of}} the gain of the amplifier without feedback, the open-loop gain AOL and the feedback factor β, which governs how much of the output signal is applied to the input (see Figure 1). The open-loop gain AOL in general may be a function of both frequency and voltage; the feedback parameter β is determined by the feedback network that is connected around the amplifier. For an operational amplifier, two resistors forming a voltage divider may be used for the feedback network to set β between 0 and 1. This network may be modified using reactive elements like capacitors or inductors to (a) give frequency-dependent <b>closed-loop</b> gain as in equalization/tone-control circuits or (b) construct oscillators. The gain of the amplifier with feedback is derived below {{in the case of a}} voltage amplifier with voltage feedback.|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} the system y(t) is fed back through a sensor {{measurement}} F to a comparison with the reference value r(t). The controller C then takes the error e (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs u to the system under control P. This {{is shown in the}} figure. This kind of controller is a <b>closed-loop</b> controller or feedback controller.|$|E
25|$|Every {{control system}} must {{guarantee}} first {{the stability of}} the <b>closed-loop</b> behavior. For linear systems, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Non-linear control systems use specific theories (normally based on Aleksandr Lyapunov's Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system. The possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen.|$|E
25|$|The BLDC motor's {{characteristic}} trapezoidal back-emf waveform {{is derived}} partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed, and partly from {{the placement of}} the rotor's PMs. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside out DC motors, the stator windings of trapezoidal BLDC motors can be with single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use Hall effect sensors mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost <b>closed-loop</b> control of the electronic commutator.|$|E
25|$|On October 1–2, 2008, the STEP Manufacturing team {{met at the}} Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology, in Hartford, Connecticut to {{demonstrate}} <b>closed-loop</b> machining, feed optimization, and measurement using STEP-NC. The highlight of the meeting was the live 5-axis machining of a titanium impeller. Participants in the machining demonstration and other activities included Boeing, Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology, Concepts NRec, DMG, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Mitutoyo, NIST, Sandvik Coromant, Scania, Siemens, and STEP Tools.|$|E
25|$|Donoghue's group {{reported}} training rhesus monkeys {{to use a}} BCI to track visual targets {{on a computer screen}} (<b>closed-loop</b> BCI) with or without assistance of a joystick. Schwartz's group created a BCI for three-dimensional tracking in virtual reality and also reproduced BCI control in a robotic arm. The same group also created headlines when they demonstrated that a monkey could feed itself pieces of fruit and marshmallows using a robotic arm controlled by the animal's own brain signals.|$|E
25|$|Designing and tuning a PID {{controller}} {{appears to}} be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. PID controllers often provide acceptable control using default tunings, but performance can generally be improved by careful tuning, and performance may be unacceptable with poor tuning. Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the <b>closed-loop</b> system performs or compromises as desired.|$|E
25|$|Stepper motors {{were and}} still are often used in {{computer}} printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with <b>closed-loop</b> analog control systems.|$|E
25|$|Inside the embryo, the dorsal aorta {{forms and}} {{eventually}} connect {{the heart to}} the capillary plexus of the yolk sac. This forms a <b>closed-loop</b> system of rigid endothelial tubing. It is known that even {{this early in the}} process of vasculogenesis, before the onset of blood flow, sections of the tube system may express ephrins or neuropilins, genetic markers of arterial or venous identities, respectively. These identities are still somewhat flexible, but the initial characterization is important to the embryonic remodelling process.|$|E
25|$|There {{are vastly}} {{more complex and}} faster-responding systems that have sought {{solutions}} for control and whereby the engineering and mathematics of dynamical systems have provided such solutions. For starter, in control theory a true <b>closed-loop</b> feedback pump will have to infuse not just rapid-acting insulin for positive errors, but also infuse glucagon for negative errors. For managing complex life situations, the pump will need several MEMS-based sensors to monitor more than just glucose, for example heart rate, breathing, ECG, temperature, CO2, blood pH, dissolved O2, etc.|$|E
25|$|The input {{impedance}} of the simplified non-inverting amplifier is high, of order Rdif × AOL times the <b>closed-loop</b> gain, where Rdif is the op amp's {{input impedance}} to differential signals, and AOL is the open-loop voltage gain of the op amp; {{in the case}} of the ideal op amp, with AOL infinite and Rdif infinite, the input impedance is infinite. In this case, though, the circuit will be susceptible to input bias current drift because of the mismatch between the impedances driving the V+ and V− op amp inputs.|$|E
25|$|This {{can also}} {{be viewed as a}} high-pass {{electronic}} filter. It is a filter with a single zero at DC (i.e., where angular frequency nbsp&radians) and gain. The high-pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier (i.e., the low-frequency zero) can lead to stability challenges when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop (e.g., in a PID controller with a significant derivative gain). In particular, as a root locus analysis would show, increasing feedback gain will drive a <b>closed-loop</b> pole toward marginal stability at the DC zero introduced by the differentiator.|$|E
25|$|They are low wing, T-tail {{airplanes}} with cabin pressurization, {{powered by}} two rear mounted turbofans. The landing gear is fully retractable {{and designed to}} be operated on paved runways only. The glass cockpit includes four multi-function displays. The operation is made through a flight management system with autopilot, autothrottle and <b>closed-loop</b> control and monitoring of flight controls Fly-By-Wire. The aircraft are certified for Day, Night, VFR and IFR flights, and are approved for reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) airspace and flight into known icing conditions, extended flight over water, Category II ILS, operations at high altitude airports up to 13800ft and steep approach operations.|$|E
25|$|Origin Oils Inc. {{has been}} researching a revolutionary method called the Helix Bioreactor, {{altering}} the common <b>closed-loop</b> growth system. This system utilizes low energy lights in a helical pattern, enabling each algal cell {{to obtain the}} required amount of light. Sunlight can only penetrate a few inches through algal cells, making light a limiting reagent in open-pond algae farms. Each lighting element in the bioreactor is specially altered to emit specific wavelengths of light, as a full spectrum of light is not beneficial to algae growth. In fact, ultraviolet irradiation is actually detrimental as it inhibits photosynthesis, photoreduction, and the 520nm light-dark absorbance change of algae.|$|E
25|$|Finite gain: Open-loop gain is {{infinite}} in {{the ideal}} operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So {{long as the}} loop gain (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely {{by the amount of}} negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop gain). In cases where <b>closed-loop</b> gain must be very high, the feedback gain will be very low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.|$|E
25|$|A {{particular}} robustness {{issue is}} the requirement for a control system to perform properly {{in the presence of}} input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the <b>closed-loop</b> system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: model predictive control (see later), and anti-wind up systems. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.|$|E
25|$|Ash ponds, a type {{of surface}} impoundment, are a widely used {{treatment}} technology at coal-fired plants. These ponds use gravity to settle out large particulates (measured as total suspended solids) from power plant wastewater. This technology does not treat dissolved pollutants. Power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants, depending on the particular wastestream in the plant. These include dry ash handling, <b>closed-loop</b> ash recycling, chemical precipitation, biological treatment (such as an activated sludge process), membrane systems, and evaporation-crystallization systems. Technological advancements in ion exchange membranes and electrodialysis systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of flue-gas desulfurization wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits. The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.|$|E
25|$|If AOL ≫ 1, then AFB ≈ 1 / β, and the {{effective}} amplification (or <b>closed-loop</b> gain) AFB is {{set by the}} feedback constant β, and hence set by the feedback network, usually a simple reproducible network, thus making linearizing and stabilizing the amplification characteristics straightforward. Note also that if there are conditions where β AOL = −1, the amplifier has infinite amplification – {{it has become an}} oscillator, and the system is unstable. The stability characteristics of the gain feedback product β AOL are often displayed and investigated on a Nyquist plot (a polar plot of the gain/phase shift as a parametric function of frequency). A simpler, but less general technique, uses Bode plots.|$|E
25|$|Understanding {{the channel}} allows for {{manipulation}} of the phase and amplitude of each transmitter in order to form a beam. To correctly form a beam, the transmitter needs to understand {{the characteristics of the}} channel. This process is called channel sounding or channel estimation. A known signal is sent to the mobile device that enables it to build a picture of the channel environment. The mobile device sends back the channel characteristics to the transmitter. The transmitter can then apply the correct phase and amplitude adjustments to form a beam directed at the mobile device. This is called a <b>closed-loop</b> MIMO system. For beamforming, it is required to adjust the phases and amplitude of each transmitter. In a beamformer optimized for spatial diversity or spatial multiplexing, each antenna element simultaneously transmits a weighted combination of two data symbols.|$|E
