5|$|The poem is in {{many ways}} deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at {{it in the context of}} the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem <b>Cleanness</b> (also known as Purity), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In <b>Cleanness</b> the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem <b>Cleanness,</b> he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E

25|$|The judges look at speed, ice coverage, {{the quality}} of the lady's {{position}}, position changes, and the man's stability and <b>cleanness</b> of turns throughout. Skaters may also raise their score by having a difficult entry such as in spiral or spread eagle position, a difficult exit, or other features such as stopping the rotation, turning a carry lift into rotational one, or reversing rotation (i.e. both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions).|$|E
25|$|Compulsory figures {{involves}} using blades to draw circles, figure 8s, {{and similar}} shapes in ice. Skaters are judged on the accuracy and {{clarity of the}} figures and the <b>cleanness</b> and exact placement of the various turns on the circles. Figures were formerly included {{as a component of}} singles competitions but were eliminated from international events in 1990. The United States was the last country to retain a separate test and competitive structure for compulsory figures, but the last national-level figures championship was held in 1999. Moves in the field (known in the United Kingdom as field moves) replaced compulsory figures as a discipline to teach the same turns and edge skills.|$|E
25|$|Moore {{went on to}} play {{a leading}} role in England's {{progress}} through their group. On 2 June he captained England to a 1–0 victory against Romania. In the second game against favourites Brazil, there was a defining moment for Moore when he tackled Jairzinho with such precision and <b>cleanness</b> that it has been described as the perfect tackle. It continues to be shown on television around the world. Brazil still won the game 1–0, but England progressed through the group. Moore swapped shirts with Pelé after the game. The shirt was displayed at the National Football Museum in Manchester, courtesy of the Priory Collection. A 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia allowed England to finish second in the group and advance to the knockout stage.|$|E
25|$|The Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1) relates {{how that}} Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, a priest of Aaron’s lineage, {{and others with}} him, used to go down into the {{marketplace}} of the Saracens in Ashkelon to buy wheat during the Seventh Year, and return to their own city, and immerse themselves in order to eat their bread (Terumah) {{in a state of}} ritual purity. The Beth-Din of Rabbi Ishmael ben Jose and Ben HaKapar, when they heard about what Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair had done, a most pious man on all other accounts, but who went down into Ashkelon when it was not permitted for priests to venture outside the Land of Israel, understood thereby that Ashkelon – though not conquered by those returning from the Babylonian exile – was not like other lands of the gentiles, and that defilement had not been decreed upon that city. Therefore, taking as an exemplum the act they heard performed by Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, they assembled themselves and reverted the old practice, decreeing a state of <b>cleanness</b> over the city’s air, and that, henceforth, Jews (including those of the priestly stock) were permitted to go into the city without harboring feelings of guilt or fear of contracting uncleanness.|$|E

500|$|Historically, the Fonteyn Kill's {{water has}} been noted for its <b>cleanness.</b> In 1924, the stream's [...] "purity" [...] was noted while an 1867 book {{describes}} the kill's waters as [...] "". More recently, the stream has been cited as suffering from urban stream syndrome. Surfaces surrounding the Fonteyn Kill are highly impervious; the stream drains an urban zone {{of the city of}} Poughkeepsie, New York, of which over 60% is impervious. The exact size of the kill's watershed is not known; an area at least as large as the known watershed is presumed to contribute to the stream's flow in the form of storm drainage. In spite of this, the stream itself is bordered by a combination of residential lots and forested swaths ranging from [...] in width. On Vassar's campus, the kill runs along the [...] outdoor Edith Roberts Ecological Laboratory and past the school's Shakespeare Garden.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{noted that}} the album {{abandons}} the veneer of noise that coats Ferraro's previous releases while retaining—and reimagining—the form and ethos of noise music. Ferraro said [...] "it's still {{in the tradition of}} noise." [...] According to Bomb magazine writer Luke Degan, the album is unlike the [...] "reverbed-out, feedback-laden noise music" [...] of Ferraro's earlier music, but instead represents the noise of the [...] "digital age." [...] A Fact writer said, [...] "there's no distortion, no tape-hiss, no obvious underground signifiers... this new <b>cleanness</b> and clarity to the Ferraro aesthetic hasn't diminished the hallucinatory power of his music... will terrify you to the core even as they evoke the soundtrack of a third-tier Melanie Griffith rom-com or a forgotten Phil Collins B-side." [...] Another critic said, [...] "while Ferraro is interested in issues of distance and impermanence, there is no lo-fi fuzz or warm nostalgic haze to temper how flat and ugly the music he's referencing on Far Side Virtual is." [...] Stereogum described the album as [...] "nihilistic easy-listening." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} as long as Sarah lived, a cloud (signifying the Divine Presence) hung over her tent. When she died, the cloud disappeared. But when Rebekah came, it returned. As long as Sarah lived, her doors were wide open. At her death that liberality ceased. But when Rebekah came, that openhandedness returned. As long as Sarah lived, there was a blessing on her dough, and the lamp used to burn from the evening of the Sabbath until the evening of the {{following}} Sabbath. When she died, these ceased. But when Rebekah came, they returned. And so when Isaac saw Rebekah following in his mother Sarah's footsteps, separating her challah in <b>cleanness</b> and handling her dough in <b>cleanness</b> (rereading the words of [...] ), [...] "Isaac brought her into the tent, (and, behold, she was like) his mother Sarah.".|$|E

2500|$|Héctor Juan Pérez Martínez [...] (September 30, 1946 – June 29, 1993), {{better known}} as Héctor Lavoe, was a Puerto Rican salsa singer.

2500|$|Watch Tower Society {{publications}} {{defend the}} practice of expelling and shunning those who [...] "promote false teaching", claiming such individuals must be quarantined {{to prevent the spread}} of their [...] "spiritual infection". They have cited a dictionary definition of apostasy ("renunciation of a religious faith, abandonment of a previous loyalty") to rule that an individual who begins affiliating with another religious organization has disassociated from the Witnesses, warranting their shunning to protect the spiritual <b>cleanness</b> of the Witness congregation on the basis of the reference in 1 John 2:19 that those who leave Christianity are [...] "not of our sort". An individual's acceptance of a blood transfusion is similarly deemed as evidence of disassociation. They say Witnesses also obey the [...] "strong counsel" [...] at 1 Corinthians 5:11 that Christians should [...] "quit mixing in company" [...] with people who unrepentantly reject certain scriptural standards.|$|E
2500|$|Witnesses {{practice}} disfellowshipping {{of members}} who unrepentantly engage in [...] "gross sin", (most commonly for breaches of the Witnesses' code of personal morality), and [...] "remorseless apostasy". The process of disfellowshipping {{is said to}} be carried to uphold God’s standards, preserve the congregation’s spiritual <b>cleanness,</b> and possibly prompt a change of attitude in the wrongdoer. The practice requires that the expelled person be shunned by all members of the group, including family members who do not live in the same home, unless they qualify for re-admission. A person who dies while disfellowshipped cannot be given a funeral at a Kingdom Hall. Members often face difficulties and trauma once expelled because of their previously limited contact with the outside world. The Watchtowers description of those who leave as being [...] "mentally diseased" [...] has drawn criticism from some current and former members; in Britain some have argued that the description may constitute a breach of laws regarding religious hatred.|$|E
2500|$|Early chamber works do exist, {{but it is}} {{difficult}} to date any of them to Handel's time in Halle. Many historians until recently followed Chrysander and designated the six trio sonatas for two oboes and basso continuo as his first known composition, supposedly written in 1696 (when Handel was 11). Lang doubts the dating based on a handwritten date of a copy (1700) and stylistic considerations. Lang writes that the works [...] "show thorough acquaintance with the distilled sonata style of the Corelli school" [...] and are notable for [...] "the or, the formal security, and the <b>cleanness</b> of the texture." [...] Hogwood considers all of the oboe trio sonatas spurious and even suggests that some parts cannot be performed on oboe. [...] That authentic manuscript sources do not exist and that Handel never recycled any material from these works make their authenticity doubtful. Other early chamber work were printed in Amsterdam in 1724 as opus 1, but it is impossible to tell which are early works in their original form, rather than later re-workings by Handel, a frequent practice of his.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{obligation}} {{that was}} incumbent upon an Israelite or Jew was {{to separate from}} his harvested grain (wheat, barley, spelt, etc.), wine (including unpressed grapes) and oil (including unpressed olives) the one-fiftieth portion of these products (or one-fortieth, {{if he were a}} man of generosity; and one-sixtieth if he were stingy) and to give the same to a man of Aaron's lineage (priestly stock), who, in turn, would eat such fruits in a state of ritual <b>cleanness,</b> in accordance with a biblical command, [...] "...and let him not eat of the holy things, until he bathes his flesh in water. And when the sun goes down down, he will be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things because it is his food" [...] (...) [...] This obligation was contingent upon the fact that such fruits grew in the Land of Israel. Later, the Rabbis made it an obligation {{to do the same for}} all fruits and vegetables grown in the Land of Israel, and not only to such fruits as grain, grapes and olives. With the destruction of the Temple and the cessation of ritual purity, the obligation to separate the Terumah continued unabated, although it was no longer given to a priest of Aaron's lineage, since bodily defilement was now pervasive. The general practice after the Temple's destruction was to separate the Terumah from all fruits and vegetables by removing even the slightest portion thereof, and to immediately discard it by burial or some other means of disposal (since it can no longer be eaten in the current state of ritual uncleanness, and those doing so would make themselves liable to extirpation).|$|E
2500|$|The {{best known}} and most {{successful}} {{production of the}} play in England was directed by Peter Brook for the RSC at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1955, starring Laurence Olivier as Titus, Maxine Audley as Tamora, Anthony Quayle as Aaron and Vivien Leigh as Lavinia. Brook had been offered the chance to direct Macbeth but had controversially turned it down, and instead decided to stage Titus. The media predicted that the production would be a massive failure, and possibly spell the end of Brook's career, but on the contrary, {{it was a huge}} commercial and critical success, with many of the reviews arguing that Brook's alterations improved Shakespeare's script (Marcus' lengthy speech upon discovering Lavinia was removed and some of the scenes in Act 4 were reorganised). Olivier in particular was singled out for his performance and for making Titus a truly sympathetic character. J.C. Trewin for example, wrote [...] "the actor had thought himself into the hell of Titus; we forgot the inadequacy of the words in the spell of the projection." [...] The production is also noted for muting the violence; Chiron and Demetrius were killed off stage; the heads of Quintus and Mutius were never seen; the nurse is strangled, not stabbed; Titus' hand was never seen; blood and wounds were symbolised by red ribbons. Edward Trostle Jones summed up the style of the production as employing [...] "stylised distancing effects." [...] The scene where Lavinia first appears after the rape was singled out by critics as being especially horrific, with her wounds portrayed by red streamers hanging from her wrists and mouth. Some reviewers however, found the production too beautified, making it unrealistic, with several commenting on the <b>cleanness</b> of Lavinia's face after her tongue has supposedly been cut out. After its hugely successful Royal Shakespeare Theatre run, the play went on tour around Europe. No video recordings of the production are known, although there are many photographs available.|$|E
