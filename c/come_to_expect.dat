5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though {{the aims of the}} deception were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 2014, {{the band}} {{announced}} a hiatus following their AM tour. Turner and Helders have both pursued other projects during this time. In 2016, Turner announced his second album with The Last Shadow Puppets, Everything You've <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Expect.</b> Helders played the drums on Iggy Pop's album Post Pop Depression. On 6 July 2016, all {{four members of}} the band appeared together in public {{for the first time since}} the end of their AM tour. It was to promote the Sheffield Children's Hospital arts trail.|$|E
25|$|Herbert {{never again}} equalled the {{critical}} acclaim he received for Dune. Neither his sequels to Dune {{nor any of}} his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although {{almost all of them}} were New York Times Best Sellers. Some felt that Children of Dune was almost too literary and too dark to get the recognition it may have deserved; others felt that The Dosadi Experiment lacked an epic quality that fans had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviews. Greg Prato of Allmusic gave it {{a rating}} of {{two and a half}} out of five stars, and said that the album sounded extremely similar to earlier releases - [...] "you get the same angry-yet-melodic riff rockers that you long ago <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from the group ... Revolutions Per Minute is just what you'd expect from Skid Row." ...|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic {{awarded the}} album 2½ stars stating [...] "If what you're after is an above-average bar band with an at times amazing guitarist and a {{consistently}} solid rhythm section, Live in New York {{will do just}} fine. Listeners who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> something on a more inspired level will have to content themselves with nearly contemporary albums like his solo venture (also on Enemy) or the stellar Ask the Ages".|$|R
50|$|The popular turn-based {{strategy}} Battle Isle series {{from the}} early 1990s achieved cult status similar to Settlers but when revised in 1997 as a 3-D tactical game Incubation similar to UFO: Enemy Unknown and later in 2001 Battle Isle: The Andosia War, which tried to breach the gap between turn-based strategies and real-time strategies, it alienated many players who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> that the Battle Isle brand would represent traditional turn-based strategies.|$|R
25|$|The gladiators {{may have}} held {{informal}} warm-up matches, using blunted or dummy weapons– some munera, however, {{may have used}} blunted weapons throughout. The editor, his representative or an honoured guest would check the weapons (probatio armorum) for the scheduled matches. These were {{the highlight of the}} day, and were as inventive, varied and novel as the editor could afford. Armatures could be very costly– some were flamboyantly decorated with exotic feathers, jewels and precious metals. Increasingly the munus was the editors gift to spectators who had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> the best as their due.|$|E
25|$|Zook was {{a strong}} recruiter, signing the twentieth-ranked class in an {{abbreviated}} 2002 search, the second-ranked class in 2003, and the seventh-ranked class in 2004. Zook's tenure was modestly successful, but well short of what Gator fans had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b> Although they were talented, Zook's teams were noted for inconsistency; they typically dominated their opponents {{in the first half}} and collapsed in the second. They defeated Georgia (its only loss of 2002) and upset LSU in 2003 on its way to the BCS Championship, but lost to both SEC Mississippi schools and twice to Miami. The Gators lost six games at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, one more than they had in 12 years under Spurrier.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of The new Panorama Elite {{was to the}} usual high standard that everyone had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.|$|E
50|$|Today, Byford is a {{town with}} most of the {{amenities}} and conveniences that one <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> in Australia; including halls, two state schools, clubs, sporting oval, trotting complex, a range of shops and businesses, a flour mill, and farms in the surrounding rural areas. A Free Reformed Church was opened on the corner of Soldiers Road and Mead Street in 1987, and a private school was later built alongside this church.|$|R

5000|$|On Twangville, Bill Wilcox wrote, [...] "For Only Slightly Mad, Bromberg {{returned}} to the formula that made his 1970s albums so great — {{which is to say}} there is no formula at all. From blues to bluegrass to rhythm and blues, Bromberg does it all, and his new album covers the full range of his musical interests.... It's all old fashioned fun with the humor and musicianship fans <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from Bromberg in his prime — a prime that is apparently ongoing." ...|$|R
25|$|India's pro-Arab {{policy had}} mixed success. Establishment of {{close ties with}} the socialist and secular Baathist regimes to some extent {{neutralized}} Pakistani propaganda against India. However, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 put the Arab and Muslim states of the Middle East in a dilemma as the war was fought by two states both friendly to the Arabs. The progressive Arab regimes in Egypt, Syria, and Algeria chose to remain neutral, while the conservative pro-American Arab monarchies in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates openly supported Pakistan. Egypt's stance was met with dismay by the Indians, who had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> close co-operation with the Baathist regimes. But, the death of Nasser in 1970 and Sadat's growing friendship with Riyadh, and his mounting differences with Moscow, constrained Egypt to a policy of neutrality. Gandhi's overtures to Muammar Gaddafi were rebuffed. Libya agreed with the Arab monarchies in believing that Gandhi's intervention in East Pakistan was an attack against Islam.|$|E

50|$|In later years, Godwin <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> {{maternal}} {{support and}} consolation from his daughter. She responded to his expectations and she cared for {{him until he}} died. Shelley’s last two novels, Lodore and Falkner, re-evaluate the father-daughter relationship. They were written {{at a time when}} Shelley was raising her only surviving child alone and supporting her ageing father. In both novels, the daughter eludes the father's control by giving him the traditional maternal figure he asks for. This relationship gives the daughter control of the father.|$|R
2500|$|Each story {{relied on}} {{using the same}} formula, [...] so that the {{audience}} quickly <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> a series of familiar set pieces: {{a phone call from}} the police asking for Batman's help, a dash to the Batcave, a race in the Batmobile to police headquarters, a conference in the Commissioner's office, investigating the scene of the crime, examining clues in the crime-lab at the Batcave, rushing to the villain's secret hideout, falling into the pre-arranged trap. By relying heavily on a formula, it became easy to spoof various elements of that formula.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the vote}} was no longer {{confined}} to the richest families in the county, voters quickly <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> the candidates for whom they voted to meet their expenses in travelling to the poll and to entertain them when they got there. At the Wiltshire election of 1559, one of the candidates, George Penruddock, was Steward to William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke: {{at the close of}} polling, Penruddock invited all the voters, as well as his opponents and the Sheriff, to a dinner at Wilton House, Lord Pembroke's seat.|$|R

500|$|When IGN's Steve Butts asked Miranda why {{the game}} was made {{available}} only through download, he replied, [...] "From a financial perspective, digital distribution {{makes a lot of}} sense. It allows us to sell the Adventure Pack at a lower price point while still providing players with the same high quality gameplay and content that they've <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from NWN2 products.". Some of the game's voice-overs, monsters, music, and objects were released to the Neverwinter Nights 2 community for free, for use in building custom adventures, without needing to purchase the game itself.|$|E
500|$|... "Run the World (Girls)" [...] is {{a complex}} but catchy track that's {{actually}} more reminiscent of M.I.A. and Santigold than Sasha Fierce. The song combines a dancefloor-defying military drumbeat, a sample from Switch's group Major Lazer, an unconventional song structure and some incongruously pretty, layered melodics that are basically chanted but still employ [...] full vocal range. The lyrics, however, are just as female-empowering as we've <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b> There's much more to the song than first meets the ear—it confuses on first listen but coalesces beautifully with repeated plays.|$|E
50|$|Later, Anthony {{switched}} to writing contemporary thrillers and spy novels, featuring strong female leads such as Davina Graham (Head of British spy services) with well-developed characterisation of protagonists and twist endings, which her readers <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b> Her 1971 The Tamarind Seed was adapted for film in 1974, starring Julie Andrews as Judith Farrow, a British Home Office functionary and Omar Sharif as Feodor, a Soviet air attaché- lovers involved in Cold War intrigue.She adapted {{well to the}} end of the Cold War and continued writing thrillers set in the post-1990 reality.|$|R
2500|$|In later years, Godwin <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> {{maternal}} {{support and}} consolation from his daughter. Two {{of the five}} children he had raised had pre-deceased him, and two more lived abroad. Mary responded to his expectations and she cared for him until he died in 1836. [...] He was buried next to Mary Wollstonecraft in the churchyard of St Pancras, where they had married. His second wife outlived him, and eventually was buried there too. The three share a gravestone. In the 1850s, Wollstonecraft and Godwin's remains were moved to Bournemouth, to the family tomb of the Shelleys.|$|R
40|$|Using a post-structural, interpretive perspective, {{we studied}} children’s humour in a grade- 1 and- 2 classroom.

They were also defined by their roles because their teachers and peers <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> certain actions from them. These two boys contributed to classroom discursive practices and also limited the classroom discourse...|$|R

500|$|From {{retrospective}} reviews, The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music {{commented that}} Barely Real was [...] "on first hearing, slightly soporific and listless, but it rewards repeated listening with its depth and emotional texture." [...] Ned Raggett (AllMusic) gave the album {{a rating of}} {{four and a half}} stars out of five, explaining that [...] "Those put off by earlier Codeine CDs won't want to continue; those taken by the band's way of doing things will happily embrace it."

500|$|... "Slow Life" [...] itself {{received}} generally positive reviews; Pitchfork Media {{called it}} a [...] "stunning closer" [...] to Phantom Power, while PopMatters described the song as [...] "the kind of schizophrenic fun we've <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from the band but ... less showy and eager to please, as they control themselves {{enough to make the}} jarring, contradicting styles much easier to digest". Stylus Magazine stated that the [...] "great" [...] track [...] "achieves symbiosis between techno and guitar-pop better than anything else they've done before". The BBC agreed calling [...] "Slow Life" [...] the band's [...] "most successful mindrattling techno attempt so far".

50|$|Tōshūsai Sharaku's works {{appeared}} {{in the middle of}} the Kansei era (1789-1801), when the nation faced hard economic times that the military government responded to with reactionary policies such as the Kansei Reforms intended to strengthen the feudalistic shogunal system. Some of the policies restricted extravagant fashions, and Kabuki theatres faced strict control over their perceived excesses and limits on actors' incomes. Late Edo-period art nevertheless flourished, and new works and popular actors continued to rapidly appear in kabuki theatre, where realistic performances came in vogue. Yakusha-e <b>came</b> <b>to</b> favour a greater emphasis on the individuality of the actors, and buyers <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> pictures with the actors' likenesses, rather than the stereotyped images of the past, such as those by the once-dominant Torii school.|$|R

500|$|The musical {{opened on}} Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales {{guaranteed}} a considerable run; by {{the start of}} November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted [...] "because audiences had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical".
