40|$|We {{present a}} {{preliminary}} {{profile of the}} murderer in Mexico. This {{is the first step}} in constructing an empirical knowledge and systematic base for the comparative study of violent offenders in the Latin American region. The total number of federal <b>convicts</b> <b>for</b> murder was compared with the total number of <b>convicts</b> <b>for</b> other intentional crimes between 1997 and 2010. The study found that the total number of federal <b>convicts</b> <b>for</b> murder is comparatively small, highly varying and becoming less over time. About one third committed their crime overseas, mostly in the United States. Also, significantly higher proportions of married, college degrees, and professionals were found among <b>convicts</b> <b>for</b> murder...|$|R

5|$|Tannakin's {{deformity}} {{was soon}} discovered, and many locals came {{to hear her}} pig-like speech or to watch her feed from the trough. The old woman was located, tried and <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> witchcraft, but even at the stake refused or was unable to reverse the enchantment.|$|E

He was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2006. Then, in 2013, he was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, a police investigation into child sexual abuse by media celebrities, and was <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> indecent assault and imprisoned for five years nine months in June 2014. His art work was largely withdrawn for sale, and became worthless, and the CBE was cancelled and annulled.|$|E
5|$|Also, in 2006, Moussaoui, who some {{originally}} suspected {{might have}} been the assigned 20th hijacker, was <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> the lesser role of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and air piracy.

Mounir el-Motassadeq, an associate of the Hamburg-based hijackers, is serving 15 years in Germany for his role in helping the hijackers prepare for the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Boyars {{could no}} longer be {{executed}} without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> treason, their fortunes {{could no longer}} be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E

5|$|Drysdale also {{oversaw the}} first civil {{litigation}} trial, {{in which the}} owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, Bhutto and Zardari were <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> {{receiving}} indemnities from a Swiss goods inspection {{company that}} was hired to end corruption {{in the collection of}} customs duties.

50|$|When on a {{grand jury}} about 1836, Allsop startled London by informing the commissioners at the Old Bailey that he should think it unjust ‘to <b>convict</b> <b>for</b> {{offences}} having their origin in misgovernment,’ since society had made the crime. He was also anti-clerical.|$|R

5|$|The {{capture of}} the 32nd Corps' weapons was the most {{significant}} achievement of the Battle of the Barracks, and greatly augmented {{the capabilities of the}} Croatian military. After he left Croatia, Trifunović was indicted for war crimes by Croatia, tried in absentia and <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> the combat deaths of six Croatian soldiers and the wounding of dozens of Croatian citizens before and during the siege. He was also prosecuted by Yugoslav authorities for treason, but subsequently pardoned. In 2013, he requested a re-trial on his Croatian war crimes conviction, but died before proceedings could commence.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders that mass killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, as they drove locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg Trials and the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.|$|E
5000|$|Marsden was a {{prominent}} figure in early New South Wales and Australian history, partly through his ecclesiastical offices as the colony's senior Anglican cleric, but also for his employment of <b>convicts</b> <b>for</b> farming and his actions as a magistrate at Parramatta, both of which attracted contemporary criticism.|$|R

5|$|There were, however, {{a number}} of irregularities. In the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, four Liberal workers were convicted of various {{offences}} for adding almost five hundred names to the electoral register. One of the four was also <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> two counts of perjury. While the unsuccessful Liberal candidate, former MP James Rooney, was not charged, Ontario Chief Justice James Chalmers McRuer, who investigated the matter, doubted that {{this could have been}} done without the candidate's knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Willson further alienated the {{legislature}} by issuing pardons for several individuals convicted of {{complicity in the}} assassination of Governor William Goebel (1900). These included former Republican governor William S. Taylor (18991900) and Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Henry Youtsey, who was <b>convicted</b> <b>for</b> complicity in the assassination but turned state's evidence, was not pardoned, leading Democrats to portray the pardons of Taylor and Powers as partisan. Goebel's likeness was also removed from state checks and documents {{and was replaced by}} likenesses of either Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, or John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} its battle against censorship {{of art and}} literature.

The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beahharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.|$|E
