500|$|Written {{in the key}} of G major, [...] "Hot n Cold" [...] is a pop and dance-pop song which {{utilizes}} {{guitars and}} synthesizers. It has a length of three minutes and forty seconds (3:40), and runs at a moderately fast tempo of 132 beats per minute. The lyrics of the song address a lover of Perry whose mood swings are affecting the couple's relationship. The song opens with Perry confronting her former partner over his frequent changes of mind, singing [...] "You <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> like a girl changes clothes / Yeah you PMS like a bitch". In the chorus, she uses antonyms to describe her partner's mood changes, with the chorus of the song including the lines [...] "You're hot then you're cold / You're yes then you're no / You're in then you're out / You're up then you're down".|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode 7.7 out of 10, praising the plot and the {{introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticizing the amount of humor and MCU references. David Sims of The A.V. Club scored the episode a 'B', calling it [...] "the first episode to show some potential for originality around the corner". He praised the character development, specifically for Coulson and Skye, {{and the introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticized Quinn as [...] "barely a step above a generic Miami Vice villain and whose motives would be totally uninteresting if they were ever made clear to us". He also found Dalton to be [...] "the latest in a line of dull Whedon hunks with just a glimmer of personality." [...] The Guardians Graeme Virtue felt that [...] "If Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't been levitating your boat so far, this breezy episode probably didn't do that much to <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> If you're not in the mood, the endless quipping can seem exhausting, but at least there was some incremental character development." [...] He had especial praise for the introduction of Hall/Graviton, and felt that Hart's performance as the character topped Samuel L. Jackson's cameo from the previous episode.|$|E
500|$|The Escapist gave Last Specter a {{score of}} four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "Another Professor Layton game, another bit of puzzling brilliance. Some of the brain teasers feel a bit {{recycled}} - instead of foxes and chickens, you're shuttling dogs and cats across the river, for example - but there's more than enough variety to warrant doggedly tracking down every last one. But if you only solve the ones you need to move the story forward, that's ok, too." [...] The Guardian gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "If you've not {{been a fan of}} the series, this isn't the game that's going to <b>change</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> For everybody else though, Professor Layton & The Spectre's Call is several days of commute-improving, grey cell stimulation in a mostly effective package. [...] And bravo to Nintendo for keeping this franchise on the standard DS rather than – for the time being, at least – adding that third dimension." [...] However, The Daily Telegraph gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "The Layton charm is undoubtedly still present, but it's not enough to carry the series by itself. Upon solving certain puzzles, Layton exclaims 'I love the thrill of a good solution'. So do we, Hershel, so do we. And in this Layton game, sadly, that thrill is all too rare." ...|$|E
