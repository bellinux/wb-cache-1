40|$|Purpose: This study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the perceptions of mobile network operators (MNOs) regarding the <b>cost</b> <b>drivers</b> of the South African mobile phone industry from a supply chain (SC) perspective. It also seeks to explore the possible cost interrelationships in the South African mobile phone SC. Research design and methodology: A qualitative case study, involving six willing managers of MNOs, and by using semi-structured interviews, observation and documents, was conducted. Findings: This study suggests that network infrastructure and network maintenance, handsets, logistics, technology, marketing and sales, training and consulting are the <b>cost</b> <b>drivers</b> in the South African mobile phone SC. These <b>cost</b> <b>drivers</b> are interrelated; and they influence {{one another in the}} mobile phone SC. Implications: The findings of this study should assist MNOs in their monitoring of <b>cost</b> <b>drivers</b> and in the identification of cost reduction opportunities, in order to remain effective and efficient in the industry. This study’s findings should help regulating authorities (such as the Department of Communications and the Independent Communication Authority of South Africa [ICASA]) to gain insights into the <b>cost</b> <b>drivers</b> of the South African mobile phone industry {{from the perspective of a}} network operator, and thus to develop appropriate mobile phone policies...|$|R

50|$|The split of cost {{helps to}} {{identify}} cost drivers, if achieved. Direct labour and materials are {{relatively easy to}} trace directly to products, {{but it is more}} difficult to directly allocate indirect costs to products. Where products use common resources differently, some sort of weighting is needed in the cost allocation process. The <b>cost</b> <b>driver</b> is a factor that creates or drives the cost of the activity. For example, the cost of the activity of bank tellers can be ascribed to each product by measuring how long each product's transactions (<b>cost</b> <b>driver)</b> takes at the counter and then by measuring the number of each type of transaction. For the activity of running machinery, the driver is likely to be machine operating hours. That is, machine operating hours drive labor, maintenance, and power cost during the running machinery activity.|$|E

This paper {{proposes a}} {{modification}} to the Academic COSYSMO estimating relationship to remedy a critical limitation {{in its current}} implementation of the <b>cost</b> <b>drivers.</b> The effort multipliers defined for these drivers have an overdramatic impact on the nominal effort, which unrealistically amplifies or compresses the effort estimate.

50|$|High {{pressure}} is a <b>cost</b> <b>driver</b> for any component, as it increases both quality requirements and required materials (thickness). Large, high pressure components require heavy weldings and forgings that have limited availability. A typical operating pressure for a PWR is over 150 atmospheres. Due {{to the low}} vapor pressure and high boiling point of the salt, the Core-unit operates at or near atmospheric pressure (other than a few atmospheres of pressure from the hydrostatic weight of the salt), despite the higher operating temperature.
