40|$|Abstract—A new {{technique}} {{is presented to}} make vertically coupled semiconductor microring resonators that eases the fabrication process with devices more robust to ring-to-waveguide misalignments. Single-mode microring optical channel dropping filters are demonstrated {{for the first time}} in this configuration with Qs greater than 3000 and an on-resonance <b>channel</b> <b>extinction</b> greater than 12 dB. A 1 4 multiplexer/demultiplexer crossbar array with second-order microrings was also made and exhibited channel-to-channel crosstalk lower than 10 dB.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{model and}} {{experimentally}} demonstrate {{a number of}} silicon microring resonator-based optical switches and optical delay lines. We propose silicon feedback-waveguide-coupled microring resonator-based devices for optical switching and hitless tuning. We also measure the optical delay in the fabricated feedback-waveguide coupled microring resonator. Finally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept experiment of a 3 × 3 matrix switch used as an optical router. We propose a silicon feedback-waveguide-coupled microring for optical filtering. Our proof-of-concept experiment shows an extinction ratio modulation from 0 dB to 18 dB at a fixed wavelength with a resonance Q of 4000. We propose to further improve the device performance by using {{a large number of}} coupled microrings and implement a Vernier-effect design. We model a feedback-waveguide-based fourth-order hitless filter showing a FSR larger than 32 nm, a 43 dB <b>channel</b> <b>extinction</b> ratio, a 3 dB-bandwidth of 12 GHz and a 12 dB channel isolation, which is potentially useful for wavelength-division-multiplexing optical communications. We present time-domain measurements of 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s time delayed Non-Return-to-Zero-signals in a feedback-waveguide-coupled microring resonator device. We demonstrate a maximum of 37 ps and 28 ps time delays for 1 Gb/s and 10 Gb/s bit rates respectively, with open eye-diagrams. We also model a delayed NRZ-modulated signal based on the Fourier-transform analysis and the modeling results show consistency with the experimental results. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate an electro-optical 3 × 3 matrix switch using microring resonators fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator substrate. Among the array of nine microrings, the five functional microrings enable the setup of multiple routes for the input light as a proof-of-concept. The device shows sub-nanosecond switch-on and –off times for optical paths establishment...|$|E
40|$|Memory {{retrieval}} is not {{a passive}} phenomenon. Instead, it triggers a number of processes that either reinforce or alter stored information. Retrieval is thought to activate a second memory consolidation cascade (reconsolidation) that requires protein synthesis. Here, we show that the temporal dynamics of memory reconsolidation are dependent on the strength and age of the memory, such that younger and weaker memories are more easily reconsolidated than older and stronger memories. We also report that reconsolidation and extinction, two opposing processes triggered by memory retrieval, have distinct biochemical signatures: pharmacological antagonism of either cannabinoid receptor 1 or L-type voltage-gated calcium <b>channels</b> blocks <b>extinction</b> but not reconsolidation. These studies demonstrate the dynamic nature of memory processing after retrieval and represent {{a first step toward}} a molecular dissection of underlying mechanisms. Key words: consolidation; reconsolidation; extinction; fear conditioning; spatial memory; protein synthesi...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} and {{investigate}} a new architecture of a silicon photonic transponder aggregator {{as a new}} interconnect subsystem enabling the implementation of colorless, directionless, and contentionless ROADMs. Such subsystem {{is based on a}} microring resonator switching fabric integrated in a silicon photonics platform to achieve high functional integration together with reduction of cost, footprint, and power consumption. In the proposed device, microring resonators perform simultaneous add and drop of wavelength channels which suffer from two detrimental effects: residual dropped signal crosstalk and residual added signal crosstalk, respectively. Considering three microring-based switching elements, the transfer matrix method has been used to compute the add/drop transfer functions of the switches as a function of their geometrical parameters. The two crosstalk effects have been evaluated jointly with other important transmission parameters, such as bandwidth, insertion losses, side lobe suppression, adjacent <b>channel</b> rejection, <b>extinction</b> ratio, and group dispersion. In addition, device sensitivity with respect to the ring-waveguide coupling coefficients has been calculated. Finally, the performance of the different switches has been assessed to demonstrate that, by a proper design, the proposed transponder aggregator can support 100 Gb/s DP-QPSK modulated signal transmission...|$|R
40|$|The {{archived}} ozone profiles {{from the}} Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) {{have already been}} corrected {{for the effects of}} the spectrally varying, interfering absorption due to aerosols composed of aqueous sulfuric acid, and agreement with correlative measurements in the stratosphere is generally excellent. However, comparisons of sets of coincident HALOE and ozonesonde profiles indicate occasional large differences at the lowest levels of the stratosphere. Most of those instances occur at altitudes just below a well-defined minimum in the 5. 26 microns <b>channel</b> aerosol <b>extinction</b> profile, whose wavelength dependence is not represented by a sulfuric acid aerosol model. Further, when the aerosol extinction exceeds about 10 (exp 3) / km, the aerosol correction to the ozone channel transmittances is both large and uncertain. After screening out the HALOE ozone profile segments whose corresponding aerosol/cirrus corrections are likely uncertain and after averaging lie ozonesonde profiles into 2. 5 km thick layers, we find that the HALOE ozone areas, on average, to within 10 % of their coincident ozonesonde measurements down to 100 hPa at tropical/subtropical latitudes and to 200 hPa at extratropical latitudes. A tightening of the coincidence criteria for the comparisons does not improve the mean differences for the sets nearly as much. Part of the variance of the paired differences was also accounted for when the ozonesonde profile values were integrated into those 2. 5 km layers, prior to taking differences. This improvement is due mainly to the vertical averaging of the local, higher-resolution ozonesonde data, matching the lower resolution for HALOE ozone in the lower stratosphere. It is concluded that HALOE is providing accurate ozone profiles throughout the lower stratosphere, when its correction for interfering aerosols has been well characterized and when cirrus layers are not indicated...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in retrieving profiles of aerosol effective radius, total number concentration, and {{complex refractive index}} from lidar measurements of extinction and backscatter at several wavelengths. The combination of three backscatter <b>channels</b> plus two <b>extinction</b> <b>channels</b> (3 β  +  2 α) is particularly important since it {{is believed to be}} the minimum configuration necessary for the retrieval of aerosol microphysical properties and because the technological readiness of lidar systems permits this configuration on both an airborne and future spaceborne instrument. The second-generation NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL- 2) has been making 3 β  +  2 α measurements since 2012. The planned NASA Aerosol/Clouds/Ecosystems (ACE) satellite mission also recommends the 3 β  +  2 α combination. Here we develop a deeper understanding of the information content and sensitivities of the 3 β  +  2 α system in terms of aerosol microphysical parameters of interest. We use a retrieval-free methodology to determine the basic sensitivities of the measurements independent of retrieval assumptions and constraints. We calculate information content and uncertainty metrics using tools borrowed from the optimal estimation methodology based on Bayes' theorem, using a simplified forward model look-up table, with no explicit inversion. The forward model is simplified to represent spherical particles, monomodal log-normal size distributions, and wavelength-independent refractive indices. Since we only use the forward model with no retrieval, the given simplified aerosol scenario is applicable as a best case for all existing retrievals in the absence of additional constraints. Retrieval-dependent errors due to mismatch between retrieval assumptions and true atmospheric aerosols are not included in this sensitivity study, and neither are retrieval errors that may be introduced in the inversion process. The choice of a simplified model adds clarity to the understanding of the uncertainties in such retrievals, since it allows for separately assessing the sensitivities and uncertainties of the measurements alone that cannot be corrected by any potential or theoretical improvements to retrieval methodology but must instead be addressed by adding information content. The sensitivity metrics allow for identifying (1)  information content of the measurements vs. a priori information; (2)  error bars on the retrieved parameters; and (3)  potential sources of cross-talk or "compensating" errors wherein different retrieval parameters are not independently captured by the measurements. The results suggest that the 3 β  +  2 α measurement system is underdetermined with respect to the full suite of microphysical parameters considered in this study and that additional information is required, in the form of additional coincident measurements (e. g., sun-photometer or polarimeter) or a priori retrieval constraints. A specific recommendation is given for addressing cross-talk between effective radius and total number concentration...|$|R
30|$|An {{experiment}} combining genetics, pharmacology, physiology, and microstimulation {{revealed a}} role for the MD in extinction learning, especially suggesting that the firing mode of the MD is critical in modulation of fear extinction (Lee et al., 2012). Thalamocortical neurons exhibit two distinct firing modes depending on membrane status: a low voltage-activated T-type Ca 2 + channel-dependent burst of high-frequency action potentials upon hyperpolarization or tonic firing of singular action potentials during depolarization (Llinas and Jahnsen, 1982; Sherman, 2001). Here, activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR 1) induces membrane depolarization in thalamocortical neurons, leading to a shift in thalamic firing from the burst to the tonic mode (McCormick and von Krosigk, 1992). The mice with a knockout of phospholipase C-β 4 (PLCβ 4), which is physiologically coupled with mGluR 1, were strongly impaired in acquisition of extinction. MD-specific knockdown of PLCβ 4 leads to similar impairment in extinction. Intra-MD infusion of CPCCOEt, a selective mGluR 1 antagonist, or mibefradil, a general T-type Ca 2 + <b>channel</b> inhibitor, before <b>extinction</b> training inhibited acquisition of extinction. Interestingly, the degree of the increase of tonic firing of the MD during the acquisition stage of extinction {{was positively correlated with}} the strength of recall of extinction. On the other hand, burst firing of the MD in PLCβ 4 -deficient mice was enhanced. Consistent with unit activity of the MD, tonic-evoked microstimulation of the MD, paired with CS, facilitated extinction learning. In contrast, burst-evoked microstimulation of the MD, paired with CS, suppressed extinction learning (Fig.  1). Thus, the MD could be involved in acquisition and consolidation of fear extinction within the triangular circuit including the mPFC and amygdala.|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{study with}} an inversion scheme that permits one to retrieve physical parameters of tropospheric particle size distributions, e. g., effective radius, volume, surface-area, and number concentrations, {{as well as}} the mean complex refractive index from backscatter and extinction coefficients at multiple wavelengths is presented. The optical data for the analysis are derived from Mie-scattering calculations for monomodal and bimodal logarithmic-normal distributions in the particle size range between 0. 01 and 10 mu m. The complex refractive index is taken between 1. 33 and 1. 8 in the real part and between 0 and 0. 1 in the imaginary part. The choice of these parameters takes account of properties of optically active atmospheric particles. The wavelengths were chosen at 355, 400, 532, 710, 800, and 1064 nm for the backscatter and at 355 and 532 nm for the extinction data, which are the available wavelengths of the two lidar systems at the Institute for Tropospheric Research. Cases of erroneous optical data of the order of as much as 20 %, an unknown refractive index, which may also be wavelength and size dependent, {{as well as the}} a priori unknown modality of the particle size distribution were considered. It is shown that both <b>extinction</b> <b>channels</b> are necessary for determining the above-mentioned parameters within reasonable limits, i. e., effective radius, surface-area, and volume concentrations to an accuracy of +/- 50 %, the real part of the complex refractive index to +/- 0. 1, and the imaginary part to +/- 50 %. The number concentration may have errors larger than 50 %. The overall performance of the inversion scheme permits the evaluation of experimental data on a routine basis.

40|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is a key}} {{structure of}} the neuronal circuitry mediating expression and extinction of conditioned fear. However, fear memories {{are thought to be}} encoded in a larger network comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HC). Thus, amygdala projections to the mPFC and to the HC are likely to be involved in fear learning, yet the cellular substrates of that learning remain unknown. To examine the role of identified amygdala projection neurons in the expression and extinction of conditioned fear responses, I used a combination of in vivo retrograde tracing techniques and analysis of expression of the activity-dependent immediate early genes (IEGs) cFos and Zif 268. I show that amygdala neurons projecting to the mPFC or to the HC exhibit differential cFos and Zif 268 expression in fear conditioned animals compared with non-conditioned control animals and with animals subjected to extinction. In particular, extinction resulted in a selective induction of cFos in mPFC projecting neurons. A more detailed analysis revealed that neurons projecting to the infralimbic subdivision of the mPFC (IL), but not those projecting to the prelimbic subdivision (PL), account for the specific cFos expression in mPFC-projecting neurons following extinction. To investigate the physiological correlates of fear extinction in anatomically defined subpopulations of amygdala projection neurons I used an electrophysiological ex vivo approach. In these experiments, I recorded from identified BA neurons projecting to PL or IL in slices obtained from mice subjected to extinction. Extinction differentially affects intrinsic properties of PL- and IL-projecting cells. While there was no change in PL-projecting neurons, IL-projecting BA cells showed a learning-related increase in spike half-width and a concomitant decrease in the fast after-hyperpolarization (AHPfast). In control animals, spike half-width and AHPfast were controlled by the activation of voltage-dependent potassium channels (VDPCs) and large-conductance Ca 2 + dependent potassium <b>channels</b> (BK-channels). After <b>extinction</b> training only VDPCs contribute to the AHPfast in IL-projecitng cells. This indicates a specific modulation of BK-channels in IL-projecting neurons following extinction learning. Our findings suggest that a change in the balance of activity between IL- and PL-projecting BA neurons may be involved in the extinction of conditioned fear. ...|$|R
