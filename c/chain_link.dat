5|$|The first {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} escape the prison was made on April 27, 1936 by Joseph Bowers, who was assigned the duty of burning trash at the incinerator. He tried to escape during duty hours by scaling a <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> fence {{at the edge of}} the island. When he was caught in this act and refused orders of the correctional officer located at the West Road guard tower to come down he was shot. He was seriously injured in the fall from over 15m (50ft) and consequently died.|$|E
5|$|The Vishnu sculptures {{found among}} the Elephanta ruins express {{different}} styles. One wears a dhoti and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh. The remnants of his sides suggest that this was likely a four arm iconography. Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> near the thigh, has a gada (mace) on side, and someone {{standing next to him}} of a damaged upper portion but with small waist and full breasts suggestive of a devi. This statue too is wearing a dhoti.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} methodology for assessing the structural integrity of mooring components for offshore applications. Finite element calculations were performed {{in order to determine the}} stress levels in studless and stud <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> as well as to evaluate the critical regions of the links. A study was also developed based on the concept of critical volume associated with the material volume susceptible to a certain critical crack size. The results showed that the studless <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> present a higher critical volume than that related to the stud <b>chain</b> <b>links,</b> fact that confirms the beneficial effect of the stud. According to the crack assessment procedure the critical crack length is smaller for the stud <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> However, the critical association between volume and crack size turns the studless <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> more susceptible to brittle fracture than the stud <b>chain</b> <b>links...</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2002, several mooring {{chains of}} Girassol Off-loading buoy which was {{installed}} offshore Angola ruptured just after 8 months of service. A new failure mechanism called out-of plane bending(OPB) fatigue in mooring <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> was identified {{in addition to}} tension induced fatigue {{after a series of}} experiments. Currently, there are no models in literature which can comprehensively explain OPB mechanism in mooring <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> Models to explain OPB mechanism are required to calculate OPB stresses in <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> for fatigue damage evaluation. These models need to be "simple" and "adequate" {{in the sense that it}} should idealize the complicated geometry of <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> while giving accurate predictions of OPB stresses when subjected to rotation and tension, at a fraction of time used by solid finite element models or full scale experiments. The research carried out in this master's project deals with development of such models to explain OPB mechanism in mooring <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> In this thesis, a new interlink stiffness model is developed to describe the nonlinear hysteritic relationship between OPB moment and interlink angle. The interlink stiffness model is then applied to a system of <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> using two different methods: a physics based approach and a semi-empirical approach. Each of these methods present a new approach to idealize a system of <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> Then, a case study is presented in which a methodology to calculate OPB stresses for one sea-state is described. This methodology follows a de-coupled approach in which results of coupled floater-mooring analysis are taken as an input for the simplified models of <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> To verify this methodology, a comparative study is performed at the end in which coupled floatermooring analysis is carried out with and without including the interlink stiffness of <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic EngineeringOffshore and Dredging Engineerin...|$|R

5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E
5|$|ZIPRA {{personnel}} in Bulawayo used civilian vehicles to smuggle weapons and equipment, including mortars, into their Entumbane camp {{over the next}} few days. C Company, 1RAR, comprising 96 men under Major Lionel Dyck (including a detachment from Support Company) and eight armoured vehicles, noticed this while they were garrisoning the Alamo on 11 February. The major reported to Brigade headquarters that the number of ZIPRA troops at Entumbane appeared to have swelled considerably, and that the <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> fence surrounding the camp had been taken down. Superiors ordered him not to intervene. Anticipating an imminent attack, Dyck used a silenced rifle to shoot out the floodlights surrounding the Alamo, lined up his vehicles against the surrounding walls so his men could stand on them while defending, and ranged mortars on a variety of targets in the ZIPRA complex.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, huge {{stockpiles}} of uranium were amassed {{and tens of}} thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600short tons (540metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US $550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.|$|E

25|$|The Mitsubishi-Shindoh Co., Ltd., has {{developed}} a proprietary copper-zinc brass alloy, called UR30, specifically designed for aquaculture operations. The alloy, which is composed of 64% copper, 35.1% zinc, 0.6% tin, and 0.3% nickel, resists mechanical abrasion when formed into wires and fabricated into <b>chain</b> <b>link,</b> woven, or other types of flexible mesh. Corrosion rates depend on the depth of submersion and seawater conditions. The average reported corrosion rate reported for the alloy is < 5 μm/yr based on two- and five-year exposure trials in seawater.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} copper–nickel alloys, {{corrosion}} resistance of copper–silicon {{is due to}} protective films that form on the surface {{over a period of}} time. General corrosion rates of 0.025–0.050mm have been observed in quiet waters. This rate decreases towards {{the lower end of the}} range over long-term exposures (e.g., 400–600 days). There is generally no pitting with the silicon-bronzes. Also there is good resistance to erosion corrosion up to moderate flow rates. Because copper–silicon is weldable, rigid pens can be constructed with this material. Also, because welded copper–silicon mesh is lighter than copper-zinc <b>chain</b> <b>link,</b> aquaculture enclosures made with copper–silicon may be lighter in weight and therefore a potentially less expensive alternative.|$|E

25|$|There are two bridges within park boundaries. A {{footbridge}} {{over the}} Chicago River {{was designed by}} Hatzfeld in 1927 and opened in 1928. The original footbridge featured an arched wooden deck with metal support beams. Its original X-shaped rails were constructed from rough hewn lumber and at both {{the north and south}} ends of the bridge were covered shelters. When the Chicago Park District significantly rebuilt and altered the bridge in 1942, they kept the shelters intact. It is not known when the shelters were removed from the site. The park district undertook extensive reconstruction of the bridge again in 1995. While the original steel structure was maintained, the deck was replaced with asphalt and the railing replaced with <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> fencing.|$|E
25|$|Mining as an {{industry}} underwent dramatic changes in medieval Europe. The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron. Other precious metals were also used, mainly for gilding or coinage. Initially, many metals were obtained through open-pit mining, and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths, rather than through deep mine shafts. Around the 14th century, the growing use of weapons, armour, stirrups, and horseshoes greatly increased the demand for iron. Medieval knights, for example, were often laden with up to 100 pounds of plate or <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> armour in addition to swords, lances and other weapons. The overwhelming dependency on iron for military purposes spurred iron production and extraction processes.|$|E
25|$|The Albany Park District {{fell behind}} on its bills by 1932 {{and it became}} clear that the district, as an {{independent}} entity, was not going to survive the lean years of the Great Depression. In 1934 there were 22 separate park districts operating in the city of Chicago. That year, motivated by the fiscal disaster the Depression had brought to many small independent agencies, voters approved the Park Consolidation Act of 1934 and unified all 22 disparate park districts, including the Albany Park District, into the Chicago Park District. The newly formed conglomerate qualified for $82 million in federal funding through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Public Works Administration (PWA) between 1935 and 1941. These funds allowed extensive improvements throughout the Chicago park system and Eugene Field Park saw many changes in the 1930s and early 1940s. The athletic fields were improved, paths and sidewalks laid, and through a 1941-42 WPA project the river banks were graded, and retaining wall, rip rap, and <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> fence were installed along the river bank. It was during this time that the 60 foot tall light tower was erected near the tennis courts.|$|E
