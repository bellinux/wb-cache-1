25|$|The Bronze Age in the Indus Valley began around 3300BCE {{with the}} Indus Valley Civilization. Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, {{it was one}} of three early civilizations of the Old World, and of the three the most widespread, {{covering}} an area of 1.25 million km2. It flourished in the basins of the Indus River, in what is today the Pakistani provinces of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan, and along a system of perennial, mostly monsoon-fed, rivers that once coursed {{in the vicinity of the}} seasonal Ghaggar-Hakra river in parts of northwest India. At its peak, the civilization hosted a population of approximately 5 million spread across hundreds of settlements extending as far as the Arabian Sea to present-day southern and eastern Afghanistan, and the Himalayas. Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley, the Harappans, developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft (<b>carneol</b> products, seal carving), and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin.|$|E

5000|$|The {{activities}} of 2002 indicate that Tell Johfiyeh {{and the small}} archaeological sites in its vicinity were used most probably as farmsteads, {{dating back to the}} 7th century BC. The following results were obtained:Archaeological sites in the vicinity of Tell Johfiyeh• Founded mainly during the Iron Age• Usually re-settled during the Byzantine and Umayyad era• Most probably agricultural facilities • The sites maintained relations to each other• Tell Irbid or Tell el-Husn probably functioned as central sites • Two phases of settlement could be separated: Iron Age II and Byzantine-Umayyad era •z Remains of the latter were found exclusively on the south-western fringe of the tell and at the eastern slope. Remainsof the Iron Age, however, were found all over the site and dominate the finds made so far.• Remains of the Byzantine-Umayyad era are:-A cistern-Remains of a small house-Two almost complete vessels of clay-Numerous clay sherds, glass and metal remains• The remains from the Iron Age belong to domestic activities within an agricultural world: -Numerous fireplaces and cooking spots, grinding-stones, mortars, basalt pestles and scrapers,weaving-weights, spinning-whorls, a three-footedbasalt-bowl with tools, „buttons“, numerous stone-vessels, several arrow-heads made of iron and needles as well as a few pearls from <b>carneol</b> ...|$|E

In {{this short}} article {{a small group}} of glass vessels of Siscian origin from an {{important}} private collection in Sisak is presented. Individual find groups from the same collection have already been published (Prilozi 15 - 16 / 1999, 17 / 2000, 18 / 2001 and 19 / 2002). The collection also contains jewelry (<b>carneol</b> gems, rings, armbands, earrings, bracelets, beads and pendants), locks, keys and padlocks, different tools (hammers, awls, mallets, hooks) and other accessories (lamp hooks, ansae, handle fastening systems, knives, forks), weapons (lance and arrow heads, battle axes, spurs etc.), play-tokens, coins (aureus, argenteus) and ceramic vessels (amphorae, jugs, urns) and other objects. With the exception of the first of the Siscian glass specimens, No. 1, which has a broken rim, the remaining six vessels are completely preserved. Among the balsamaria, bottles with a round bottom (Pl. 1, 1, 2, Fig. 1 a,b) represent shapes common in the first century. The rather specific bottle with a long neck and a standing plate (Pl. 1, 3., Fig. 2 d) remains without more precise chronological definition for lack of parallels, and in a broader context it can be dated to the first-third centuries. The spherical bottle (Pl. 1, 4, Fig. 2 a) overlaps with such finds from the first century, as well as the patera-shaped little plate (Pl. 1, 6, Fig. 2 e) and on the basis of numerous analogous Italic and Pannonian examples it can be dated to {{the second part of the}} first century. A closer dating of the conical glass with engraved line decoration (Pl. 1, 5, Fig. 2 c) cannot be determined within the expanse of first-third century period, to which other similar specimens have been dated. Parallel to other identically designed vessels, the rectangular olla cineraria (Pl. 1, 7, Fig. 2 b) probably dates from the second part or the end of the first century and from the second century...|$|E

Razina životne i duhovne stvarnosti ovisila je o gospodarskoj i socijalnoj razini naručitelja kao i o njegovom ukusu i obrazovanju, ali i o sposobnosti kreatora i izvođača djela. U Istri, kao području života članova carskih i senatorskih obitelji, te hijerarhijski brojnih službenika, svećenika i vojnika, naručivala su se i kupovala kvalitetno izrađena umjetnička djela kao i uporabni predmeti svakodnevnog života. Keramički proizvodi s minucioznim detaljima, srebrni i zlatni nakit, posebno geme, gravirane narukvice, izrađevine su serijskog obrta u kojima se ogleda i umjetnička crta. Značajni su mozaički podni i zidni detalji od kojih se svakako izdvaja tegula vermicula s likom Dioniza iz rimske vile u Verigama na Brijunima i kompozicija “Kažnjavanje Dirke” iz urbane vile u Puli kao i fresko dekoracije rimskih prostora. Kamene skulpture Antonije Minor i Agripine Minor iz Pule visoke su umjetničke i spomeničke vrijednosti. Sve ove grupe uporabnih predmeta i rimskih spomenika većim su dijelom otkrivene u nekropolama (Pula, Medulin, Nezakcij, Savudrija, Sv. Ivan Kornetski i dr.), a pojedinačni nalazi kamene i mozaičke antičke baštine potjeću iz Poreča, Pule, Nezakcija i Plomina. craft is a skill {{involving}} {{a number of}} activities of artists and craftsmen, executors of artistic ideas and creators of templates that shape, as well as spiritually enrich, the everyday life of individuals or a community. The level of material and spiritual reality in antique Istria depended {{not only on the}} economic and social level of the client and on his taste and education, but also on the ability of the creator and executor of the work. In Istria, where members of imperial and senatorial families as well as numerous officials, priests, and soldiers lived, high-quality works of art, as well as practical everyday artefacts, were commissioned and bought. Ceramic artefacts like cups of the Sarius-Surus type, terra nigra and terra sigillata with minute details, decorations and forms, even though mass produced in moulds by craftsmen, can be considered to be more sophisticated products than large quantities of mass-produced amphorae or similar receptacles. Glass bottles, cups and plates imported from the West and East were also mass produced, but given the thickness of the glass, transparency, colour, form, and decoration, they are more sophisticated than numerous lacrimarii and other practical everyday vessels. This is why multicoloured pyxides and “millefiori” type bowls capture our attention with their unique execution and beauty. Jewellery, particularly gemstones, although made using a matrix for mass production in the workshops of Aquileia, are certainly works of art given that they were individually processed. In other words, the semiprecious stone, <b>carneol,</b> or more rarely amethyst, was engraved by hand. The same is true for amber and jet jewellery. Silver and gold jewellery and, in particular, engraved bracelets were mass produced by craftsmen, wherein artistic features can be noticed if they were individually made by a jeweller outside a typological series. Details of floor and wall mosaics are particularly significant. Tegula vermicula from the Roman villa in Verige Bay on one of the Brijuni Islands is especially distinguished as a unique example bearing the image of Dionysus. The composition “Punishment of Dirce” from an urban villa in Pula, a high-quality work of an antique mosaic maker, also has certain artistic qualities. Stone sculptures, especially portraits from the Republic era, and those of Antonia Minor and Agrippina Minor from Pula, members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and the portraits of a woman and a man of the Antoninian dynasty from Plomin, are not numerous in Istria, but certainly have high artistic value. Funerary stone monuments range from awkward stonemasonry executions to a high artistic level seen in the reliefs of the mausoleum in Pula. All these groups of practical items and Roman monuments have been recovered mainly from necropolises (Pula, Medulin, Nesactium, Savudrija, Sv. Ivan Kornetski, and others), while individual finds of the stone and mosaic antique heritage have been recovered in Poreč, Pula, Nesactium, and Plomin.
