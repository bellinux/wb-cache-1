5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E

The water content of healthy cartilage is finely balanced by <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> driving water out and hydrostatic and osmotic pressure drawing water in. Collagen fibres exert the <b>compressive</b> <b>force,</b> whereas the Gibbs–Donnan effect and cartilage proteoglycans create osmotic pressure which tends to draw water in.|$|E

This evidence is often generated in single-molecule experiments {{that are designed to}} specifically test effects of pulling forces. However, the effect of <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> on the lifetime of receptor ligand bonds remains largely unexplored. Here we extend the common usage of the atomic force microscopy technique to study whether <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> applied to bound streptavidin-biotin species can significantly accelerate the rate of dissociation. Presented experimental data indicate that <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> can substantially decrease the lifetime of the molecular bond. Surprisingly, the efficiency of accelerating dissociation by <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> sometimes exceeds the enhancement of the dissociation rate measured in pulling experiments, indicating that <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> applied to the bound species might be efficiently used to control the lifetime of adhesion bonds...|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{distribution}} of mass throughout a person's body, the magnitude of the reaction force varies between a person's feet and head. At any horizontal cross-section of a person's body (as with any column), the size of the <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> being resisted by the tissues below the cross-section is equal to the weight of the portion of the body above the cross-section.

25|$|Like {{any other}} bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar}} bone is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics using bands, wires, or appliances, an area of bone under <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation. Thus, the tooth or teeth are slowly moved along the jaw so as to achieve a dentition that works in harmony. In this way, the width of the space between the alveoli and the root is kept about the same.|$|E

2500|$|Prestressing {{concrete}} is {{a technique}} that greatly increases the load-bearing strength of concrete beams. The reinforcing steel in the bottom part of the beam, which will be subjected to tensile forces when in service, is placed in tension before the concrete is poured around it. Once the concrete has hardened, the tension on the reinforcing steel is released, placing a built-in <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> on the concrete. When loads are applied, the reinforcing steel takes on more stress and the <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> in the concrete is reduced, but does not become a tensile force.

2500|$|A {{jaw crusher}} uses <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> for {{breaking}} of particle. [...] This mechanical pressure {{is achieved by}} the two jaws of the crusher of which one is fixed while the other reciprocates. A jaw or toggle crusher consists {{of a set of}} vertical jaws, one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw, moves back and forth relative to it, by a cam or pitman mechanism, acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker. The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber. The movement of the swing jaw can be quite small, since complete crushing is not performed in one stroke. The inertia required to crush the material is provided by a weighted flywheel that moves a shaft creating an eccentric motion that causes the closing of the gap.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if using a sensor-equipped tibial insert would reduce medial (MED) and lateral (LAT) gapping and create more equivalent <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> in the MED and LAT compartments. Methods: 7 orthopedic surgeons each performed bilateral TKA on complete lower extremity cadaveric specimens. Left TKA was performed first without the use of the instrumented tibial insert. With trial components placed, the patella was reduced and joint capsule closed with towel clips. Surgeons performed varus and valgus stress tests on each knee and the mm of MED and LAT gapping were recorded. <b>Compressive</b> <b>forces</b> in the MED and LAT compartment were measured at 10 °, 45 °, and 90 ° of flexion. Sensor-assisted TKA was then performed on the right knee and <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> and gapping were again recorded. MED, LAT, and total mediolateral (ML) gapping and MED and LAT <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> were compared between conventional TKA and sensor-assisted TKA with paired t-tests. Results: Sensor-assisted TKA resulted in significantly reduced MED (1. 2 vs. 1. 9 mm, p<. 001), LAT (0. 8 vs. 1. 4 mm, p = 0. 003), and total ML gapping (2. 0 vs. 3. 4 mm, p<. 001). There were no differences in the MED and LAT <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> between conventional and sensor-assisted TKA. However, sensor-assisted TKAs demonstrated greater MED compartment forces as the knee was flexed whereas conventional TKAs had greater LAT forces. Conclusions: Sensor-assisted TKA significantly reduced MED and LAT gapping with the knee in 20 ° of flexion. Future clinical studies are needed to determine the most appropriate <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> in the MED and LAT compartments...|$|R

[...] In California, the plate is sliding northwestward along a transform boundary, the San Andreas Fault, toward the subduction zone. At the same time, the North American Plate is moving southwestward, but relatively southeast along the fault. The westward component of the North American Plate's motion results in some <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> along the San Andreas and its associated faults, thus helping lift the Pacific Coast Ranges and other parallel inland ranges {{to the west of}} the Central Valley, in this region most notably the Diablo Range. The Hayward Fault shares the same relative motions of the San Andreas.

2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{determine}} the porosity of aerogel: the three main methods are gas adsorption, mercury porosimetry, and scattering method. In gas adsorption, nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being adsorbed is dependent {{on the size of the}} pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its saturation pressure. [...] The volume of the gas adsorbed is measured by using the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller formula (BET), which gives the specific surface area of the sample. [...] At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample. [...] In mercury porosimetry, the mercury is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores' size, but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high <b>compressive</b> <b>force.</b> [...] The scattering method involves the angle-dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample. [...] The sample can be solid particles or pores. [...] The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network. [...] The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons. [...] Aerogel is also an open porous network: the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network, gases can enter and leave the substance without any limitation, while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing them to stay within the pores. The high porosity and surface area of silica aerogels allow them to be used in a variety of environmental filtration applications.|$|E
