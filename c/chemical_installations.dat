40|$|The {{frequency}} of an accident’s occurrence {{is a key}} aspect {{to take into consideration}} in the field of risk assessment. Aspects such as the human factor, which is a major cause of undesired events in process industries, are usually not considered explicitly in the frequency estimation, mainly due to the uncertainty and complexity associated to them. Failure frequencies are modified by a fuzzy modifier that has been developed in order to introduce the human factor in their estimation. The model includes variables such as Organizational Factors, Job Characteristics Factor and Personal Characteristics Factor. Applying this methodology, new values of frequencies have been obtained. To develop the fuzzy modifier the opinion of experts has been taken into account through the completion of a questionnaire. The new values are considered more realistic and accurate since the human factor is now reflected. Consequently, this improves the final risk assessment when it is applied to techniques such as QRA (Quantitative Risk Analysis).

40|$|<b>Chemical</b> process <b>installations</b> {{are exposed}} to {{aggressive}} chemicals and conditions leading to corrosion. The damage from corrosion can lead to an unexpected plant shutdown and to the exposure of people and the environment to chemicals. Due to changes within and {{on the surface of}} materials subjected to corrosion, energy is released in the form of acoustic waves. This acoustic activity can be captured and used for corrosion monitoring in <b>chemical</b> process <b>installations.</b> Wavelet packet coefficients extracted from the acoustic activity have been considered to determine whether corrosion occurs, and to identify the type of corrosion process, at least for the most important corrosion processes in the chemical process industry. Feature subset selection is then applied to these wavelet coefficients to achieve a much higher accuracy in the identification of different corrosion processes than when no feature subset selection is applied to the acoustic waves. However, due to the statistical dependencies that potentially exist between the wavelet coefficients, the latter should not be selected independently from each other. Local discriminant basis selection algorithms do not take the statistical dependencies between wavelet coefficients into account. In this paper, we have used several mutual information-based approaches that take these dependencies into account and compared them to the wavelet-specific local discriminant basis selection algorithm. Furthermore, a hybrid filter-wrapper genetic algorithm, which uses a relevance-redundancy approach as a local search procedure, was designed. The highest classification accuracies are obtained with the hybrid filter-wrapper genetic algorithm, for all classifiers used in this paper. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm easily outperformed one of the most commonly used classifiers in chemometrics: partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). A naive Bayes classifier that uses the features selected by the hybrid filter-wrapper genetic algorithm was able to identify the absence of corrosion, uniform corrosion, pitting and stress corrosion cracking, with an accuracy of up to 87. 20 %.
