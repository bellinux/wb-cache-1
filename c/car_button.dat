25|$|Räikkönen {{was handed}} a {{reprimand}} from the stewards over his late race contact with Magnussen while they elected {{not to take}} any action over the first lap incident between Button and Pérez. Magnussen was adamant that Räikkönen was {{to blame for the}} incident, saying that he drove defensively but that the driver made an overtaking attempt, while Räikkönen admitted following his contact with Chilton earlier in the race, he was willing to attempt aggressive manoeuvres. Pérez blamed Button for his retirement, saying that he was battling his teammate Hülkenberg and did not expect Button to be in the position he placed himself in {{because of the lack of}} space for another <b>car.</b> <b>Button</b> made no comment on the incident. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner reckoned that despite Vettel's turbocharger failing, the driver would not allow his frustrations to get the better of him, and stated Ricciardo's challenge on Hamilton in the event's closing period was an indication that the approach the team used was correct but noted a realistic overtake was not possible unless the challenged driver made an error.|$|E
500|$|The two Sauber {{drivers were}} eighth and ninth with Heidfeld {{in front of}} Räikkönen; Heidfeld was happy with his {{position}} after losing track time on Friday while Räikkönen complained {{that he had been}} blocked by Fisichella who was on an out lap. de la Rosa rounded out the top ten qualifiers and was happy after Jaguar engineer Humphrey Corbett corrected an issue with understeer on de la Rosa's <b>car.</b> <b>Button</b> took eleventh position and reported that his Benetton was well balanced. Frentzen took twelfth and said his qualifying position was more significant than his fourth-place finish in the Belgian Grand Prix. Irvine struggled with brake balance which shifted towards the rear of his Jaguar which meant he managed thirteenth. He also was unable to set a faster time after Olivier Panis blocked him by driving to the first corner apex and stopped his car. Fisichella used his Benetton team's spare car because his race car developed an hyradulic failure in practice but had an engine issue in the spare car which restricted him to fourteenth. BAR drivers Jacques Villeneuve and Panis took the fifteenth and seventeenth positions and both reported that {{there was a lack of}} aerodynamic grip but mechanical grip was fine. The two were separated by Alesi in the slower of the two Jordan cars and described his session as [...] " [...] the worst qualifying session I could imagine on a circuit which love" [...] because he had brake balance and handling issues. Verstappen and Bernoldi took the eighteenth and nineteenth positions for the Arrows team. Enge set the twentieth fastest time in his first Formula One qualifying session, and had two engine problems in both his race car and the spare monocoque tuned for Frentzen. The two Minardi drivers qualified at the rear of the field with Fernando Alonso ahead of Yoong; both drivers stopped on their out laps with gearbox actuator failures and were required to share the spare Minardi car.|$|E
500|$|The final race of {{the season}} was run in {{conditions}} that were never quite wet enough for drivers to use wet tyres, but never quite dry enough for slick tyres to provide enough grip. While Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton fought over the race lead, Sebastian Vettel {{was involved in a}} first-lap clash with Bruno Senna that damaged his exhaust and spun him around, relegating him to last place. Senna retired on the spot, as did Sergio Pérez, who was caught in the crossfire. The race was one of attrition, with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean also crashing out early. Button seized the lead from Hamilton, but soon found himself under pressure from Nico Hülkenberg and lost the lead to the German driver on lap 18, and second place to Hamilton shortly thereafter. The field stabilised themselves after the first round of stops, with Vettel in the lower points and Fernando Alonso running fourth when he needed a podium to stand any chance of being champion. Hülkenberg spun on lap 48 and lost the lead to Hamilton, but caught the McLaren on lap 54 as they encountered lapped traffic. The two made contact in the first corner, forcing Hamilton out of the race and earning Hülkenberg a drive-through penalty for causing an avoidable accident. In the wake of their collision, Button re-took the lead and held on {{to the end of the}} race. Meanwhile, the rain intensified, prompting teams to scramble for tyres. Hülkenberg's penalty and Hamilton's retirement promoted Alonso to the podium, which became second place when team-mate Felipe Massa yielded for him. A slow stop for Vettel relegated him to twelfth and swinging the balance of power in Alonso's favour. In the last ten laps of the race, Vettel began to make his way back up the order until he was seventh, just enough to secure the title, but leaving him vulnerable if the damage he received on the first lap – which by now had left a long crack running along the floor of his car – got worse. Vettel's seventh became sixth when Michael Schumacher moved aside to let Vettel through. Two laps from the end of the race, Paul di Resta crashed heavily as he came onto the main straight, forcing the deployment of the safety <b>car.</b> <b>Button</b> won the race, with Alonso second and Massa third, but Vettel's sixth place was enough to secure his third consecutive World Drivers' Championship. Kimi Räikkönen finished the season third overall, having benefited from Hamilton's retirement to hold onto the place following a bizarre incident in which he left the circuit and attempted to rejoin by taking to the support paddock pit lane, only to find the way blocked and forcing him to double back and find another way onto the circuit. In his final race in Formula One, Schumacher's seventh place saw him finish the season in thirteenth place overall; his worst performance over a season since he contested six rounds during the [...] season. In the World Constructors' Championship, Ferrari secured second place from McLaren with two cars on the podium, while Kamui Kobayashi's ninth place was not enough for Sauber to take fifth from Mercedes, and Marussia lost tenth place to Caterham when Vitaly Petrov secured the team's best result of the season with eleventh place. Nikolai Fomenko, Marussia's director of engineering, later claimed that Charles Pic had deliberately let Petrov through, as Pic had announced his move to Caterham for the [...] season two days before the race; however, no action was taken by the FIA in response to these claims.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{reverse engineering}} of <b>car</b> volume <b>button.</b> The purpose of {{article is to}} introduce reverse engineering procedure, {{what we need to}} do this kind of procedure and how we can remanufacture <b>car's</b> volume <b>button.</b> The purpose of reverse engineering is to manufacture another object based on a physic and existing object for which 3 D CAD is not available. The first we need digital version of object. Because our <b>car's</b> volume <b>button</b> has free formed surfaces we decided to use 3 D scanning technology to obtain the point cloud of existing object. With the help of point cloud we can developed 3 D CAD model which will be used for manufacturing of button pair. We used for manufacturing of pair of buttons machine for selective laser sintering Formiga P 100. In the paper are also described costs of making of one pair of buttons and whole workspace...|$|R

50|$|The Australian Grand Prix was {{not free}} of {{incidents}} in the last laps. On the very final lap, in the final 2 corners, Jenson Button blew his engine, causing Fisichella right behind him to be covered in oil and struggling to control the <b>car.</b> <b>Button</b> ended up stalling the car about 10 metres from the finish line. He did so deliberately, giving up a points-scoring position, to avoid a 10 place position penalty in the next race.|$|E

50|$|Starting with 1996's <b>Car</b> <b>Button</b> Cloth and {{continuing}} through the present, the band membership has been fluid, {{with the name}} The Lemonheads generally being used by whomever Evan Dando had recruited to record and/or play with at the time. Their last official release was 2009's collection of cover songs Varshons. Several announcements of albums or tours involving any number of musicians have been announced over the years since then, most recently a 2012 project involving Ben Deily, Juliana Hatfield, and Ryan Adams, but as yet no major recordings or substantial tours have materialized.|$|E
5000|$|Dando re-formed The Lemonheads {{with former}} member John Strohm on guitar, Bill Gibson, former bassist of Australian band The Eastern Dark, and Patrick Murphy, {{a former member}} of Dinosaur Jr, on drums. The group {{released}} the album <b>Car</b> <b>Button</b> Cloth in 1996. The album featured [...] "jangly guitar songs" [...] such as [...] "If I Could Talk I'd Tell You," [...] and some writing that showed off Dando's darker side in [...] "Break Me" [...] and [...] "Losing Your Mind". In 1997 the band went on tour and played its final gig at the Reading Festival, after which the band went on hiatus.|$|E
50|$|The MP4-25 {{proved to}} be a stark {{improvement}} over the McLaren MP4-24 with both Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton reaching the third stage of qualifying at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix. Hamilton got the better of the car in Q3 placing the car fourth on the grid with Button managing eighth. During the race the car proved lacking in downforce causing it to struggle {{to keep up with the}} pace of the Ferraris and Sebastian Vettel who opened up an impressive lead. During an uneventful race Hamilton finished third thanks to a problem with Vettel's <b>car,</b> <b>Button</b> also picked up a place during the race and finished seventh.|$|E

Vettel made his second pit stop for intermediate tyres that lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams <b>cars.</b> <b>Button</b> recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth {{position on}} the lap. Button made a second pit stop for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; it took longer than expected because his pit crew changed his steering wheel, and he came out behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton; Rosberg made his second pit stop (for new intermediate tyres) on lap 33, and came out behind Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced understeer and spun 360 degrees after running onto the run-off area. Hamilton made a pit stop at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36. Ricciardo took the lead until his pit stop during that lap and came out behind the two Mercedes drivers, Vettel and Button.|$|R

5000|$|TAG Recordings was {{an imprint}} of Atlantic Records started in 1994. TAG had been {{intended}} to host Atlantic's stable of alternative rock artists and {{capitalize on the}} wild popularity of alternative and grunge rock at that time. The label handled artists such as Fountains of Wayne, The Inbreds, The Lemonheads (first signed to Atlantic and then moved to TAG Recordings for their album <b>Car</b> <b>Button</b> Cloth), The Bottle Rockets [...] and Jawbox. Due in part to poor sales of the latter band's self-titled album, {{as well as a}} corporate shakeup at Atlantic, the label was shut down in 1996 and Fountains of Wayne was transferred to Atlantic, on which they released Utopia Parkway. The Inbreds were one of the first bands signed by TAG Recording's head of A&R, Leyla Turkkan, and their first album was Kombinator.|$|E
50|$|The Lemonheads are an {{alternative}} rock band formed in 1986 in Boston, Massachusetts featuring guitarist, vocalist and songwriter Evan Dando, {{who is the}} only original member left in the current Lemonheads line-up. Current members in addition to Dando are Karl Alvarez, Vess Ruhtenberg, Bill Stevenson and Devon Ashley; previous members include original band co-founder Ben Deily, and Juliana Hatfield. The first Lemonheads album, Hate Your Friends, was released in 1987 on punk/underground label Taang! Records. After releasing two more albums {{in the next two}} years, both of which performed well on North American college radio, the band parted ways with Taang! and signed to Atlantic in 1990. Over this period, the band's fame rose, as did their charting positions. After the 1996 release of the <b>Car</b> <b>Button</b> Cloth album, The Lemonheads went on an extended hiatus before reuniting in the early 2000s. In their recording career, the band has released eight studio albums, two compilation albums, three extended plays and 15 singles.|$|E
50|$|Hamilton and Kobayashi pitted on lap 31, one lap after Räikkönen, who Hamilton was {{competing}} with now for fifth spot. He overtook him at Turn 1 {{on the following}} lap. On lap 34, Narain Karthikeyan retired his HRT into the garage due to vibrations in the <b>car.</b> <b>Button,</b> Massa and Vettel piited on laps 35, 36 and 38 respectively, and all retained their positions in fourth, second and first, with Kobayashi in third. Michael Schumacher, who had started twenty-third and opted for a different tyre strategy, was left as the only driver on the softer tyres when he pitted on lap 37. He {{spent much of the}} remainder of the race behind the Toro Rosso of Daniel Ricciardo, fighting for tenth place, but never eventually gaining it due to some impressive defending. On lap 41, Charles Pic drove his Marussia into the pit garage with engine failure. Button spent the final stint of the race closing to within one second of Kobayashi, but never managing to overtake the Sauber driver.|$|E
