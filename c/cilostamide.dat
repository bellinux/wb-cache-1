40|$|Introduction: It {{was shown}} in a {{previous}} study, that MCPIP, a <b>cilostamide</b> derivative, increased atrial contraction force without changing contraction rate. To improve this property, two new derivatives of <b>cilostamide</b> were synthesized and their effects on PDE 3 activity and isolated rat atria contraction were investigated. Methods: The inhibitory effect of each compound on PDE 3 enzyme was determined. Reserpine-treated rat atria were separated and suspended in an organ bath containing Krebs-Henseleit buffer. The effects of each compound alone or in combination with isoprenaline were assessed. Results: Mc 2 and mbc 2 inhibited PDE 3 activity with a potency lower than <b>cilostamide,</b> while they increased the contraction force with a higher efficacy (percentage higher than base line, cilostamide= 19 ± 3 %, P <b>cilostamide).</b> Atrial contraction rate was increased {{in the presence of}} <b>cilostamide</b> or isoprenaline, but was not changed with synthetic compounds. Furthermore, the effect of isoprenaline on the contraction rate was inhibited by synthetic compounds (percentage higher than base line, isoprenaline= 68 ± 9 %, +mc 2 = 6 ± 5 % and +mbc 2 = 36 ± 6 %) and was not changed in the presence of <b>cilostamide.</b> Conclusion: The synthetic compounds induced an increase in the atrial contraction force that was higher than <b>cilostamide</b> and was not correlated to their PDE 3 inhibition. These compounds potentiated the effect of isoprenaline on the contraction force which excludes the possibility of their inhibitory effect on the receptor. In addition to PDE 3 inhibition, other mechanisms are involved in producing the effects of these compounds, which are not clear and needs further investigation...|$|E

In the double-injury model, the second balloon injury caused more severe intimal hyperplasia (intima/media (IM) ratio, 1. 88 ± 0. 10) than in the single-injury model (1. 09 ± 0. 08). Histopathological study revealed that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) were the predominant cell-type in the affected neointimal area. Oral administration of <b>cilostamide</b> for 2 weeks after the second injury suppressed intimal hyperplasia in the double-injury model (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 bid, 83 % inhibition {{in terms of the}} IM ratio, P< 0. 05; 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 bid, 69 % inhibition, P< 0. 05). Similar effects were also observed in the single-injury model with oral administration of <b>cilostamide</b> for 2 weeks (100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 bid, 36 % inhibition, P< 0. 01). <b>Cilostamide</b> inhibited DNA synthesis of cultured VSMC stimulated by foetal calf serum or different kinds of growth factors, but did not affect their migration stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -BB. <b>Cilostamide</b> significantly increased the cyclic AMP concentration of VSMC dose-dependently. These results indicate that <b>cilostamide</b> suppresses intimal hyperplasia both in the single- and double-injury models of rat, presumably by inhibiting proliferation rather than migration of VSMC. It is suggested that PDE 3 inhibitors might find application in preventing intimal hyperplasia following angioplasty such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or stent...|$|E

The combination of <b>cilostamide</b> and rolipram caused CGP 12177 to enhance contractile force with −logEC 50 M= 7. 7 and Emax= 178 %. The positive inotropic effects of noradrenaline (−logEC 50 M= 6. 9) were potentiated by rolipram (−logEC 50 M= 7. 4) but not by <b>cilostamide</b> (−logEC 50 M= 7. 0).

We sought to unravel the role of PDE 3 and PDE 4 on signals through the H and L sites in human myocardium. The kinetics of matching positive inotropic effects of (-) -noradrenaline (20 nM) and (-) -CGP 12177 (100 nM) were investigated on human atrial trabeculae in the absence and presence of the PDE 3 inhibitor <b>cilostamide</b> (300 nM), PDE 4 inhibitor rolipram (1 mu M) or both. The influence of <b>cilostamide</b> and rolipram on agonist-evoked cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increases were also compared in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing recombinant human beta(1) -adrenoceptors. (-) -Noradrenaline and (-) -CGP 12177 caused matching inotropic responses that faded during a 60 -min time course. <b>Cilostamide,</b> but not rolipram, increased the positive inotropic effects and abolished the time dependent fade of both agonists.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Phosphodiesterases PDE 3 and/or PDE 4 control {{ventricular}} effects of catecholamines in several species but their relative effects in failing human ventricle are unknown. We investigated whether the PDE 3 -selective inhibitor <b>cilostamide</b> (0. 3 - 1 μM) or PDE 4 inhibitor rolipram (1 - 10 μM) modified the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of catecholamines in human failing myocardium. Experimental approach Right and left ventricular trabeculae from freshly explanted hearts of 5 non-β-blocker-treated and 15 metoprolol-treated patients with terminal heart failure were paced to contract at 1 Hz. The effects of (-) -noradrenaline, mediated through β 1 -adrenoceptors (β 2 -adrenoceptors blocked with ICI 118551), and (-) -adrenaline, mediated through β 2 -adrenoceptors (β 1 -adrenoceptors blocked with CGP 20712 A), were assessed {{in the absence}} and presence of PDE inhibitors. Catecholamine potencies were estimated from –logEC 50 s. Key results <b>Cilostamide</b> did not significantly potentiate the inotropic effects of the catecholamines in non-β-blocker-treated patients. <b>Cilostamide</b> caused greater potentiation (P= 0. 037) of the positive inotropic effects of (-) -adrenaline (0. 78 ± 0. 12 log units) than (-) -noradrenaline (0. 47 ± 0. 12 log units) in metoprolol-treated patients. Lusitropic effects of the catecholamines were also potentiated by <b>cilostamide.</b> Rolipram {{did not affect the}} inotropic and lusitropic potencies of (-) -noradrenaline or (-) -adrenaline on right and left ventricular trabeculae from metoprolol-treated patients. Conclusions and implications Metoprolol induces a control by PDE 3 of ventricular effects mediated through both β 1 - and β 2 -adrenoceptors, thereby further reducing sympathetic cardiostimulation in patients with terminal heart failure. Concurrent therapy with a PDE 3 blocker and metoprolol could conceivably facilitate cardiostimulation evoked by adrenaline through β 2 -adrenoceptors. PDE 4 does not appear to reduce inotropic and lusitropic effects of catecholamines in failing human ventricle. ...|$|E

Forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP strongly (by 60 - 70 %) inhibited [3 H]thymidine incorporation into MC. <b>Cilostamide,</b> lixazinone or cilostazol selective inhibitors of cAMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozyme PDE-III, inhibited mitogenesis to similar extent as forskolin and DBcAMP and activated in situ PKA, but without detectable increase in cAMP levels. <b>Cilostamide</b> and cilostazol were {{more than three times}} more effective at inhibiting mesangial mitogenesis than rolipram and denbufylline, inhibitors of isozyme PDE-IV, even though PDE-IV was two times more abundant in MC than was PDE-III. On the other hand, when incubated with forskolin, rolipram-enhanced cAMP accumulation was far greater (10 - 100 x) than with <b>cilostamide.</b> EGF increased MAPK activity (+ 300 %); PDE isozyme inhibitors which suppressed mitogenesis also inhibited MAPK. PDE isozyme inhibitors also suppressed PDGF-stimulated MC proliferation. We conclude that cAMP inhibits the mitogen-dependent MAPK-signaling pathway probably by decreasing the activity of Raf- 1 due to PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation. Further, we surmise that minor increase in the cAMP pool metabolized by PDE-III is intimately related to regulation of mesangial proliferation. Thus, PDE isozyme inhibitors have the potential to suppress MC proliferation by a focused effect upon signaling pathways...|$|E
40|$|Protein kinase D (PKD) targets several {{proteins}} in the heart, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and class II histone deacetylases, and regulates cardiac contraction and hypertrophy. In adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM), PKD activation by endothelin- 1 (ET 1) occurs via protein kinase Cε and is attenuated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Intracellular compartmentalisation of cAMP, arising from localised activity of distinct cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms, {{may result in}} spatially constrained regulation of the PKA activity that inhibits PKD activation. We have investigated {{the roles of the}} predominant cardiac PDE isoforms, PDE 2, PDE 3 and PDE 4, in PKA-mediated inhibition of PKD activation. Pretreatment of ARVM with the non-selective PDE inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) attenuated subsequent PKD activation by ET 1. However, selective inhibition of PDE 2 [by erythro- 9 -(2 -hydroxy- 3 -nonyl) adenine, EHNA], PDE 3 (by <b>cilostamide)</b> or PDE 4 (by rolipram) individually had no effect on ET 1 -induced PKD activation. Selective inhibition of individual PDE isoforms also had no effect on the phosphorylation status of the established cardiac PKA substrates phospholamban (PLB; at Ser 16) and cTnI (at Ser 22 / 23), which increased markedly with IBMX. Combined administration of <b>cilostamide</b> and rolipram, like IBMX alone, attenuated ET 1 -induced PKD activation and increased PLB and cTnI phosphorylation, while combined administration of EHNA and <b>cilostamide</b> or EHNA and rolipram was ineffective. Thus, cAMP pools controlled by PDE 3 and PDE 4, but not PDE 2, regulate the PKA activity that inhibits ET 1 -induced PKD activation. Furthermore, PDE 3 and PDE 4 play redundant roles in this process, such that inhibition of both isoforms is required to achieve PKA-mediated attenuation of PKD activation...|$|E

Treatment of VSMC with either forskolin or 8 -bromo-cyclic AMP caused significant concentration- and time-dependent increases in total cellular cyclic AMP PDE activity. Using <b>cilostamide</b> or Ro 20 - 1724, we demonstrated that both PDE 3 and PDE 4 activities were increased following forskolin or 8 -bromo-cyclic AMP treatment, with a relatively larger effect observed on PDE 3 activity. The increase in cyclic AMP PDE activity induced by forskolin or 8 -bromo-cyclic AMP was inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, demonstrating that new mRNA synthesis and protein synthesis were required. An analogue of forskolin which does not activate adenylyl cyclase (1, 9 -dideoxyforskolin) or an analogue of cyclic GMP (8 -bromo-cyclic GMP) did not affect total cyclic AMP PDE activity. Incubation of VSMC with 8 -bromo-cyclic AMP for 16 [*]h caused a marked rightward shift in the concentration-response curves for both isoprenaline- and forskolin-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. A role for up-regulated cyclic AMP PDE activity in this reduced potency is supported by our observation that cyclic AMP PDE inhibitors (IBMX, <b>cilostamide</b> or Ro 20 - 1724) partially normalized the effects of isoprenaline or forskolin in treated cells to those in untreated cells. We conclude that VSMC cyclic AMP PDE activity is increased following long-term elevation of cyclic AMP and that increases in PDE 3 and PDE 4 activities {{account for more than}} 70 % of this effect. Furthermore, we conclude that increases in cyclic AMP PDE activity contribute to the reduced potency of isoprenaline or forskolin in treated VSMC.

IBMX (100 [*]μM), a broad-spectrum PDE inhibitor, increased basal ICa by 120 % and [cAMP]i by 70 %, similarly to a saturating concentration of the β-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (1 [*]μM).

Each selective PDE inhibitor was then tested in the presence of another inhibitor to examine whether a concomitant inhibition of two PDE subtypes had any effect on ICa or [cAMP]i. While all combinations tested significantly increased [cAMP]i (40 – 50 %), only <b>cilostamide</b> (0. 1 [*]μM) +Ro 20 - 1724 (0. 1 [*]μM) produced a significant stimulation of ICa (50 %). Addition of EHNA (10 [*]μM) to this mix increased ICa to 110 % and [cAMP]i to 70 % above basal, i. e. to similar levels as obtained with IBMX (100 [*]μM) or isoprenaline (1 [*]μM). When tested on top of a sub-maximal concentration of isoprenaline (1 [*]nM), which increased ICa by (≈ 40 % and had negligible effect on [cAMP]i, each selective PDE inhibitor induced a clear stimulation of [cAMP]i and an additional increase in ICa.

Abattoir-derived sheep COCs were cultured for 2 hours (pre-IVM) in 100 μM forskolin (FSK) plus 500 μM 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX). Pre-IVM (100 μM FSK and 500 μM IBMX) culture increased COC cAMP concentrations 10 -fold compared with controls (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) {{signalling}} pathway {{is involved}} in the control of different biological processes such as survival, proliferation and differentiation. In PC 12 cells, the ERK signalling pathway integrates different external stimuli: epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the ERK pathway transiently and induces cell proliferation, whereas nerve growth factor (NGF) induces sustained activation of ERK and promotes cell differentiation into sympathetic-like neurons. The second messenger 3 ’, 5 ’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) controls a plethora of cellular events from metabolic to cellular signalling pathways. Over the years, lines of evidence have shown that cAMP is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and cell differentiation, suggesting a possible crosstalk between these two pathways. Selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors were used to block the degradation of cAMP. These inhibitors increased the level of cAMP, but had different effects on the activation of ERK. Upon both NGF and EGF stimulations, <b>cilostamide</b> had the strongest effect and doubled the intensity of the phosphorylation of ERK, identifying PDE 3 to control the level of cAMP relevant for the regulation of the ERK pathway. The treatment with <b>cilostamide</b> enhanced the differentiation of PC 12 cells and the combination of both <b>cilostamide</b> and rolipram (a PDE 4 inhibitor) turned the proliferative effect of EGF into a differentiation effect. The route for cAMP in the regulation of the ERK pathway was decomposed by using the cAMP analogues 8 -pCPT- 2 ’-O-Me-cAMP and 6 -Bnz-cAMP. They specifically activate the Exchange protein activated by cyclic AMP (Epac) and the cAMP regulated protein kinase (PKA) respectively, which were hypothesised to be the effectors of cAMP in the regulation of ERK. The Epac agonist mimicked the effects of <b>cilostamide</b> on the activation of ERK, but failed to enhance cell differentiation. The PKA agonist reduced the phosphorylation ERK upon EGF. It was suggested that the activation of ERK in response to cAMP was mainly mediated through Epac rather than PKA, and that the activation of both PKA and Epac are required to induce cellular differentiation. To elucidate the differential regulation of the activation of ERK upon NGF and EGF stimulation and in response to cAMP, the activity of Ras and Rap 1 were measured by affinity pulldown assays. Upon EGF the signal was transduced through Ras only, whereas upon NGF the signal was mediated through both Ras and Rap 1. cAMP sensitised Rap 1 that became activated upon EGF stimulation indicating that cAMP can switch on the Rap 1 /B-Raf pathway. This correlated with the increase in the phosphorylation of ERK in response to high levels of cAMP upon EGF stimulation. Then, the role of Raf- 1 and C 3 G, a guanine exchange factor for Rap 1, were investigated using small interfering RNA. The depletion of Raf- 1 showed that Raf- 1 is not essential for transducing the mitogen signal upon NGF stimulation and suggested that Ras mediates the signal through B-Raf upon EGF stimulation to compensate for the loss of Raf- 1. The depletion of C 3 G also confirmed that the activation of ERK in response to cAMP is mediated through the Rap 1 /B-Raf pathway. Finally, the interaction between Raf- 1 and AKAP 79 was demonstrated for the first time suggesting the existence of a complex between Raf- 1, AKAP and PKA and therefore a possible molecular mechanism for the inhibition of Raf- 1 by cAMP through PKA. The data presented in this thesis demonstrates that cAMP participates to finely tune the regulation of the ERK signalling pathway and can be use as a tool to elucidate the network comprising the ERK cascade...|$|E

Incubation of mesangial cells (MC) with NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) enhanced both basal and 8 -bromo-cAMP–stimulated GJIC as well as expression of gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx 43). This potentiating action of SNAP on Cx 43 expression was mimicked by two other NO donors and significantly blocked by soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3,-�]quinoxalin- 1 – 1. Guanosine 3 �, 5 �-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) analogue 8 -bromo-cGMP exerted an effect similar to NO, whereas another cGMP analogue, 8 -pCPT-cGMP, which selectively activates cGMP-dependent kinase without affecting cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE 3), had no effect. Moreover, the synergistic action of NO on Cx 43 expression was completely prevented by protein kinase A inhibitor H 89 but not by cGMP-dependent kinase inhibitor Rp- 8 -Br-PET-cGMP.

But, mc 6 failed to potentiate the effect of isoprenalin; mc 3 and mc 4 did not increase ACF, which may be because of their higher hydrophilic nature. It was interesting that mc 2, alone or in combination with isoprenaline, produced the highest inotropic effect while it did not affect the basal contraction rate and almost blocked the isoprenaline chronotropic effect. Conclusion: Combination of mc 2 with isoprenaline had synergistic effect on inotropic effect, but this combination reduced isoprenaline chronotropic effect; therefore, these effects cannot be related to reducing B-adrenergic receptors activity. These compounds showed different effects; probably all of them were not mediated via PDE 3 inhibition and other mechanisms are involving...|$|E

The cGI-PDE, which constituted {{about half of the}} high affinity cAMP-PDE activity of a tissue homogenate, was identified with a 105 -kDa protein on SDS-PAGE through use of antibodies towards the human platelet, bovine cardiac and bovine adipose tissue cGI-PDE in Western blot and immunoprecipitation/immunoinactivation analysis. As observed during purification of the enzyme from other tissues the enzyme protein was exquisitely sensitive to proteolytic nicking during purification, resulting in several 30 - 77 -kDa polypeptide fragments. Rapid immunoprecipitation from fresh tissue extracts was the only was found to partially prevent the proteolysis. The native enzyme had apparent molecular sizes of approx. 100, 000 or, mainly approx. 220, 000 by gel chromatography, presumably indicating the presence of monomeric and dimeric forms. The enzyme hydrolyzed cAMP and cGMP with normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km of 0. 16 and 0. 09 microM, respectively, with Vmax for hydrolysis of cAMP of 0. 3 compared to 3. 1 mumol/min per mg protein for cAMP.

The cGI-PDE was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase as has been reported for the analogous enzymes in heart, adipose tissue and platelets.

The second aim was to find the effect of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) supplementation on oocyte maturation rate and on ROS/TAC levels during IVM. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, mouse germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes divided into cumulus denuded oocytes (DOs) and cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) groups. GVs were matured in vitro in the presence or absence of ALA only for 18 hours (control) or with pre-culture of forskolin plus <b>cilostamide</b> for an additional 18 hours. Matured oocytes obtained following 18 and 36 hours based on experimental design. In parallel, the ROS and TAC levels were measured at different time (0, 18 and 36 hours) by 2 ', 7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) probe and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, respectively.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of cGMP generated by particulate and soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC) on the 5 -HT 4 -mediated inotropic response. Extensive myocardial infarctions were induced by coronary artery ligation in Wistar rats, exhibiting heart failure 6  weeks after surgery. Contractility was measured in left ventricular preparations. Cyclic GMP was measured by EIA. In ventricular preparations, ANP or BNP displayed no impact on 5 -HT 4 -mediated inotropic response. However, CNP increased the 5 -HT 4 -mediated inotropic response as well as the β 1 -adrenoceptor (β 1 -AR) -mediated response to a similar extent as PDE 3 inhibition by <b>cilostamide.</b> Pretreatment with <b>cilostamide</b> eliminated the effect of CNP. Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and soluble GC by l-NAME and ODQ, respectively, attenuated the 5 -HT 4 -mediated inotropic response, whereas the NO donor Sin- 1 increased this response. The effects were absent during PDE 3 inhibition, suggesting cGMP-dependent inhibition of PDE 3. However, in contrast to the effects on the 5 -HT 4 response, Sin- 1 inhibited whereas l-NAME and ODQ enhanced the β 1 -AR-mediated inotropic response. cGMP generated both by particulate (NPR-B) and soluble GC increases the 5 -HT 4 -mediated inotropic response in failing hearts, probably through inhibition of PDE 3. β 1 -AR and 5 -HT 4 receptor signalling are subject to opposite regulatory control by cGMP generated by soluble GC in failing hearts.

However, {{it is not}} known whether carvedilol has the same effect. We investigated whether the PDE 3 -selective inhibitor <b>cilostamide</b> (0. 3 mu M) or PDE 4 -selective inhibitor rolipram (1 mu M) modified the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of catecholamines in ventricular myocardium of heart failure patients treated with carvedilol.

The effects of (-) -noradrenaline, mediated through beta(1) -adrenoceptors (beta(2) -adrenoceptors blocked with ICI 118551), and (-) -adrenaline, mediated through beta(2) -adrenoceptors (beta(1) -adrenoceptors blocked with CGP 20712 A), were assessed in the absence and presence of the PDE inhibitors. The inotropic potency, estimated from -logEC(50) s, was unchanged for (-) -noradrenaline but decreased 16 -fold for (-) -adrenaline in carvedilol-treated compared to non-beta-blocker-treated patients, consistent with the previously reported beta(2) -adrenoceptor-selectivity of carvedilol. <b>Cilostamide</b> caused 2 - to 3 -fold and 10 - to 35 -fold potentiations of the inotropic and lusitropic effects of (-) -noradrenaline and (-) -adrenaline, respectively, in trabeculae from carvedilol-treated patients. Rolipram did not affect the inotropic and lusitropic potencies of (-) -noradrenaline or (-) -adrenaline. Treatment of heart failure patients with carvedilol induces PDE 3 to selectively control the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects mediated through ventricular beta(2) -adrenoceptors compared to beta(1) -adrenoceptors. The beta(2) -adrenoceptor-selectivity of carvedilol may provide protection against beta(2) -adrenoceptor-mediated ventricular overstimulation in PDE 3 inhibitor-treated patients.

40|$|Abstract Background The ovulatory {{surge of}} gonadotropins {{triggers}} oocyte maturation and rupture of the ovarian follicle. The resumption of nuclear maturation in the oocyte from the prophase stage {{is characterized by}} germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). It has previously been shown that specific inhibition of cAMP degradation by PDE 3 prevents the resumption of oocyte meiosis. However, no report has characterized the activity of PDE 3 in the porcine oocyte, or the implication of the cAMP-PDE 3 pathway in the entire nuclear maturation process. In this study, PDE 3 activity in the oocyte was assessed during in vitro maturation (IVM) and the possible roles of the cAMP-PDE 3 pathway in the resumption and progression of meiosis were investigated in terms of different models of oocyte maturation. Results Cyclic AMP-degrading PDE activity was detected in the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) and was partially inhibited by a specific PDE 3 inhibitor, <b>cilostamide.</b> When measured only in the denuded oocyte, PDE activity was almost completely inhibited by <b>cilostamide,</b> suggesting that cAMP-PDE 3 activity is the major cAMP-PDE in porcine oocytes. PDE 3 A mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. PDE 3 activity did not vary significantly during {{the early hours of}} IVM, but a maximum was observed at 13 hours. In cumulus-oocyte complexes, meiosis resumed after 20. 81 hours of culture. PDE 3 inhibition no longer maintained meiotic arrest if sustained beyond 17. 65 hours of IVM, 3 hours prior to resumption of meiosis. Thereafter, PDE 3 inhibition progressively lost its efficacy in GVBD. When the protein phosphatase 1 and 2 A inhibitor okadaic acid was continuously or transiently (3 hours) present during IVM, meiosis resumed prematurely; PDE 3 inhibition was unable to prevent GVBD. However, PDE 3 inhibition in COC treated with OA for 3 hours significantly delayed meiosis at the intermediate stage. Conclusion The present investigation has demonstrated that PDE 3 A is the major cAMP-degrading PDE in the oocyte. It regulates the resumption of meiosis until 3 hours prior to GVBD and transiently affects meiotic progression. </p...|$|E

Modulation of individual PDE families is now pos-sible with the use of newly developed type-specific PDE inhib-itors. This study evaluated the role of type 3 - and type 4 -specific PDE inhibitors on the meiotic arrest of bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) and denuded oocytes (DOs). It also evaluated the role of these specific inhibitors on meiotic arrest when COCs are incubated in {{the presence or absence of}} theca cell monolayers. Bovine COCs were aspirated from ovaries collected at the abattoir. Denuded oocytes and COCs were incubated for 12 h in culture medium alone or culture medium containing the type 3 PDE inhibitors <b>cilostamide</b> (10 and 20 mM) or milrinone (10 and 50 mM) or the type 4 PDE inhibitor rolipram (10 and 50 mM). Oocytes were then fixed and classified according to the status of nuclear maturation. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were coincubated with untreated theca cell monolayers or theca cell monolayers treated with the different specific PDE inhibi-tors. Bovine COCs or DOs incubated in culture medium re-sumed meiosis, but supplementation of the culture medium with the PDE 3 inhibitors <b>cilostamide</b> or milrinone resulted in meiotic arrest. On the other hand, supplementation of the culture me-dium with rolipram did not prevent oocyte maturation. Further-more, PDE 3 inhibitors, but not PDE 4 inhibitors, had an additive effect on the inhibitory action of theca cell monolayers on oo-cyte maturation. These data support the hypothesis that inhibi-tion of PDE 3 prevents the meiotic resumption of bovine oocytes, whereas inhibition of PDE 4 does not block oocyte maturation even under normally inhibitory conditions. The additive effect of PDE 3 inhibitors on the ability of theca cells to maintain bo-vine oocytes in meiotic arrest suggests that type 3 PDE has an important role in meiotic resumption of bovine oocytes. cyclic adenosine monophosphate, meiosis, ovum, phosphodies-terases, theca cell...|$|E

Pertussis toxin pretreatment, which maximally ADP-ribosylated Gi, the guanine nucleotide-binding protein that couples inhibitory receptors to adenylate cyclase and blocks receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, did not interfere with ANF suppression of isoproterenol- or PGE 1 -elevated cellular cAMP content.

Key components of these systems are PDEs, enzymes that modulate the amplitude, duration, termination, and specificity of cAMP and cGMP signaling.

The birthweight of PR offspring did not significantly differ from that of C offspring. Systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated in PR compared with C (p < 0. 05). Maximal vascular contraction to phenylephrine and the thromboxane analog U 46619 were similar in C and PR offspring at postnatal d 87 and 164.

The transcript levels of glucagon receptors were {{about three times}} higher in sinoatrial node than in the atrial myocardium. Chronotropic responses to glucagon and isoproterenol were blunted by the funny current (If) inhibitor ZD 7288. Inhibitors of protein kinase A, H- 89 and KT- 5720 reduced the chronotropic response to glucagon but not to isoproterenol. Inhibition of ryanodine receptors and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (important regulators of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release), with ruthenium red and KN- 62 respectively, failed to alter chronotropic responses of either glucagon or isoproterenol. Non selective inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) with 3 -isobutylmethylxantine or selective inhibition of PDE 3 or PDE 4 with <b>cilostamide</b> or rolipram respectively did not affect chronotropic effects of glucagon or isoproterenol.

It was reported previously that the prostacyclin analog iloprost stimulated receptor-mediated increases in cAMP in rabbit and human erythrocytes. However, the PDEs that hydrolyze erythrocyte cAMP synthesized in response to iloprost were not identified.

When protease inhibitors were absent during homogenization and centrifugation, this platelet phosphodiesterase was susceptible to sequential proteolysis forming 80 -kDa and 60 -kDa peptides.

Ovaries were obtained from an abattoir and cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) were aspirated from antral follicles into culture medium supplemented with 4 mg/ml BSA and 2 mM 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX). COC, denuded oocytes (DO), or mural granulosa cells (MGC) were cultured either with or without forskolin or FSH, in the presence of specific PDE inhibitors; either milrinone (PDE 3 inhibitor), <b>cilostamide</b> (PDE 3 inhibitor), or rolipram (PDE 4 inhibitor).

Both signaling molecules are degraded by the superfamily of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) consisting of more than 50 different isoforms. Several of these PDEs are implicated in disease processes inspiring the quest for and synthesis of selective PDE inhibitors, that unfortunately have led to very mixed successes in clinical trials. This may be partially caused by their pharmacological action. Accumulating data suggests that small differences between different PDE isoforms may already result in specific tissue distributions, cellular localization and different involvement in higher order signal protein complexes. The role of PDEs in these higher order signal protein complexes has only been marginally addressed, as no screening methodology is available to address this in a more comprehensive way. Affinity based chemical proteomics is a relatively new tool to identify specific protein-protein interactions.

However, <b>cilostamide</b> (0. 1, 0. 3, and 1 mg/kg/min), a selective phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, {{did not affect the}} val-ues of these parameters. Indomethacin (3 mg/kg i. v. bolus and 1 mg/kg/min i. v. infusion), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, reduced the basal arterial and renal venous plasma cAMP concentra-tions and blunted the rolipram-induced elevation of cAMP con-centrations and urinary cAMP excretion. The effects of rolipram on renal hemodynamics and urine formation were attenuated in the presence of indomethacin. These results suggest that in the dog kidney in vivo, 1) phosphodiesterase IV, but not phospho-diesterase III, participates in degradation of cAMP and 2) the inhibition of phosphodiesterase IV enhances glomerular filtra-tion and urinary Na 1 excretion, the responses of which depend in part on indomethacin-susceptible (prostaglandin-mediated, probably) control of basal cAMP level. cAMP has been suggested to participate in the control of renal functions.
