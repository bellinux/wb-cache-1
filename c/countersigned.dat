5|$|Contrary to its {{misleading}} title, the Manifesto of the Sixteen {{had originally}} fifteen signatories—among them {{some of the}} most eminent anarchists in Europe—and was later <b>countersigned</b> by another hundred. The position of the Manifesto was in stark contrast to that of most anarchists of the day, many of whom denounced its signatories and their sympathizers, and accused them of betraying anarchist principles. In the fallout over the war, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated, with many former friends cutting their ties to him. The Russian anarchist movement was split into two, with a faction supporting Kropotkin's position to the strong criticism of the Bolsheviks. Elsewhere in Europe, including in the Spanish and Swiss anarchist movements, the dismissal of the Manifesto was overwhelming, with supporters being angrily denounced and marginalized.|$|E

5|$|In case {{of death}} or {{resignation}} {{submitted to the}} President of the Constitutional Court and communicated to the Speaker of the parliament, or in cases when the Constitutional Court decides to terminate the presidential term through impeachment, the Speaker of the parliament becomes acting president. In those circumstances, new legislation is <b>countersigned</b> by the prime minister instead {{of the president and}} a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. This situation occurred after the death of Franjo Tuđman on 10 December 1999, when Vlatko Pavletić became the acting president. After the parliamentary elections of 2000, the role was transferred to Zlatko Tomčić, who filled the office until Stjepan Mesić was elected President of Croatia in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia is the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces of the Republic of Croatia and appoints and relieves military commanders of duty, conforming to applicable legislation. Pursuant to decisions of the parliament, the president declares war and concludes peace. In cases of immediate threats to the independence, unity and existence of the state, the president may order the use of armed forces, even if no state of war is declared, provided that such an order is <b>countersigned</b> by the prime minister. During a state of war, the president may promulgate regulations with the force of law on the basis of, and within the scope of, authority obtained from the parliament. In such circumstances, the president may convene government cabinet meetings and preside over them. If the parliament is not in session, the president is authorized to regulate all matters required by the state of war through regulations carrying the force of law. In case of an immediate threat to the independence, unity and existence of the state, or if the governmental bodies are prevented from performing their constitutional duties regularly, the president may, at the proposal of the prime minister, issue regulations carrying the force of law. Such regulations must also be <b>countersigned</b> by the prime minister to become valid. The president is required to submit regulations that are promulgated thus to the parliament for approval as soon as the parliament may convene, otherwise the regulations become void. The president cooperates with the government directing operation of the Croatian security and intelligence system. The president and the prime minister jointly appoint heads of the security agencies, and the president may attend cabinet meetings, taking part in discussions held at such meetings.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia may {{dissolve}} Parliament {{upon the}} request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a motion of no confidence or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after the budget is proposed in the parliament. That decision must be <b>countersigned</b> by the Prime Minister to become valid. The President may also dissolve Parliament after a motion of no confidence supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (maximum period of 120 days). However, the President may not dissolve Parliament at {{the request of}} the government if a procedure to determine if the President has violated provisions of the constitution is in progress.|$|E

5000|$|In {{military}} terminology, a <b>countersign</b> is a sign, word, or {{any other}} signal previously agreed upon and required to be exchanged between a [...] or guard and anybody approaching his or her post. The term usually encompasses both the sign given by the approaching party {{as well as the}} sentry's reply. However, in some armies, the <b>countersign</b> is strictly the reply of the sentry to the password given by the person approaching. A well-known sign/countersign used by the Allied forces on D-Day during World War II: the challenge/sign was [...] "flash", the password [...] "thunder", and the <b>countersign</b> (to challenge the person giving the first code word) [...] "Welcome".|$|R

5|$|In 1829, Duyet {{suffered}} {{another blow}} when Nguyen Van Thoai, an ally whom he appointed to run Cambodia for him died. The general nominated another subordinate to replace his colleague Nguyen Van Xuan, but Minh Mạng overruled him and instead appointed {{one of his}} mandarins Bui Minh Duc to the post. Although the emperor formally asked Duc to cooperate with Duyet, Minh Mạng then appointed Duc to the post of Minister of the Board of War, putting him above the general {{in the chain of}} command, effectively making Duyet irrelevant with regards to the running of the protectorate. In 1831, just before Duyet's death, Minh Mạng began to dismantle his military infrastructure and sending his component units to other parts of Vietnam, and sent a loyalist General Nguyen Van Khue to Gia Định, allowing him to dilute the viceroy's power. In addition, no government reports could be officially approved and sent to the capital until it was <b>countersigned</b> by civil officials sent south by the emperor. These moves against southern autonomy gradually increased the resentment and regionalist sentiments among the local population.|$|E
5|$|This {{situation}} {{started to}} gradually {{change with the}} ascension of Pope Leo IX (1049–1054) {{and the beginning of}} the Reform Papacy. This pope, in order to reform the corrupted Roman clergy, appointed several new cardinals from the monastic centers outside Rome, such as Monte Cassino, Remiremont and Cluny. These new cardinals became his close advisors. Leo’s successors continued this trend and Nicholas II in 1059 gave the cardinals the exclusive right to elect a new pope. At the end of the 11th century the boca formed a single College of Cardinals, which became the main body of the papal government — they served as experts or judges in the legal causes (auditors), <b>countersigned</b> the solemn papal privileges, acted as governors of the cities or provinces of the Papal States or were sent by the popes on important diplomatic missions. The cardinals became the most important members of the Roman Curia, and as such were still required to reside in the papal court, unless they were dispatched for a legatine mission in the name of the pope.|$|E

The 2006 pardoning of several convicted child rapists, including an Australian rapist and child pornographer, caused controversy.

25|$|Herseni {{was chosen}} for high office in the new bureaucracy, serving as Secretary General of a {{combined}} Ministry of Education and Culture, seconding Minister Brăileanu. He <b>countersigned</b> an order by Antonescu and Brăileanu for the demotion and arrest of Petre Andrei, the previous Minister of Education, who was thus shamed into committing suicide. Herseni soon found himself drawn into the conflict between Sima and Antonescu, over the appointment of Guard loyalists at the Accademia di Romania (Antonescu wanted the old regime figures {{to be kept in}} place).|$|E
25|$|Although Ceaușescu <b>countersigned</b> Răutu's {{downfall}} {{and allowed}} a condemnation of Răutu's erstwhile proteges, little was {{published on the}} ideologist's own career, and almost no negative reinvestigation saw print before 1989. Researchers such as Ileana Vrancea and Ion Cristoiu, who tackled the more delicate subjects of Stalinist culture and were condemned by the communist press as borderline dissidents, refrained from even mentioning Răutu by name. Benefiting from his seniority in the communist movement, academician Iorgu Iordan made at least one reference to Răutu's problematic decision-making, even before Răutu had been sidelined: Iordan's version of events is preserved in his 1979 memoirs.|$|E

If, within two months, no candidate has won {{the confidence of the}} Cortes then the king dissolves the Cortes and calls for a new General Election.

Streitman himself only served in the CE between February and December 1942, being succeeded by Gingold. His last years were brought his return to activism, this time as a Revisionist Zionist, working for a massive Jewish resettlement in British Palestine. Meanwhile, in February 1946, his CE colleagues were brought in front of the Romanian People's Tribunals, whereupon Gingold and Vasile Isăceanu were given life sentences. Streitman survived the 1947 establishment of a communist regime, which, although anti-Zionist, preferred to ignore him and his political stances.|$|E

25|$|In William's absence, Queen Mary and her advisors – the 'Council of Nine' – {{hastened to}} take {{measures}} for the defence of the country. Carmarthen {{thought that it was}} advisable to fight, as did Nottingham and Admiral Russell, who were unconvinced that the French were as strong as Torrington reported and considered that only the admiral's pessimism, defeatism or treachery could account for his reports. As the two fleets moved slowly up the channel (with Torrington keeping carefully out of range), Russell drafted the order to fight. <b>Countersigned</b> by Nottingham, the orders reached the admiral on 9 July whilst he was off Beachy Head. Torrington realised that not to give battle was to be guilty of direct disobedience; to give battle was, in his judgment, to incur serious risk of defeat. Torrington called a council of war with his flag-officers, who concluded that they had no option but to obey.|$|E
25|$|In 1814, {{increasingly}} {{opposed to}} the Greek-language teaching favored by the Phanariotes, Asachi proposed {{the first in a}} series of Romanian-language educational institutions, a course in engineering and topography to be held at the Princely Academy in Iaşi; once approved by the ruler and <b>countersigned</b> by Veniamin, the lectures attracted a number of young boyars (including the future Ottoman diplomat Alexandros Kallimachis, Scarlat's son, Teodor Balş (who was to serve as Moldvia's kaymakam in 1856-1857), Daniel Scavinschi, as well as Gheorghe Asachi's brother Petru. He gave various lectures, and offered additional training in drawing and art history, as well as in Romanian history. He organized several exhibits of his students' work in technical drawing. Despite a favorable report from its inspectors, Asachi's facility soon met with opposition from Greek teachers at the Academy, which led it to be closed soon after its original students graduated (1819).|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War {{there was a sense of}} dissatisfaction in how honours were distributed. The effect was the passage of the Nickel Resolution. The resolution created a policy of Canadians not being appointed to peerages or titular honours, and the government of Canada only making recommendation for a handful of non-titular honours. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster reaffirmed the equality of the self-governing dominions of the British Empire, however there was no mechanism to establish honours specific to the dominions. In 1935, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal was established as the first award specifically for service in Canada. The Canadian government managed the creation of this medal by passing the recommendation for creating the honour on to the Dominions Office, who had experience with drafting Royal Warrants. In 1934, King George V signed the Royal Warrant creating the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal. Prime Minister R.B. Bennett <b>countersigned</b> the Royal Warrant 15 December 1934 signifying that the King was acting on the advice of his Canadian Ministry.|$|E
