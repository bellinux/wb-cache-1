50|$|In 2005 she {{was sold}} to her current owners and renamed Amazing Grace. The New owners decided to {{classify}} the ship as a passenger <b>carrying</b> <b>vessel</b> licensed by the US Coast Guard. After many modifications {{to meet the requirements}} of the USCG, the vessel received a Certificate of Inspection (COI). This COI allowed the ship to take passengers out for sailing adventures. For a few years after the ship was sold the vessel's home port was in Gig Harbor, Washington. There, her course yard was removed and was rigged as a square topsail schooner. When the teak deck needed replacement due to leakage, the owners decided to temporarily move the ship to San Diego because of its ideal weather conditions. After a few transits back and forth between San Diego and Gig Harbor, the ship was permanently relocated to San Diego where she resides now.|$|E
50|$|Under {{international}} law, {{the citizens}} of neutral nations are entitled to trade, at their own risk, with any or all powers engaged in war. No duty to restrain contraband trade is imposed on the neutral governments, but no neutral governments {{has the right to}} interfere on behalf of citizens whose property is seized by one belligerent if it is in transit to another. The penalty traditionally imposed by belligerents on neutral carriers engaged in commercial traffic with the enemy consists of confiscation of cargo. By the Declaration of London, it was extended to include condemnation of the <b>carrying</b> <b>vessel</b> if more than half the cargo was contraband. The right of warring nations to sink neutral ships transporting contraband is not recognized in international law, but the practice was initiated by Germany in World War I and was often resorted to by the Axis Powers in World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Riggin had her {{built for}} his oyster {{dredging}} fleet and named her after his sons, Jacob and Edward. They all captained her {{at one time}} or another on the Delaware Bay. She was always known as a quick, light air vessel and her speed was proven in 1929 when she handily won the only official Oyster Dredging Race in the Delaware Bay. She was used for oyster-dredging until the 1940s, when the fishing regulations changed. The Riggin family sold her and she was converted to power to begin fishing for groundfish and mackerel in Cape Cod and Long Island Sound. In the early 1970s she was bought by Dave and Sue Allen and converted from a fishing vessel to a passenger <b>carrying</b> <b>vessel</b> which is what she remains. Her engine was removed and cabins added below to create space for guests. [...] She is part of the Maine Windjammer fleet, carrying vacationers on 3-, 4- and 6-day sailing trips in Penobscot Bay, Maine. Her homeport is Rockland, Maine and her sailing grounds range from Boothbay Harbor, Maine to Bar Harbor, Maine. Much of her deck, underwater planking and frames are original. She is currently owned by Jon Finger and Anne Mahle.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{intercontinental}} {{radioactive material}} shipping campaigns have focused public and regulatory {{attention on the}} safety of transport of this material by ocean-going vessels. One major concern is {{the response of the}} vessel and onboard radioactive material (RAM) packages during a severe ship-to-ship collision. These collisions occur at velocities less than the velocity obtained in the Type B package regulatory impact event and the bow of the striking ship is less rigid than the unyielding target used in those tests (Ammerman and Daidola, 1996). This implies that ship impact is not a credible scenario for damaging the radioactive material packages during ship collisions. It is possible, however, for these collisions to generate significant amounts of crush force by the bow of the impacting ship overrunning the package. It is the aim of this paper to determine an upper bound on the magnitude of this crush force taking into account the strength of the radioactive material <b>carrying</b> <b>vessel</b> and any other cargo that may be stowed in the same hold as the radioactive material...|$|E
40|$|Landing bulletins provide basic catch {{records of}} amounts {{and values of}} marine {{resources}} taken by California's commercial fisheries plus summarizations of catches by the passenger carrying fishing industry. Small quantities of freshwater fish taken commercially in inland areas also are detailed. These figures are of local, national, and international significance to those interested in the wise utilization and management of California's living marine and freshwater resources. This report for 1976 is the 36 th in a series stemming from the first gathering of commercial fisheries landing data by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1916 and the subsequent first publication of these catch data in 1929 for the years 1926 and 1927. California's fishery statistics {{are based on a}} system where fish dealers, processors, and operators of passenger carrying fishing vessels send duplicate copies of their landing records to the department. Fish Bulletin 86, which reported the catch for 1950, describes fully the system and methods used in collecting commercial fish records.

40|$|Mobile laser {{scanning}} is an emerging technology for capturing three-dimensional {{information from the}} surrounding objects. With {{state of the art}} sensors the achieved point cloud could capture fine details of the surroundings with good accuracy and effectiveness. Many of the applications deal with the civil engineering purposes in urban areas for traffic and city planning and modelling. In this article we present multiplatform mobile {{laser scanning}} solutions for mapping applications that require mobility in various terrains and river environments but yet produce high density point clouds with good reliability and accuracy. The ROAMER mobile laser scanning system was deployed in multitude of tasks from urban areas to climate research. The paper also introduces a completely new backpack Akhka platform for mobile lidar mapping of areas where wheeled vehicles cannot operate. The sensor set is the same in all of the approaches, but the <b>carrying</b> <b>vessel</b> was selected according to the application. This was possible thanks to a relatively light and compact yet simple design of the system. ROAMER system {{is one of the few}} high-end MLS systems that are easily adaptable to various platforms.

40|$|Abstract. Ratcheting {{is one of}} the {{challenging}} phenomena that needs to be investigated for the Fast breeder reactor (FBRs), to arrive at the optimum structural dimensions that are safe and yet do not have undue redundancy. Austenitic stainless steel is the principal structural material for Indian FBR. Preliminary assessment indicates {{that there is a need}} to demonstrate that the main load <b>carrying</b> <b>vessel</b> made of this material can provide sufficient safety margin against ratcheting under biaxial loading conditions. This exercise calls for carrying out many simulated experiments, particularly with biaxial tension torsion specimens to generate adequate data for developing robust constitutive models to predict ratcheting. Accordingly, many biaxial tension-torsion experiments for austenitic stainless steel pipes were conducted and the best results have been reported here. The mechanical behavior of this material has been reported for a given axial tensile stress superimposed with a given range of cyclic shear stress for many cycles of loading. Rectangular rosette is used for capturing the biaxial response. Important material responses like cyclic hardening and biaxial ratcheting have been experimentally observed. Maximum accumulation of 2700 ¬µ axial strain has been observed for a loading condition of constant axial stress of 102 MPa super imposed with a cyclic variation of shear stress amplitude of 120 MPa over 2450 cycles. The amount of progressive accumulation o...|$|E
40|$|The ‚Äòscaly-foot gastropod‚Äô (Chrysomallon squamiferum Chen et al., 2015) from deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} vent ecosystems of the Indian Ocean {{is an active}} mobile gastropod occurring in locally high densities, and it is distinctive for the dermal scales covering the exterior surface of its foot. These iron-sulfide coated sclerites, and its nutritional dependence on endosymbiotic bacteria, are both noted as adaptations to the extreme environment {{in the flow of}} hydrogen sulfide. We present evidence for other adaptations of the ‚Äòscaly-foot gastropod‚Äô to life in an extreme environment, investigated through dissection and 3 D tomographic reconstruction of the internal anatomy. Results Our anatomical investigations of juvenile and adult specimens reveal a large unganglionated nervous system, a simple and reduced digestive system, and that the animal is a simultaneous hermaphrodite. We show that Chrysomallon squamiferum relies on endosymbiotic bacteria throughout post-larval life. Of particular interest is the circulatory system: Chrysomallon has a very large ctenidium supported by extensive blood sinuses filled with haemocoel. The ctenidium provides oxygen for the host but the circulatory system is enlarged beyond the scope of other similar vent gastropods. At the posterior of the ctenidium is a remarkably large and well-developed heart. Based on the volume of the auricle and ventricle, the heart complex represents approximately 4 % of the body volume. This proportionally giant heart primarily sucks blood through the ctenidium and supplies the highly vascularised oesophageal gland. Thus we infer the elaborate cardiovascular system most likely evolved to oxygenate the endosymbionts in an oxygen poor environment and/or to supply hydrogen sulfide to the endosymbionts. Conclusions This study exemplifies how understanding the autecology of an organism can be enhanced by detailed investigation of internal anatomy. This gastropod is a large and active species that is abundant in its {{hydrothermal vent}} field ecosystem. Yet all of its remarkable features‚Äîprotective dermal sclerites, circulatory system, high fecundity‚Äîcan be viewed as adaptations beneficial to its endosymbiont microbes. We interpret these results to show that, as a result of specialisation to resolve energetic needs in an extreme chemosynthetic environment, this dramatic dragon-like species has become a <b>carrying</b> <b>vessel</b> for its bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background High endothelial venules (HEV) {{have been}} {{recognized}} {{to play a role}} in metastasis by its changes seen in the cancer microenvironment of lymph nodes (LN) and solid cancers. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue is a prevalent tumor of the head and neck region with high propensity for LN metastasis. The extent of LN metastasis is the most reliable adverse prognostic factor. Primary tumors can induce vasculature reorganization within sentinel LN before the arrival of tumor cells and HEV represents these remodelled vessels. This study aims to evaluate the cancer induced vascular changes in regional lymph nodes (LN) of patients by studying the morphological and functional alterations of HEV and its correlation with clinical outcome and pathological features. Methods This study was based on 65 patients with SCC tongue who underwent primary surgical treatment including neck dissection. The patients were categorized into 2 groups based on the presence of malignancy in their cervical lymph nodes. A review of the patients' pathological and clinical data was performed from a prospective database. Immunohistochemical staining of the tissue blocks for HEV and high-power-field image analysis were performed and analyzed with correlation to the patients' clinical and pathological features. Results The total number of HEV was found to be significantly associated to disease-free interval. There was a similar association comparing the HEV parameters to overall survival. The density of abnormal HEV was significantly higher in patients with established metastases in their lymph nodes and HEV was shown to be a better prognosis factor than conventional tumor staging. The HEV morphological metamorphosis demonstrates a spectrum that correlates well with disease progression and clinical outcome. Conclusions The results suggest that the HEV displays a spectrum of morphological changes in the presence of cancer and LN metastasis, and that HEV is possibly involved in the process of cancer metastasis. We revealed the relationship of HEV and their metamorphosis in pre-metastatic and metastatic environments in regional lymph nodes of tongue cancer patients in relation to clinical outcomes. The significant observation of modified dilated HEV containing red blood cells in lymph nodal basin of a cancer suggests the shifting of its function from one primarily of immune response to that of a blood <b>carrying</b> <b>vessel.</b> It also demonstrated potential prognostic value. More studies are needed to elucidate its potential role in cancer immunotherapy and as a potential novel therapeutic approach to preventing metastasis by manipulating the remodelling processes of HEV. </p...|$|E
