5|$|In 1925, the Pirates {{became the}} first team to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> three-game to one deficit to defeat the Washington Senators and win the World Series. Pittsburgh's third and final World Series {{championship}} while they played at Forbes Field came in 1960. Bill Mazeroski hit the first home run to end a World Series and as of 2017, the only walk-off home run in World Series Game 7 history.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees and the Red Sox {{finished}} {{tied for}} first in 1978; subsequently, the Yankees won a high-profile tie-breaker {{game for the}} division title. The first-place tie came after the Red Sox had enjoyed a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, in the 2004 AL Championship Series, the Yankees ultimately lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–0. The Red Sox comeback {{was the only time}} in baseball history that a team has <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 0–3 deficit to win a series. The Red Sox {{went on to win the}} World Series, effectively ending the 86-year-old curse.|$|E

5|$|Calgary ended 2010 {{with three}} {{consecutive}} wins and won their first game in 2011 for a season-high four-game winning streak. The streak {{came to an}} end {{at the hands of the}} New York Islanders on January 3, a contest that marked the Flames franchise's 3,000th game in its history. Losses to Vancouver, Detroit and Carolina followed, the latter two in overtime, but the Flames' four-game eastern road trip that began in Carolina ended with the team registering two wins and six points. The last game of the trip, against the Montreal Canadiens, saw the team <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 4–0 deficit to force the contest into overtime before Montreal prevailed. Kiprusoff struggled throughout the road trip, and was jeered by the fans on the team's first game home, a 6–0 loss to Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks {{owner and}} staunch American {{nationalist}} Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager {{to compile a}} team of only American players; at the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With eight out of 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York Americans, and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset, having fallen 3–0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings. Toronto rebounded, and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup, becoming {{the first of four}} teams in the NHL to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 series deficit and the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015–16 season, James {{was criticized}} {{for his role in}} several off-court controversies, {{including}} the midseason firing of Cavaliers' head coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and {{the best record in the}} East. James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors, who were coming off a record-setting 73 win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala in the final two minutes, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 3–1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.|$|E

5|$|Going into Wimbledon, Murray had {{not lost}} a match on grass since the {{previous}} year's final, {{and was on}} a winning streak of 11 matches on grass. In the first two rounds, Murray faced Benjamin Becker and Yen-hsun Lu respectively, defeating both in straight sets. His third round match was against 32nd seed Tommy Robredo, and despite a tour comeback over the past year, Murray overcame the Spaniard in straight sets {{to set up a}} clash with Mikhail Youzhny, the highest seed left in Murray's half following the unexpectedly early exits of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Despite facing a fightback in the second set, Murray won in straight sets to make it through to his tenth consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, in which he was to play Fernando Verdasco, the first left-handed player Murray had faced since the 2012 US Open. For the seventh time in his career, Murray had to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> deficit of two sets to ultimately come through in five, setting up a semifinal clash with 24th seed Jerzy Janowicz, the Polish player who beat Murray in their previous encounter. After Murray failed to break Janowicz's serve, the Pole took the opening set in the tiebreak, following a double fault from Murray. However Murray managed to up his level of play, and won the next three sets, making it through to his second consecutive Wimbledon final, and third consecutive major final against Novak Djokovic.|$|E

25|$|Using a 3–4–3, the midfielders are {{expected}} to split their time between attacking and defending. Having only three dedicated defenders means that if the opposing team breaks through the midfield, {{they will have a}} greater chance to score than with a more conventional defensive configuration, such as 4–5–1 or 4–4–2. However, the three forwards allow for a greater concentration on attack. This formation is used by more offensive-minded teams. The formation was famously used by Liverpool under Rafael Benítez {{during the second half of}} the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> three-goal deficit.|$|E
25|$|The Bulls then {{advanced}} {{to face the}} Detroit Pistons, marking {{the first time the}} Central Division rivals had met in the playoffs since 1991. The Pistons won the first three games including a big comeback in Game 3. No NBA team had ever <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 0–3 deficit to win the series, but the Bulls avoided a sweep by winning Game 4 by 10 points. The Bulls then easily won Game 5 in Detroit, and had a chance to make NBA history. But they lost at home in game 6 by 10, and the Pistons won the series 4–2 on May 17.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, the Rays trailed the Cleveland Indians 7–0 {{after the}} top of the 4th inning, but would rally to score eight {{unanswered}} runs over the remainder of the game to win, capped off by a walk-off home run by B. J. Upton to lead off the bottom of the 9th inning. At the time, this was the largest come from behind win in franchise history, but remains the largest deficit overcome at home. Previously, the Rays had never won a game in which they had trailed by at least seven runs. They had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> six run deficit on five occasions.|$|E

San Antonio again built a large lead on the road before halftime, taking a 55–33 lead {{in the second quarter}} after scoring seven {{consecutive}} points, culminated by a soaring dunk by Leonard. The Spurs defense held Miami to just 35 percent shooting in the first half after allowing the Heat to shoot 50 percent overall in the prior game.

Despite 7 games against top 10 ranked opponents, Kansas finished the regular season 26–5, earned their 8th consecutive Big 12 title, and advanced to their 14th Final Four in school history. The Jayhawks would face another 2 seed, the Ohio State Buckeyes, in the National Semifinals. Kansas would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 13-point first half deficit to win the game, 64–62.
