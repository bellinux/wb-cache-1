5|$|At the {{intersection}} with Montgomery Street, MD 2 splits into another one-way pair with the northbound direction running east on Montgomery Street and then turning north on Light Street, intersecting MD 2 Truck (Key Highway) and passing by the Maryland Science Center, and the southbound direction following Hughes Street to Hanover Street. Along this one-way pair, the route carries one lane {{in each direction}} {{with the exception of}} Light Street, where the northbound direction has four lanes. Both directions of MD 2 join again along eight-lane divided Light Street and the route heads toward the Inner Harbor. Near Harborplace, the route splits into another one-way pair with northbound MD 2 running along three-lane Calvert Street and southbound MD 2 running along four-lane St. Paul Street. The route crosses many streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, Fayette Street, and Saratoga Street. The one-way pair passes by Mercy Medical Center before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 40. Calvert Street passes under US 40 (the Orleans Street Viaduct) while St. Paul Street intersects US 40 as it follows the one-way pair of Franklin Street westbound and Mulberry Street eastbound.|$|E
5|$|Route 70 {{crosses the}} Pennsauken Creek into Evesham Township, Burlington County, running east through more {{commercial}} areas within the Marlton {{section of the}} township. A short distance later, the route intersects Route 73 at an interchange that was formerly the Marlton Circle. After the Marlton Circle, the road heads east passing through some more commercial areas and then into residential neighborhoods that are separated from the road by trees, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. It continues into a mix of suburban development and rural woods and farms as it crosses into Medford Township, coming to a crossroads with CR 618. From this intersection, Route 70 continues east through the Medford area, passing a couple shopping centers before crossing CR 541. After the CR 541 intersection, the route leaves the suburban development and runs through a mix of woodland and farmland with occasional homes. It enters Southampton Township, where the road enters more wooded surroundings before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 206 at the Red Lion Circle.|$|E

2500|$|October – Robert L. Blattner of LDS Social Services (which was tasked by {{the church}} to treat {{homosexual}} members in 1972) gave an address titled [...] "Counseling the Homosexual in a Church Setting" [...] at the Association of Mormon Counselors and Psychotherapists (AMCAP) annual conference. Blattner served as a {{special assistant to the}} LDS Commissioner of Personal Welfare Victor L. Brown Jr. In the address Blattner states that the causes of homosexuality in men are a [...] "disturbed family background" [...] of an [...] "absent father" [...] and [...] "usually" [...] a [...] "controlling mother" [...] and a [...] "lack of relationship with peers", while for women he only says [...] "we don't have much information". He also says homosexual behavior and alcoholism are similar. He is asked what [...] "the church's feelings are about electric shock ... behavior modification" [...] and answered the church had [...] "never made a statement on it" [...] but that [...] "most people <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> can be helped by it" [...] in reference to aversion therapy research happening at BYU.|$|E
2500|$|Midrash (pl. Midrashim) is a Hebrew word {{referring}} to a method of reading details into, or out of, a biblical text. The term midrash also can refer to a compilation of Midrashic teachings, {{in the form of}} legal, exegetical, homiletical, or narrative writing, often configured as a commentary on the Bible or Mishnah. [...] There are a large number of [...] "classical" [...] Midrashic works spanning a period from Mishnaic to Geonic times, often showing evidence of having been worked and reworked from earlier materials, and frequently <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in multiple variants. A compact list of these works [...] is given below; a more thorough annotated list can be found under Midrash. The timeline below must be approximate because many of these works were composed over a long span of time, borrowing and collating material from earlier versions; their histories are therefore somewhat uncertain and the subject of scholarly debate. In the table, [...] "n.e." [...] designates that the work in question is not extant except in secondary references.|$|E
2500|$|The {{activity}} at Contimporanul cemented Janco's belief in primitivism {{and the values}} of outsider art. In a 1924 piece, he argued: [...] "The art of children, folk art, the art of psychopaths, of primitive people are the liveliest ones, the most expressive ones, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> from organic depths, without cultivated beauty." [...] He ridiculed, like Ion Vinea before him, the substance of Romania's academic traditionalism, notably in a provocative drawing which showed a grazing donkey under the title [...] "Tradition". Instead, Janco was publicizing the idea that Dada and various other strands of modernism were the actual tradition, for being indirectly indebted to the absurdist nature of Romanian folklore. The matter of Janco's own debt to his country's peasant art is more controversial. In the 1920s, Vinea discussed Janco's Cubism is a direct echo of an old abstract art that is supposedly native and exclusive to Romania—an assumption considered exaggerated by Paul Cernat. Seiwert suggests that virtually none of Janco's paintings show a verifiable contact with Romanian primitivism, but his opinion is questioned by Sandqvist: he writes that Janco's masks and prints are homages to traditional Romanian decorative patterns.|$|E
