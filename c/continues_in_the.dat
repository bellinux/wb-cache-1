5|$|Since the 1960s, {{populations of}} the Caucasian jungle cat living along the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus range states have been rapidly declining. Only small populations persist today. There has been no record in the Astrakhan Nature Reserve in the Volga Delta since the 1980s. The jungle cat is rare in the Middle East. In Jordan, it is highly {{affected}} by the expansion of agricultural areas around the river beds of Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, where farmers hunted and poisoned jungle cats for attacking poultry. It is also considered rare and threatened in Afghanistan. India exported jungle cat skins in large numbers, until this was banned in 1979; some illegal trade, however, <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, {{as well as in}} Egypt and Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|This {{area has}} been a focus of archaeological and egyptological {{exploration}} {{since the end of}} the eighteenth century, and its tombs and burials continue to stimulate research and interest. In modern times the valley has become famous for the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun (with its rumours of the Curse of the Pharaohs), and is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. In 1979, it became a World Heritage Site, along with the rest of the Theban Necropolis.

Defunct Games called Wonder Boy in Monster Land the most challenging game in the Wonder Boy series, noting the lack of passwords or <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Master System version, the relatively few chances to earn extra lives, and a time limit. The review said {{that the ability to}} earn gold and upgrade equipment which are laid out in the status screen tremendously adds to the replay value. It praised the responsive, though sometimes not precise, controls and the tight hit detection. Moreover, it said that the graphics were colorful and that it complemented the music and its simplistic sound effects well. Overall, the review said that the game is recommended for Master System and platforming fans alike.|$|E
5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} is heterogeneous. Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the {{majority of whom}} are Arab Christians) and, some 4% are Muslims (of which many are Ahmadis).

The trend <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> age 15-29 group, in which 27% of the Arab {{population is}} found, and the age 30-44 group (23%). The population of Jews and others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively. Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population. This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population.|$|E
