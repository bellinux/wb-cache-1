5000|$|The first {{implementation}} of the live distributed object concept, as defined in the ECOOP paper, was the Live Distributed Objects [...] platform developed by Krzysztof Ostrowski at Cornell University. The platform provided a set of visual, drag and drop tools for composing hierarchical documents resembling web pages, and containing XML-serialized live object references. Visual content such as <b>chat</b> <b>windows,</b> shared desktops, and various sorts of mashups could be composed by dragging and dropping components representing user interfaces and protocol instances onto a design form, and connecting them together. Since the moment of its creation, a number of extension {{have been developed to}} embed live distributed objects in Microsoft Office documents, and to support various types of hosted content such as Google Maps.

In particular, the tool supports group <b>chat</b> <b>windows</b> that allow {{members of a group}} to communicate with text that persists for about a day. We describe the experience of 6 globally-distributed work groups who used the tool over a period of 17 months. An analysis of use shows that the group functionality was used primarily for bursts of synchronous conversations and occasional asynchronous exchanges. The content was primarily focused on work tasks, and negotiating availability, with a smattering of non-work topics and humor. Nearly all groups were remarkably similar in the content of their group chat, although the research group chatted far more frequently than the others. We conclude with suggestions for future research, and a discussion of the place of team-oriented synchronous messaging tools in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our {{research}} on developing a web-based environment, a virtual theatre, in which users can display different behaviors and have goals that emerge during the inter¬action with this environment. One {{way to support}} such users is to give them different inter¬action modalities and access to multimedia information. The interactions between user (visitor) and the system take place using different task-oriented agents. These agents allow mouse and keyboard input, but interactions can also take place using speech and language input. In the current system both sequential and simultaneous multi-modal input is possible. The system presents its information through agents that use tables, <b>chat</b> <b>windows,</b> natural language, speech and a talking face.
