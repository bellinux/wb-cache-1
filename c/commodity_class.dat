40|$|For almost 70 years, {{actual costs}} of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) in the Department of Defense (DoD) have {{exceeded}} on average between 20 % and 506 % {{of their life}} cycle cost estimates, which are official expectations of actual program costs prior to completion. Despite numerous DoD acquisition reform efforts and implementation of sophisticated cost estimation techniques, this cost growth continues to exist. Accurate cost estimates are vital to the capital budgeting process for the DoD since {{they are used to}} set the affordability cap for each MDAP and across DoD Component weapon system program portfolios. Affordability is defined as the upper limit a DoD Component can allocate for a program without reducing costs or shifting resources between programs. To improve affordability in the DoD, a method that quantifies and adjusts for the persistent cost growth to enhance the accuracy of cost estimates is needed to promote more responsible and sustainable MDAP capital investment decisions. This thesis presents a simple yet powerful method of quantifying and correcting for systemic cost estimation risk in MDAPs to improve cost estimate accuracy and, consequently, affordability. Cost estimation risk is defined as the difference between estimated and actual MDAP costs (on average a deficit), and it consists of systemic and program-specific components. This dichotomized risk framework is similar to the one used in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) in which the growth rate in value of any one of a set of assets comprising a market in equilibrium is proportional to its systemic risk exposure to that market. In the CAPM, systemic risk aggregated risk from multiple economic factors - pervades the market and is unavoidable, and asset-specific risk is considered unpredictable due to idiosyncratic uncertainties. By analogy, the growth rate in cost estimates for a program belonging to the "market" of MDAPs is assumed proportional to that MDAP's systemic risk exposure to the market. Like in CAPM, systemic cost estimation risk - aggregated risk from 26 systemic factors identified in this thesis - pervades the market for MDAPs, as evidenced by historical cost overruns, and program-specific cost risk is considered unpredictable and best mitigated by program-dedicated professional cost estimators in the DoD and defense industry. From this analogy, the expected growth-beta relationship of CAPM may be adapted to determine for MDAPs the systemic cost risk-adjusted growth rates for the defense commodity classes of aircraft, electronics and software, missiles, ships, space and satellites, and vehicles. These classes are the same used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to segment defense commodities into distinct price index "baskets" based upon common inflation risks among commodities within each class. Based on this rationale, each MDAP is assumed to share systemic cost risk within its respective class; this risk is measured by beta in the expected growth-beta relationship. Defense <b>commodity</b> <b>class</b> beta values are calculated by linear regression of historical percentage cost estimate changes of member MDAPs with those of all MDAPs, and then averaging these beta values over the appropriate defense <b>commodity</b> <b>class.</b> Next, the expected cost estimate growth rate for any MDAP may be calculated by first estimating the future expected growth rate in all MDAPs using the arithmetic mean of historical annual cost estimate percentage changes, and then scaling this rate by the particular MDAP's systemic cost risk exposure - the defense <b>commodity</b> <b>class</b> beta value for which it is a member. Finally, the Systemic Risk Factor (SRF) for each defense <b>commodity</b> <b>class</b> is calculated from these growth rates and the forecast time horizon, adjusted for compounding effects over relatively longer time horizons, and then applied to current MDAP cost estimates to form systemic risk-adjusted cost estimates to improve affordability. This method was applied to an empirical retrospective case study using a set of cost data from six MDAPs, one from each <b>commodity</b> <b>class,</b> as a partial validation of the method. The results of this study show an overall 57 % enhancement in estimation accuracy when comparing the initial and SRF-adjusted MDAP cost estimates to the final estimates, indicating quantifying and adjusting for systemic cost risk can improve cost estimation accuracy. To show the effectiveness of this method on improving affordability, these six programs were combined to form a hypothetical acquisition portfolio and assessed for affordability over a five year period. While the unadjusted portfolio was not affordable four out of five years, the SRF-adjusted portfolio was affordable in all but the last year, illustrating the benefit of adjusting cost estimates for systemic risk. However, the benefits of improved cost estimate accuracy and affordability come at the cost of potentially over-budgeting for priority MDAPs thereby leaving less funds available for other, lower priority programs. Additionally, this method is not shown to be optimal in the sense of minimizing cost estimate errors to maximize affordability. Still, empirical results are promising and warrant further research into the idea of using SRFs to adjust life cycle cost estimates and ultimately improve MDAP affordability for the DoD. by David Petrucci.

This methodological approach allows us to quantify the contribution of certain factors in each country —such as economic growth, economic structure and the evolution of road freight transport intensity (including improvements in both supply and transport systems) — to road freight transportation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} to {{identify}} the dependence structure existing between the returns of equity and commodity futures and its evolution through the past 20 years. The key {{point is that we}} do not do not impose the dependence structure but let the data select it. To do so, we model the dependence between commodity (metal, agriculture and energy) and stock markets using a flexible approach that allows us to investigate whether the co-movement is : (i) symmetric and occurring most of the time, (ii) symmetric and occurring mostly during extreme events and (iii) asymmetric and occurring mostly during extreme events. We also allow for this dependence to be time-varying from January 1990 to February 2012. Our analysis uncovers three major stylized facts. First, we find that the dependence between commodity and stock markets is time varying, symmetric and occurs most of the time (as opposed to mostly in extreme events). Second, not allowing for time-varying parameters in the dependence distribution generates a bias toward evidence of tail dependence. Similarly, considering only tail dependence may lead to wrong evidence of asymmetry. Third, a growing comovement between industrial metals and equity markets is identified as early as in 2003, a comovement that spreads to all <b>commodity</b> <b>classes</b> and becomes unambiguously stronger with the global financial crisis after Fall 2008. ...|$|R

Within these accessions, the tropical japonica sub-group was predominant (10 accessions out of 12); this result, together with the observation that tropical japonica have a lower level of average disease incidence, may indicate that higher breeding pressure for bakanae resistance was applied in the tropical japonica than on the temperate sub-group. This observation is further supported by the higher frequency of the resistant allele (“A”) at the qBK 1 _ 628091 peak marker observed in tropical japonica (41.5 %) compared to temperate japonica (5.1 %). Sequences corresponding to the peak markers for qBK 1 _ 628091 and qBK 4 _ 31750955 are here provided (Additional file 6 : Figure S 5).

The method development is associated with analytical difficulties, since pesticides currently used in agriculture represent a variety of chemical classes having very different physico chemical properties. The method development also encounters difficulties when many various <b>commodity</b> <b>classes</b> with different characteristics are studied. The main task in pesticide residue analysis has been to provide multi residue methods, and traditionally GC has been the main analytical technique. In order to regulate the use of hazardous pesticides, the EU commission introduces strict maximum residue levels (MRL). The need for improved sample handling and detection techniques are, however, high due to handling of lower detection limits, complex matrices and the need of more efficient sample throughput. Of the new techniques introduced as alternative techniques to the traditional extraction techniques, pressurised fluid extraction (PFE) has {{shown to be a}} promising technique in {{analysis of}} pesticide residues in fatty foodstuffs. In water analysis, large sample volumes are needed due to low MRLs. The solid phase extraction (SPE) technique allows a concentration of large sample volumes and simplifies the tedious laboratory work with traditional separation funnels. A new approach was to use non-polar solvents for the sample extraction from the earlier used polymeric column. Both these techniques provide low solvent consumption, short extraction times and ability to automate the manual steps. An LC-MS/MS multi residue method was finally developed for pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables. The technique is robust and sensitive and allows a simultaneous determination of 57 pesticides and metabolites in one single analysis and without any clean-up steps. The sensitivity was improved to achieve the maximum residue limits needed by EU. Several multi step methods, which involve more costly analysis, has been replaced by this technique...|$|R

Portion condemnation data may be particularly useful, as these data can provide more specific information on health outcomes than whole carcass condemnation data. Various seasonal, secular, disease, and non-disease factors have been previously identified to be associated with whole carcass condemnation rates in Ontario provincial abattoirs; and if ignored, may bias the results of quantitative disease surveillance methods. The objective of this study was to identify various seasonal, secular, and abattoir characteristic factors that may be associated with bovine portion condemnation rates and compare how these variables may differ from previously identified factors associated with bovine whole carcass condemnation rates. Results Data were collected from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) and the Ontario Cattlemen’s Association regarding “parasitic liver” and pneumonic lung condemnation rates for different cattle classes, abattoir compliance ratings, and the monthly sales-yard price for <b>commodity</b> <b>classes</b> from 2001 - 2007. To control for clustering by abattoirs, multi-level Poisson modeling was used to investigate the association between the following variables and “parasitic liver” as well as pneumonic lung condemnation rates: year, season, annual abattoir audit rating, geographic region, annual abattoir operating time, annual total number of animals processed, animal <b>class,</b> and <b>commodity</b> sales price. Conclusions In this study, “parasitic liver” condemnation rates were associated with year, season, animal class, audit rating, and region. Pneumonic lung condemnation rates were associated with year, season, animal class, region, audit rating, number of cattle processed per year, and number of weeks abattoirs processed cattle. Unlike previous models based on whole carcass condemnations, commodity price was not associated with partial condemnations in this study. The results identified material-specific predictor variables for condemnation rates. This is important for syndromic surveillance based on abattoir data and should be modeled and controlled for during quantitative surveillance analysis on a portion specific basis. </p...|$|R

Law is structurally indeterminate as applied to particular cases, and so the interpretation which becomes official is always a matter of force; the stronger of the contesting parties in each legal dispute will ultimately obtain the sanction of law. Therefore, he states: [...] "The attempt to replace war and inequality with law is not merely utopian but is precisely self-defeating. A world structured around international law cannot but be one of imperialist violence. The chaotic and bloody world around us is the rule of law." ...|$|R

It is argued that there was one crucial element which he contributed to this devel¬opment, viz. the distinction of <b>commodities</b> into three <b>classes,</b> each having its own law of value: the identification of an intermediate class, made of “Commodities, {{in the production of}} which some persons possess greater facilities {{than the rest of the}} community, and which therefore the competition of the latter cannot increase, except at a greater cost”, paved the way to the conception (which however Bailey did not achieve) that there may be a functional relationship between unit cost of production and quantity produced; this would eliminate a major stumbling block which the competitive condition price equal cost constituted for a supply and demand theory of value: for demand to have an influence in price determination, unit costs of production cannot be fixed, but must vary with the quantity produced...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to theoretical knowledge and help investors, fund administrators, financial regulators and database vendors. Its chapters examine hedge fund performance attribution and fund persistence under changing market conditions, and issues of hedge fund index engineering, using a rigorously constructed unified database (U. S. dataset, from 1990 to 2014). The core of my modelling approach is a custom piece-wise parsimonious multifactor model with predefined and non-defined structural breaks, flexible enough to capture differences in asset and portfolio allocations. This is implemented on a strategy, fundamental, and a mixed level. Concerning funds’ persistence, I use several parametric and non-parametric techniques whereas I develop a framework with mixed trading strategies for investors’ conditional high returns. I examine the classification problem of hedge funds by implementing several classification techniques used by database vendors, on the same dataset. The findings are robust, showing that during stressful market conditions most hedge fund strategies do not provide significant alphas to investors as fund managers {{are more concerned about}} minimizing their systematic risk and there is a switch from equity to <b>commodity</b> asset <b>classes.</b> Directional strategies have more common exposures than non-directional strategies under all market conditions. Falling stock markets are harsher than recessions for hedge funds. Moreover, during stressful conditions, small funds suffer more than large funds, young funds outperform old ones and funds that do not impose restrictions (and survive) outperform funds with no lockups. There are cases where funds can deliver significant negative alpha to investors conditional on stressful market conditions. In general, stressful market conditions {{have a negative impact on}} all types of funds’ persistence whereas my zero investment “synthetic” trading strategy can bring conditional high returns to investors. Furthermore, I found that the differences between index vendors are mainly due to the use of different selection criteria and different datasets. ...|$|R
