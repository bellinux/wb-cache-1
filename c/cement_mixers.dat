25|$|From Dachau, the Rebbe was {{dispatched}} to the Muldorf Forest, where the Nazis were building an underground airport, hangar and missile batteries in order to bomb major European cities. He {{and thousands of other}} prisoners were forced to work 12-hour shifts, carrying 110-pound bags of cement from the rail depot to the <b>cement</b> <b>mixers</b> inside the hangar. Halberstam grew very weak from this difficult work. When he collapsed under his burden, he was beaten. He refused to work at all on Shabbat, which brought on more beatings. Finally, his friends persuaded the camp managers to give him to the job of camp custodian, allowing him to sweep and tidy the barracks while engaging in prayer the entire day.|$|E

Then, using an atomic bomb designed for an MGM-5 Corporal intermediate-range ballistic missile that he had purchased for $US1 million in Germany, Goldfinger would blow open Fort Knox's impregnable vault, before removing roughly $15 billion in gold bullion by truck and train {{with the help of}} American criminal organizations, including the Mafia; the Purple Gang (an organization that existed in real life); the Spangled Mob (a fictional gang that would later appear in other Bond novels); and the <b>Cement</b> <b>Mixers,</b> an all-female gang led by lesbian and former trapeze artist Pussy Galore. They would then escape to the Soviet Union on a cargo boat. Goldfinger bribes the syndicate leaders with $15,000 in gold apiece to secure their attendance at the meeting and promises that each group will receive at least $1 billion, while he will keep $5 billion.|$|E

As quickly as possible, the Americans replaced or upgraded the old, unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work. About 102 new large, railroad-mounted steam shovels were purchased from the Marion Power Shovel Company and brought from the United States. These were joined by enormous steam-powered cranes, giant hydraulic rock crushers, <b>cement</b> <b>mixers,</b> dredges, and pneumatic power drills, nearly all of which were manufactured by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and built in the United States. The railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty, double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new rolling stock. In many places, the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line, and a new line had to be constructed above Gatun Lake's waterline.|$|E
