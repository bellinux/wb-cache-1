5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré {{explained}} and demonstrated the instrument, and then <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>a</b> week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ.|$|E
25|$|According to his great-great-grandson, d'Alembert {{received}} him rather poorly, {{and to get}} rid of him {{gave him}} a thick mathematics book, saying to come back when he had read it. When Laplace <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>a</b> few days later, d'Alembert was even less friendly and did not hide his opinion that it was impossible that Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he realised that it was true, and from that time he took Laplace under his care.|$|E
25|$|After Kutuzov became Governor-General of Crimea in 1787, the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792 began. He {{was again}} {{severely}} wounded in 1788 during the Siege of Ochakov when a bullet was shot through {{both of his}} temples. Kutuzov <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>a</b> year later, {{taking part in the}} Battle of Rymnik and Siege of Izmail. Near the end of the war, he led a decisive charge at the Battle of Măcin. Kutuzov was on good terms with Tsar Paul, but had disputes with his successor Tsar Alexander. In 1805, he led Russian forces alongside Austria during the Napoleonic Wars. The allied Russo-Austrian army was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz. Alexander blamed Kutuzov and demoted him to Moldova for the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812. Kutuzov vanquished a four-times larger Turkish army at Rousse and brought an end to the war with a decisive victory at the Battle of the Danube. For his achievements, he was awarded the titles of count and prince.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to Grand Rapids in 1946, Ford became active in local Republican politics, and supporters {{urged him to}} take on Bartel J. Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed {{his view of the}} world. [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>a</b> converted internationalist", Ford wrote, [...] "and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated isolationist.

2500|$|Peter Lever (3/43) had Ken Eastwood caught {{behind by}} Alan Knott and John Snow (1/68) removed Keith Stackpole's off stump {{with a ball}} that <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>a</b> foot after {{pitching}} to leave Australian 13/2 {{at the end of}} the first day. Bob Willis (3/58) caught the nightwatchman Rod Marsh and bowled Ian Chappell the next morning and they were 66/4, but Ian Redpath (59) and Doug Walters (42) added 81. Walters was stumped on 41 by Knott, who made 6 dismissals in the match, but 'when Umpire Rowan ruled Walters not out, Knott stood on the edge of the popping crease as if paralysed with unbelief. Walters was stumped off Underwood (2/39) on 42 and given out by Umpire O'Connell and the spinner caught and bowled Ian Redpath. When Kerry O'Keeffe was out at 178/7 Greg Chappell (65) was left alone with the tail, but Terry Jenner retired hurt when he ducked into a [...] on 8. Rowan warned the fast bowler for intimidatory bowling yet again, but Snow and Illingworth objected strongly, the captain saying [...] "That's the only bouncer he's bowled" [...] and that he would complain to the ABC, but Snow had bowled three other short balls at Jenner earlier in the over and Bob Willis had been brought in for the mis-hit. Rowan later claimed that Illingworth and Snow swore at him, which they denied. The bowler was loudly booed and [...] "when he returned to his fielding position at long-leg Snow was pelted with bottles, cans and partially eaten pies". Some of the crowd wanted to shake his hand, but then he was [...] at Paddington Hill who was forced to let go by other spectators. In 1998 the eighty-year-old Trevor Guy told the Sydney Morning Herald that he was the man who had grabbed Snow in order to tell him what he thought about him hitting Jenner. Guy and Snow, in Australia for the 1998–99 Ashes series, agreed that they had no hard feelings about the matter. To avoid injury to his team Illingworth took his men back to the dressing room without the permission of the umpires, an unprecedented move in Test cricket. He later justified his action by saying [...] "I've seen people hit by bottles and it makes a bloody mess of them". The England manager David Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field and Lou Rowan told them that if they did not immediately return they would forfeit the match (and the Ashes) and was supported by Alan Barnes of the ABC. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down. Furthermore, he strongly objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. It took seven minutes for the groundstaff to move the debris, during which one was hit on the head with a beer-can and had to be taken to hospital, though most of the 40 cans were for soft drinks. The Australian batsmen Greg Chappell and Dennis Lillee remained at the crease throughout the incident. Jenner returned to bat at 235/8 and made a brave 30, last man out on 264 to give Australia a lead of 80 runs.|$|E
