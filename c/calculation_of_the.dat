Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E

Here a first-principles, many-pole generalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasmon-pole model is developed for improved <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> inelastic losses. <b>The</b> method {{is based on the}} GW approximation for the self-energy and real space multiple scattering <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dielectric function for a given system. The model retains <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasmon-pole model and is applicable both to periodic and aperiodic materials over a wide energy range. The same many-pole model is applied to extended GW <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quasiparticle spectral function.

In particular, the terminal velocity {{was based on the}} type of bomb being dropped and did not change during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path of the bomb would be when dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach terminal velocity and followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.|$|E
