The supercharged V6 was uprated to 171kilowatts (229hp) from the VS. Safety wise, side airbags became an option for the Acclaim and higher models, a first for Holden.|$|E

She also wears a South Asian-like attire composing of black gagra choli with a trailing black veil. However, after being cursed by Zant, Midna became a diminutive [...] "imp". Other than {{her lack of}} clothing, save a Fused Shadow fragment (powerful magical relics of her race) as a mask, Midna bears elements of her {{original form}}. While in her imp form, Midna frequently speaks in sinister and sarcastic ways, often acting uninterested in the events of Hyrule and/or Link's plight unless they suit her needs. Her bright orange hair is her main method of physical control while she is in imp form and will often use it to deal physical damage or <b>control</b> <b>Link</b> while {{he is in his}} wolf form. Her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Kōmoto.|$|E

It also now did not require the glass hatch to be opened before the swinging door. Changes between model years 2002, 2003, and 2004 were minor, involving an enlargement of the center compartment bin and the addition of a front passenger door power lock in the latter two years respectively. The success of the CR-V prompted Honda to introduce an entry-level SUV, the Element.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the battle}} in Coast City, he discovers that Doomsday is {{controlled}} by General Nathaniel Adam. He escapes from Doomsday and then saves a woman named Alexandra Gianopoulos from Doomsday's attack. He learns the timeline has been changed, suspecting Professor Zoom. Alexandra and Booster split up, but she secretly has powers allowing her to take others' powers and follows him. Later, he flies to Gotham City when Doomsday attacks him. General Adam's <b>control</b> <b>link</b> is destroyed by Alexandra {{in an attempt to}} rescue Booster. Doomsday's true personality comes to the surface and he attacks Booster. During the fight, Doomsday beats him nearly to death, but he is rescued by Alexandra. He tries to prevent Doomsday from killing innocent people, and manages to put Doomsday's helmet back on. Doomsday's control is restored to Adam, who grabs Booster, hoping to kill him. Fortunately, Adam takes him back to the base for interrogation, allowing him to escape when the sight of [...] "Project Superman" [...] causes Doomsday's true personality to resurface. Alexandra defeats Doomsday by using the control helmet to make Doomsday tear himself apart, subsequently asking Booster to take him with her when he restores history to normal. Alexandra subsequently sacrifices herself to save Booster from an Atlantean attack, leaving him to return to Vanishing Point as history resets without any clear memory of his time in the [...] "Flashpoint" [...] universe.
