5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative <b>care</b> <b>team</b> members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to explore the extent of teamworking in primary health care in the UK and compare primary health <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> with other multidisciplinary teams on fundamental critieria of team functioning. A survey was conducted, using a validated questionnaire which measures four aspects of team climate: participation, shared objectives, task orientation and support for innovation. Sixty-eight primary health <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> participated in the questionnaire survey, with additional comparison data from: 24 oil company teams; 27 NHS management teams; 20 community mental health teams; 40 social services teams. The total number of respondents across three samples was 1, 555. Main outcome measures were levels of team participation, support for innovation, task orientation and clarity of, and commitment to, team objectives. Primary health <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> scored significantly lower than other teams in the sample on all team functioning factors except task orientation.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the ability of}} five New York statewide regions to accommodate 30 children needing critical care after a hypothetical mass casualty incident (MCI) and the duration to complete an evacuation to facilities in other regions if the surge exceeded local capacity. A quantitative model evaluated pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) vacancies for MCI patients, based on data on existing resources, historical average occupancy, and evidence on early discharges and transfers in a public health emergency. Evacuation of patients exceeding local capacity to the nearest PICU center with vacancies was modeled in discrete event chronological simulations for three scenarios in each region: pediatric critical <b>care</b> transport <b>teams</b> were considered to originate from other PICU hospitals statewide, using (1) ground ambulances or (2) helicopters, and (3) noncritical <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> were considered to originate from the local MCI region using ground ambulances. Chronology of key events was modeled. Across five regions, {{the number of children}} needing evacuation would vary from 0 to 23. The New York City (NYC) metropolitan area could accommodate all patients. The region closest to NYC could evacuate all excess patients to PICU hospitals in NYC within 12 hours using statewide critical <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> traveling by ground ambulance. Helicopters and local noncritical <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> would not shorten the evacuation. For other statewide regions, evacuation of excess patients by statewide critical <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> traveling by ground ambulance would require up to nearly 26 hours. Helicopter transport would reduce evacuation time by 40 %- 44 %, while local noncritical <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> traveling by ground would reduce evacuation time by 16 %- 34 %. The present study provides a quantitative, evidence-based approach to estimate regional pediatric critical care evacuation needs after an MCI. Large metropolitan areas with many PICU beds would be better able to accommodate patients in a local MCI, and would serve as a crucial resource if an MCI occurred in a smaller community. Regions near a metropolitan area could be rapidly served by critical <b>care</b> transport <b>teams</b> traveling by ground ambulance. Regions distant from a metropolitan area might benefit from helicopter transport. Using local noncritical <b>care</b> transport <b>teams</b> would involve shorter delays and less expert care during evacuation...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} among leadership clarity (i. e., team members' consensual perceptions of clarity of and no conflict over leadership of their teams), team processes, and innovation {{were examined in}} health care contexts. The sample comprised 3447 respondents from 98 primary health <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> (PHCTs), 113 community mental health teams (CMHTs), and 72 breast cancer <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> (BCTs). The results revealed that leadership clarity is associated with clear team objectives, high levels of participation, commitment to excellence, and support for innovation. Team processes consistently predicted team innovation across all three samples. Team leadership predicted innovation in the latter two samples, {{and there was some}} evidence that team processes partly mediated this relationship. The results imply the need for theory that incorporates clarity and not just style of leadership. For health <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> in particular, and teams in general, the results suggest a need to ensure leadership is clear in teams when innovation is a desirable team performance outcome. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

2500|$|In the Anglo-American {{model of}} care, the {{physician}} remains {{the leader of}} the <b>care</b> <b>team,</b> but paramedics function much more independently than in the Franco-German model. [...] This has not always been the case. [...] In the earliest days of paramedicine paramedics were required to contact a physician for formal orders for every single intervention that they performed. [...] Indeed, it was argued in some systems that this was the only safe approach to providing care in this fashion. There were early examples of 'paramedics' who operated blindly, providing medications from numbered or colour-coded syringes as they were directed by the physician, with no real understanding of the interventions that they were performing. [...] Control was absolute and immediate; there were examples of paramedics being trained, but not legally permitted to perform their skills, or in other cases, the performance of skills could only occur with a physician or nurse present, much like the existing Franco-German model. [...] This was absolutely necessary in the earliest stages of paramedicine as, in the absence of formal licensing arrangements for paramedics, they often functioned {{as an extension of the}} physician's medical license. [...] This type of arrangement persists to this day in some locations, such as the Canadian province of Ontario. [...] As the training, knowledge and skill level of paramedics grew, as they developed licensing and certification processes, and as physicians became more comfortable in working with this new profession, greater degrees of independent practice were permitted. [...] This would ultimately evolve into a system in which most paramedics function almost purely on complex written protocols or s committed to memory, often numerous pages in length, and contacting a physician only when standing orders have been exhausted.|$|E
