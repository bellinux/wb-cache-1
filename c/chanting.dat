During the 7th and 8th centuries Canterbury was renowned for the excellence of its clergy's <b>chanting,</b> and sent singing masters to instruct others, including two to Wilfrid, who became Bishop of York. Putta, the first Bishop of Rochester, had a reputation for his skill at <b>chanting,</b> which he was said to have learned from the Gregorian missionaries. One of them, James the Deacon, taught <b>chanting</b> in Northumbria after Paulinus returned to Kent; Bede noted that James was accomplished in the singing of the chants.|$|E

50|$|Apart from Byzantine <b>chant,</b> ison is {{also used}} in some Russian traditions, such as Valaam <b>chant.</b> Recently, under the {{influence}} of Byzantine <b>chant,</b> Znamenny <b>chant</b> also tends to be performed with the ison. This innovation is rather controversial however, as Znamenny <b>chant</b> follows different musical logic than the Byzantine <b>chant,</b> is less ornamental and mobile on its own, and also does not use different scales for different tones. With ison introduced, Znamenny <b>chant</b> tends sometimes to sound rather dull, and the <b>chants</b> of different tones become more similar, which is not always a desirable effect. Ison {{is also used}} in Bulgarian and Serbian <b>chant.</b>|$|R

5|$|In his teachings, Sai Baba {{emphasised}} {{the importance}} of performing one's duties without attachment to earthly matters and of being content regardless of the situation.
