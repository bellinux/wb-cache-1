40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a new 'Multi-Register and Four-Level' (RL) tonal model. Register {{is defined}} by phonation types. There are six major types of phonation, which define three Registers: H, M, and L. The RL model is an improvement over the traditional 'five-point' tonal scale. Its tenability depends on whether it can accommodate the three known five level tone systems. The most challenging case among the three is the Dong language of Gaoba, a variety of the Tai-Kadai family. A field investigation was conducted and the five Gaoba level tones were reexamined. It was found the highest level tone in Gaoba is produced with a falsetto voice. Gaoba Dong thus constitutes a piece of supportive, rather than <b>counter,</b> <b>evidence</b> for the RL model. Then we deal with several tonal systems with single-, double-, or triple-register(s) ...|$|R

First, {{it is important to have}} strong theoretical support for the exploratory investigation of a potential mediating variable. A criticism of a mediation approach rests on the ability to manipulate and measure a mediating variable. Thus, one must be able to manipulate the proposed mediator in an acceptable and ethical fashion. As such, one must be able to measure the intervening process without interfering with the outcome. The mediator must also be able to establish construct validity of manipulation. One of the most common criticisms of the measurement-of-mediation approach is that it is ultimately a correlational design. Consequently, it is possible that some other third variable, independent from the proposed mediator, could be responsible for the proposed effect.

30|$|However, <b>counter</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} that optimal and/or superior vision {{is not required}} to fulfil the potential for eliteness. Firstly, there are examples of elite-sporting individuals whose vision was sub-optimal. Mansoor Ali Khan (1941 – 2011) became the captain of the Indian cricket team at the age of 21 having lost sight in one eye when aged 16 [21], and there are also questions about the vision of the legendary Babe Ruth [22]. Secondly, low to moderate levels of retinal-image blur, simulating uncorrected myopia, may not necessarily impact negatively on performance in sporting tasks [23, 24], even in tasks where the visual demands are high [25 – 27]. Also, the uptake of eye care amongst elite-level athletes may be low; hence, suboptimal vision (e.g. due to uncorrected refractive error) may well exist amongst some elite sportspeople [28 – 32]. Finally, {{a number of studies have}} concluded that claims that vision can be trained or improved remain unproven [18, 33 – 35].|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{in-depth}} field study {{in a rural}} area of Namibia, this article assesses the potential contribution of community-based tourism enterprises (CBTEs) to poverty alleviation and empowerment. It shows that tourism income captured locally improves rural households' livelihoods and generates linkages in the local economy. On the job learning, training sessions and extensive support by non-governmental organisations and donors are further shown to empower rural actors and unlock socioeconomic opportunities for the future. In this context, CBTEs can be characterised as pro-poor initiatives. However, this article provides <b>counter</b> <b>evidence</b> that the sustainability of such community tourism ventures is to be questioned. First, mainstreaming these projects within the competitive tourism commodity chain proves highly challenging and costly; second, communities' institutional and managerial capacity is weak and thus CBTEs' viability is limited; finally, inadequate support by donors and non-governmental organisations fails to tackle challenges faced by community tourism ventures. community-based tourism, livelihoods, institutional arrangements, global commodity chains,...|$|R
40|$|This study {{uses the}} {{thematic}} analysis {{developed by the}} Glasgow University Media Group to explore how the US, UK and German national press covered the US/Coalition assault on the Iraqi city of Fallujah in November 2004. The study relies on quantitative and qualitative full text content analyses to assess 428 news, editorial and commentary items. The article suggests that, while government and military officials of the US/Coalition had argued the military ‘operation’ was necessary to secure Iraq and defeat an ‘insurgency’, organisations and actors from Iraqi society refer to the ‘operation’ as ‘collective punishment’ and a ‘massacre’ that targeted the Iraqi population. The article investigates how the press represented each of these perspectives.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to extend the {{application}} of the lexical root theory to the investigation of select religious terms in English and Arabic to prove their genetic relationship. It criticizes and rejects the claims of the Comparative Historical Method that Indo-European languages have no genetic relationship to Arabic whatsoever. It provides further definitive <b>counter</b> <b>evidence</b> that such languages are not only related to Arabic but are also descended from it directly. The evidence concerns Arabic and English words in the area of faith and religion, which have been deliberately excluded from Swadesh’s 100 - and 200 -word lists used in language family classifications. The paper argues that religious terms are as central as core vocabulary because man’s life is meaningless without faith that opens up windows of future hope and achieves internal and external peace and security. More precisely, it shows how certain extremely common Arabic religious words and expressions exist in today’s English, noting minor phonetic and semantic changes...|$|R

Religious attendance was assessed yearly over five years using the single question, “how often do you attend religious gatherings nowadays?” Depressive symptoms were assessed four times within the first year using the Depression subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Logistic regression models of change in attendance were created, stratifying by baseline attendance status. Attenders who developed elevated symptoms {{were less likely to}} subsequently decrease their attendance (relative risk ratio: 0. 55, 95 % CI [0. 38 – 0. 79]) relative to baseline as compared to those without elevated symptoms.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is two-fold: to test the Aspect Hypothesis, {{according}} to which the early use of tense—aspect morphology patterns by semantic/aspectual features of verbs, and Tense is initially defective (e. g.

Based on longitudinal data from a Turkish child second language (L 2) learner of English, we present <b>counter</b> <b>evidence</b> for both hypotheses.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} bank mergers on loan pricing. Using a sample of U. S. commercial and industrial loans, I find that banks reduce loan interest rates after they acquire target banks with small market shares. This merger effect is largest {{in the first two}} years and almost disappears by the third year after the merger. Ex-ante conditions such as the concentration of the banking market and the market overlap of merging banks significantly affect merger effects in ways consistent with theory predic-tions. Merger effects are also found to vary across firms: mergers lead to larger rate reductions for informationally opaque firms than for informationally transparent firms. This provides <b>counter</b> <b>evidence</b> for the concern that bank mergers will particularly hurt firms lacking high-quality quantitative information. Although merging banks reduce their loan interest rates, rival banks, i. e., banks located in the same markets as the merging banks, leave their loan interest rates unchanged after mergers occur. This can be attributed to the fact that rival banks do not get efficiency gains as merging banks do and thus do not find it profitable to follow the pricing changes of merging banks...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine ideological, psychological, and {{demographic}} predictors of motivated reasoning. Three-hundred and seventy-seven participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk system completed written responses critically evaluating strengths and weaknesses in a vignette on the topic of anthropogenic climate change. The vignette has two fictional scientists present prototypical arguments for and against anthropogenic climate change that are constructed with equally flawed and conflicting reasoning from both view points. Written responses were coded by a team of trained and reliability assessed qualitative raters. Motivated reasoning is operationalized by providing supporting evidence for the congruent belief and <b>counter</b> <b>evidence</b> against the incongruent belief. We found higher levels of dogmatism and lower levels of neuroticism in those engaging in motivated reasoning. Participants who supported anthropogenic climate change had equal levels of need for cognition, adoption of scientific attitudes, and openness to experience to participants who did not accept anthropogenic climate change, but were less conservative and more neurotic. Participant reasoning was predominately assessed as encompassing valid statements, supporting the notion that reasoning about beliefs and corresponding evidence creates directional reasoning and not necessarily invalid reasoning...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the capacity of}} Town Centre Management (TCM) to contribute towards the social enhancement of local places and communities in the English context. Much recent literature has highlighted the effectiveness of TCM, referring to the same objectives as those of recent regeneration programmes: place marketing, retail and leisure development, surveillance measures and evening and night time economies. However, these aspects of urban regeneration favoured by TCM are mainly concerned with consumption-based economic revitalization and physical upgrading, while {{little attention has been}} paid to social dimensions of regeneration issues. The key to the examination of the TCM’s roles in social regeneration may lie in questions of pursuing social equity: how does TCM plays a role in redistributing some of the benefits brought by physical and economic regeneration into the development of local communities? Out of the pilot study and twelve case studies, only three cases (Wigan, Doncaster and Wood Green) have demonstrated positive impact of TCM in pursuing social equity of the regeneration premises, while two (Birmingham and Reading) have provided <b>counter</b> <b>evidence.</b> Utilising the data from these five case studies, this article discusses the roles and potential of TCM in redistributing the regeneration benefits over the communities from different social strata. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about using {{evidence}} from previous authors; literature reviews. This {{has already been}} done, for example by WEBSTER and WATSON (2002) in the journal MISQ and LATOUR (1987) in "Science in Action," but the former used the root metaphor of the previous literature being objective facts (truthful sign posts) towards empirics while LATOUR used the root metaphor of references ganging up on the reader to persuade. This paper will provide a middle road on the same topic using the root metaphor of the courtroom. Revealing and justifying alternative root metaphors is central to interpretive research. Therefore, presentation of these different interpretations of the same topic (literature reviews) provides {{a unique opportunity to}} appreciate "seeking interpretations" as a research methodology. Readers are advised to read these two other interpretations as well as this paper, noting how a different root metaphor can lead to very different appreciation of a situation. Therefore, and more specifically, this paper will argue for social inquiry researchers to adopt the root metaphor of considering literature reviews to be the calling upon expert witnesses to provide supporting or <b>counter</b> <b>evidence</b> justifying their paper's conclusion.
