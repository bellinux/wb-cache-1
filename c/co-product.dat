25|$|The two {{additional}} scenarios for sugarcane ethanol were {{requested by the}} Board in order to account for improved harvesting practices and the export of electricity from sugarcane ethanol plants in Brazil using energy from bagasse. These two scenarios {{are not to be}} considered average for all of Brazilian ethanol but specific cases when such practices are adopted in Brazil. Scenario 1 considers mechanized harvesting of cane which is gradually replacing the traditional practice of burning straw before harvesting cane, and the sale of electricity (co-generated) from power plants that are capable of exporting additional energy beyond that required for processing in the plant (<b>co-product</b> credit). Scenario 2 only considers the export of electricity (<b>co-product)</b> from power plants capable of producing the additional electricity for export. The assumptions or values for the baseline pathway published in February 2009 are the same, including the estimates of indirect land use change for all Brazilian sugarcane scenarios.|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} decade, {{the amount of}} ethanol fuel {{produced}} from corn each year has increased dramatically. This increase in ethanol production increases the demand for corn {{to be used as}} fuel and decreases its supply for livestock feed. The increasing ethanol production also increases the supply of corn <b>co-products,</b> feeds produced in the conversion of corn to ethanol. Traditionally <b>co-products</b> have been included in beef feedlot rations to decrease costs.

40|$|Agroindustrial <b>co-products</b> are {{a viable}} {{alternative}} for use in animal nutrition. Tests were conducted using eight different types of <b>co-products</b> and feed to evaluate the chemical composition, in vitro digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and neutral detergent fiber, and gas production by them. The <b>co-products</b> tested were: coffee hulls; pelleted citrus pulp; grape residue; soybean hulls; cottonseed; cassava foliage; and foods usually supplied to ruminants: corn silage and ground corn concentrate. Data of in vitro digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and neutral detergent fiber were tested by analysis of variance using the least square method; the results of gas production were interpreted by a non-linear regression by the Gauss-Newton method; {{and the effects of}} treatments were evaluated by the Tukey’s test. The coefficients of in vitro digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and neutral detergent fiber of <b>co-products</b> were different. Gas production was also different between <b>co-products</b> and feeds evaluated for the volume of gas produced from the fast and slow degradation fractions, degradation rate, bacterial colonization time, and the total volume of gas produced. The evaluated <b>co-products</b> exhibited greater in vitro dry matter digestibility compared to corn silage, except for cottonseed, grape residue, and cassava foliage. <b>Co-products</b> showed higher values of in vitro crude protein digestibility compared to corn silage, and a reduced in vitro digestibility of neutral detergent fiber, except for pelleted citrus pulp and soybean hulls. Corn silage produced larger volume of gas from the fast degradation fraction compared to the <b>co-products</b> and corn concentrate. <b>Co-products</b> analyzed had appropriate nutritional characteristics according to the techniques applied and can be included in ruminant diets...|$|R
25|$|In 2006 {{researchers}} of EPFL, Switzerland, {{reported the}} use of formic acid as a hydrogen storage material. Carbon monoxide free hydrogen has been generated in a very wide pressure range (1–600 bar). A homogeneous catalytic system based on water-soluble ruthenium catalysts selectively decompose HCOOH into H2 and CO2 in aqueous solution. This catalytic system overcomes the limitations of other catalysts (e.g. poor stability, limited catalytic lifetimes, formation of CO) for the decomposition of formic acid making it a viable hydrogen storage material. And the <b>co-product</b> of this decomposition, carbon dioxide, {{can be used as}} hydrogen vector by hydrogenating it back to formic acid in a second step. The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 has long been studied and efficient procedures have been developed. Formic acid contains 53 g L−1 hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. By weight, pure formic acid stores 4.3 wt% hydrogen. Pure formic acid is a liquid with a flash point 69°C (cf. gasoline −40°C, ethanol 13°C). 85% formic acid is not flammable.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Biomass <b>co‐products</b> {{from the}} dry‐grind ethanol {{production}} process and/or corn stover are potential {{sources for the}} energy needed to operate the plant. The ethanol plant <b>co‐products</b> alone contain sufficient energy to meet the electrical and thermal needs of the plant {{as well as to}} produce excess power that can be sold. Fuel characteristics of <b>co‐products</b> of the ethanol dry‐grind process [distillers wet grains (DWG), concentrated distillers solubles (referred to as “syrup”), and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) ], and corn stover are evaluated. Analyses include proximate, ultimate, selected metals, ash fusion temperatures, minerals in the ash, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Higher heating values for the <b>co‐products</b> are greater than for corn stover and for most other biomass materials. The ethanol <b>co‐products</b> contain large amounts of nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, which will require major control technologies for combustion or gasification systems to meet emissions limits. The alkali metal content (potassium and sodium oxides) of the ash is high (22 % to 34 %) for <b>co‐products</b> and corn stover, which will require careful design to avoid to ash fouling in combustion and steam generation units. Corn stover has more favorable combustion characteristics than the ethanol <b>co‐products</b> based on higher ash fusion temperatures and the TGA results (higher combustion reactivity and lower burnout temperature) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} biofuel industrial production chains will {{increase in the}} coming years and will be a promising source of <b>co-products</b> that are useful for sustainable farming systems. However, the use of <b>co-products</b> that are obtained from the biofuel production chains, especially for crop disease management, is an under-explored area in the research community. The liquid and solid <b>co-products</b> that are related to the biofuel outputs of particular interest in crop protection are 1) oil-less seed meals and glycerin derived from the biodiesel chain, 2) steam-exploded liquid waste derived from a 2 nd-generation bioethanol chain, and 3) charcoal (bio-char) obtained from the pyrolysis of plant biomass. It is interesting to include the suppressive composts that are obtained by composting agricultural waste and the exhausted biomasses originating from the different biofuel chains. This overview summarizes the nature, the effects, the mechanisms, the possible applications, and the use in crop protection of the most important solid and liquid <b>co-products</b> that are obtained from industrial processes, focusing on 2 nd-generation biofuel outputs to control economically important plant diseases that are caused by soil-borne pathogens. The aim of this work is to review the available studies on the employment perspectives of biofuel chain <b>co-products</b> in crop protection by distinguishing the two concepts that are most important in sustainable farming systems: 1) the possible effects of these organic inputs in terms of interaction with beneficial soil microbial populations and 2) the possible relationships of these organic inputs in terms of interaction with the physiological and ecological processes of the crop-pathogen systems. This distinction will permit a good definition of the potential advantages of biofuel chain <b>co-products</b> with respect to the traditional organic amendments that are usually used in crop protection. It is evident from this review that biofuel chain <b>co-products</b> have great potential but sometimes give inconsistent disease control, which limits their use in crop protection. There {{is no doubt that the}} benefits of biofuel chain <b>co-products</b> outweigh their drawbacks, but the impact of this approach on pathogen populations and disease suppression is often unpredictable...|$|R

40|$|Although, {{according}} to the ISO 14044 standard, economic allocation should be the solution of last resort, it is frequently used in LCA studies of agri-food systems because of the inadequacy of solutions preferred by ISO. We propose {{a new way of}} allocating impacts to plant <b>co-products</b> {{according to}} the underlying physical relationships between the <b>co-products.</b> We compare this method to two current allocation methods. (i) We surveyed 24 LCA studies from peer-reviewed scientific journals and scientific reports for the 2000 - 2013 period that attributed impacts to plant <b>co-products</b> used as animal feed to establish the prevalence of allocation methods in recent LCA studies. (ii) We calculated allocation factors for 21 plant <b>co-products</b> used as ingredients for animal feeds according to three methods: energy allocation based on lower heating values (En), economic allocation based on average prices for a 5 -year period (Ec), and allocation based on plant physiological construction cost of plant compounds (Cc). (i) In the studies surveyed, Ec was used in 19 out of 24 cases. En was used in three studies, system expansion and mass allocation were used in two studies, while nitrogen content was used in one study. (ii) Compared to En and Ec, Cc yielded higher allocation factors for protein-rich <b>co-products</b> and lower factors for lipids. Whereas the difference between En and Cc was modest (up to 5 percentage points), the difference between Ec and Cc was more variable and sometimes large (up to 18 percentage points).

40|$|This review studies biofuel {{expansion}} {{in terms of}} competition between conventional and advanced biofuels based on bioenergy potential. Production of advanced biofuels is generally more expensive than current biofuels because products are not yet cost competitive. What is overlooked in the discussion about biofuel is the contribution the industry makes to the global animal feed supply and land use for cultivation of feedstocks. The global ethanol industry produces 44 million metric tonnes of high-quality feed, however, the <b>co-products</b> of biodiesel production have a moderate impact on the feed market contributing to just 8 – 9 million tonnes of protein meal output a year. By economically displacing traditional feed ingredients <b>co-products</b> from biofuel production are an important and valuable component of the biofuels sector and the global feed market. The return of <b>co-products</b> to the feed market has agricultural land use (and GHG emissions) implications as well. The use of <b>co-products</b> generated from grains and oilseeds can reduce net land use by 11 % to 40 %. The proportion of global cropland used for biofuels is currently some 2 % (30 – 35 million hectares).
