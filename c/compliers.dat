5000|$|Advocates of ITT {{point out}} that it is also simpler than other forms of study design and {{analysis}} because it does not require observation of compliance status for units assigned to different treatments or incorporation of compliance into the analysis. In other words, critics say, you don't have to know the effect of the pill only whether people were told to take it -- most people do not want to know that. The idea of ITT comes from studies where pills, e.g., may be prescribed in an outpatient setting where you don't know who complied and who didn't so there is no choice but to include all the data. Once you do know, however, who is in the experiment and who isn't, it is reasonable to include <b>compliers</b> -- although separately it is good to know whether an intervention was capable of getting good compliance. Proponents of ITT suggest that although ITT analysis is widely employed in published clinical trials, it can be incorrectly described and there are some issues with its application. Critics suggest that ITT asks the question [...] "What is the effect of being assigned to a medical intervention?" [...] If, instead, the results are described as if they measure the effect of the intervention, that is incorrect. Furthermore, there is no consensus on how to carry out an ITT analysis in the presence of missing outcome data. Here, critics say that missing data is not data, [...] "imputing" [...] data, is fabricating it. Science has numerous statistical methods like curve fitting to deal with incomplete data.|$|E

40|$|To {{consider}} {{the role of}} uncertain production cost resulting from complying with rules of origin (ROO), we formulate a Cournot oligopoly model of a free trade area (FTA). If exporters do not comply with ROO, they must pay an external tariff, and if they comply, they enjoy zero tariff but suffer an uncertain production cost. Because <b>compliers</b> must source a certain ratio of the inputs from within the area, they face input-price fluctuations in that area; this yields an uncertain production cost for <b>compliers.</b> This uncertain cost provides a benefit to <b>compliers</b> owing to its variance. Therefore, for an intermediate external tariff, strategic substitution emerges in exporters' choice. We show that the coexistence of <b>compliers</b> and non-compliers is seen among symmetric exporters. We also discuss the endogenous rate of ROO-compliers in the coexisting equilibrium of <b>compliers</b> and non-compliers. We show that if the variance of the uncertain production cost is small, the rate of ROO-compliers in the coexisting equilibrium increases {{with the number of}} total exporters inside the FTA. ...|$|E
30|$|Under the LATE interpretation, the IV {{estimates}} that follow reflect {{the effect of}} schooling for the “compliers” of our instrument, i.e. the people whose schooling was affected by the policy. Although <b>compliers</b> are unobserved and we lack predetermined variables to characterize them, we conjecture that the <b>compliers</b> in our case {{ought to have been}} relatively academically weak students. This conjecture is based {{on the nature of the}} instrument, which made access to secondary school more difficult, thus presumably blocking schooling to the “marginal” students. The conjectured identity of the <b>compliers</b> plays a role in the interpretation of our results below.|$|E
30|$|On average, the <b>compliers</b> to the {{instrument}} are likely less advantaged than the non-compliers. For example, they left school {{in states with}} a lower prevalence of white collar workers, fewer private health insurance mandates, lower average Medicaid expenditures {{for a family of}} four, and lower state expenditures on health and hospitals. Moreover, the <b>compliers</b> left school with fewer years of education at younger ages, have lower age-adjusted AFQT scores, have less educated parents, and have otherwise less advantaged family backgrounds (e.g., at age 14 they have less access to cultural materials in the home {{and are more likely to}} live in a rural area) than the non-compliers. Moreover, these differences are generally statistically different from zero. <b>Compliers</b> are less likely to be an ethnic minority and speak a non-English language in the home at age 14, however.|$|E
40|$|Instrumental {{variable}} (IV) is {{a standard}} tool to measure {{the effect of a}} treatment. However, it relies on a strong "no-defiers" condition, and it captures the effect of the treatment for <b>compliers</b> only. This paper shows that no-defiers can be replaced by a weaker condition, which requires only that conditional on their treatment effects, more subjects move in the compliant direction than otherwise. This weaker condition is sufficient to capture causal effects for a subgroup of same size as the standard population of <b>compliers.</b> It also shows that the effect of the treatment is the same for <b>compliers</b> as for a larger population G. As a result, IV also captures treatment effects for G. The size of G can be bounded.

40|$|Randomized {{experiments}} are {{the gold standard}} for evaluating proposed treatments. The intent to treat estimand (ITT) measures the effect of treatment assignment, but not the effect of treatment if subjects take treatments to which they are not assigned. The desire to estimate the efficacy of the treatment in this case has been the impetus for a substantial literature on compliance over the last 15 years. In papers dealing with this issue, it is typically assumed there are different types of subjects, for example, those who will follow treatment assignment (<b>compliers),</b> and those who will always take a particular treatment irrespective of treatment assignment. The estimands of primary interest are the complier proportion and the complier average treatment effect (CACE). To estimate CACE, researchers have used various methods, for example, instrumental variables and parametric mixture models, treating <b>compliers</b> as a single class. However, it is often unreasonable to believe all <b>compliers</b> will be affected. This paper therefore treats <b>compliers</b> as a mixture of two types, those belonging to a zero effect class, others to an effect class. Second, in most experiments, some subjects drop out or simply do not report the value of the outcome variable, and the failure to take into account missing data can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. Recent work on compliance in randomized experiments has addressed this issue by assuming missing data are missing at random or latently ignorable. We extend this work to the case where <b>compliers</b> are a mixture of types and also examine alternative types of non-ignorable missing data assumptions...|$|E
40|$|Many {{empirical}} studies use Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity (FRD) designs to identify treatment effects when {{the receipt of}} treatment is potentially correlated to outcomes. Existing FRD methods identify the local average treatment effect (LATE) on the subpopulation of <b>compliers</b> with values of the forcing variable that are equal to the threshold. We develop methods that assess the plausibility of generalizing LATE to subpopulations other than <b>compliers,</b> and to subpopulations other than those with forcing variable equal to the threshold. Specifically, we focus on testing the equality of the distributions of potential outcomes for treated <b>compliers</b> and always-takers, and for untreated <b>compliers</b> and never-takers. We show that equality of these pairs of distributions implies that the expected outcome conditional on the forcing variable and the treatment status is continuous in the forcing variable at the threshold, {{for each of the}} two treatment regimes. Our main recommendation is that researchers, as a matter of routine, present graphs with estimates of these two conditional expectations in addition to graphs with estimates of the expected outcome conditional on the forcing variable alone.

In our application to the active labour market programmes in Switzerland, we find large positive employment effects for at least 8 years after treatment for the <b>compliers.</b> On the other hand, the effects for the always- and never-participants are small. In addition, when examining the potential outcomes separately, we find that the <b>compliers</b> have the worst employment outcomes without treatment.

In the Eastern Cape, South Africa, TB {{is a public}} health problem of epidemic proportion. Poor compliance and frequent interruption to treatment are associated with increased transmission rates, morbidity, and costs to TB control programs. This study explored determinants of (non-) compliance from the patients' perspective. Methods: Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} patients (33 treatment <b>compliers</b> and 34 treatment non-compliers) and 14 community health workers from local community clinics and the hospital in the township of Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Q-methodology was used. Patients rank ordered 32 opinion statements describing determinants of treatment compliance from the TB adherence model. By-person factor analysis was used to explore patterns in the rankings of statements by <b>compliers</b> and non-compliers. These patterns were interpreted and described as patient views on determinants of compliance with treatment. Patients and community health workers selected the top five determinants of compliance and non-compliance. Results: <b>Compliers</b> believed that completing treatment would cure them of TB. Economic prospects were crucial for compliance. <b>Compliers</b> felt that the support of the government disability grant helped with compliance. Non-compliers believed that stigmatization had the greatest impact on non-compliance, together with the burden of disease, the arrangements involved with receiving treatment, restrictions accompanying treatment, and the association of TB with HIV/AIDS infection. Conclusions: Stigmatization makes TB a 'social disease'. Individual motivation and self-efficacy appear to have a considerable effect on compliance, but, for non-compliers, the general lack of job prospects and being able to provide for themselves or their family also makes TB very much an 'economic disease'.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is a lack}} of {{research}} regarding the long-lasting effects of a more physically active lifestyle in patients with mental disorders. In the present study, clinical data were analysed to examine if initially physically inactive patients, clinically diagnosed with stress-related exhaustion, taking part in 12 -month multimodal treatment (MMT), differ at the 18 -month follow-up regarding mental health, depending on whether they did or did not comply with the physical activity (PA) recommendations resembling those of the American College of Sports Medicine. METHODS: The study population consisted of 69 patients (65  % women) who were referred to a stress clinic due to stress-related exhaustion. All patients received MMT. A major goal was to increase patients' PA levels. The patients received general comprehensive instructions including personal advice regarding the positive effects of PA on mental health and could self-select for an 18 -week coached exercise program. Changes in mental health symptoms over an 18 -month period were compared between non-compliers (n[*]=[*] 26), mild <b>compliers</b> (n[*]=[*] 22) and strong <b>compliers</b> (n[*]=[*] 21) with the PA recommendations included in the MMT. RESULTS: Non-compliers, mild and strong <b>compliers</b> did not differ regarding burnout, depression and anxiety at baseline. Although substantial improvements occurred in all groups, mild and strong <b>compliers</b> reported significantly lower burnout and depression levels at the 18 -month follow-up than the non-complying group (p[*]<[*]. 05). The general pattern of findings was corroborated, if standard cut-off criteria for clinical burnout were used. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with PA recommendations is associated with decreased levels of burnout and depression in patients with stress-related exhaustion. Thus, the promotion of a more active lifestyle among patients with stress-related exhaustion should be implemented as a part of MMT, to achieve a more sustainable decrease of symptoms of burnout and depression.
