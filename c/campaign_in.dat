5|$|As {{a prelude}} to his planned <b>campaign</b> <b>in</b> Greece, Philip went on <b>campaign</b> <b>in</b> the winter of 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He {{defeated}} them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through {{the territory of the}} Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's <b>campaign</b> <b>in</b> Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} changes <b>in</b> negative <b>campaigning</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands between 1981 and 2010. In addition, we examine which factors determine whether political parties {{are likely to}} make use of this <b>campaign</b> strategy <b>in</b> the Dutch multi-party system. We advance existing research on negative <b>campaigning</b> <b>in</b> two ways. First of all, this is the most extensive study of negative <b>campaigning</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands conducted so far and to our knowledge also the most extensive conducted in any multi-party system. Second, our study contributes to the theoretical understanding of the determinants of negative <b>campaigning</b> <b>in</b> a multi-party context by differentiating between parties' vote-seeking and office-seeking incentives, and stating the implications of office-seeking for the use of negative campaigning. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd...|$|R
