2500|$|Plant viruses {{need to be}} {{transmitted}} by a vector, most often insects such as leafhoppers. One class of viruses, the Rhabdoviridae, has been proposed to actually be insect viruses that have evolved to replicate in plants. The chosen insect vector of a plant virus will often be the determining factor in that virus's host range: it can only infect plants that the insect vector feeds upon. This was shown in part when the old world white fly {{made it to the}} United States, where it transferred many plant viruses into new hosts. Depending on the way they are transmitted, plant viruses are classified as non-persistent, semi-persistent and persistent. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet of the insect and on the next plant it feeds on, it inoculates it with the virus. Semi-persistent viral transmission involves the virus entering the foregut of the insect. Those viruses that manage to pass through the gut into the haemolymph and then to the salivary glands are known as persistent. There are two sub-classes of persistent viruses: propagative and <b>circulative.</b> Propagative viruses are able to replicate in both the plant and the insect (and may have originally been insect viruses), whereas <b>circulative</b> can not. <b>Circulative</b> viruses are protected inside aphids by the chaperone protein symbionin, produced by bacterial symbionts. [...] Many plant viruses encode within their genome polypeptides with domains essential for transmission by insects. In non-persistent and semi-persistent viruses, these domains are in the coat protein and another protein known as the helper component. A bridging hypothesis has been proposed to explain how these proteins aid in insect-mediated viral transmission. The helper component will bind to the specific domain of the coat protein, and then the insect mouthparts — creating a bridge. In persistent propagative viruses, such as tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), there is often a lipid coat surrounding the proteins that is not seen in other classes of plant viruses. In the case of TSWV, 2 viral proteins are expressed in this lipid envelope. It has been proposed that the viruses bind via these proteins and are then taken into the insect cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E

Since there are two modes in which the inequality, which is indeed the condition and constituent of riches, may be established--namely, by increase of possession on the one side, and by decrease of it on the other--we have to inquire, with respect to any given state of riches, precisely in what manner the correlative poverty was produced; that is to say, whether by being surpassed only, or being depressed, what are the advantages, or the contrary, conceivable in the depression. For instance, it being one of the commonest advantages of being rich to entertain a number of servants, we have to inquire, on the one side, what economical process produced the poverty of the persons who serve him; and what advantage each (on his own side) derives from the result.|$|E

A <b>circulative</b> transmission mechanism refers to a transmission mechanism in which the vector ingests a pathogen during feeding from an infected host, the pathogen is absorbed in the vector’s gut and then travels through the hemocoel into the salivary glands.

50|$|The {{transmission}} of the CYLV occurs by mechanical inoculation of the plant by aphids of the genus Cavariella, popularly known as “plant lice”. The vector transmits the virus while feeding the host organic matter contained in the phloem. There is a minimum latent period of 7-18 hours after the vector has acquired the virus. The viruses remain <b>circulative</b> in the vector, but are not transmitted to their progeny insects, {{which means that the}} viral infection occurs horizontally.

The virions attach to the aphid stylet {{in a matter of seconds}} and may remain infectious for four to seventeen hours. The distance over which the virions can be transmitted is limited due to the short period for which they remain infectious.

5000|$|The largest {{distinction}} between the two forms appears through the result of each. During C-M-C, a commodity sold will be replaced by a commodity bought. In this form money only acts as a means of exchange. The transaction ends there, with the exchange of use-values and the money has, according to Marx, [...] "been spent once and for all." [...] The C-M-C form facilitates the exchange of one use-value for another. On the contrary, during M-C-M, money is essentially exchanged for more money. The person who invested money into a commodity sells it for money. The money returns to the initial starting place, so the money is not spent, as in the C-M-C form of exchange, but instead advanced. The only function of this process lies in its ability to valorize.

5000|$|It {{is known}} that Banana aphid (Pentalonia nigronervosa) transmits the virus from {{infected}} to healthy plants by feeding. Aphids feed on the plant phloem tissues by injecting their thin, flexible stylet into the epidermis of the plant tissue until it reaches the phloem of the leaves. Then the aphid injects saliva and sucks the cell contents. This ingestion of viral components is done inadvertently by the aphid. Vector transmission of the BBTV is <b>circulative</b> and non-propagative, meaning that transmission of the virus occurs from and to the phloem tissues and the virus does not replicate within the aphid’s midgut. Acquisition of the virus by the banana aphid requires about 18 hours of feeding and then the aphid can retain the virus for approximately two weeks. [...] The retransmission of this virus can happen after as little as two hours of feeding on a healthy plant however it takes about {{a month for the}} BBTD symptoms to appear after infection. To infect, the carrier aphid can feed on the banana plant for as few as 15 minutes, but more often a couple hours, as the longer feeding time will increase the odds of transmission. The suckers produced on infected plants that would usually be used for planting the next season will also be diseased, which is one way the disease can spread from year to year. Banana aphids also have the capability to feed on Heliconia and flowering ginger; however, these alternate hosts of the aphid vector are not hosts of the virus. The ability of banana aphids to feed on alternate hosts {{is important to keep in}} mind when attempting to control the virus.|$|E

Translocation analysis has shown that, whereas TYLCV-Is DNA is conspicuous in the digestive tract, hemolymph, and salivary glands of B. tabaci 8 h after acquisition feeding started, AbMV-Is DNA was detected only in the insect digestive tract, even after 96 h. To determine whether AbMV-Is particles were rapidly degraded in the hemolymph as a result of their inability to interact with GroEL, we have isolated a GroEL gene from B. tabaci and used a yeast two-hybrid assay to compare binding of the CP of TYLCV-Is and AbMV-Is to the insect GroEL. The yeast assay showed that the CPs of the two viruses are able to bind efficiently to GroEL. We therefore suggest that, although GroEL-CP interaction in the hemolymph is a necessary condition for <b>circulative</b> transmission, the nontransmissibility of AbMV-Is is not the result of lack of binding to GroEL in the B. tabaci hemolymph, but most likely results from an inability to cross the gut/hemolymph barrier. © 2000 Academic Press Key Words: GroEL gene; <b>circulative</b> transmission; geminiviruses; whitefly...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{virus species}} of the family Nanoviridae have {{segmented}} genomes with the highest known number of segments encapsidated individually. They thus likely represent the most extreme case of the so-called multipartite, or multicomponent, viruses. All {{species of the}} family {{are believed to be}} transmitted in a <b>circulative</b> nonpropagative manner by aphid vectors, meaning that the virus simply crosses cellular barriers within the aphid body, from the gut to the salivary glands, without replicating or even expressing any of its genes. However, this assumption is largely based on analogy with the transmission of other plant viruses, such as geminiviruses or luteoviruses, and the details of the molecular and cellular interactions between aphids and nanoviruses are poorly investigated. When comparing the relative frequencies of the eight genome segments in populations of the species Faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV) (genus Nanovirus) within host plants and within aphid vectors fed on these plants, we unexpectedly found evidence of reproducible changes in the frequencies of some specific segments. We further show that these changes occur within the gut during early stages of the virus cycle in the aphid and not later, when the virus is translocated into the salivary glands. This peculiar observation, which was similarly confirmed in three aphid vector species, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Aphis craccivora, and Myzus persicae, calls for revisiting of the mechanisms of nanovirus transmission. It reveals an unexpected intimate interaction that may not fit the canonical <b>circulative</b> nonpropagative transmission. IMPORTANCE A specific mode of interaction between viruses and arthropod vectors has been extensively described in plant viruses in the three families Luteoviridae, Geminiviridae, and Nanoviridae, but never in arboviruses of animals. This so-called <b>circulative</b> nonpropagative transmission contrasts with the classical biological transmission of animal arboviruses in that the corresponding viruses are thought to cross the vector cellular barriers, from the gut lumen to the hemolymph and to the salivary glands, without expressing any of their genes and without replicating. By monitoring the genetic composition of viral populations during the life cycle of Faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV) (genus Nanovirus), we demonstrate reproducible genetic changes during the transit of the virus within the body of the aphid vector. These changes do not fit the view that viruses simply traverse the bodies of their arthropod vectors and suggest more intimate interactions, calling into question the current understanding of <b>circulative</b> nonpropagative transmission...|$|E

The final topic is the possibility for international cooperation in the region in terms of E-waste management systems. The authors’ preliminary result is that the E-waste management systems operating in these East Asian countries have contributed to extended producer responsibility and DfE to some extent, but many challenges remain in their improvement through proper cost sharing among the stakeholders.

Knot- 1 silencing led to an increase in the amounts of TYLCV ingested by the insects and transmitted to tomato test plants by several orders of magnitude.

Although many parameters of acquisition and transmission have been established (see Part III, Chapter 2), the localization of TYLCV particles in the whitefly has been barely studied. TYLCV is transmitted in a <b>circulative</b> manner. Once ingested during feeding on phloem of infected plants, the viral particles cross the midgut wall barrier, are transported through the haemolymph to the salivary system, cross the salivary gland barrier and are transmitted to the plant during feeding (Ghanim et al., 2001 a). Few research articles describe the anatomy of B. tabaci organs and cells in relation to virus translocation, retention, and transmission.

40|$|Background: Phloem-feeding {{insects are}} among the most devastating pests worldwide. They not only cause damage by feeding from the phloem, thereby {{depleting}} the plant from photo-assimilates, but also by vectoring viruses. Until now, the main way to prevent such problems is the frequent use of insecticides. Applying resistant varieties would be a more environmental friendly and sustainable solution. For this, resistant sources need to be identified first. Up to now there were no methods suitable for high throughput phenotyping of plant germplasm to identify sources of resistance towards phloem-feeding insects. Results: In this paper we present a high throughput screening system to identify plants with an increased resistance against aphids. Its versatility is demonstrated using an Arabidopsis thaliana activation tag mutant line collection. This system consists of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and the <b>circulative</b> virus Turnip yellows virus (TuYV). In an initial screening, with one plant representing one mutant line, 13 virus-free mutant lines were identified by ELISA. Using seeds produced from these lines, the putative candidates were re-evaluated and characterized, resulting in nine lines with increased resistance towards the aphid. Conclusions: This M. persicae-TuYV screening system is an efficient, reliable and quick procedure to identify among thousands of mutated lines those resistant to aphids. In our study, nine mutant lines with increased resistance against the aphid were selected among 5160 mutant lines in just 5 months by one person.

40|$|Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus is the {{putative}} fastidious bacterial causal agent of citrus greening disease, {{also known as}} Huanglongbing (HLB), translated from Chinese as yellow dragon disease. The HLB bacterial pathogen is indigenous to Asia but has been introduced and dispersed to citrus throughout the Americas. A related bacterium that is indigenous to the Americas causes damage to potato (zebra chip) and tomato (vein-greening) and other solanaceous hosts. The causal agents are propagative and <b>circulative</b> in the psyllid vector, Diaphorina citri (Kuwayama) and Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc.), the Asian citrus and potato (or tomato) psyllid, respectively. The specific psyllid proteins that are indirectly or {{directly involved in the}} <b>circulative,</b> propagative transmission pathway are not known. However, if proteins were known that function at key points in the pathway e. g. post-ingestion, infection, biofilm formation, nutrition, circulation, and/or acquisition were known, such knowledge could be exploited to knock out their expression and abate pathogen transmission. To this end a combined approach involving functional genomics and anatomical localization of the bacterium is being implemented.   Results indicate that Ca. Liberibacter establishes biofilms on the outer surfaces of the alimentary canal and salivary glands of the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri Kuwayama and the potato psyllid (PP) Bactericera cockerelli Sulc. In silico transcript profiling of infected and uninfected ACP and PP identified a number of mis-expressed, unique transcripts (unitrans). Functional predictions (gene ontology associations) implicate certain of these unitrans in Ca. Liberibacter infection of the psyllid host and/or in psyllid-mediated Ca.

40|$|Abstract Background Phloem-feeding {{insects are}} among the most devastating pests worldwide. They not only cause damage by feeding from the phloem, thereby {{depleting}} the plant from photo-assimilates, but also by vectoring viruses. Until now, the main way to prevent such problems is the frequent use of insecticides. Applying resistant varieties would be a more environmental friendly and sustainable solution. For this, resistant sources need to be identified first. Up to now there were no methods suitable for high throughput phenotyping of plant germplasm to identify sources of resistance towards phloem-feeding insects. Results In this paper we present a high throughput screening system to identify plants with an increased resistance against aphids. Its versatility is demonstrated using an Arabidopsis thaliana activation tag mutant line collection. This system consists of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and the <b>circulative</b> virus Turnip yellows virus (TuYV). In an initial screening, with one plant representing one mutant line, 13 virus-free mutant lines were identified by ELISA. Using seeds produced from these lines, the putative candidates were re-evaluated and characterized, resulting in nine lines with increased resistance towards the aphid. Conclusions This M. persicae -TuYV screening system is an efficient, reliable and quick procedure to identify among thousands of mutated lines those resistant to aphids. In our study, nine mutant lines with increased resistance against the aphid were selected among 5160 mutant lines in just 5 [*]months by one person. The system can be extended to other phloem-feeding insects and <b>circulative</b> viruses to identify insect resistant sources from several collections, including for example genebanks and artificially prepared mutant collections. </p...|$|E
40|$|BGPI : Equipe 5 Insect-vectored plant viruses can induce {{changes in}} plant phenotypes, thus {{influencing}} plant-vector interactions {{in a way}} that may promote their dispersal according to their mode of transmission (i. e., <b>circulative</b> vs. noncirculative). This indirect vector manipulation requires host-virus-vector coevolution and would thus be effective solely in very specific plant-virus-vector species associations. Some studies suggest this manipulation may depend on multiple factors relative to various intrinsic characteristics of vectors such as transmission efficiency. In anintegrative study, we tested the effects of infection of the Brassicaceae Camelina sativa with the noncirculative Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) or the <b>circulative</b> Turnip yellows virus (TuYV) on the host-plant colonization of two aphid species differing in their virus transmission efficiency: the polyphagous Myzus persicae, efficient vector of both viruses, and the Brassicaceae specialist Brevicoryne brassicae, poor vector of TuYV and efficient vector of CaMV. Results confirmed the important role of virus mode of transmission as plant-mediated effects of CaMV on the two aphid species induced negative alterations of feeding behavior (i. e., decreased phloem sap ingestion) and performance that were both conducive for virus fitness by promoting dispersion after a rapid acquisition. In addition, virus transmission efficiency may also play a role in vector manipulation by viruses as only the responses of the efficient vector to plant-mediated effects of TuYV, that is, enhanced feeding behavior and performances, were favorable to their acquisition and further dispersal. Altogether, this work demonstrated that vector transmission efficiency also has to be considered when studying the mechanisms underlying vector manipulation by viruses. Our results also reinforce the idea that vector manipulation requires coevolution between plant, virus and vector...|$|E

Although {{thrombolytic}} {{therapy has}} been shown to be beneficial to stroke patients, the effectiveness of intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke patients with ventricle myxoma is unknown. Case Description. A 22 -year-old woman with left hemiplegia was sent to the emergency department at a teaching hospital. The magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, and the echocardiography showed a mass in the left ventricle. Intravenous recombined tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was administrated, and the postthrombolysis transcranial Doppler exam showed that her right middle cerebral artery was <b>circulative.</b> The patient's condition improved gradually, and no complication was observed up to 16 months of follow-up.

40|$|Virus {{transmission}} by aphids {{involves a}} combination of biological players that have co-evolved over years of interaction: plant hosts, aphid vectors, plant viruses and the aphid’s bacterial endosymbiont. In this interaction, plant hosts activate their immune defenses against plant viruses and aphids and the latter two use a myriad of strategies to overcome, counteract or skip the host plant defense, which sometimes is done in collaboration. Bacterial endosymbionts of insect vectors might {{also play a role}} in virus transmission, either directly or indirectly, as I discussed in a critical literature review. I used proteomics and aphid genetics to show that the “biotype” phenotype of aphids is generated by genetic recombination in sexual reproduction and that aphid virulence and virus transmission are independent traits. I also showed that the host plant where aphids are reared on affects the aphid ability to transmit a <b>circulative</b> virus, the Luteovirid Potato leafroll virus (PLRV). Using organismal, biochemical, molecular, and imaging approaches, I show that the differential expression and activity of gut cysteine proteases at the cell membrane of aphids reared on a PLRV non-host plant is responsible for the change in virus transmission phenotype. Finally, using small RNA sequencing, I showed that aphids do not activate their small interference RNA (siRNA) antiviral defense against PLRV, which provides additional evidence for the lack of replication of Luteovirids in their aphid vectors. However, aphids produce 22 nt long siRNA as an immune defense against an aphid virus, Myzus persicae Densovirus (MpDNV), which infects and replicates in the aphid. Strikingly, an abundance of unusually large sRNA, from 33 to 38 nt that aligned to MpDNV were produced only in aphids fed on PLRV-infected plants, suggesting that feeding on a plant infected with a <b>circulative</b> virus modulates the aphid antiviral immune defenses. The function of these large sRNAs is not yet known. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) is {{composed}} of two autonomously replicating virus RNAs related to the genomic RNAs of viruses in the genera Luteovirus and Umbravirus. The transmission of PEMV resembles that of its luteovirus relatives in utilizing <b>circulative</b> aphid transmission. However, unlike its luteovirus counterparts, PEMV can also be mechanically transmitted. Prolonged mechanical passage of PEMV {{can lead to the}} loss of aphid transmissibility, a trait that is mirrored by specific changes in the PEMV virion composition. These changes were used to examine the virus contri-bution to vector transmission and the mechanisms by which it is regulated.

Several {{studies have shown that}} insect vector proteins are involved in the passage and the {{transmission of}} the virus. Interestingly, proteins expressed by bacterial endosymbionts that reside in the insect vector, were also shown to influence the transmission of these viruses. Thus far, the transmission of two plant viruses that belong to different virus genera was shown to be facilitated by a bacterial chaperone protein called GroEL. This protein was shown to be implicated in the transmission of Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) by the green peach aphid Myzus persicae, and the transmission of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) by the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci.
