5|$|Declassified US {{documents}} {{indicate that}} the US may have violated the PTBT's ban on atmospheric testing in 1972 by, at the instruction of Henry Kissinger, monitoring and <b>collecting</b> <b>data</b> on French atmospheric tests over the Pacific Ocean, which may have amounted to cooperation with the French program.

5|$|In {{addition}} to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM {{would have helped}} astronomers construct {{a map of the}} Milky Way galaxy.

5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, <b>collecting</b> <b>data</b> for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E
5|$|At Fort Marlene, Mulder {{runs into}} the sickly looking Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), who tells Mulder that she was {{subjected}} to experiments by the Syndicate to create a black oil vaccine and that the colonists will begin colonization if they learn of Cassandra's existence as an alien-human hybrid. Scully, {{with help from the}} Lone Gunmen, looks into Fowley's personal history and informs Mulder that Fowley has been <b>collecting</b> <b>data</b> on alien abductees and traveling to Tunisia every week, although there is no trace of her activities in FBI records. Although Mulder still trusts Fowley, he goes to her apartment to confront her.|$|E
5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging {{and leaving the}} care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens {{as they grow older}} and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in <b>collecting</b> <b>data,</b> but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.|$|E

5|$|While {{over the}} South China Sea on October12, a United States Air Force WC-130H Hercules {{reconnaissance}} aircraft (call sign Swan 38), {{with a crew}} of six, went missing while <b>collecting</b> <b>data</b> on the cyclone. The plane took off from Clark Air Base during the night on October12 and made its final contact six hours later roughly 95km (60mi) north of Manila. A rescue team of five Air Force aircraft and the USS White Plains was dispatched to look for survivors. Search and rescue missions for the crew only found pieces of debris, such as an aircraft survival radio, soundproofing material, and orange cushion-like material. All six crewmen were never found and are presumed dead. Following the incident, the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron established the Swan 38 Memorial Scholarship for outstanding students in the 403d Wing.|$|E
5|$|Clark was {{assigned}} {{a position in the}} 1st Infantry Division and flew to Vietnam on May 21, 1969, during the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He worked as a staff officer, <b>collecting</b> <b>data</b> and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the Bronze Star for his work with the staff. Clark was then given command of A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. In February, only one month into his command, he was shot four times by a Viet Cong soldier with an AK-47. The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men, who counterattacked and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to his right shoulder, right hand, right hip, and right leg, and was sent to Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, to recuperate. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his actions during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The first practice session was initially held in wet-weather conditions before less rain fell and drivers were required to adapt to changing levels of grip. Full wet tyres {{were used in the}} session's opening period before the field utilised intermediate tyres in its closing minutes. The conditions prevented the teams from <b>collecting</b> <b>data</b> on how the dry-compound tyres would perform. Adrian Sutil was the fastest driver with a time of 1:25.701 seconds, ahead of Massa who spun several times and had the fastest time until Sutil's lap. Jenson Button was third-fastest despite complaining about his car's handling, ahead of Rubens Barrichello (who spun at high-speed at turn three after driving into a large amount of standing water) and Vitaly Petrov. Rosberg and Sébastien Buemi were sixth and seventh-fastest. Nico Hülkenberg, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Pedro de la Rosa rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. Hamilton drove over standing water at the exit of the turn three left-hander twenty minutes before the session ended and slid sideways into the turn four tyre barrier, heavily damaging his car.|$|E
40|$|Public {{registers}} in Czech Republic {{and their}} usage in demography Abstract The {{aim of this}} thesis is to introduce registers in gestion of ministries and other government bureaus and compare <b>collected</b> <b>data</b> in these registers with the ones collected in census. From the comparision results was designed process and methodology to replace census using paper forms with automatically <b>collected</b> <b>data</b> from registers or at least {{reduce the number of}} questions filled in the forms. With respect to huge scale of different registers used in Czech Republic, the selection of registers was conditioned with their connection to census <b>collected</b> <b>data.</b> Such registers are described with their function, <b>collected</b> <b>data</b> and their connection to census. It is clear, that this possibility is viable for main part of <b>collected</b> <b>data,</b> for the other part additional survey is still needed.
