40|$|Developmental {{pressure}} is encroaching many {{small towns and}} cities in Malaysia. The wave of development has caused small towns like Sungai Petani Town and its surrounding catchment area {{to be affected by}} the changing land uses due to developmental pressure in the catchment area. This paper examined the temporal patterns of nutrient concentrations longitudinally along the Sungai Petani River from March 2012 to December 2013 due to the unequal distribution of ‘green’ areas with respect to the ‘grey’ areas. Four stations were chosen longitudinally from upper Sungai Petani River downstream towards Sungai Petani Town and were monitored from upstream part of Sungai Petani Town which is the least affected station, through Sungai Petani Town and towards the downstream station below the Sungai Petani Town. Water sampling at all stations were performed through grab sampling technique at depths of about 0. 5 m. Water samples were analysed only for dissolved forms of nitrate (NO 3), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH 4), total nitrogen (TN), phosphate (P 04) and total phosphorus (TP). The samples were analysed using standard procedure by Adams (1989) and APHA (1998). Most of the nutrient concentrations increased from upper station to the second station situated in the Sungai Petani Town. Nitrate increases by 6 per <b>cent</b> <b>and</b> 15 per <b>cent</b> in 2012 <b>and</b> 2013 respectively, ammonia increases by 11 per <b>cent</b> <b>and</b> 35 per <b>cent</b> respectively, TN by 16 per <b>cent</b> <b>and</b> 22 per <b>cent</b> respectively, TP by 45 per <b>cent</b> <b>and</b> 44 per <b>cent</b> respectively, <b>and</b> PO 4 by 13 per <b>cent</b> <b>and</b> 90 per <b>cent</b> respectively. On the other hand, the concentration decreases from second to the last station at the outlet downstream of the town. Nitrate decreases by 16 per <b>cent</b> <b>and</b> 27 per <b>cent</b> in 2012 <b>and</b> 2013 respectively, ammonia increases by 28 per <b>cent</b> <b>and</b> 44 per <b>cent</b> respectively. TN by 34 per <b>cent</b> <b>and</b> 41 per <b>cent</b> respectively, TP 16 per <b>cent</b> <b>and</b> 28 per <b>cent</b> respectively, <b>and</b> PO 4 increases another 2. 4 per cent in 2012 but decline by 42 per cent in 2013.

5|$|Few nickels had {{circulated}} {{in the western}} states before the 1880s (people there preferred silver and gold coins); interest in the new Liberty Head design had led to increasing use of nickels there. Good economic conditions and high demand for nickels for use in coin-operated devices caused the piece to circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint's appropriation to purchase base metals for striking into nickels and cents. At the time, statutory restrictions permitted production of <b>cents</b> <b>and</b> nickels only at Philadelphia; Roberts' request that Congress allow striking at the other mints was granted in 1906.

5|$|In total, 757,813,744 dollars dated 1979 {{were struck}} for {{circulation}} at the Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco Mints.

Due to its persistent unpopularity, production of Anthony dollars for circulation was suspended, and 9,742,000 1981 dollars were struck across all three Mints exclusively for sale to collectors; this mintage {{marked the end of}} production. At the close of production, the Treasury encountered a dilemma: the Mint struck a large number of dollars in anticipation of great public demand, resulting in a surplus of 520,000,000 coins in 1981. Melting the coins was impractical; the cost of manufacture was approximately 2 <b>cents,</b> <b>and</b> the 98 cents earned from seignorage was applied to the national debt. Had the coins been melted, their seignorage would {{have been added to the}} debt. Accordingly, the coins were placed in government storage, to be dispensed as needed.|$|E
5|$|Numismatist Bruce C. Goldstein {{indicated}} that several factors combined {{to keep the}} nickel three-cent piece in decline {{after the passage of}} the 1873 act. Less and less fractional currency was being redeemed, as almost a decade had passed since the issuance of three-cent notes. Rich silver strikes in the West lowered the price of that metal to the point where old silver coins emerged from hoarding and circulated again. These factors, combined with ample stocks of <b>cents</b> <b>and</b> nickels, made the three-cent nickel, a non-silver coin of odd denomination, less desirable. By 1876, the mintage for circulation had declined to 162,000. None were struck for circulation in 1877 and 1878, though some proof coins were minted for sale to the public.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War caused most American coins {{to vanish}} from circulation, with the gap filled by such means as {{merchant}} tokens, encased postage stamps, and United States fractional currency, issued in denomination {{as low as}} three cents. Although specie (gold or silver coins) was hoarded or exported, the copper-nickel cent, then the only base metal denomination being struck, also vanished. In 1864, Congress began the process of restoring coins to circulation by abolishing the three-cent note and authorizing bronze <b>cents</b> <b>and</b> two-cent pieces, with low intrinsic values, to be struck. These new coins initially proved popular, though the two-cent piece soon faded from circulation. On March 3, 1865, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Mint to strike three-cent pieces of 75%copper and 25%nickel.|$|E

5|$|By 1850, it was {{no longer}} {{profitable}} for the Mint to strike <b>cents,</b> <b>and</b> on May 14, New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson introduced legislation for a cent made out of billon, copper {{with a small amount of}} silver. At the time, it was widely felt that coins should contain a large proportion of their face value in metal. The coin would be annular; that is, it would have a hole in the middle. The Mint struck experimental pieces, and found that it was difficult to eject such pieces from the presses where they were struck, and that it was expensive to recover the silver from the alloy. Provisions for a smaller cent were dropped from the legislation that gave congressional approval for the three-cent piece in 1851. Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggested that one factor in rejecting the holed coins was that they reminded many of Chinese cash coins with their minimal purchasing value. A drop in copper prices in 1851 and early 1852 made the matter of a smaller cent less urgent at the Department of the Treasury, which supervised Mint activities.|$|E
5|$|Finance chair Walter M. Gibson, {{supported}} by Minister of the Interior Samuel G. Wilder, pushed a new currency law through the 1880 legislature. It allowed the kingdom to purchase {{gold and silver}} bullion to be struck into new Hawaiian coins. Having the kingdom issue its own coins was one {{means by which the}} government hoped to improve Native Hawaiian morale, as their numbers and their influence had both been declining over the previous few decades. The king became more interested in coinage bearing his likeness during his world tour of 1881. During this journey, he was contacted by the owner of a New Caledonia nickel mining company hoping to use the metal in coinage, and sample five-cent pieces were sent to the king after his return to Honolulu. They found little favor, possibly because Hawaii's motto was misspelled. No action was taken until 1882, when the king appointed Gibson to lead the government. He moved forward with the coin idea; the currency was to have the king's image on the obverse side, and Hawaii's coat of arms and motto Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono (The Life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness) on the reverse. The 1880 law specified that the silver coins were to be in denominations of one dollar, fifty cents, twenty-five <b>cents,</b> <b>and</b> twelve and one-half cents. Twelve and one-half cents, or one bit (one Spanish colonial real) was sometimes the day's pay for a laborer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nearly}} three decades since passage of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the annual demand for silver bullion rose {{steadily}} from roughly 11 million ounces (1933) to 110 million ounces (1962). The Acts of 1939 and 1946 established floor prices for silver of 71 <b>cents</b> <b>and</b> 90.5 cents (respectively) per ounce. Predicated by an anticipated shortage of silver bullion, Public Law 88-36 (PL88-36) was enacted on 4 June 1963 which repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, and the Acts of 6 July 1939 and 31 July 1946, while providing specific instruction regarding the disposition of silver held as reserves against issued certificates and the price at which silver may be sold. It also amended the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the issue of lower denomination notes (i.e., $1 and $2), allowing for the gradual retirement (or swapping out process) of $1 silver certificates and releasing silver bullion from reserve. In repealing the earlier laws, PL88-36 also repealed {{the authority of the}} Secretary of the Treasury to control the issue of silver certificates. By issuing Executive Order 11110, President John F. Kennedy was able to continue the Secretary’s authority. While retaining their status as legal tender, the silver certificate had effectively been retired from use.|$|E
