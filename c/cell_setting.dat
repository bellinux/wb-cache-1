40|$|Abstract: Colorectal {{cancer is}} {{initiated}} in colonic crypts {{as a consequence}} of alterations leading to the disruption of the normal colonic cellular process. We propose a new model, which couples a convection-diffusion type equation with a level set equation, for tracking the time evolution of an epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>set,</b> inside a colonic crypt, until it reaches the top of the crypt. The convection-diffusion equation describes the evolution of the density of the cells in the epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>set.</b> The parameters of this equation regulate the geometric and temporal cellular mechanism, and different parameter choices lead to distinct cell behavior. The level set equation tracks the location and shape of the epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>set,</b> inside the crypt, as well as its interface, separating the <b>cell</b> <b>set</b> from the others cells, which reside within the crypt.

Formulations of diffusion combined with mass-averaged Darcy flow are considered for three component gases. Fick formulations can be considered as approximations of Maxwell-Stefan in a certain sense.

We observe that the predictions of the formulations are very similar, despite their seemingly different structure. Analytic insight is given to the result. In addition, it is seen that for both formulations, diffusion laws are small perturbations from bulk flow.

In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel CAC {{algorithm}} {{that takes into}} account the mobility of users inside the cell with a focus on the downlink of third generation mobile systems. We first study the system capacity in a multiple <b>cell</b> <b>setting</b> and obtain effective bandwidth expressions for different calls as a function of both their positions in the cell as well as their classes of traffic (voice versus data). We then use this formulation to derive a mobility-based admission control algorithm which we analyze by Markov chains. We hence obtain several performance measures, namely the blocking probability, the dropping probability, both intra and inter-cell, as well as the overall cell throughput. We eventually investigate the performance of our CAC and show how to extend the Erlang capacity bounds, i. e., the set of arrival rates such that the corresponding blocking/dropping probabilities are kept below predetermined thresholds. ...|$|E

The stochastic nature of packet loss across receivers and channel interference constraints between cells complicate this task, however. In this paper, we analyze the problem of minimizing the delay of data dissemination in dense multi-channel wireless cellular networks, using rateless coding transmission. We begin with an extreme value analysis of the delay in a single <b>cell</b> <b>setting,</b> and show that the growth rate of this random variable becomes deterministic as the client audience scales up. Next, we extend the analysis to multi-cell, multi-channel settings and derive tight performance bounds on the delay. Our analysis reveals that the availability of more channels does not always reduce delay proportionally. This sub-linear gain effect is guaranteed to occur if the difference between the chromatic number and the fractional chromatic number of the graph is greater than one. I...|$|E

However, the performance of adaptive precoder selection in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) cellular networks in the presence of interference variation is much less understood. In this paper we develop a simulation model for MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) networks that allows us to study the impact of popular scheduling and power control algorithms on the time variation of the uplink interference power. We find that employing a time persistent proportional fair scheduler (which we term proportional fair in frequency, PFF, scheduler) together with an open loop power control scheme significantly reduces intercell interference variation and thereby it provides higher throughput than traditional schedulers that are primarily optimized for a single <b>cell</b> <b>setting</b> without taking into account the variation of the intercell interference power.

Expression of the nef gene {{has been shown to}} be essential to the maintenance of high levels of virus replication and the development of pathogenesis in the animal model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. In contrast to this in vivo model, the use of standard T cell culture systems to study nef function in vitro has produced a spectrum of contradictory results, and has failed to demonstrate a significant positive influence of nef on viral life cycle. We have developed a cell model to study regulation of HIV- 1 replication that we believe reflects more accurately virus-cell interactions as they occur in vivo. Our experimental system used acute virus infection of purified, quiescent CD 4 lymphocytes and subsequent induction of viral replication through T cell activation. With this cell model, NL 4 - 3 virus clones with open and mutated nef reading frames were compared for replication competence. The clones with nef mutations showed reproducible and significant reductions in both rates of growth and maximal titers achieved. The degree of reduced replication was dependent on initial virus inoculum and the timing of T cell activation. The influence of nef was highly significant for induction of virus replication from a latent state within resting CD 4 cells. Its effect was less apparent for virus infection of fully proliferating CD 4 cells. This study demonstrates that nef confers a positive growth advantage to HIV- 1 that becomes readily discernable in the primary <b>cell</b> <b>setting</b> of virus induction through T cell activation. The experimental cell model, which we describe here, provides not only a means to study nef function in vitro, but also provides important clues to the function of nef in HIV infection in vivo...|$|E

The Cu term, malachite, Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) (2), is monoclinic, P 2 (1) /a. Substitution of Cu 2 + with other bivalent cations such as Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu or Ni is possible and leads to a different structure type, rosasite, P 2 (1) /a or P 2 (1) /b 11 in the same <b>cell</b> <b>setting</b> as malachite. Rosasite structure is topologically similar to malachite, but the symmetry elements are oriented differently with respect to structural units. The stability of the malachite-like structure (MS) compared with the rosasite-like structure (RS) has been suggested {{to be related to}} the Jahn-Teller effect in CuO 6 coordination polyhedra. For this reason the hypothesis of the phase transition of malachite, Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) (2), to a rosasite structure at high pressure, as a result of the reduced Jahn-Teller effect, has been tested and confirmed by powder and single-crystal diffraction structural studies: above 6 GPa the malachite structure is no longer stable and transforms to a RS structure. RS Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) (2) is 3 % more dense than malachite and the bulk modulus is remarkably higher, 80 (2) GPa compared with 48 (4) GPa. The longer apical Cu-O bonds in the distorted Me 1 octahedral site are progressively shortened with increasing pressure, revealing a decrease in the Jahn-Teller effect at high pressure. The transition has a first-order character, is reversible with a significant hysteresis, and there is no evidence of any intermediate phase between the two structures. We then have further evidence that in the Me- 2 (CO 3) (OH) (2) compounds, the two main structural types, MS and RS, are closely related. The former structure is stabilized only when Cu is the prevalent cation in the octahedral sites, and it can transform directly to the RS as a function of thermodynamic changes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Stable {{simultaneous}} {{knock down}} of the HIV- 1 coreceptors CCR 5 and CXCR 4 is a promising strategy to protect cells from both R 5 macrophage tropic and X 4 T cell tropic as well as dual tropic viral infections. The potency of shRNAs in targeted gene silencing qualifies them as powerful tools for long term HIV gene therapy. Our previous work with a bispecific lentiviral vector containing CXCR 4 and CCR 5 shRNAs showed efficacy in down regulating both coreceptors and conferring viral resistance to both X 4 and R 5 -tropic strains of HIV- 1 in cultured cell lines. To extend these results to a stem cell gene therapy setting, here we show transduction of primary CD 34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells to derive normal end stage cells that are resistant to HIV- 1 infection. Results The bispecific XHR lentiviral vector harboring CXCR 4 and CCR 5 shRNA expression cassettes was efficient in transducing CD 34 + cells. The transduced cells gave rise to morphologically normal transgenic macrophages when cultured in cytokine media. There was a marked down regulation of both coreceptors in the stably transduced macrophages which showed resistance to both R 5 and X 4 HIV- 1 strains upon in vitro challenge. Since off target effects by some shRNAs may have adverse effects on transgenic cells, the stably transduced macrophages were further analyzed {{to determine if they}} are phenotypically and functionally normal. FACS evaluation showed normal levels of the characteristic surface markers CD 14, CD 4, MHC class II, and B 7. 1. Phagocytic functions were also normal. The transgenic macrophages demonstrated normal abilities in up-regulating the costimulatory molecule B 7. 1 upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, IL- 1 and TNFα cytokine secretion in response to LPS stimulation was also normal. Thus, the transgenic macrophages appear to be phenotypically and functionally normal. Conclusion These studies have demonstrated {{for the first time that}} a bispecific lentiviral vector could be used to stably deliver shRNAs targeted to both CCR 5 and CXCR 4 coreceptors into CD 34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells and derive transgenic macrophages. Transgenic macrophages with down regulated coreceptors were resistant to both R 5 and X 4 tropic HIV- 1 infections. The differentiated cells were also phenotypically and functionally normal indicating no adverse effects of shRNAs on lineage specific differentiation of stem cells. It is now possible to construct gene therapeutic lentiviral vectors incorporating multiple shRNAs targeted to cellular molecules that aid in HIV- 1 infection. Use of these vectors in a stem <b>cell</b> <b>setting</b> shows great promise for sustained HIV/AIDS gene therapy. </p...|$|E
