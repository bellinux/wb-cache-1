50|$|When {{the driver}} stops the vehicle on an incline where {{the nose of}} the car is {{sufficiently}} higher than the rear of the car, the system is engaged when the driver's foot is depressing the brake pedal, and then the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is fully depressed. Once set, the driver must keep the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> fully depressed but may remove the foot from the brake pedal. To disengage the system and move the car forward, the driver selects first gear, gently depresses the fuel pedal, and slowly releases the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> which at a point in its travel releases the braking system, allowing the car to proceed.|$|R

50|$|A common {{example of}} riding the clutch {{is to keep}} slight continual {{pressure}} on the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> {{instead of on the}} floorboard or dead pedal. Although this slight pressure is not enough to allow the clutch disc itself to slip, it is enough to keep the release bearing against the release springs. This causes the bearing to remain spinning, which leads to premature bearing failure.|$|R
50|$|In {{a manual}} transmission, the {{flywheel}} {{is attached to}} the engine's crankshaft and spins along with it. The clutch disk is in between the pressure plate and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the pressure plate. When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> up), the flywheel spins the clutch plate and hence the transmission. As the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed, the throw out bearing is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to the clutch disk. This makes the clutch plate stop receiving power from the engine, so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the clutch disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.|$|R

5000|$|Second: The <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is {{unlatched}} and {{the clutch}} engaged. The brake pedal is pushed forward {{as far as}} possible setting brakes on the rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|Other {{engineering}} {{improvements that}} modernized the 1961 Larks included {{the introduction of}} cowl ventilation, suspended brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals</b> (accompanied by a firewall-mounted brake master cylinder) and revamped steering systems.|$|R
50|$|A {{gear stick}} (rarely spelled gearstick), gear lever (both UK English), {{gearshift}} or shifter (US English) is a metal lever {{attached to the}} shift assembly in a manual transmission-equipped automobile and is used to change gears. In an automatic transmission-equipped vehicle, a similar device {{is known as a}} gear selector. A gear stick will normally be used to change gear whilst depressing the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> with the left foot to disengage the engine from the drivetrain and wheels. Automatic transmission vehicles, semi-automatic transmissions, and those with continuously variable transmission gearboxes do not require a <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|R
30|$|Usage {{of manual}} gearbox: Clutch wear {{is reduced by}} {{choosing}} a low starting gear and a correct handling of the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal.</b> When cruising, the vehicle should be operated at a high gear.|$|R
5000|$|Double-clutching {{allows the}} driver to control the engine and {{transmission}} revolutions to synchronize, so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is released and the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while transmission is in neutral) {{just the right amount}} in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. [...] "Skip changing" [...] is also widely used; in principle operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.|$|R
50|$|Line locks {{are often}} used for burnouts by fully locking the front wheels and then {{engaging}} the gas pedal and disengaging the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal,</b> this makes the rear tires spin but keeps the car stationary.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{options are}} either a Lamborghini-sourced six-speed manual gearbox with metal gate for the shift lever, or an Audi-developed R Tronic gearbox—which is a semi-automatic, without a traditional <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> with automatic gears shifting mode.|$|R
50|$|The 'Sensonic' clutch variant, (available on Turbo models only) {{provided}} a manual gear lever as {{in a standard}} manual transmission car, but omitted the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> in favor of electronics which could control the clutch faster than an average driver.|$|R
5000|$|The Freelander TD4_e {{features}} stop-start {{technology to}} improve fuel economy and reduce carbon emissions. The system cuts out the engine when {{the vehicle is}} stationary, neutral is selected and the clutch engaged; the engine restarts when the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed.|$|R
5000|$|When the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> {{is fully}} released, the clutch is fully engaged {{and all of}} the engine's torque is transferred. In this coupled state, the clutch does not slip, but rather acts as rigid {{coupling}} to transmit power to the gearbox.|$|R
2500|$|For the 1940 model, Oldsmobile was {{the first}} auto {{manufacturer}} to offer a fully automatic transmission, called the [...] "Hydramatic", which features four forward speeds. It has a gas pedal and a brake—no <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal.</b> The gear selector is on the steering column.|$|R
50|$|It also {{features}} a realistic manual transmission mode (including a <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> {{and the possibility of}} stalling the car should one mis-shift) and force feedback steering wheel, in which the driver would have to properly operate the car as they would in real life.|$|R
50|$|Operators of 18-wheelers, farm equipment, {{tractors}} and other heavy equipment learn to float the transmission {{in and out}} of gear, beginning with dis-engaging the clutch by pressing the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> only part way, enough to pull the transmission out of gear, re-engaging the clutch in neutral (between gears by letting the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> all the way back out) to let the engine revolutions decelerate enough for the idle sprockets to shift, and free gear shafts to slow their revolutions per minute (RPM), then dis-engage the clutch again (by pressing the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> only part way to the floor) a second time, and float the higher gear into engaging the drive coupling and flywheel and engaging the clutch plates. Professional operators of heavy equipment take extensive safety training before ever learning how to double-clutch. Once an operator is familiar with range, range selector, rpm, velocity, and torque of heavy equipment like an 18-wheeler, he can begin to anticipate when to shift gears. Operators become familiar with ranges of gears. They also learn not to leave their foot on the clutch while driving, because these types of transmissions use the clutch for some very different purposes. The depth the clutch is depressed to the floor will determine what the clutch will be doing as a synchronizing function.|$|R
50|$|A {{compressed}} air brake system {{is divided into}} a supply system and a control system. The supply system compresses, stores and supplies high-pressure air to the control system {{as well as to}} additional air operated auxiliary truck systems (gearbox shift control, <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> air assistance servo, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} very light weight rattle free fabric {{bodywork}} built by Rover under licence from Weymann. For the driver's comfort the <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> is adjustable for travel {{and the front}} seat can be adjusted over a range of six inches using wing nuts in the cushion.|$|R
50|$|The name Self-Changing Gears is {{sometimes}} confusing: the gearboxes {{are not fully}} automatic, selection of gear ratio remains a manual choice, but the gear-changing and any clutch control needed is automated. The gearboxes were {{used in conjunction with}} a fluid coupling so no <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> was needed.|$|R
