40|$|The {{problems}} associated with grain elevation and conveying under forced flow in vertical pipes are discussed. Based on experimental results, a theory is presented to describe forced flow {{with varying degrees of}} air permeation up to and just beyond the fluidization point. The theory takes into account the boundary and internal frictional properties, the degree of consolidation of the bulk granular material, and the stress fields that occur during forced flow. The force to elevate grain in a vertical tube is shown to be composed of two components, one to overcome Coulomb friction and initiate motion, and the other a time-dependent component that depends on the stiffness and damping characteristics of the granular material. The Coulomb friction component increases approximately exponentially with column height due to the positive feedback effect of the shear stresses at the pipe wall opposing the motion. Air permeation is shown to significantly reduce this component of the <b>conveying</b> <b>force</b> by reducing both the internal friction and the apparent bulk specific weight, the latter being the actual bulk specific weight less the air pressure gradient. Air permeation has a very significant effect on reducing both the bulk stiffness and, particularly, the damping characteristics, thereby reducing the time-dependent component of the <b>conveying</b> <b>force...</b>|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe hair-cell tip link, a fine {{filament}} directly <b>conveying</b> <b>force</b> to mechanosensitive transduction channels, is composed of two proteins, protocadherin- 15 and cadherin- 23, whose mutation causes deafness. However, their molecular structure, elasticity, and deafness-related structural defects are unknown. We present crystal {{structures of the}} first and second extracellular cadherin repeats of cadherin- 23. Overall, structures show typical cadherin folds, but reveal an elongated N terminus that precludes classical cadherin interactions and contributes to an N-terminal Ca 2 +-binding site. The deafness mutation D 101 G, in the linker region between the repeats, causes a slight bend between repeats and decreases Ca 2 + affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that cadherin- 23 repeats are stiff and that either removing Ca 2 + or mutating Ca 2 +-binding residues reduces rigidity and unfolding strength. The structures define an uncharacterized cadherin family and, with simulations, suggest mechanisms underlying inherited deafness and how cadherin- 23 may bind with itself and with protocadherin- 15 to form the tip link...|$|E

Recently, Kane and Lubensky showed that lattices {{at the point}} of marginal mechanical stability (Maxwell lattices) possess a topological invariant that describes the distribution of floppy, zero-energy edge modes.

This provides both a bulk metric for mechanical polarization and a design principle to convey stresses and strains towards or away from parts of the structure. We also characterize the effects of removing bonds on the material's structure and floppy modes, establishing a relationship between edge modes and bulk response...|$|R
40|$|SummaryHow {{metazoan}} mechanotransduction channels sense mechanical stimuli is {{not well}} understood. The NOMPC channel in the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, a mechanotransduction channel for Drosophila touch sensation and hearing, contains 29 Ankyrin repeats (ARs) that associate with microtubules. These ARs have been postulated to act as a tether that <b>conveys</b> <b>force</b> to the channel. Here, we report that these N-terminal ARs form a cytoplasmic domain essential for NOMPC mechanogating in vitro, mechanosensitivity of touch receptor neurons in vivo, and touch-induced behaviors of Drosophila larvae. Duplicating the ARs elongates the filaments that tether NOMPC to microtubules in mechanosensory neurons. Moreover, microtubule association is required for NOMPC mechanogating. Importantly, transferring the NOMPC ARs to mechanoinsensitive voltage-gated potassium channels confers mechanosensitivity to the chimeric channels. These experiments strongly support a tether mechanism of mechanogating for the NOMPC channel, providing insights into the basis of mechanosensitivity of mechanotransduction channels...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of facial}} vibrissae (whiskers) in the {{behavior}} of terrestrial mammals is principally as a supplement or substitute for short-distance vision. Each whisker in the array functions as a mechanical transducer, <b>conveying</b> <b>forces</b> applied along the shaft to mechanoreceptors in the follicle at the whisker base. Subsequent processing of mechanoreceptor output in the trigeminal nucleus and somatosensory cortex allows high accuracy discriminations of object distance, direction, and surface texture. The whiskers of terrestrial mammals are tapered and approximately circular in cross section. We characterize the taper of whiskers in nine mammal species, measure the mechanical deflection of isolated felid whiskers, and discuss the mechanics of a single whisker under static and oscillatory deflections. We argue that a tapered whisker provides some advantages for tactile perception (as compared to a hypothetical untapered whisker), and that this may explain why the taper has been preserved during the evolution of terrestrial mammals...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{medicine}} this century is darkened by {{the downfall of}} the German medical profession, exposed during the doctors' trial at Nuremberg in 1946. Relying largely on documents published during 1933 in German medical journals, this paper examines two widely accepted notions of those events, metaphorically termed "slippery slope" and "sudden subversion. " The first connotes a gradual slide over infinitesimal steps until, suddenly, all footing is lost; the second <b>conveys</b> <b>forced</b> take over of the profession's leadership and values. Both concepts imply that the medical profession itself became the victim of circumstances. The slippery slope concept is a prominent figure of argument in the current debate on bioethics. The evidence presented here, however, strongly suggests that the German medical community set its own course in 1933. In some respects this course even outpaced the new government, which had to rein in the profession's eager pursuit of enforced eugenic sterilizations. In 1933 the convergence of political, scientific, and economic forces dramatically changed the relationship between the medical community and the government. That same convergence is occurring again and must be approached with great caution if medicine is to remain focused on the preservation of physical and medical integrity...|$|R

40|$|Sound {{detection}} by {{inner ear}} hair cells requires tip links that interconnect mechanosensory stereocilia and <b>convey</b> <b>force</b> to yet unidentified transduction channels. Current models postulate a static {{composition of the}} tip link, with protocadherin 15 (PCDH 15) at the lower and cadherin 23 (CDH 23) at {{the upper end of}} the link. In terminally differentiated mammalian auditory hair cells, tip links are subjected to sound-induced forces throughout an organism’s life. Although hair cells can regenerate disrupted tip links and restore hearing, the molecular details of this process are unknown. We developed a novel implementation of backscatter electron scanning microscopy to visualize simultaneously immuno-gold particles and stereocilia links, both of only a few nanometers in diameter. We show that functional, mechanotransduction-mediating tip links have at least two molecular compositions, containing either PCDH 15 /CDH 23 or PCDH 15 /PCDH 15. During regeneration, shorter tip links containing nearly equal amounts of PCDH 15 at both ends appear first. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrate that these transient PCDH 15 /PCDH 15 links mediate mechanotransduction currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca 2 +-dependent decay (adaptation). The mature PCDH 15 /CDH 23 tip link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation. Thus, our findings provide a molecular mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells and could help identify elusive components o...|$|R

Despite intensive studies in various model systems, the molecular pathway by which forces are transmitted to the transduction channels remains elusive. In fly campaniform mechanoreceptors, the mechanotransduction channels are gated by compressive <b>forces</b> <b>conveyed</b> via two rows of microtubules that are hypothesized to be mechanically reinforced by an intervening electron-dense material (EDM). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by studying a mutant fly in which the EDM was nearly absent, whereas the other ultrastructural elements in the mechanosensitive organelle were still present at 50 % (or greater) of normal levels. We found that the mechanosensory response in this mutant was reduced by 90 % and the sensitivity by at least 80 %. To test whether loss of the EDM could lead to such a reduction in response, we performed a mechanical analysis and estimated {{that the loss of}} the EDM is expected to greatly decrease the overall rigidity, leading to a marked reduction in the gating <b>force</b> <b>conveyed</b> to the channel. We argue that this reduction in force, rather than the {{reduction in the number of}} transduction channels, is primarily responsible for the nearly complete loss of mechanosensory response observed in the mutant fly.

Practically, however, the two modes of action are always in some sort united. Again, the weight to be borne may either act generally on the whole wall surface, or with excessive energy on particular points: when it acts on the whole wall surface, the whole wall is generally supported; and the arrangement becomes a continuous rampart, as a dyke, or bank of reservoir.|$|R
