25|$|Shibas tend {{to exhibit}} an {{independent}} nature and sometimes show dog aggression. This is more prevalent between female Shibas and {{is influenced by}} the breed's strong prey drive. The Shiba Inu is best in a home without other small dogs or young children, but consistent obedience training and early socialization <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> the difference. The breed also interacts fairly well with cats.|$|E
25|$|Death of a {{child can}} {{take the form of}} a loss in infancy such as {{miscarriage}} or stillbirth or neonatal death, SIDS, or the death of an older child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss. This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it. Intervention and comforting support <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> the difference to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.|$|E

In his 2015 book Unoffendable: How Just One Change <b>Can</b> <b>Make</b> <b>All</b> of Life Better, Christian radio personality Brant Hansen calls What's So Amazing About Grace? life-changing and writes that Yancey's discussion of [...] "Babette's Feast" [...] inspired him to see the film.

500|$|Before {{production}} began, however, Spielberg grew {{reluctant to}} continue with Jaws, in fear of becoming typecast as the [...] "truck and shark director". He wanted to move over to 20th Century Fox's Lucky Lady instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure. Brown helped convince Spielberg {{to stick with the}} project, saying that [...] "after , you <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> the films you want". The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5million and a shooting schedule of 55days. Principal photography was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios' contract with the Screen Actors Guild was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike.|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> {{the money from the}} Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1923, when Adams was 76, the {{following}} newspaper story appeared in The Salt Lake Tribune, telling of his whereabouts:Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, {{but he turned}} up in New York {{the other day and}} is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, {{in the language of the}} billiard realm, [...] "make 'em talk all languages." [...] That man is Frank B. Adams, known the world over as [...] "Yank" [...] Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over the [...] world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives at 635 West 136th street In New York. When I told Tom Foley, the daddy of all the roommkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business he laughed and said: [...] "I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard players. They never die." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cutler's {{first win}} came {{in his third}} start on December 17, which was a 37–20 road victory over the Arizona Cardinals. [...] He {{finished}} the game 21-of-31 with 261 yards, two touchdowns, an interception and a QB rating of 101.7, the highest for a Broncos rookie since John Elway in 1983. One touchdown traveled 65 yards in the air, and was recorded as a 54-yard touchdown to Javon Walker on the Broncos' third play of the game. Shanahan said to the media, [...] "You saw {{what he could do}} today. It doesn't take a genius out there to figure out this guy is very composed, <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> the throws and plays with a lot of confidence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Half-Life 2 {{begins as}} the G-Man speaks to Gordon in a dreamlike scene, after keeping him [...] "in stasis far from Earth, thought, and time itself" [...] {{for nearly two}} decades, during {{which he did not}} {{physically}} age. He comments that [...] "the right man in the wrong place <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> the difference in the world." [...] Gordon is then [...] "point inserted" [...] into a train bound for City 17, to the (mild) surprise of the other passengers. Freeman quickly learns that Earth has been conquered and occupied by the trans-dimensional Combine empire, with a military force powerful enough to have subdued the entirety of Earth's nations within a period of 7 hours. He soon meets up with Barney Calhoun and Alyx Vance, and joins the resistance against the Combine.|$|E

2500|$|The {{function}} of genes {{is to provide}} the information needed to make molecules called proteins in cells. Cells are the smallest independent parts of organisms: the human body contains about 100 trillion cells, while very small organisms like bacteria are just one single cell. A cell is like a miniature and very complex factory that <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> the parts needed to produce a copy of itself, which happens when cells divide. There is a simple division of labor in cells—genes give instructions and proteins carry out these instructions, tasks [...] like building a new copy of a cell, or repairing damage. Each type of protein is a specialist that only does one job, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein to do this job. Similarly, if a cell needs to do something faster or slower than before, it makes more or less of the protein responsible. Genes tell cells what to do by telling them which proteins to make and in what amounts.|$|E
