The objective was to understand whether the <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> preferences of individuals are affected by their individual personality types or not and whether gender plays any role in selection of <b>colour</b> <b>shades</b> of individuals. The study sample consisted of a total of 80 subjects, randomly selected from within the age group of 18 - 25. An attempt was made to maintain a balance between two genders and across the ages. The research instruments used were Eysenck’s Personality Test (to measure the personality types) and a separate Colour Bar- Colour Preference Test was designed to serve the purpose of this study. The subjects were made to fill both the questionnaires and then the items were scored and results were analyzed. Positive scoring was done for Eysenck’s personality questionnaire and negative scoring was used to score the Colour Bar-Colour Preference Test. The data collected was divided into: Introverts (female, male) and Extroverts (female, male). From the data collected the mean, standard deviation and correlation between extraversion scores and the most preferred colour scores, for all the four groups.

30|$|The type of {{geologic}} formation is paramount in determining aquifer performance. Well yield {{is not a}} very reliable aquifer performance indicator, because it depends largely on the efficiency of the pump installed. Other aquifer parameters such as transmissivity, specific capacity, and storativity must be employed in aquifer performance assessment. Due to scale and <b>colour</b> <b>shading,</b> the categorized groundwater zones appear as if basement aquifers are not discontinuous, whereas, in reality, they are discontinuous. Therefore, {{it should be noted that}} the areas shaded as very good, good, moderate, and fair and poor have intervening regions that are not in the designated class, but cannot be discerned by the human eye. Geographic information system modeling of geologic structural data at regional extent is rapid and cost-effective method. It provides a means of effective planning and quick decision making on the exploration, exploitation, and management of groundwater in a particular geologic terrain.|$|E

The quality of interest is the <b>colour</b> <b>shade,</b> {{one of the key}} feature and exterior appearance for the vehicles. With low percentage of first time quality, the manufacturer has spent a lot of cost for repairing work as well as the longer production time. To permanently dissolve such problem, the precisely spraying condition should be optimised. Therefore, this work applied the multiple regression and response surface methods or RSM to investigate significant factors and to determine the optimum factor level in order {{to improve the quality of}} paint shop. Firstly, 2 k full factorial was employed to study the effect of five factors including the paint flow rate at robot setting, the paint levelling agent, the paint pigment, the additive slow solvent, and non volatile solid at spraying of atomising spraying machine. The response value of <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> at 15 and 45 degree are measured using spectrophotometer. Then the regression models of <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> at both degrees were developed from the significant factors affecting each response. Consequently, both regression models were placed into the form of linear programming to maximise the <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> subjected to 3 main factors including the pigment, the additive solvent and the paint flow rate. This led to the determination of new levels of decision variables and brought 70 % reduction on paint repairs cost and improve first time quality from 70 % to 88 % for the production of interes...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} biological systems {{it is important to}} gain pertinent information on the spatial localisation of chemicals within cells. With the relatively recent advent of high-resolution chemical imaging this is being realised and one rapidly developing area of research is the Raman mapping of single cells, an approach whose success has vast potential for numerous areas of biomedical research. However, there is a danger of undermining the potential routine use of Raman mapping {{due to a lack of}} consistency and transparency in the way false-shaded Raman images are constructed. In this study we demonstrate, through the use of simulated data and real Raman maps of single human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells, how changes in the application of <b>colour</b> <b>shading</b> can dramatically alter the final Raman images. In order to avoid ambiguity and potential subjectivity in image interpretation we suggest that data distribution plots are used to aid shading approaches and that extreme care is taken to use the most appropriate false-shading for the biomedical question under investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of three screenhouse nets differing in <b>colour,</b> <b>shading</b> intensity (SI) and porosity on photosynthesis, transpiration rate and light acclimation of sweet pepper plants was investigated at Velestino (central Greece) from May to October 2011. The screenhouse nets {{consisted of two}} insect-proof white nets (W 13 and W 34, SI= 13 and 34 %, respectively), and a green shading net (G 36, SI= 36 %). Climate variables were recorded continuously in the different treatments. Leaf photosynthesis and transpiration rate were measured fortnightly over different canopy layers. The results indicated that drastic changes in light regime induced by shading nets had only a slight effect on leaf gas exchange and water use efficiency. Ontogenic effects (leaf ageing) {{appeared to be the}} main factor responsible for the observed seasonal pattern of leaf photosynthetic attributes. Overall, sweet pepper plants grown under screenhouse treatments appeared to display a physiological response and light-acclimation across a large interval of SI that was close to that observed for the field grown crop, irrespective of the colour and porosity of the nets. © ISHS 2012...|$|E

Here, convective wind flows over leads (Figure 2) are investigated through numerical large-eddy simulations (LES, Figure 3), scaling theoretical analyses (Figure 4) –to estimate basic parameters of turbulence, namely, convective wind speed, depths-scales of convective zones, horizontal extension of circulations and turbulent fluxes at the air-water interface. The model allowed deriving a heat/mass transfer law for a heat island, which expresses analytically the turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapour from the water surface to the atmosphere through external parameters: the temperature difference between the open water and the ambient air over surrounding ice,and the static stability in the basic-state atmospheric environment. An important role of the lead width is disclosed (Figure 1 insertion) : with increasing widths, {{the efficiency of the}} heat/mass transfer first increases and, after achieving a maximum, decreases (Figure 3).

40|$|Geophysical {{techniques}} are now routinely applied to groundwater and environmental studies and geologists {{are forced to}} deal with the ever increasing volumes of numbers that are generated. Geophysical data can and should be processed to extract the maximum amount of useful information and the results presented to effectively convey the meaning of the data to others, who are often less specialized. With common low-cost computers we are able to process and present geophysical data in many more useful, creative and revealing ways than the traditional contour map. Geophysical surveys are sensitive to instrument accuracy, survey methodology, cultural noise, geologic noise (the geology that we are NOT interested in) and the geologic model that we are studying. The intelligent application of filters can be used to both remove the effects of noise and to enhance those components of the data that are of interest. It is important to understand the relationship of filters, gridding methods, sample density and noise characteristics in order to use processed data effectively. This paper will use a number of practical examples to illustrate the use of filters in processing, as well as the use of <b>colour,</b> <b>shading</b> and perspective to help visualize and enhance the results of geophysical studies.
