5|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers (including {{those in}} pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> work for money.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious was {{released}} on home video on May 1, 2012. On June 26, the film made its British premiere, following which an interactive panel was held in which the audience was encouraged to fight human trafficking by donating funds, raising awareness, and praying. In September, the film was screened at The Rome International Film Festival in Rome, Georgia, the Midwest Christian-Inspirational Indie Film Festival in Chicago, Illinois, and the Atlanta International Documentary Film Festival in Atlanta, Georgia. Nefarious was screened at Oaxaca FilmFest two months later. The Rose Marine Theater in Fort Worth, Texas hosted a screening in celebration of Human Rights Day in December. Other screenings {{have taken place in}} South Korea, Hong Kong, Bermuda, and Canada. The Hong Kong premiere was attended by such people as Clement Cheng, Lori Chow, Cathy Leung, Pamela Peck, Nancy Sit, and Grace Wong, and the subsequent three weeks of screenings were all sold out. In May 2013, Katarina MacLeod, a former sex slave, spoke at a screening in Peterborough, Ontario hosted by Canadian Baptist Women of Ontario and Quebec. Laila Mickelwait, Exodus Cry's Director of Awareness and Prevention, screened the film in several countries in an attempt to persuade governments to make laws similar to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which criminalizes the purchasing rather than the selling of sex. Because Sweden now has the lowest human trafficking rate in the European Union, Mickelwait argued that such laws decrease the demand for <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> and effectively combat related organized crime. At some screenings, Exodus Cry solicited funds for the halfway houses it runs in Moldova called LightHouses, where victims of sex trafficking are given help.|$|E

50|$|Virtual sex, that is, {{sexual acts}} {{conveyed}} by messages rather than physically, {{is also the}} subject of commercial transactions. <b>Commercial</b> phone <b>sex</b> services have been available for decades. The advent of the Internet has made other forms of virtual sex available for money, including computer-mediated cybersex, in which sexual services are provided in text form by way of chat rooms or instant messaging, or audiovisually through a webcam (see camgirl).|$|R
25|$|In 1996–97, {{following}} {{the success of}} prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan. These projects showed the feasibility of such programmes, which included condom use to control the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers, and have been officially promoted since 1998. Between 1999 and 2001, the World AIDS Foundation supported a five-site trial of a behavioral intervention in <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers who worked in entertainment establishments. The intervention included condom promotion, establishment of clinics for sexually transmitted diseases to provide check-ups, and outreach for health education and counseling. HIV-related knowledge improved substantially, {{and the rate of}} bacterial sexually transmitted diseases fell. The rate of condom use at last intercourse increased from around 55% to 68%, and fewer <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers agreed to sex without a condom when requested by a client who offered more money. The prevalence of gonorrhea fell from about 26% at baseline to 4% after intervention, and the prevalence of chlamydia fell from about 41% to 26%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>sex</b> work {{is illegal}} in China; hence, brothels are illegal and <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers operate out of places of {{entertainment}} (e.g., karaoke bars), hotels, hair-dressing salons, {{or on the}} street. The traditional strategy for controlling HIV transmission through <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers has been the development of stricter laws to prevent risky behaviors, accompanied by raids on suspected sex establishments by public security officials. Those apprehended are subject to compulsory education on law and morality, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and forced participation in productive labor. Under the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law, those knowingly infected with HIV who continue to practice prostitution are subject to more severe penalties and criminal liability for creating a risk of spreading a quarantinable disease. Detention ranges from 6 months to 2 years. Until recently, health education in this system was uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Since poverty {{has become}} very {{prevalent}} in the Pygmy communities, sexual exploitation of indigenous women has become a common practice. <b>Commercial</b> <b>sex</b> has been bolstered by logging, which often places large groups of male laborers in camps which are set up {{in close contact with}} the Pygmy communities.|$|E

5|$|The {{packaging}} for {{the book}} is made of aluminium, which was Madonna's idea, and is spiral bound and enclosed in a Mylar sheet. Due to the scandalous nature of the photographs and the media mayhem surrounding it from the initial preview of the book, Madonna {{did not have to}} promote Sex, except for a pre-release party and some television specials. Her publishers were extremely apprehensive about the release as well as its <b>commercial</b> potential. <b>Sex</b> was released alongside her fifth studio album Erotica, which went on sale a day earlier.|$|R
5000|$|Frank and {{his brother}} Tom founded Christian Television of Jacksonville. The {{non-profit}} purchased Channel 47 before it was launched in August 1980 and requested the call letters, WXAO. [...] "XAO" [...] stood for [...] "Christ, the alpha and the omega" [...] in Greek. Their intent was to be an alternative to <b>commercial</b> television's <b>sex</b> and violence by broadcasting programs from The PTL Club, Christian Television Network, and Trinity Broadcast Network. The station was Jacksonville's first 24-hour station, but never generated a large viewership and was sold in 1990 for approximately $3 million.|$|R

25|$|Persian poets, such as Sa'di (d. 1291), Hafiz (d. 1389), and Jami (d. 1492), wrote poems {{replete with}} homoerotic allusions. The two most {{commonly}} documented forms were <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> with transgender young women or males enacting transgender roles {{exemplified by the}} köçeks and the bacchás, and Sufi spiritual practices in which the practitioner admired {{the form of a}} beautiful boy in order to enter ecstatic states and glimpse the beauty of god.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 1.8 {{percent of}} the age 18–49 population of Jamaica was HIV positive in 2011. The rate for {{men who have sex}} with men was 32.8 percent. The highest rates of infection were in the most urbanised parishes and in tourist areas. The HIV epidemic has been closely tied to poverty and developmental and socio-cultural issues, including slow economic growth, high levels of unemployment, early sexual debut, the culture of multiple partnerships, and the informal drug and <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> sectors.|$|E

This study {{rests on a}} data from <b>commercial</b> female <b>sex</b> workers (CFSW) that was collected in Thailand during January and February 2007. Past research in SWB indicates that women who have more formal education, those who feel positively about their income rank and working conditions, and those who feel connected to others in their community report greater well-being compared to others. Moreover, Biswas-Diener and Diener (2006) found that sex workers in Calcutta were generally satisfied with their personal domains. Most Thai sex workers, in our sample, were generally satisfied with their personal domains (relative income, marital status, and working conditions); however, less satisfaction was reported about feeling part of the community...|$|R
25|$|According to a 2011 estimate, 0.2 {{percent of}} persons aged 15–49 were HIV-positive, which along with Cuba and Nicaragua {{was the lowest}} rate in Latin America and the Caribbean.

25|$|The Ministry of Interior is {{currently}} collaborating with IOM {{to produce a}} demand-reduction campaign targeting clients of <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> outlets along the Czech-German border area. A government-fund-ed NGO conducted awareness campaigns among potential trafficking victims at schools and asylum centers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to provide trafficking information to applicants for Czech visas from identified trafficking source countries. The Crime Prevention Department continued awareness programs at schools. In addition to the Czech National Action Plan on trafficking adopted in 2003, the government in July 2004 adopted a plan to combat commercial sexual abuse of children.|$|E
25|$|Although most HIV-infected {{individuals}} in China are drug users, patients infected through sexual transmission are {{the fastest growing}} group, accounting for close to 50% of new infections in 2005. Overall, they represent 43.6% of total HIV/AIDS cases, including <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers or their clients (19.6%), partners of HIV-infected individuals (16.7%), and {{men who have sex}} with men (7.3%). As with drug use, sexuality is not openly discussed in Chinese society and is therefore neither easily targeted by health promotion campaigns, nor has it traditionally been taught in schools. Even among university students, levels of AIDS knowledge and risk perception are alarmingly low. On the other hand, attitudes towards sex are becoming increasingly more liberal and, as a result, premarital and extramarital sex are more commonly practiced. Although they are widely available, condoms are rarely used.|$|E
50|$|Longford was {{a leading}} figure in the Nationwide Festival of Light of 1971, protesting against the <b>commercial</b> {{exploitation}} of <b>sex</b> and violence, and advocating the teaching of Christ {{as the key to}} recovering moral stability in the nation. His anti-pornography campaigning made him the subject of derision and he was labeled by the press as Lord Porn when he and former prison doctor Christine Temple-Saville set out on a wide-ranging tour of sex industry establishments in the early 1970s to compile a self-funded report. The press made much of his visits to strip clubs in Copenhagen.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} John Cleland's pornographic novel, Fanny Hill, conceals {{coercion}} by employing {{the language of}} materialism to suggest that all <b>sex,</b> <b>commercial</b> or not, produces pleasure. While the ostensible benevolence of human instinct allows the novel to sidestep questions of injury and rape, they persist until Fanny's marriage, which delivers her to conjugal felicity. Fanny Hill presents an extreme version of the marriage plot, showing that marriage's claim to retroactively pardon harm allows it to sanction violent means. Cleland's novel implicates Pamela by demonstrating that they share a basic structure: materialist pornography, like the marriage plot, transforms injury into the impossibility thereof, forcefully restricting first-person narrative in the process...|$|R
25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of testing infrastructure has been largely prompted {{by the introduction of}} provider-initiated routine testing campaigns to identify infected individuals and put them in contact with treatment services. Client-initiated testing was failing to identify most infected individuals, so campaigns to screen high-risk groups, including drug users, <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers, prisoners, and former plasma donors, were commissioned to link patients to treatment services. The campaigns have resulted in a substantial {{increase in the number of}} individuals who know their HIV status, with an additional 60,000 people living with HIV/AIDS identified. This increased identification explains, at least in part, the rapid rise in reported HIV cases in the early 21st century. However, even with this effort, only about 22% of the estimated 650,000 HIV-infected individuals living in China at the end of 2005 have been identified. Routine testing in high-risk groups continues.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} against anti-trafficking raids {{are related}} to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005 (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of <b>commercial</b> <b>sex,</b> therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{has urged}} India to decriminalise {{homosexuality}} by {{saying it would}} help the fight against HIV/AIDS by allowing intervention programmes, much like the successful ones in China and Brazil. Jeffrey O'Malley, director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on HIV/AIDS, has stated countries which protect {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) have double the rate of coverage of HIV prevention services as much as 60%. According to him, inappropriate criminalisation hinders universal access to essential HIV, health and social services. Later talking to The Hindu in November 2008, he added concerns that the then in power United Progressive Alliance government was in a difficult position in regards to amending Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code because of the then upcoming elections, as such changes could be misrepresented. He further emphasised the need to change the laws, sensitise the police and judiciary. According to him, after removal of discriminatory laws, marginalised groups would have better access to treatment and prevention facilities like condoms. He warned of the urgency and stated that India had succeeded in checking the spread of AIDS through <b>commercial</b> <b>sex</b> workers but transmission through gay sex, and injectable-drug users was still an area of concern in the country.|$|E

500|$|Kant viewed {{humans as}} being {{subject to the}} animalistic desires of self-{{preservation}}, species-preservation, and the preservation of enjoyment. He argued that humans {{have a duty to}} avoid maxims that harm or degrade themselves, including suicide, sexual degradation, and drunkenness. This led Kant to regard sexual intercourse as degrading because it reduces humans to an object of pleasure. He admitted sex only within marriage, which he regarded as [...] "a merely animal union". He believed that masturbation is worse than suicide, reducing a person's status to below that of an animal; he argued that rape should be punished with castration and that bestiality requires expulsion from society. Feminist philosopher Catharine MacKinnon has argued that many contemporary practices would be deemed immoral by Kant's standards because they dehumanize women. Sexual harassment, prostitution and pornography, she argues, objectify women and do not meet Kant's standard of human autonomy. <b>Commercial</b> <b>sex</b> has been criticised for turning both parties into objects (and thus using them as a means to an end); mutual consent is problematic because in consenting, people choose to objectify themselves. Alan Soble has noted that more liberal Kantian ethicists believe that, depending on other contextual factors, the consent of women can vindicate their participation in pornography and prostitution.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{measuring}} {{the extent of}} this practice is difficult due to its criminal and covert nature, the International Labour Organization estimates that {{there are as many}} as 1.8 million children sexually trafficked worldwide, while UNICEF's 2006 State of the World's Children Report reports this number to be 2 million.

Likewise, Kendall and Funk justifies how “young girls age 12 and under are malleable and more easily trained into their prospective roles as prostitutes, and because virginity is highly prized by certain consumers willing to pay a premium” (31).A variety of sources, including the I.L.O, and scholars Erin Kunze and D.M.
