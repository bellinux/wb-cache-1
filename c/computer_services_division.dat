40|$|January 14 th 2004, President George Bush announces {{his plans}} to {{catalyst}} the space program into {{a new era of}} space exploration and discovery. His vision encompasses a robotics program to explore our solar system, a return to the moon, the human exploration of Mars, and to promote international prosperity towards our endeavors. We at NASA now have the task of constructing this vision in a very real timeframe. I have been chosen to begin phase 1 of making this vision a reality. I will be working on creating an Educational Mars Simulation of human exploration of Mars to stimulate interest and involvement with the project from investors and the community. GRC s <b>Computer</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Division</b> (CSD) in collaboration with the Office of Education Programs will be designing models, constructing terrain, and programming this simulation to create a realistic portrayal of human exploration on mars. With recent and past technological breakthroughs in computing, my primary goal can be accomplished with only the aid of 3 - 4 software packages. Lightwave 3 D is the modeling package we have selected to use for the creation of our digital objects. This includes a Mars pressurized rover, rover cockpit, landscape/terrain, and habitat. Once we have the models completed they need textured so Photoshop and Macromedia Fireworks are handy for bringing these objects to life. Before directly importing all of this data into a simulation environment, it is necessary to first render a stunning animation of the desired final product. This animation with represent what we hope to capture out of the simulation and it will include all of the accessories like ray-tracing, fog effects, shadows, anti-aliasing, particle effects, volumetric lighting, and lens flares. Adobe Premier will more than likely be used for video editing and adding ambient noises and music. Lastly, V-Tree is the real-time 3 D graphics engine which will facilitate our realistic simulation.

The major {{purpose was to}} {{determine}} the predictive efficiency of the Science Research Associates High School Placement Test Educability score, Reading score, Modern Mathematics score, Science Methodology score, and Composite score, as well as the predictive efficiency of the grade nine mathematics mark received by each student in predicting success in the grade ten Honours course. [...] The secondary purpose of the investigation was to determine if the school which a student attended prior to coming to Brother Rice High School had any effect on his performance in the grade ten Honours course. [...] Sample [...] The subjects used were 191 boys enrolled in the grade ten Honours course at Brother Rice High School in St. John’s, Newfoundland, during the school years 1974 - 1975, 1975 - 1976, 1976 - 1977. There was no selection procedure used; rather all students for whom data was available were included in the study. [...] Procedure [...] To answer the major purpose, a stepwise multiple regression was used which was developed by Draper and Smith (1966) and programmed for the IBM 360 / 370 computer by Carlson and Hazlett (1969) of the University of Alberta's Educational Research Services. The computations were performed at the Computer Services Department of Memorial University of Newfoundland.

40|$|The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has {{conducted}} a successful pilot {{inquiry into the}} <b>computer</b> <b>services</b> sector, collecting sales by type of service ‘product’. The size of the <b>computer</b> <b>services</b> market in 2000 was £ 32. 0 bn, with IT consultancy, computer facilities management and systems integration being the largest three activities. This is the first National Statistics official source of detailed service sector sales by product. Following a development period of only six months, a detailed classification of <b>computer</b> <b>services</b> has been devised, according to which businesses {{have been able to}} provide data. The survey has been conducted and published within six months, achieving 77 per cent response from sampled businesses. Useful lessons have been learnt in surveying service sector industries for this type of detailed information. Background This inquiry is viewed as a study into the feasibility of a SERVCOM inquiry (albeit possibly limited to key sectors) similar to the existing PRODCOM 1 (PRODucts of the European COMmunity) Inquiry which measures sales of manufactured products. The <b>computer</b> <b>services</b> industries (<b>Division</b> 72 of NACE 2 (the EC classification of economic activity)), were piloted following the Performance Innovation Unit Report E-commerce @ its. - best. uk 3, which supported DTI proposals for new five-digit codes for e-commerce enabling industries within the UK Standard Industrial Classification 4 (SIC(92)). The <b>computer</b> <b>services</b> industries are amongst {{the most important of these}} enabling industries. However, it was felt that industry based proposals would be both difficult to implement and of limited value in the fast-moving and converging IT services industry. It was decided that a product based approach (“SERVCOM”) would have more chance of success. Potential Benefits of Detailed Services Information A range of initiatives has been put in place by the ONS over recent years to improve the quality and availability of service sector statistics, for example the newly developing Index of Services (IoS), the Corporate Services Price Index (CSPI) and improvements to th...|$|R

40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{effort is}} underway at the NASA Glenn Research Center to develop concepts for revolutionary, nontraditional fuel cell power and propulsion systems for aircraft applications. There {{is a growing}} interest {{in the use of}} fuel cells as a power source for electric propulsion as well as an auxiliary power unit to substantially reduce or eliminate environmentally harmful emissions. A systems analysis effort was initiated to assess potential concepts in an effort to identify those configurations with the highest payoff potential. Among the technologies under consideration are advanced proton exchange membrane (PEM) and solid oxide fuel cells, alternative fuels and fuel processing, and fuel storage. Prior to this effort, the majority of fuel cell analysis done at Glenn was done for space applications. Because of this, a new suite of models was developed. These models include the hydrogen-air PEM fuel cell; internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell; balance-of-plant components (compressor, humidifier, separator, and heat exchangers); compressed gas, cryogenic, and liquid fuel storage tanks; and gas turbine/generator models for hybrid system applications. Initial mass, volume, and performance estimates of a variety of PEM systems operating on hydrogen and reformate have been completed for a baseline general aviation aircraft. Solid oxide/turbine hybrid systems are being analyzed. In conjunction with the analysis efforts, a joint effort has been initiated with Glenn s <b>Computer</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Division</b> to integrate fuel cell stack and component models with the visualization environment that supports the GRUVE lab, Glenn s virtual reality facility. The objective of this work is to provide an environment to assist engineers in the integration of fuel cell propulsion systems into aircraft and provide {{a better understanding of the}} interaction between system components and the resulting effect on the overall design and performance of the aircraft. Initially, three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) models of representative PEM fuel cell stack and components were developed and integrated into the virtual reality environment along with an Excel-based model used to calculate fuel cell electrical performance on the basis of cell dimensions (see the figure). CAD models of a representative general aviation aircraft were also developed and added to the environment. With the use of special headgear, users will be able to virtually manipulate the fuel cell s physical characteristics and its placement within the aircraft while receiving information on the resultant fuel cell output power and performance. As the systems analysis effort progresses, we will add more component models to the GRUVE environment to help us more fully understand the effect of various system configurations on the aircraft...|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{troubles}} associated with problem solving are alleviated {{when there is}} a model {{that can be used to}} represent the problem. Through the Advanced Graphics and Visualization (G-VIS) Laboratory and other facilities located within the Research Analysis Center, the <b>Computer</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Division</b> (CSD) is able to develop and maintain programs and software that allow for the modeling of various situations. For example, the Icing Research Branch is devoted to investigating the effect of ice that forms on the wings and other airfoils of airplanes while in flight. While running tests that physically generate ice and wind on airfoils within the laboratories and wind tunnels on site are done, it would be beneficial if most of the preliminary work could be done outside of the lab. Therefore, individuals from within CSD have collaborated with Icing Research in order to create SmaggIce. This software allows users to create ice patterns on clean airfoils or open files containing a variety of icing situations, manipulate and measure these forms, generate, divide, and merge grids around these elements for more explicit analysis, and specify and rediscretize subcurves. With the projected completion date of Summer 2005, the majority of the focus of the Smagglce team is user-functionality and error handling. My primary responsibility is to test the Graphical User Interface (GUI) in SmaggIce in order to ensure the usability and verify the expected results of the events (buttons, menus, etc.) within the program. However, there is no standardized, systematic way in which to test all the possible combinations or permutations of events, not to mention unsolicited events such as errors. Moreover, scripting tests, if not done properly and with a view towards inevitable revision, can result in more apparent errors within the software and in effect become useless whenever the developers of the program make a slight change in the way a specific process is executed. My task therefore requires a brief yet intense study into GUI coverage criteria and creating algorithms for GUI implementation. Nevertheless, there are still heavily graphical features of SmaggIceSmaggIce that must be either corrected or redesigned before its release. A particular feature of SmaggIce is the ability to smooth out curves created by control points that form an arbitrary shape into something more acquiescent to gridding (while maintaining the integrity of the data). This is done by a mathematical model known as Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curves. Existing NURBS code is written in FORTRAN- 77 with static arrays for holding information. My new assignment is to allow for dynamic memory allocation within the code and to make it possible for the developers to call out functions from the NURBS code using C...|$|E
