5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers. The <b>coupling</b> problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid on-the-fly <b>coupling</b> of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed one extra train slot on the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after <b>coupling</b> them, caused by moisture in the couplers. Due to the problems VR ended the practice of <b>coupling</b> Pendolino trains on-the-fly at the two intersection stations; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E

Two studies were conducted that tested whether <b>couples</b> with low relationship satisfaction show meaningful gains after RE.
