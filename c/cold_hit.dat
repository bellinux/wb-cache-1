40|$|In recent years, {{defendants}} {{who were}} identified {{as a result of}} a search through a database of DNA profiles have argued that the probability that a randomly selected person would match a crime-scene stain overstates the probative value of the match. The statistical literature is divided, with most statisticians who have written on the subject rejecting this claim. In People v. Nelson, the Supreme Court of California held that when the random-match probability is so small as to make it exceedingly unlikely that any unrelated individual has the incriminating DNA profile, this statistic is admissible in a database-search case. In dicta, the court suggested that the defendant might be permitted to introduce an inflated match probability to counter the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s statistic.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study, from a mathematician’s perspective, {{of the current}} ongoing debate {{as to how to}} calculate the significance of a DNA profile match in a “Cold Hit ” case, where the match {{is the result of a}} search through a DNA database, and what statistical information about the database identification may be presented in court as evidence. At present, such evidence may be (though often is not) excluded from court proceedings in jurisdictions that adhere to the 1923 Frye ruling that only scientific evidence may be admitted that uses methods on which the scientific community has reaches a consensus. Much of the legal debate has centered around the government’s insistence that it present the RMP (random match probability) in <b>cold</b> <b>hit</b> cases, a position that we argue strongly against. We use a particular current case as an illustrative example, but the focus of the paper is the general mathematical issues involved in such cases. The paper is in part expository, written both to make the mathematical community more aware of this important legal issue, and to provide lawyers and others in the legal profession with the necessary background to understand the main statistical issues involved. We do however present a proposed resolution to the key disagreement between the two main protagonists in the statistical debate — the adherents of the procedures recommended in the National Research Council’s 1992 and 1996 reports on DNA profiling evidence, and those who favor the Bayesian approach advocated by Balding and Donnelly.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{criminal}} investigations, investigators have sought a 2 ̆ 2 gold standard 2 ̆ 2 {{for the evaluation of}} forensic evidence. Currently, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology is the most reliable method of identification. Short Tandem Repeat (STR) DNA genotyping has the potential for impressive match statistics, but the methodology not infallible. The condition of an evidentiary sample and potential issues with the handling and testing of a sample can lead to significant issues with the interpretation of DNA testing results. Forensic DNA interpretation standards are determined by laboratory validation studies that often involve small sample sizes. This dissertation presents novel methodologies to address several open problems in forensic DNA analysis and demonstrates the improvement of the reported statistics over existent methodologies. Establishing a dynamically calculated RFU threshold specific to each analysis run improves the identification of signal from noise in DNA test data. Objectively identifying data consistent with degraded DNA sample input allows for {{a better understanding of the}} nature of an evidentiary sample and affects the potential for identifying allelic dropout (missing data). The interpretation of mixtures of two or more individuals has been problematic and new mathematical frameworks are presented to assist in that interpretation. Assessing the weight of a DNA database match (a <b>cold</b> <b>hit)</b> relies on statistics that assume that all individuals in a database are unrelated - this dissertation explores the statistical consequences of related individuals being present in the database. Finally, this dissertation presents a statistical basis for determining if a DNA database search resulting in a very similar but nonetheless non-matching DNA profile indicates that a close relative of the source of the DNA in the database is likely to be the source of an evidentiary sample...|$|E
