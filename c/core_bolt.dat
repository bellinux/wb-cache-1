BWRVIP- 25 requires that 50 % of the core plate rim hold-down bolts of BWR/ 2 - 5 plants without repair wedges be examined by enhanced VT- 1 from below the core plate (or by UT from above core plate once the technique is developed). However, it was determined that the bolts cannot be inspected by UT due to configuration issues and it has recently been concluded that an EVT- 1 exam does not provide meaningful results.

50|$|The {{first version}} of the rocket was to use three first stage <b>cores,</b> {{inseparably}} <b>bolted</b> together, with an RD-0146 powered second stage. It {{would have been able}} to lift a cargo or satellite payload of 23.8 tons to a 200-km, 51.7-degree circular orbit, a crew vehicle of 18.8 tons to a 135 by 400-km orbit, 7.0 tons to geostationary transfer orbit and 4.0 tons to geostationary orbit. The second variant would add two additional cores, and allow the strapon boosters to detach earlier in flight, boosting payload capacity to 35 tons. Version 3 would use stretched tanks on the booster cores, increasing payload again to 50 tons. Version 4 would fly with only a single core, and a Soyuz 2-derived upper stage.|$|R
25|$|In his decade-long {{pursuit of}} an elusive title, Mike Thibault {{found himself in}} the proverbial hot seat to {{engineer}} a deep run. But an absence of urgency was reflected in the team's free agency approach – making small waves to pry Thompson and Cash from their respective teams – to solely ink rugged forward Mistie Mims in relief of Charles. Sticking with the status quo meant the roster was set {{so much so that the}} Sun drafted an unheralded Malian prospect. Going into the season, Thibault had assembled a deep roster that necessitated only a couple minor moves to cap the off-season process. The coach's patience paid dividends when his burgeoning <b>core</b> <b>bolted</b> to a 6–1 start highlighted by a chafed Montgomery turning the starting reins over to Hightower. Leading into the 1-month Olympic hiatus, the Sun strung together a five-win streak to improve to a league-best 15–4 mark. Following the ill-timed Games, which saw the club's Jones-Charles tandem help capture gold for Team USA, Connecticut continued to perform superbly while short-handed. They finished the season 25–9, with a better road record (13–4) than as hosts. The Sun fended off late Liberty rallies to sweep their way into a joust with the Fever in what was the team's first Conference finals since 2010's radical facelift. In the series, the Sun took themselves to the doorstep of a Finals berth after notching a decisive Game 1 rout. But building on a stirring two-point Game 2 win and a rally cry after losing Douglas, Indiana derailed the Sun's seemingly predestined trip in a 71–87 home romp, a defeat that essentially cost longtime coach Thibault his job. The lion's share of the season's fortunes came from the talented triumvirate of Lawson, Jones and league MVP Tina Charles flanked by Mims and sixth woman Montgomery carving a niche as an energy duo off the pines. Though failure was what came to mind in taking stock of the team's decade season; the Fever capturing the year's title being emblematic of that.|$|R

40|$|Both bolt {{profile shape}} and profile spacing (rib spacing) {{have been found}} to {{influence}} the bonding capacity of the grouted rock bolt. The bolt surface profile configuration has greater importance to rock bolt than the steel rebar used in civil engineering construction, because the rock bolt is subjected to greater dynamic loading than the steel rebar. The increased bonding capacity of bolts is important when supported ground is either heavily fractured, faulted or the supported ground is of soft formation, typically that of coal measure rocks. Past laboratory studies have identified the bolt profile spacing as of significant relevance to bolt resin rock bonding increase, however, no attempt has been made to determine the optimum spacing between the bolt profiles spacing. Accordingly, a series of laboratory tests were carried out on 22 <b>core</b> diameter <b>bolts</b> installed in cylindrical steel sleeve. The study was carried out by both push and pull testing. The push testing was carried out in 150 mm long sleeves while the pull testing was made in 115 mm long sleeves. Profile spacing tested include, 12. 5, 25. 0 mm, 37. 5 mm and 50 mm lengths. The profile spacing of 37. 5 mm wide was found to provide the optimum bearin...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims at {{presenting}} numerical {{and experimental}} {{results on the}} lateral thrust exerted by the inner core of a buckling restraining brace (BRB) when, after buckling in compression, it arrives {{into contact with the}} external restraining case. The BRB consisted of a plate <b>core</b> restrained by <b>bolted</b> U- shaped member, thus allowing an easy assembly of the BRB, as well as the inspection and the substitution of its core after a seismic event [1, 2]. The results of six tests on BRBs having a plate core with a cross section of 5 x 50 mm 2 and a dissipative length of 560 mm are shown. The gap dimension was varied between 0. 25 and 0. 70 mm.

However, {{it was determined that}} the bolts cannot be inspected by UT due to configuration issues and it has recently been concluded that an EVT- 1 exam does not provide meaningful results. Accordingly, a technical justification for deviation from the BWRVIP guidance was developed. The technical justification included an analysis that found that the bolting has a relatively low susceptibility to cracking and a very high flaw tolerance. Therefore, postulated flaws would not grow to a size that significantly reduces the bolt preload {{over the life of the}} plant. Even if significant cracking did occur in the bolting, redundant structural components will prevent adverse displacement of the core plate. Furthermore, even with the extremely conservative assumptions of failures of both the bolting and the redundant hardware, the Standby Liquid Control (SLC) system could be used to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown. The BWRVIP is currently working on developing revised guidance for the <b>Core</b> Plate <b>bolts</b> and expects to complete that work, including gaining NRC approval of the revised guidance, by the end of 2015. Given the low likelihood that the function of the core plate will be compromised by bolting failures, there is little risk in postponing inspections of the bolts until such time as the BWRVIP develops revised guidance.

40|$|Demands on {{fastening}} bolts {{in mechanical}} engineering and automotive industry are discussed in this paper. The possibility of using microstructurally graded material for bolts is derived from this discussion. This material consists of a conventional coarse-grained core or main body and an ultra-fine-grained (UFG) layer surrounding it. Current research focuses on the manufacture of UFG layers by means of incremental metal forming. The examinations were carried out on an UFG material with elevated yield strength. An elasto-plastic model of an M 6 bolt, made of aluminum alloy EN AW- 6082, was set up and the bolt was loaded with tensile forces. The resulting distributions of stress and equivalent plastic deformation were analyzed. Result of this analysis is a recommendation for an optimum thickness of the ultra-fine-grained layer. Bolts from graded materials can withstand higher loads in the groove of the thread, which is the section with the highest load on the bolt. At the same time high toughness in the <b>bolt's</b> <b>core</b> is obtained, which allows its use as a safety component...|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose is}} to {{describe}} the technique and report the results and complications of percutaneous femoral rotational osteotomy, secured with a trochanteric-entry, locked intramedullary rod, in adolescents with femoral anteversion. Our series comprised an IRB approved, retrospective, consecutive series of 85 osteotomies (57 patients), followed to implant removal. The average age at surgery was 13.3  years (range 8.8 – 18.3) with a female-to-male ratio of 2.8 : 1. The minimum follow-up was 2  years. Eighty-three osteotomies healed primarily. Two patients, subsequently found to have vitamin D deficiency, broke screws and developed nonunions; both healed after repeat reaming and rod exchange and vitamin supplementation. Preoperative symptoms, including in-toeing gait, tripping and anterior knee pain or patellar instability, were resolved consistently. We did not observe significant growth disturbance or osteonecrosis. We noted a 12.5  % incidence of broken interlocking screws; this {{did not affect the}} correction or outcome except for the two patients mentioned above. This prompted a switch from a standard screw (core diameter =  3  mm) to a threaded <b>bolt</b> (<b>core</b> diameter =  3.7  mm). These results have led this technique to replace the use of plates or blade plates for rotational osteotomies.|$|R

Introduction: 2 HP Three Phase Induction Motor, No. 83362, Type 1, Form K. 1800 R. P. M., 110 Volts, 60 Cycles, 12 amperes. The primary or rotor {{of the motor}} is mounted in a hollow {{cylindrical}} frame of cast iron. This frame also forms {{the base of the}} machine and supports two end plates which contain the rotor bearings. The bearings consist of brass boxes arranged to be lubricated by two rings in each bearing. These rings revolve as the shaft turns carrying the oil from a chamber below the bearings. The primary consists of an iron core which is built up of sheet steel stampings. The <b>core</b> is firmly <b>bolted</b> to the frame. The conductors, which are copper wires or bars, depending upon the size of the machine, are placed in grooves in the core. These coils are insulated from the core and from each other where more than one conductor is placed in a slot. The windings, which are (y) connected, are held in the slots by thin wedges of tough wood, to protect the winding from mechanical injury, and also from the mechanical pull due to the reaction of the flux in the rotor. The secondary member or rotor is built up of laminated sheet steel. The laminae are insulated from each other by sheets of tissue paper or by a coating of japan, {{in order to reduce the}} loss by eddy currents which are induced by the flux. The conductors in this member are heavy copper bars which are short circuited at the ends of the rotor by heavy copper plates...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bolted</b> <b>cores</b> made of coated {{silicon steel}} sheets {{constitute}} {{a vital part}} of heavy electrical equipment for transformers, motors and turbogenerators. Bolted laminates are eminently suitable for facilitating smooth magnetic flux paths, but, unfortunately, they are unable to suppress interlaminate shearing caused by flexural vibration generating noise levels often exceeding 100 dB during operation. The resulting din and cacophony in the surrounding has become a major environmental concern. This thesis makes an attempt to develop theoretical, experimental and numerical models for evolving an effective stiffness approach enhancing the design and analysis underlying nonlinear flexure of bolted laminates. While large machine cores contain thousands of thin sheets bolted together along with end plates, this thesis reports the results obtained on two different assemblies. Two 375 mm long 60 mm wide and 10 mm thick plates assembled with 3, 4 or 5 bolts constitute the first configuration. The second one which is much more realistic comprises 80 coated 270 micron silicon steel sheets with end plates of 2 or 4 mm thickness held together by 3 or 5 bolts. Static 3 point bend tests on these bolted assemblies are followed by instrumented impact tests. Static bending tests highlight the role of frictional nonlinearity inducing a drop in the stiffness due to sliding between the plates. An experimentally determined effective modulus in the initial linear range is utilized for static and dynamic finite element simulations. Nonlinear response of bolted plates is simulated using contact elements in between the sliding plates, plates and the bolts heads. Since the first fundamental mode of vibration dominates the tribomechanical vibration induced noise, the primary focus is on the fundamental frequency in bending. There is generally a good overall agreement in all the results obtained through theory, experiment and FE simulation. Experiments, however, unveil quite complex nonlinear effects induced by friction and plasticity outside the scope of this thesis. However, the low amplitude response of bolted laminates which is reasonably well captured in this thesis represents the starting point for initiating a more elaborate effort for addressing large amplitude nonlinear flexure in bolted laminates. These findings shed light on estimating and controlling noise and vibration levels in heavy electric machines...|$|R
