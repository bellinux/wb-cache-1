5|$|Poole's Guildhall {{has played}} a varied part {{in the history of}} the town. A Grade II* listed {{building}}, the Guildhall was built in 1761 at a cost of £2,250. The new building included an open market house on the ground floor and a courtroom and offices for the town council on the first floor and has also been used as a Court of Record, Magistrates' Court, <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Admiralty</b> and a venue for Quarter Sessions. Between 1819 and 1821 the building was consecrated as a Parish Church while the old St. James Church was pulled down and replaced with the present church. During the Second World War the building was used as a canteen and meeting room for American soldiers prior to the invasion of France. The showers and washing facilities installed at this time were later converted into public baths which were used until the 1960s. The building was converted for use as the town museum between 1971 and 1991 but stood empty for the next 16 years. After a renovation project funded by Poole Borough Council, the restored Guildhall opened in June 2007 as a Register Office for weddings, civil partnerships and other civic ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea {{to be viewed as}} a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>admiralty.</b> Unlike the usual English common law system, the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>admiralty</b> hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse that contributed to the American Revolution.

25|$|On 12 March 1705 Lieutenant George Ramsey {{with two}} sergeants, three corporals, and thirty-three {{soldiers}} were {{on board the}} Royal Mary for some two months whilst she cruised off the Scottish east coast. On 6 June the cruise was extended for another two months {{in the company of}} her sister ship Royal William. A record of the soldier's purpose on board is not known but possibly they were to be landed at places where Jacobites were at work. Due to the execution for piracy of Captain Thomas Green of the English East India Company's vessel Worcester and two of his officers at Leith in 1707, feelings were not good between the Scottish government and that of England. Scotland's attempt to found a colony at Darien had failed, and when the vessels returned one of them, the Speedy Return, was missing. Captain Green was accused by the mob of killing the crew and sinking the ship. He and his men were tried by the High <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Admiralty</b> of Scotland, found guilty, and executed on Leith Sands, despite a lack of valid evidence against them.|$|E

500|$|When Castor {{returned}} to Britain, the frigate was classed by the Admiralty and the Navy Board as [...] "salvage" [...] {{rather than as}} a prize. The laws regarding salvage meant that the proportion of prize money due to be paid to Laforey and his crew was significantly reduced by the declaration. The grounds for this judgement were that after its capture by the French, Castor was not taken into a French harbour and properly condemned by a French prize court and commissioned into the French Navy, the normal legal requirement for what was termed a [...] "complete prize". On behalf of his men Laforey brought a legal challenge against the ruling to the High <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Admiralty</b> to determine the status of Castor. The judge, Sir James Marriott, heard evidence from a number of parties, including a deposition by Captain L'Huillier that described Admiral Nielly's standing orders to fit out any captured warships at sea for continued service in the campaign. After considering the evidence Marriott ruled that Castor was a legitimate prize [...] "setting forth as a ship of war", and that the normal prize rules should apply to Laforey's case. The prize money for the purchase of the frigate was therefore authorised to be paid at Plymouth on 20 July 1795.|$|E
