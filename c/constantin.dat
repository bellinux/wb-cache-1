5|$|As head of Ileana, Bogdan-Pitești {{organized}} Joséphin Péladan's 1898 {{visit to}} Bucharest. It was a much-publicized event, which {{attracted the attention}} of high society and received ample coverage in the press; Bogdan-Pitești accompanied Péladan on visits to various Bucharest landmarks, including the Athenaeum, the Chamber of Deputies, the Orthodox Metropolitan and Domnița Bălașa churches, as well as the Roman Catholic Saint Joseph Cathedral. Among the politicians who attended the ceremonies were Nicolae Filipescu, <b>Constantin</b> Dissescu, Take Ionescu, Ioan Lahovary, and <b>Constantin</b> C. Arion; prominent intellectuals (Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, Rădulescu-Motru etc.) were in the audience.|$|E
5|$|By Order 1191 of , Romania's Minister of War, Vintilă Brătianu, {{created the}} Volunteer Corps {{as a special}} {{formation}} of the national army. On the same day, in Darnytsia, Pietraru was tasked by Chief of Staff <b>Constantin</b> Prezan with equipping the new recruits and organizing them into units. The honorary command was assigned to <b>Constantin</b> Coandă, who was already the military attaché with Russia's Stavka (General Headquarters). Over the next month, in Mogilev, Coandă again negotiated the Corps' recognition by Stavka. Coandă received the permission, {{but the number of}} recruits was no longer clearly specified.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Luceafărul Theater in Iaşi {{hosted a}} dramatized version of Momente şi schiţe. Titled În lumea lui Mitică ("In Mitică's World"), it was {{directed}} by <b>Constantin</b> Brehnescu and starred Dionisie Vitcu.|$|E
5|$|By the 1910s, Bogdan-Pitești's art {{interests}} {{gave birth}} to a collection of as few as 967 or as many as 1,500 individual works, most of them hosted by his estate in Colonești. They comprised objects created by prominent Romanian visual artists, including, alongside his early associates, Nina Arbore, <b>Constantin</b> Brâncuși, Oscar Han, Aurel Jiquidi, Maria Ciurdea Steurer, <b>Constantin</b> Medrea, Ary Murnu, Dimitrie Paciurea, Nicolae Petrescu-Găină, Alexandru Satmari, Francisc Șirato, Cecilia Cuțescu-Storck, Jean Alexandru Steriadi, Friedrich Storck, Ion Theodorescu-Sion, and Nicolae Tonitza. Of the total, around 900 works were of Romanian provenance. Among the foreign artists whose work was featured in the collection were Georges Rochegrosse and Frank Brangwyn. The section dedicated to newer works of art was designed and opened as the first the modern art museum in Romania.|$|E
5|$|Circa 1908, the Bogdan-Pitești villa on Bucharest's Știrbey-Vodă Street (near the Cișmigiu Gardens) began hosting regular {{gatherings of}} intellectuals. Among those who {{attended}} in successive stages were the writers Macedonski, Eftimiu, Tudor Arghezi, Mateiu Caragiale, Benjamin Fondane, Gala Galaction, George Bacovia, Ion Minulescu, Claudia Millian, N. D. Cocea, Ion Vinea, F. Brunea-Fox, Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est, A. de Herz, Ion Călugăru, and Adrian Maniu. It also hosted the artists Luchian, Artachino, Verona, Maxy, Iser, Steriadi, Dimitrescu, Pallady, Ressu, Dărăscu, Nina Arbore, <b>Constantin</b> Brâncuși, <b>Constantin</b> Medrea, Dimitrie Paciurea, Maria Ciurdea Steurer, Oscar Han, Nicolae Tonitza, Ion Theodorescu-Sion, Friedrich Storck and Cecilia Cuțescu-Storck, {{as well as}} Abgar Baltazar, Alexandru Brătășanu, Alexandru Poitevin-Skeletti, George Demetrescu Mirea, Rodica Maniu, and Marcel Janco. Also in 1908, following Iser's proposal, Bogdan-Pitești sponsored a Bucharest exhibit showcasing works by the renowned European painters Demetrios Galanis, Jean-Louis Forain and André Derain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Constantin</b> Amăriuţei {{was noted}} for {{defining}} Mitică's character (Miticism) through onthologic terms {{borrowed from the}} German philosopher Martin Heidegger. He thus argued that, for all their mundane motivations, the character and his peers illustrated a search present with all individuals, identifiable with Heidegger's concepts of Being-in-the-World and Being-toward-death (see Heideggerian terminology).|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{came from}} an old line of country nobility. His direct {{ancestors}} {{had served in the}} Fifth Crusade against Egypt, and again in the Eighth Crusade of Saint Louis against Tunisia in 1270. They had also fought at the Battle of Saint-Omer in 1340 and the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. The family managed to survive the French Revolution. Three members of the family served in Napoleon's Grande Armée and a fourth, who suffered from weak health, served in the supply train. The third son, <b>Constantin,</b> who had served in Napoleon's Russian Campaign, was created a chevalier by King Louis XVIII, and a Papal count by Pope Pius IX in 1857. <b>Constantin</b> had two sons. The older, Alfred Francois Marie (1822–1902), died childless. The younger, Gustave Francois Marie Joseph (1829–1914), became a noted Egyptologist.|$|E
5|$|Filitti lived secluded in a townhouse on Oltarului Street, in the Bucharest {{quarter of}} Moșilor. He {{repeatedly}} complained about street noises, confiscated the footballs of neighborhood children, and eventually received (from Romanian Police chief Gavrilă Marinescu) a permanent guard {{to protect him}} from distractions. Filitti had few visiting friends, among them Alexandru Filitti-Robănești, teacher Alexandru Pisoschi, historians Emanoil Hagi-Moscu and G. D. Florescu. He was however in constant correspondence with other scholars who shared his passions, including Greek jurist Panagiotis Zepos, His Majesty's Antiquarian G. T. Kirileanu, bibliophile <b>Constantin</b> Karadja, regional historian G. Poboran, academician-priest Nicolae M. Popescu and Hungarian archivist Endre (Andrei) Veress. In addition to the anti-Germanophile Nicolae Iorga, his rivals in academia included a new generation of leading historians, who were targets of his polemical articles: Gheorghe I. Brătianu, George Fotino, <b>Constantin</b> C. Giurescu and P. P. Panaitescu. The latter was however influenced by Filitti's ideas on the sources of landed property, and incorporated them into his own historical narrative.|$|E
5|$|In August 1936, {{he removed}} Nicolae Titulescu {{from the office}} of Foreign Minister, {{replacing}} him with Victor Antonescu. This caused an uproar, with most of Romania's diplomatic corps voicing their dissatisfaction. Over the following months, virtually all of Titulescu's supporters were themselves recalled (including, among others, <b>Constantin</b> Vișoianu, the ambassador to Poland, <b>Constantin</b> Antoniade, Romania's representative to the League of Nations, Dimitrie Ghyka, the ambassador to Belgium, and Caius Brediceanu, the ambassador to Austria) while Titulescu's adversaries, such as Antoine Bibesco, were returned to office. Bibesco subsequently campaigned in France and the United Kingdom, in an attempt to reassure Romania's main allies that the move did not signify a change in Romania's priorities. Tătărescu was later blamed by his own party for having renounced the diplomatic course on which Romania had engaged.|$|E
5|$|In watchmaking, Vacheron <b>Constantin,</b> Patek Philippe, Rolex, Breitling, {{and other}} {{companies}} use platinum for producing their limited edition watch series. Watchmakers appreciate the unique properties of platinum, as it neither tarnishes nor wears out (the latter quality relative to gold).|$|E
5|$|Sartain was a {{progressive}} New Woman, who with her sister-in-law, Hattie Judd Sartain, formed the woman's organization, the New Century Club. Hattie {{is believed to}} have helped her attain the commissions of portraits of local physicians <b>Constantin</b> Hering and James Caleb Jackson. Besides having financed her education and being her ally and mentor, Hattie also modeled for Sartain.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} second arrival to power, Tătărescu became noted for the {{enthusiastic}} support {{he gave to}} the modernist sculptor <b>Constantin</b> Brâncuși, and directed state funds to finance the building of Brâncuși's The Endless Column complex in Târgu Jiu (completed in October 1938).|$|E
5|$|The codex is an Alexandrian text-type {{manuscript}} {{written in}} the 4th century in uncial letters on parchment. Scholarship considers the Codex Sinaiticus {{to be one of}} the best Greek texts of the New Testament, along with the Codex Vaticanus. Until the discovery by <b>Constantin</b> von Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, the Codex Vaticanus was unrivaled.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} claimed lineage {{from the}} non-monastic {{branch of the}} Filitti clan. A Silvestru Filitti, active ca. 1810, {{was among the first}} private practitioners in Wallachia. Fully Romanianized, 20th-century Filittis were still members of Romania's privileged class. A native of Bucharest, Ioan C. was the son of Colonel <b>Constantin</b> Filitti, a former Ordinance Officer of the Romanian Domnitori. By then, the family owned a country estate, at Alexeni, Ialomița County. The Filittis preserved strong connections with the Ialomița region, where Colonel Filitti had twice served as Prefect. Ioan inherited from him a deep dislike and mistrust toward the dominant National Liberal Party (PNL), sentiments which carried him into Conservative politics: <b>Constantin</b> regarded himself as a political victim of the PNL establishment, and in particular of the Brătianu family. Colonel Filitti had another son, Alexandru—better known under the moniker Filitti-Robănești.|$|E
5|$|A dandy, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești himself led {{a life of}} luxury, {{marked by}} excess, and had by then become a drug addict. He was a proud {{homosexual}} (or bisexual), which did not prevent him from keeping as his concubine a younger woman, {{commonly referred to as}} Domnica ("Little Lady") or Mica ("Little One"). Born Alexandra Colanoski, she was born in 1894 to Romanian Poles from Bessarabia, and, according to memoirist <b>Constantin</b> Beldie, had previously been a prostitute at a nightclub.|$|E
5|$|Averescu {{was born}} in Ozerne (previously known as Babele, and {{subsequently}} renamed Alexandru Averescu), a village northwest of Izmail, now part of Ukraine. The son of <b>Constantin</b> Averescu, who held the rank of sluger, he studied at the Romanian Orthodox seminary in Izmail, then at the School of Arts and Crafts in Bucharest (intending to become an engineer). In 1876, he decided to join the Gendarmes in Izmail.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{death in}} 952 is {{recorded}} by the Irish annals, who enter it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm's death. The last of Constantine's certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, ConstantineIII (<b>Constantín</b> mac Cuiléin). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amlaíb mac Gofraid {{was married to a}} daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, but like the name of his wife, or wives, this has not been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen referees {{participated in}} the tournament: four Europeans – two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (<b>Constantin</b> Rădulescu, also the Romanian team coach), and eleven from the Americas – among them six Uruguayans. In order to {{eliminate}} differences {{in the application of}} the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.|$|E
5|$|France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 {{points to}} 8 and {{defeating}} Germany 27 points to 17. Other sources list the German team as second, {{because of the}} points difference, but no such determination was made in 1900. 6,000 people watched the game between France and Great Britain, which was the largest crowd at the games. <b>Constantin</b> Henriquez, a player on the French team, is the first known coloured athlete {{to compete in the}} Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|From France, Bogdan-Pitești had {{contemplated}} {{the idea of}} revolutionizing Romanian art, and, upon his arrival to Bucharest, began organizing artists' reunions at the Kübler and Fialkowski coffeehouses. In 1896, with Post-Impressionist artists <b>Constantin</b> Artachino, Ștefan Luchian and Nicolae Vermont, he founded Salonul Independenților, the Romanian replica of the French Société des Artistes Indépendants. They were soon joined by painter Nicolae Grant and caricaturist Nicolae Petrescu-Găină.|$|E
5|$|In March 2001, the {{official}} website was set up, which revealed the film's original October 26, 2001 release and a redirect to the film's distributor <b>Constantin</b> Films. The website was fully opened in July 2001, and composed of images, plot info, character biographies and downloads. The film was {{planned to have}} an R-rated classification which is what Anderson wanted since he knew the film had to be Rated-R in order to capture {{the horror of the}} games. In January 2002, the film was officially announced to contain an R rating.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November 1940, the Iron Guard began {{a bloody}} {{retaliation}} against various political figures {{who had served}} under Carol (following a late investigation into the 1938 killing of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the movement's founder and early leader, by Carol's authorities). Tătărescu and <b>Constantin</b> Argetoianu were among the second wave of captured politicians (on 27 November), and were destined for arbitrary execution; they were, however, saved by the intervention of regular police forces, most of whom had grown hostile to the Guardist militias.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{disagree with}} this narrative, Professor <b>Constantin</b> Zuckerman going {{as far as}} to suggest that the True Cross was actually lost, and that the wood contained in the allegedly still sealed reliquary brought to Jerusalem by Heraclius in 629 was a fake. In his analysis, the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe, recently turned ally and co-father-in-law, Persian general and soon-to-become king, Shahrvaraz.|$|E
5|$|Textual {{critics and}} palaeographers like Johann Jakob Wettstein, <b>Constantin</b> von Tischendorf, Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener and Caspar René Gregory dated the {{manuscript}} to the 10th century. Henri Omont and Kirsopp Lake dated {{it to the}} 12th century, and Dean Burgon to the 12th or 13th century. It is dated by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research to the 12th century because the frequent occurrence of enlarged letters, rounded breathing marks, flourishes and ligatures seem to eliminate earlier dates.|$|E
5|$|The new ruler, Gheorghe Bibescu, {{released}} Bălcescu {{and other}} {{participants in the}} plot during 1843; soon afterwards, they became involved in founding a new Freemason-inspired secret society, known as Frăția ("The Brotherhood"), which was {{to serve as the}} central factor in the revolution. Early on, Frățias nucleus was formed by Bălcescu, Ion Ghica, Alexandru G. Golescu, and Major Christian Tell; by spring 1848, the leadership also included Dimitrie and Ion Brătianu, <b>Constantin</b> Bălcescu, Ștefan and Nicolae Golescu, Gheorghe Magheru, C. A. Rosetti, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, and Ioan Voinescu II. It was especially successful in Bucharest, where it also reached out to the middle class, and kept a legal facade as Soțietatea Literară (the Literary Society), whose meetings were attended by the Moldavians Vasile Alecsandri, Mihail Kogălniceanu, and Costache Negruzzi, {{as well as by the}} Austrian subject <b>Constantin</b> Daniel Rosenthal. During the early months of 1848, Romanian students at the University of Paris, including the Brătianu brothers, witnessed and, in some cases, took part in the French republican uprising.|$|E
5|$|The {{two films}} were both {{produced}} with assistance from Eurimages, and were donated production funds from French private ventures, {{as well as}} from the French state. The credited producers of the film also include the television stations La Sept and Canal Plus, the Romanian Ministry of Culture's Studio of Film Production and the French Ministry of Culture's Centre national de la cinématographie, the Romanian firm Filmex, as well as filmmakers Marin Karmitz and <b>Constantin</b> Popescu.|$|E
5|$|Alongside Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and <b>Constantin</b> Argetoianu (whom {{he succeeded}} as Premier), Tătărescu became a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} group of maverick pro-Carol politicians. After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a national government that was to back Carol's foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania's borders after the outbreak of World War II. In 1945, Tătărescu stressed his belief that authoritarianism benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war. Tătărescu's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties, and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by Ernest Urdăreanu and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their young}} age, the three editors {{were able to}} attract collaborations from {{established}} Symbolist authors, active within Romania's own Symbolist movement. Alongside their close friend and mentor Adrian Maniu (an Imagist who had been Vinea's tutor), they included N. Davidescu, Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo, Emil Isac, Claudia Millian, Ion Minulescu, I. M. Rașcu, Eugeniu Sperantia, Al. T. Stamatiad, Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est, <b>Constantin</b> T. Stoika, {{as well as the}} journalist and lawyer Poldi Chapier. In its inaugural issue, the journal even printed a poem by one of the leading figures in Romanian Symbolism, Alexandru Macedonski. Simbolul also featured illustrations by Maniu, Millian and Iosif Iser.|$|E
5|$|FIFA {{president}} Jules Rimet intervened, {{and eventually}} four European teams {{made the trip}} by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by <b>Constantin</b> Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King CarolII. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers {{to ensure that the}} players would still have jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip. The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.|$|E
5|$|For Constantine's {{last years}} as king {{there is only}} the meagre record of the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba. The death of Æthelstan is reported, as are two others. The first of these, in 938, is that of Dubacan, mormaer of Angus or son of the mormaer. Unlike the report of 918, on this {{occasion}} the title mormaer {{is attached to a}} geographical area, but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was in any way similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom. The second death, entered with that of Æthelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailpín, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of <b>Constantín.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} events, 91 revolutionaries {{were sentenced to}} exile. Of these, a small group was transported by barges from Giurgiu, {{on their way to}} the Austrian-ruled Svinița, near the Danube port of Orschowa. The revolutionary artist <b>Constantin</b> Daniel Rosenthal and Maria Rosetti, both of whom had been allowed to go free and had {{subsequently}} followed the barges on shore, pointed out that the Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction, and were able to persuade the mayor of Svinița to disarm the guards, which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee. The escapees then made their way to Paris.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1898, back in Romania, Bogdan-Pitești and {{the other}} Salonul Independenților {{initiators}} joined up with author Ioan Bacalbașa and architect Ștefan Ciocâlteu. This diverse group established Societatea Ileana, an association dedicated to supporting innovative artists. Its steering committee was later joined by the intellectual and political figures <b>Constantin</b> Rădulescu-Motru, Nicolae Xenopol, and Nicolae Filipescu, {{as well as by}} the painter Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The society took up the effort to uproot against academic salons, organizing a large and provocative exhibit in 1898, and, at the height of its popularity, enlisted in its ranks some 300 people. Despite such consolidation, various Ileana affiliates were not entirely committed to the cause, and never severed their links with Stănescu's official section.|$|E
