50|$|Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, {{formerly}} known as Corynebacterium hæmolyticum, is a species of bacteria classified as a gram-positive bacillus. It is catalase-negative, aerobic, beta-hemolytic, and not motile. It {{is part of the}} normal flora of the pharynx, but it may sometimes cause head and neck infections, pharyngitis, and sinusitis (Arcanobacterium <b>haemolyticum</b> <b>infections).</b>|$|R
50|$|Clostridium novyi (oedematiens) a Gram-positive, endospore- forming, obligate {{anaerobic}} bacteria of {{the class}} clostridia. It is ubiquitous, being found in the soil and faeces. It is pathogenic, causing {{a wide variety of}} diseases in man and animals. It comes in three types, labelled A, B, and a non-pathogenic type C distinguished by the range of toxins they produce. Some authors include <b>Clostridium</b> <b>haemolyticum</b> as <b>Clostridium</b> novyi type D. C novyi is closely related to Clostridium botulinum types C and D as Yoshimasa Sasaki et al. have demonstrated by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.|$|R

In a period of 2 years from 1978 - 80 C. haemolyticum was isolated from the pharynx of 9 patients wih tonsillitis and from local septic lesions in 7 other patients. Association with other pathogens was common. No patients had a rash. The properties of the isolates {{are described}}...|$|R
50|$|A. <b>haemolyticum</b> <b>infection</b> is {{most common}} in 15- to 25-year-old persons and manifests as exudative pharyngitis and/or {{tonsillitis}} accompanied by cervical lymphadenopathy. Symptoms look like those of β-hemolytic streptococci or viral infection. A rash of the chest and of the abdomen, neck, or extremities is seen in 20% to 25% of cases, enhancing the risk of diagnostic error as streptococcal infection or penicillin allergy, when β-lactam therapy is initiated without exact diagnosis.|$|R
40|$|Diphtheroids or "coryneform" bacilli {{are usually}} {{considered}} to be nonpathogenic "normal flora" of human skin and mucous membranes. Because bacterial cultures are frequently contaminated with these organisms the correct diagnosis and treatment may be delayed by the failure to recognize serious infections caused by them. Few confirmed cases of orthopaedic infections due to Arcanobacterium <b>haemolyticum</b> <b>infection</b> have been reported, partly because of inadequate identification of this bacterium. We report a case of septic arthritis due to A. haemolyticum...|$|R
5000|$|Arcanobacterium (...) is a genus of bacteria. They are gram-positive, non-acid fast, nonmotile, facultatively anaerobic, and non-endospore forming. They {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in {{nature in the}} microbiota of animals (including the human microbiota) and are mostly innocuous. Some can cause disease in humans and other animals (for example, Arcanobacterium <b>haemolyticum</b> <b>infections).</b> As with various species of a microbiota (including their cousins in the genera Corynebacterium and Trueperella), they usually are not pathogenic but can occasionally opportunistically capitalize on atypical access to tissues (via wounds) or weakened host defenses.|$|R
2500|$|Pathology of F. magna {{infection}} varies {{according to}} host type but some features are shared by all three types. Primary lesions usually occur in the liver and are associated with mechanical damage due to migrating juvenile flukes or fibrous encapsulation of sedentary adult flukes. The most common feature of F. magna infection is black pigmentation in abdominal or thoracic organs, especially in the liver. The hematin pigment is produced by flukes as a byproduct of feeding on blood. Pigment within tissues {{is a result of}} migrating of juvenile flukes and it accumulates within hepatic cells without resorption. F. magna has also been associated with Red Water disease in bovine. F. magna causes liver damage, which allows the bacteria <b>Clostridium</b> <b>haemolyticum</b> to cause secondary infection in hepatic tissue. The infection will decrease the livers function, and the host's urine will become red, hence the name [...] "Red Water" [...] disease.|$|R
40|$|One hundred fifty-one {{isolates}} of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>haemolyticum</b> {{were examined}} for consistent toxin production following repeated serial transfers in laboratory media. Most of these isolates produced only {{small amounts of}} toxic materials and serial transfers appeared to reduce toxigenic characteristics. Eleven of the isolates consistenly produced measurable amounts of toxic materials. One of these isolates was used for production of toxic fluids that were concentrated by lyophilization and reconstitution to a smaller volume or by precipitation with ammonium sulphate followed by dialysis against water and glycerol. Known amounts of these substances were inactivated with formalin, heat, beta-propiolactone, ultra-violet irradiation and glutathione. The resulting toxoids were inoculated into guinea pigs and most were judged to be nonimmunogenic because the animals were unable to resist dermal challenge. Toxic materials with added glycine were inactivated with formaldehyde as readily as those without the amino acid but the resulting toxoids were immunogenic while those prepared without the amino acid were not...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial flagella are cell {{locomotion}} {{and occasional}} adhesion organelles composed primarily of the polymeric protein flagellin, but {{to date have}} not been associated with any enzymatic function. Here, we report the bioinformatics-driven discovery of a class of enzymatic flagellins that assemble to form proteolytically active flagella. Originating by a metallopeptidase insertion into the central flagellin hypervariable region, this flagellin family has expanded to at least 74 bacterial species. In the pathogen, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>haemolyticum,</b> metallopeptidase-containing flagellin (which we termed flagellinolysin) {{is the second most}} abundant protein in the flagella and is localized to the extracellular flagellar surface. Purified flagellar filaments and recombinant flagellin exhibit proteolytic activity, cleaving nearly 1000 different peptides. With similar to 20, 000 flagellin copies per similar to 10 -mu m flagella this assembles the largest proteolytic complex known. Flagellum-mediated extracellular proteolysis expands our understanding of the functional plasticity of bacterial flagella, revealing this family as enzymatic biopolymers that mediate interactions with diverse peptide substrates...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobes {{differ in}} their {{sensitivity}} to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. Strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at pO 2 levels greater than 0. 5 %. Species that {{were found to be}} strict anaerobes were Treponema macrodentium, Treponema denticola, Treponema oralis n. sp., <b>Clostridium</b> <b>haemolyticum,</b> Selenomonas ruminatium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and Lachnospira multiparus. Moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8 %. The moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. Species considered as moderate anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, Fusobacteria nucleatum, Clostridium novyi type A, and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. The recognition of at least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} flagellum {{is made up}} {{of approximately}} 20, 000 subunits of the monomeric protein, flagellin, and plays a role in cell motility and pathogenesis. The extreme sequence diversity within the hypervariable region of flagellin genes observed across phyla suggests hidden functional diversity. This thesis outlines the discovery of the first family of flagellin variants with proteolytic activity. A multi-faceted approach revealed a conserved HExxH motif within the hypervariable region (HVR) of these flagellin variants. The motif is characteristic of the Gluzincin family of thermolysin-like peptidases and was found to be conserved in 74 bacterial species spanning over 32 genera. Experimental validation began with the recombinant expression and purification of the HVR of the flagellin FliA(H) from the species <b>Clostridium</b> <b>haemolyticum,</b> an animal pathogen. An approach using mass spectrometry and proteomics revealed that the substrate specificity of this flagellin protease {{is similar to that of}} zinc-dependant matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs). Furthermore, peptide sequencing of harvested C. haemolyticum flagellar filaments revealed that the proteolytic flagellin was the second most dominant flagellin component and was also shown to have MMP-like protease activity. Considering the expanded functional repertoire of this organelle in the recent years, this flagellin-associated protease may play a role in chemotaxis, biofilm formation, adhesion and pathogenesis...|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the means by which A. <b>haemolyticum</b> causes <b>infection</b> or the {{associated}} skin manifestations. The organism is known to produce uncharacterized hemolytic agent(s), a neuraminidase and a phospholipase D (PLD) acting preferentially on sphingomyelin. PLD is known to result in tissue damage, but the role in disease of the cytotoxic effect caused by this extracellular toxin is not established.|$|R
40|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>haemolyticum</b> is {{the causal}} agent of bacillary {{hemoglobinuria}} in cattle, goat, sheep, and ruminants. In this study, we report the first recorded human-infecting C. haemolyticum strain collected from an 18 -year-old woman diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After failure of traditional techniques, only next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology {{in combination with}} bioinformatics, phylogenetic, and pathogenomics analyses revealed that our King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSHRC) bacterial isolate belongs to C. haemolyticum species. KFSHRC isolate is composed of 1 chromosome and 4 plasmids. The total genome size {{is estimated to be}} 2. 7 [*]Mbp with a low GC content of 28. 02 %. Comparative pathogenomics analysis showed that C. haemolyticum KFSHRC isolate is a potential virulent pathogenic bacterium as it possesses the virulence factors necessary to establish an infection, acquire essential nutrients, resist antimicrobial agents, and tolerate hostile conditions both in the human host and in its surrounding environment. These factors are included in the main chromosome in addition to novel recombination of the plasmids, and they could be the reason for the incidence of that human infection. This work demonstrated the importance of using NGS in medical microbiology for pathogen identification. It also demonstrates the importance of sequencing more microbial samples and sharing this information in public databases to facilitate the identification of pathogenic microbes with better accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium botulinum (group III), Clostridium novyi and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>haemolyticum</b> are {{well-known}} pathogens causing animal botulism, gas gangrene/black disease, and bacillary hemoglobinuria, respectively. A close genetic relationship {{exists between}} the species, which {{has resulted in the}} collective term C. novyi sensu lato. The pathogenic traits in these species, e. g., the botulinum neurotoxin and the novyi alpha toxin, are mainly linked to a large plasmidome consisting of plasmids and circular prophages. The plasmidome of C. novyi sensu lato has so far been poorly characterized. In this study we explored the genomic relationship {{of a wide range of}} strains of C. novyi sensu lato with a special focus on the dynamics of the plasmidome. Twenty-four genomes were sequenced from strains selected to represent as much as possible the genetic diversity in C. novyi sensu lato. Sixty-one plasmids were identified in these genomes and 28 of them were completed. The genomic comparisons revealed four separate lineages, which did not strictly correlate with the species designations. The plasmids were categorized into 13 different plasmid groups on the basis of their similarity and conservation of plasmid replication or partitioning genes. The plasmid groups, lineages and species were to a large extent entwined because plasmids and toxin genes had moved across the lineage boundaries. This dynamic process appears to be primarily driven by phages. We here present a comprehensive characterization of the complex species group C. novyi sensu lato, explaining the intermixed genetic properties. This study also provides examples how the reorganization of the botulinum toxin and the novyi alpha toxin genes within the plasmidome has affected the pathogenesis of the strains...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is an {{emerging}} bacterial pathogen, causing pharyngitis and more invasive infections. This organism expresses an unusual phospholipase D (PLD), which we propose promotes bacterial pathogenesis through its action on host cell membranes. The pld gene is {{found on a}} genomic region of reduced %G + C, suggesting recent horizontal acquisition. RESULTS:Recombinant PLD rearranged HeLa cell lipid rafts in a dose-dependent manner and this was inhibited by cholesterol sequestration. PLD also promoted host cell adhesion, as a pld mutant had a 60. 3 % reduction {{in its ability to}} adhere to HeLa cells as compared to the wild type. Conversely, the pld mutant appeared to invade HeLa cells approximately two-fold more efficiently as the wild type. This finding was attributable to a significant loss of host cell viability following secretion of PLD from intracellular bacteria. As determined by viability assay, only 15. 6 % and 82. 3 % of HeLa cells remained viable following invasion by the wild type or pld mutant, respectively, as compared to untreated HeLa cells. Transmission electron microscopy of HeLa cells inoculated with A. haemolyticum strains revealed that the pld mutant was contained within intracellular vacuoles, as compared to the wild type, which escaped the vacuole. Wild type-infected HeLa cells also displayed the hallmarks of necrosis. Similarly inoculated HeLa cells displayed no signs of apoptosis, as measured by induction of caspase 3 / 7, 8 or 9 activities.

40|$|Botulism {{is caused}} by botulinum {{neurotoxins}} (BoNTs) produced by the spore forming strictly anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Seven different types of BoNTs (type A-F) have so far been established {{on the basis of}} neutralization with different antibodies. Botulism affects both humans and animals, and there are occasionally large-scale outbreaks of high mortality in animals. Especially large outbreaks of avian botulism have been reported from various countries, including Sweden. Other animals relatively commonly affected are cattle, horses, sheep and farmed fur animals. C. botulinum is a diverged species and can be organized into four groups, which reflect their genetic and physiological differences. C. botulinum group III strains producing BoNT types C, D and chimers C/D and D/C, are mainly connected to animal botulism. The gene encoding BoNT in C. botulinum group III strains is located on an unstable plasmid-like phage. In this thesis, strains of the previously relatively uncharacterised C. botulinum group III were isolated and genotyped with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Several pulsotypes were formed, but the majority clustered closely together and represented most of the chimeric strains. Strains representing different pulsotypes and different animal and geographical origin, were selected for whole genome sequencing and the resulting genomes could be divided into four genomic lineages. Comparisons against genomes of Clostridium novyi and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>haemolyticum</b> revealed that they could be organized into the same genomic lineages (lineages II-IV), which resulted in the suggested collective term C. novyi sensu lato. The organization of all sequenced genomes was analysed. It revealed a relatively conserved chromosome and an abundance of highly dynamic plasmids. The plasmids, lineages and species were entwined because plasmids and toxin genes had moved across the lineage boundaries. Of the four lineages, only lineage I was C. botulinum specific, and this lineage includes strains of the most common pulsotype. One genome of lineage I was assembled into completion. It was smaller than C. botulinum group I and II genomes, but contained as much as five plasmids. Most of the identified putative toxin genes were found on these plasmids. Strains of lineage I may be more virulent than other C. botulinum group III strains, which is reflected by their domination in animal botulism cases today...|$|R
40|$|Identify an {{uncommon}} pathogen {{as a cause}} of osteomyelitis A. haemolyt icum (previously Corynebacterium haemolyticum), is a facultative aerobic gram-positive rod first isolated from U. S. servicemen and indigenous populations of the South Pacific in 1946. Early reported cases detailed A. haemolyticum as a causative pathogen for exudative pharyngitis (most commonly in adolescents) and cutaneous <b>infections.</b> A. <b>haemolyticum</b> <b>infections</b> can be separated epidemiologically into 2 distinct subsets: healthy adolescents presenting with upper respiratory tract infections and immunocompromised patients presenting with more serious systemic infections. The organism has been identified in severe infections including vertebral osteomyelitis, endocarditis, sepsis, brain abscess, and Lemierre’s disease. Osteomyelitis caused by A. haemolyticum has been described in less than five cases in the literature. It is often overlooked or misdiagnosed due to its slow growth and features similar to other pathogens. Initial microbiology often shows mixed flora, including gram-positive rods and diphtheroid bacilli, which are part of the normal flora of the skin. A. haemolyticum’s distinct colony features are typically only seen after 72 hours of incubation. Case Presentation: A 30 -year-old Caucasian man with a history of peripheral neuropathy, diabetic foot ulcers, methicillin-resistant S. aureus osteomyelitis and amputation of the left second distal phalanx presented with a malodorous and painful plantar ulcer. •Vital signs were within normal limits. •Physical exam showed erythematous, edematous distal left foot and 3 cm x 0. 5 cm x 2 mm plantar ulcer with necrotic tissue and serosanguinous drainage (Fig 1). •Labs revealed no leukocytosis, but elevated inflammatory markers. •Left foot X-ray showed previous amputation of 2 nd distal phalanx, soft tissue swelling and indistinctness of the cortex of the 3 rd distal phalanx, consistent with osteomyelitis (Fig 2).
