500|$|The group {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia by May 1, where Walden was {{establishing}} Capricorn Records. Mike Callahan and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell became the band’s early crew members. [...] "Red Dog" [...] was a disabled Vietnam veteran who donated his monthly disability checks to the band's cause. In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which {{became known as}} the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie <b>Crash</b> <b>Pad.</b> [...] "There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie <b>Crash</b> <b>Pad</b> and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning, but they all just moved out," [...] said Trucks. [...] Living meagerly, they found a friend in [...] "Mama Louise" [...] Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds, early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side. The band's image was radical in the just barely integrated Macon: [...] "A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long-haired boys, or of them always having a black guy with them," [...] said Hudson. The band performed locally, as well as 80 miles north in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day.|$|E
500|$|He next {{starred in}} Pineapple Express (2008), a stoner comedy co-starring and co-written by Seth Rogen and {{produced}} by Judd Apatow. Of Franco's character, Apatow said, [...] "You tell him, 'Okay, you're {{going to play}} a pot dealer', and he comes back with a three-dimensional character you totally believe exists. He takes it very seriously, even when it's comedy". In her New York Times review, critic Manohla Dargis wrote: [...] "He's delightful as Saul, loosey-goosey and goofy yet irrepressibly sexy, despite that greasy curtain of hair and a <b>crash</b> <b>pad</b> with a zero WAF (Woman Acceptance Factor). It's an unshowy, generous performance and it greatly humanizes a movie that, as it shifts genre gears and cranks up the noise, becomes disappointingly sober and self-serious". His performance earned him a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. He has stated in some interviews that he no longer uses cannabis (although he has occasionally alluded to smoking it, most notably during an extended segment on The Colbert Report). He was awarded High Times magazine's Stoner of the Year Award for his work in Pineapple Express. In 2008 he also appeared in two films by American artist Carter, exhibited at the Yvon Lambert gallery in Paris. On September 20, 2008, he hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL), and a second time on December 19, 2009.|$|E

In 2016 it was manufacturing wide range of climbing equipment, including: spring-loaded camming devices, climbing nuts and hexcentrics, belay devices, portaledges, harnesses, carabiners, slings, helmets, haul bags, <b>crash</b> <b>pads,</b> and artificial climbing holds.|$|R
25|$|The Dr.I {{suffered}} other deficiencies. The pilot's {{view was}} poor during takeoff and landing. The cockpit was cramped and furnished with materials of inferior quality. Furthermore, {{the proximity of}} the gun butts to the cockpit, combined with inadequate <b>crash</b> <b>padding,</b> left the pilot vulnerable to serious head injury {{in the event of a}} crash landing.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was updated {{to move with}} the times. There was now an all-anti-dazzle-black interior (including black instrument dial bezels instead of the previous chrome versions).

5|$|To prevent injuries, boulderers {{position}} <b>crash</b> <b>pads</b> {{near the}} boulder {{to provide a}} softer landing, {{as well as one}} or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures, and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact.|$|R
50|$|As a teenager, Styrene was {{a hippie}} but also trained in opera. At age 15, {{she ran away}} from home with £3 in her pocket, and hitchhiked from one music festival to another, staying at hippie <b>crash</b> <b>pads.</b> Thinking of this as a {{challenge}} to survive, her adventure ended when she stepped on a rusty nail while bathing in a stream and had to be treated for septicaemia.|$|R
500|$|Unlike other {{climbing}} sports, bouldering can {{be performed}} safely and effectively with very little equipment, an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing to many climbers. Bouldering pioneer John Sherman asserted that [...] "The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders". Others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag as the bare minimum, while more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of shoes, chalk, brushes, <b>crash</b> <b>pads,</b> and a skincare kit.|$|R

50|$|A punk {{house is}} a {{dwelling}} occupied {{by members of the}} punk subculture. Punk houses are similar to the hippie <b>crash</b> <b>pads</b> of the 1960s and the slan shacks of science fiction fandom. The Factory, an alternative living space founded by Andy Warhol as the home base of The Velvet Underground, is directly linked to the formation of punk rock in New York City. In the early 1980s, a few punk gangs developed around allegiance to certain punk houses.|$|R
5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} chalk {{on their}} hands to absorb sweat. It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. <b>Crash</b> <b>pads,</b> also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|R
50|$|Herko was {{associated}} with a group of habitués to Warhol’s Silver Factory on 47th Street including Ondine, Rotten Rita, and Billy Name. Nicknamed “mole people” on account of their intensive speed usage and subterranean habits — “mole because they were known to be tunneling towards some greater insanity that no one but this inner circle was aware of” — members of this group performed their manias and drug routines in a life/art blurring spectacle in <b>crash</b> <b>pads</b> and stages throughout the city. They are best remembered for their roles in many of Warhol's experimental films.|$|R

5000|$|The rapid {{influx of}} people {{flooding}} the area created an immediate {{need for some}} services that Al had not originally considered.

This program proved so popular that Al's office (living room) was changed to the [...] "We will help you {{find a place to}} stay" [...] room. Al moved his office to a tiny room next to the kitchen. The Switchboard attracted additional volunteers Ron Small and Ken Englander to assist with the many tasks the Switchboard wanted to accomplish.|$|R
5000|$|The feral {{movement}} is {{strongly associated with}} radical environmentalism and a communal lifestyle, with many members residing on multiple occupancy properties. In common with the hippies before them, {{many members of the}} feral movement rely on a system of <b>crash</b> <b>pads,</b> squats, and extended networks of [...] "friends of friends" [...] throughout Australia to travel with a minimum of financial outlay. [...] Although the itinerant lifestyle and environmental beliefs most associated with the feral movement are akin to those of the earlier hippie movement, the ferals adopted a confrontational, politically charged style of dress, music, and philosophy more often associated with the punk movement.|$|R

50|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down <b>crash</b> <b>pads.</b> Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|R
50|$|The off-ramp for Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island {{is unusual}} {{in that it is}} on the {{left-hand}} side in the eastbound direction. This off ramp presents an unusual hazard - drivers must slow within the normal traffic flow and move into a very short off-ramp that ends in a short radius turn left turn (a 15 MPH advisory is posted). The turn has been further narrowed from its original design by the installation of <b>crash</b> <b>pads</b> on the island side. Eastbound and westbound on-ramps are on the usual right-hand side, but they do not have dedicated merge lanes; drivers must await a gap in the traffic and then accelerate from a stop sign to traffic speeds in a short distance.|$|R
25|$|The Panorama Elite II range {{built on}} the success of the Panorama I and Panorama Elite. The front grill was squared up {{although}} it still used the same twin headlight layout. The first bay on the near side was tidied up so the top of the window was in line with all the other side windows. Parcel racks were redesigned so the supply of fresh air and light output was more readily available. The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximize on headroom when leaving the seats. <b>Crash</b> <b>padding</b> was provided along the inner side of the racks in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range.|$|R

5000|$|Roller Derby: Players {{compete in}} an oval [...] "roller derby" [...] rink, and each player has to race 10 laps around the rink, using roller skates. The {{challenge}} is played in separate heats for each gender — two 4-player heats for the men, and three 3-player heats for the women. When host T. J. Lavin sounds the horn, each player races on their own, competing against opposing players, and can eliminate an opponent {{out of the}} action zones by launching their opponents over the <b>crash</b> <b>pads</b> outside the railings. If a player is knocked off the track {{on the inside of}} the course, that player has three seconds to get back on the action zone, or he/she will be disqualified. A player is also disqualified if he/she clings onto the railing. The winners of each heat advance to the final round, in which the last player standing wins.|$|R
5000|$|Weaver's Week likened {{what they}} saw of it to a [...] "cruder" [...] Total Wipeout, {{mourning}} {{the lack of a}} character in the judges as [...] "anonymous monitors blowing a whistle. We may have to withdraw our critique of Uriah Rennie on Freeze Out: the [...] "Ice Judge"'s studied lack-of-character was, itself, a character". They also noted that the show had [...] "spent no money on its set dressing, just enough <b>crash</b> <b>pads</b> and mud and water to make it safe for the players. Nor has the programme spent much money on its challenges. They feel like the sort of thing an ambitious village carnival might do". They didn't finish the review; it initially halted after Weaver mistakenly perceived the commentators to be using [...] "blatant sexism", although after being contacted by The Rubberbandits, they amended the story to say that they had misheard and misinterpreted what had been said.|$|R

This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down <b>crash</b> <b>pads.</b> Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|R
