Few data are available on the content of gossypol in the commercial <b>complementary</b> <b>feed</b> and in feed raw materials. The present study was focused on the investigation of the presence of free gossypol in commercial <b>complementary</b> <b>feed</b> not containing cotton. A total of 50 samples of commercial <b>complementary</b> <b>feed</b> for dairy cows were performed in 29 feed mills both using and not using cotton as feed material. The free gossypol contamination resulted under the detection limit of the technique (4 mg/kg) in 12 out of 50 samples analysed and ranged from 4 to 20 mg/kg in 28 samples. In 10 samples the level of free gossypol ranged from 20 to 29. 5 mg/kg. Average contamination of samples was 12. 2 ± 9. 2 SD mg/kg. No significant difference (P= 0. 571) was shown in free gossypol concentration between feed produced in cotton free plants and in plants where cotton is used as feed material. Free gossypol content detected in the present study allows considering <b>complementary</b> <b>feed</b> for dairy cows not at risk. On the other hand, the detection of free gossypol in cotton free <b>complementary</b> <b>feed,</b> probably attributable to cross contamination of feed materials upstream of the feed mill, should be further investigated...|$|E

Therefore, this study aimed to assess timely initiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> and associated factors among mothers with children aged 6 – 23 months in Lalibela District. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 01 to April 29, 2015. Four hundred twenty-one mother-child pairs were selected by the systematic random sampling technique. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with timely initiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> The Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with a 95  % Confidence Interval (CI) was computed to assess the strength of association, and variables with a P-value of < 0. 05 were considered as statistically significant in the multivariable analysis.

40|$|The {{market for}} poultry {{products}} (egg and meat) is growing worldwide owing {{also to the}} absence of cultural or religious obstacles. Dietary protein sources represent the primary production costs. Soybean meal is the most used protein source in the diet formulations for broilers and laying hens. However due to its ever-increasing price, the sustainability of this production chain is becoming critical, in particular in some developing countries. Therefore, alternative feed protein sources, locally available and sustainable are required. The use of insects as an alternative source of protein in animal feeding is becoming globally more appealing, especially for its sustainability. In addition, insects (adult, larval and pupal form) are consumed naturally by wild birds and free-range poultry. The rural poultry farming in the economy and food security of developing countries has been momentous. Studies have shown the feasibility of using insects as an alternative feed source or as <b>complementary</b> <b>feed</b> source for poultry. Grasshoppers, darkling beetle, crickets, cockroaches, termites, lice, stink bugs, cicadas, aphids, scale insects, psyllids, beetles, caterpillars, flies, fleas, bees, wasps and ants have all been used as complementary food sources for poultry. Soybean or fish meal in broiler chicken or laying hen diets have been successfully replaced at low inclusion levels by black soldier flies (Hermetia illucens), housefly (Musca domestica), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) and silkworm (Bombix mori) pupae.

A recursive econometric model was employed using detailed household level survey data of production, income and consumption, nutrition, and health. Results show that market-oriented technologies are significant determinants of income. The size of the cultivated area, herd size, and purchased inputs are positively and strongly associated {{with the level of}} per capita income. Predicted income has a positive and significant influence on expenditures of food and non-food items. Price of food, however, has a negative and significant impact on expenditures. Results also indicate that womensâ€™ knowledge, expenditure on food, and price of nutrients are important determinants of nutrient intakes. The analysis of the factors affecting the health status revealed that womensâ€™ practice and knowledge, and age of the mother and female headship are important determinants of the weight-for-age and weight for height scores. Also, participation in village level health programs has a significant effect (at 10 % level) on the weight for height. The policy implications resulting from this study clearly indicate that strategies that promote market-oriented smallholder dairy can improve food security as it contributes to an increased per capita income, thereby increasing per capita expenditure on food and non-food items. This increase in turn, positively affects the intake of nutrients. Therefore, to improve health, it is useful to focus on the role of woman in the household...|$|E

EFSA was requested to re-evaluate Provita LE when used with calves for rearing up to four months {{in the range of}} 1 × 109 to 5 x 109 CFU/kg feedingstuffs. The identity of both strains has been established and no resistance to clinically relevant antibiotic detected. L. rhamnosus satisfies the requirements for the qualified presumption of safety approach to safety assessment, and is presumed safe for the target animals, consumers and the environment. Safety of the complete additive for the target species at the proposed dose range was demonstrated in a tolerance study in which no adverse effects were seen when a 100 -fold overdose of the additive was administered to calves. The enterococcal strain was shown not to contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and does not raise additional safety concerns. Since no other sources of concern were identified, Provita LE is considered safe for consumers. No data on skin/respiratory sensitisation were provided. In the absence of data, the potential of the additive to be a skin/respiratory sensitiser cannot be excluded. The dustiness of the additive tested indicated a potential for users to be exposed via inhalation. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the additive should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly.

40|$|Introduction: To prevent mother-to-child {{transmission}} (MTCT) of HIV in developing countries, new World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend maternal combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) during pregnancy, throughout breastfeeding for 1 {{year and then}} cessation of breastfeeding (COB). The efficacy of this approach {{during the first six}} months of exclusive breastfeeding has been demonstrated, but the efficacy of this approach beyond six months is not well documented. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study of 279 HIV-positive mothers was started on zidovudine/ 3 TC and lopinavir/ritonavir tablets between 14 and 30 weeks gestation and continued indefinitely thereafter. Women were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed for six months, <b>complementary</b> <b>feed</b> for the next six months and then cease breastfeeding between 12 and 13 months. Infants were followed for transmission to 18 months and for survival to 24 months. Text message reminders and stipends for food and transport were utilized to encourage adherence and follow-up. Results: Total MTCT was 9 of 219 live born infants (4. 1 %; confidence interval (CI) 2. 2 – 7. 6 %). All breastfeeding transmissions that could be timed (5 / 5) occurred after six months of age. All mothers who transmitted after six months had a six-month plasma viral load > 1, 000 copies/ml (p< 0. 001). Poor adherence to cART as noted by missed dispensary visits was associated with transmission (p= 0. 04). Infant mortality was lower after six months of age than during {{the first six months of}} life (p= 0. 02). The cumulative rate of infant HIV infection or death at 18 months was 29 / 226 (12. 8 % 95 CI: 7. 5 – 20. 8 %). Conclusions: Maternal cART may limit MTCT of HIV to the UNAIDS target of < 5 % for eradication of paediatric HIV within the context of a clinical study, but poor adherence to cART and follow-up can limit the benefit. Continued breastfeeding can prevent the rise in infant mortality after six months seen in previous studies, which encouraged early COB...|$|E
40|$|Background: More {{than one-third}} of deaths during {{the first five years}} of life are {{attributed}} to undernutrition, which are mostly preventable through economic development and public health measures. To alleviate this problem, it is necessary to determine the nature, magnitude and determinants of undernutrition. However, there is lack of evidence in agro-pastoralist communities like Bule Hora district. Therefore, this study assessed magnitude and factors associated with undernutrition in children who are 6 - 59 months of age in agro-pastoral community of Bule Hora District, South Ethiopia. Methods: A community based cross-sectional study design was used to assess the magnitude and factors associated with undernutrition in children between 6 - 59 months. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 796 children paired with their mothers. Anthropometric measurements and determinant factors were collected. SPSS version 16. 0 statistical software was used for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated to nutritional status of the children Statistical association was declared significant if p-value was less than 0. 05. Results: Among study participants, 47. 6 %, 29. 2 % and 13. 4 % of them were stunted, underweight, and wasted respectively. Presence of diarrhea in the past two weeks, male sex, uneducated fathers and > 4 children ever born to a mother were significantly associated with being underweight. Presence of diarrhea in the past two weeks, male sex and pre-lacteal feeding were significantly associated with stunting. Similarly, presence of diarrhea in the past two weeks, age at <b>complementary</b> <b>feed</b> was started and not using family planning methods were associated to wasting. Conclusion: Undernutrition is very common in under-five children of Bule Hora district. Factors associated to nutritional status of children in agro-pastoralist are similar to the agrarian community. Diarrheal morbidity was associated with all forms of Protein energy malnutrition. Family planning utilization decreases the risk of stunting and underweight. Feeding practices (pre-lacteal feeding and complementary feeding practice) were also related to undernutrition.

Members of households with crossbred cows on average consumed 17 percent more calories, 24 percent more fat and 13 percent more protein than members of dairy households with no improved cows. The households with crossbred cows spent about 7 percent more on food purchases, and, in addition, they allocated more land to growing high-protein pulses and consumed about 30 percent as much pulses. The hypothesis that increased marketing activity would lead to less milk available for home consumption is rejected. Milk consumption in households with crossbred cows was found to be more than double that in households with local cows, especially benefiting children. Other studies in other areas have Reported that as cash crops are introduced in smallholder production systems, with greater integration into the market women may lose control over cash income to men, who tend to spend less on food for the household. These results indicate that women in households with improved crossbred cows maintain control over income allocated for food purchases and make over 80 percent of household expenditures on food. Furthermore, the men in these households spend some 28 percent more on food than men in households with no crossbred cows. The anthropometric data collected by EHNRI point {{to the fact that the}} introduciton of crossbred cows could significantly improve human nutrition and health. By the end of the study, stunting of children (height for age) was found to be less than half as prevalent in households with crossbred cows (20 percent) as in those households with local cows (43 percent). Results of this study show that food-based intervention can have a significant positive impact on human nutrition and health status...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> is a {{supplementary}} food {{given to}} babies after age 6 months to 24 {{months of age}} {{in order to meet}} the nutritional needs in addition to breast milk. However, <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> which is not under WHO standard become one of the causes of the increasing prevalence of malnutrition in children aged 12 - 24 months in the world and in Indonesia. The incidence of malnutrition at Lesung Batu Puskesmas, Empat Lawang is still quite high at 18 %. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship giving <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> with the incidence of nutritional status in the region. Method: This study used case control design. Sampling based on inclusion and exclusion criteria to the number of samples was 80 consisting of 40 cases and 40 controls. Data was taken from data register cases of malnutrition primer using questionnaires and anthropometric measurements of children nutritional status and using neighborhood controls. The data was analyzed by univariate, bivariate chi square. Result: Hypothesis test results indicated that the nutritional status of children associated with the frequency of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> (p value< 0. 0001; OR 6. 6), and history of infectious disease (p value 0, 04; OR 3). Meanwhile, the age of first administration of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding,</b> the texture of foods, the variation of foods and a portion of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> were not associated with nutritional status children aged 12 - 24 months. Conclusion: Advice can be given that mothers who have children 6 - 24 months should give more attention to the provision of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> in accordance with the recommended WHO through counseling, information, education and communication related nutrition and <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> practices of infants and children...|$|R
