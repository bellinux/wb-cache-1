5|$|Macdonald was a {{classical}} liberal in the 19th-century tradition of John Stuart Mill. He believed in individual freedom and responsibility and {{feared that the}} growth of government bureaucracy would threaten liberty. For him, {{the role of the}} state was to provide basic services. He supported public ownership of utilities like the Nova Scotia Power Commission, but rejected <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> interventionist policies such as government ownership of key industries or big loans to private companies.|$|E
5|$|During the 1890s Saint-Saëns {{spent much}} time on holiday, {{travelling}} overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before. A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893. He wrote one opera, the comedy Phryné (1893), and together with Paul Dukas helped to complete Frédégonde (1895) an opera left unfinished by Ernest Guiraud, who died in 1892. Phryné was well received, and prompted <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring grand opera. His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement fantasia Africa (1891) and his Fifth ("Egyptian") Piano Concerto, which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846. Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support.|$|E

25|$|Meretz is {{also one}} of the more left-wing parties in terms of {{economic}} policy. The party seeks to create a welfare state with broad-reaching social services that are effectively regulated and monitored.

25|$|The Clinton {{health care}} plan remains the most {{prominent}} national proposal associated with Hillary Clinton and may have influenced her prospects in the 2008 presidential election. There are some similarities between Clinton's plan and Republican Mitt Romney's {{health care plan}}, which has been implemented in Massachusetts, though Romney has since distanced himself from Clinton on the issue, in particular arguing that his plan <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> control {{at the state level}} and the private market, not from the federal government.|$|E
25|$|Decomposition of Navarrese Carlism {{continued}} in the late 1940s, demonstrated by the Pamplona riots of 1945, pro-Juanist stance of El Pensamiento Navarro and different factions competing for local administrative posts. The new Junta Regional appointed by Fal in 1947 and headed by Mariano Lumbier failed to produce any change and Carlism lost its grip even on the Pamplona council. Among overall disarray and increasing <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> active attitude of the claimant, in 1951 Don Javier appointed a new Junta Regional, with Joaquín Baleztena regaining the Navarrese presidency.|$|E

25|$|Families who {{say they}} have run out of {{pharmaceutical}} options have moved to Colorado to access Charlotte's Web. The demand has spurred <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> research to determine whether these products actually do what is claimed. Amy Brooks-Kayal, vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, stated that epileptic seizures may come and go without any obvious explanation, and that Charlotte's web could cause developmental harm. She recommended that parents relocate so that their affected children could have access to one of the nation's top pediatric epilepsy centers rather than move to Colorado.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} {{resulted in}} <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> gun control measures. In 2000 {{federal and state}} legislation was introduced that would require safety locks on firearms as well as ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition magazines. Though laws were passed that made {{it a crime to}} buy guns for criminals and minors, there was considerable controversy over legislation pertaining to background checks at gun shows. There was concern in the gun lobby over restrictions on Second Amendment rights in the US. In 2001, K-Mart, which had sold ammunition to the shooters, announced it would no longer sell handgun ammunition. This action was encouraged by the award-winning 2002 documentary Bowling for Columbine, written and directed by Michael Moore.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> bank holidays. Among {{the most notable}} dates absent from the {{existing}} list are the feast days of patron saints; 23 April (St George's Day and {{widely regarded as the}} birthday of William Shakespeare) in England and 1 March (St David's Day) in Wales are not currently recognised. 17 March (St Patrick's Day) is a public holiday in Northern Ireland and, since 2008, 30 November (St Andrew's Day) is a bank holiday in Scotland. St Piran's Day (patron saint of Cornwall) on 5 March is already given as an unofficial day off to many government and other workers in the county, and there are renewed calls for the government to recognise this as an official bank holiday there.|$|E

25|$|The Jordanian Brotherhood {{has formed}} its own {{political}} party, the Islamic Action Front. In 1989 {{they become the}} largest group in parliament, with 23 out of 80 seats, and 9 other Islamist allies. A Brother {{was elected president of}} the National Assembly and the cabinet formed in January 1991 included several MBs. Its radicalization which <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> militant support for Hamas in Palestine has come into direct conflict with its involvement in the parliament and overall political process. The Brotherhood claimed its acceptance of democracy and the democratic process but only within their own groups. There is a high degree of dissent amongst Brotherhood leaders who do not share the same values therefore undermining its acceptance and commitment to democracy.|$|E
25|$|Derivatives of the {{standard}} blue uniform (collectively called the no.3 uniform) was adopted for specialized forces and for all officers in various occasions which <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> formal or casual attire. The Traffic Police Department was among the few {{to move away from}} the all-blue attire, adopting a short-sleeved white tunic, dark blue breeches, a black leather Sam Browne belt, and riding boots for its officers performing mobile squad duties. A white crash helmet is worn when on the move, while a new dark blue jockey cap with chequered white and dark blue patterns around its circumference is worn when convenient while performing static duty. Members of the Vigilante Corps are also attired by a white short-sleeved top similar in design to the dark blue version for normal officers, gold-coloured buttons and badges, and a dark blue beret in place of the peak cap.|$|E
25|$|After {{fermentation}} {{the grapes}} are then aged in small oak barrels. In many DOC regions, the wines {{are required to}} age for at least 3 years {{though it is not}} uncommon for producers to age their wines for 5 to 10 years. Traditionally the barrels were made of chestnut instead of oak, which contributed high amounts of wood tannins and was very porous which promoted excessive evaporation in the barrel. Under this same traditional style of winemaking, a large ullage or air space would emerge in the barrel and oxidation took place. This gave the wine its characteristic amber but also flavours and traits that may be characterised as wine faults. Towards the end of the 20th century, more produces began switching to oak barrels while maintaining the tradition of not topping up the barrels and filling in the ullage space. This angel's share still produces some level of oxidation, though not as severe as the style was historically made. Modern winemaking technique also <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> temperature control and keeping the wine in rooms with a consistent temperature that promotes more fresh flavours in the wine and fewer faults.|$|E
