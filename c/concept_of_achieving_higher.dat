40|$|The use of spectrographs with telescopes having {{high order}} {{adaptive}} optics (AO) systems offers the possibility <b>of</b> <b>achieving</b> near diffraction-limited spectral resolution on ground-based telescopes, {{as well as}} important advantages for instrument design. The small stellar image diameters obtained with adaptively corrected systems allow high resolution without a large loss of light at the spectrograph entrance slit, as well as greater spectral coverage per exposure. The adaptively corrected echelle spectrograph (ACES), designed at Steward Observatory for a spectral resolution R 200, 000, couples the telescope pupil to the instrument with a 10 m diameter near single-mode optical fiber. Initial observations at the 2. 5 m telescope on Mt. Wilson validated the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>high</b> spectral resolution with an adaptively corrected telescope and fiber coupled spectrograph. However the transmission of multiple modes in the fiber lead to a wavelength-dependent variation in illumination that made flat fielding impossible. In this paper we describe instrument design improvements, the installation and testing of a new CCD detector, and testing aimed at understanding and eliminating the fiber-related transmission problems to permit science quality imaging...|$|R
5|$|As {{one of the}} {{earliest}} shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>achieving</b> a <b>high</b> score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers, in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.|$|R

[...] It also moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre, with its influence extending to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo and Call of Duty.|$|R
40|$|Yield {{improvement}} {{has always}} been an important objective for plant breeders although seed yield is a complex trait influenced by several component characters. The present paper reports the efforts made to develop lines of yellow sarson with some established morpho-phisiological characters contributing to seed yield. A spontaneous erectophyle multilocular siliqua mutant was first used to transfer this trait into improved breeding lines. Both multilocular and bilocular siliqua types were comparable in seed yield but bilocular types recorded significantly higher number of siliqua per plant while tetralocular types recorded significantly larger number of seeds per siliqua. Erectophyle siliqua orientation was then established to be more productive than other posture like pendant or horizontal. A spontaneous basal branching mutant was then used to transfer this trait into the breeding lines and incorporated lines produced more number of siliqua per plant through increase in number of branches. A spontaneous apetalous mutant was isolated and this trait was transferred to the elite breeding lines. Among different groups waxy multilocular apetalous groups recorded significantly higher seed yield per plant. Thus the long term research efforts established the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>achieving</b> a <b>high</b> yielding ideotype in yellow sarson through incorporation of some morpho-physical traits following classical breeding...|$|R
500|$|However, it was {{not until}} 1978's seminal Space Invaders, created by Nishikado at Japan's Taito Corporation, that the shooter genre became prolific. Space Invaders pitted the player against {{multiple}} enemies descending {{from the top of the}} screen at a constantly increasing rate of speed. The game used alien creatures inspired by The War of the Worlds (by H. G. Wells) because the developers were unable to render the movement of aircraft; in turn, the aliens replaced human enemies because of moral concerns (regarding the portrayal of killing humans) on the part of Taito Corporation. As with subsequent shoot 'em ups of the time, the game was set in space as the available technology only permitted a black background. The game also introduced the idea of giving the player a number of [...] "lives". Space Invaders was a massive commercial success, causing a coin shortage in Japan, and gaining mainstream popularity in America. It popularised a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player-controlled cannon's movement, and it was the first video game to popularise the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>achieving</b> a <b>high</b> score, being the first to save the player's score. The aliens of Space Invaders return fire at the protagonist, making them the first arcade game targets to do so. It set the template for the shoot 'em up genre, and has influenced most shooting games released since then.|$|R
