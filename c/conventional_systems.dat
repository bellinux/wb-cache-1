25|$|The air {{conditioning}} system on the new Insight has an expanded thermodynamic range compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>systems.</b> Unlike the separate low pressure and high pressure refrigerant pipes used in <b>conventional</b> <b>systems,</b> the Insight has its low pressure cold pipe enclosing the high pressure hot refrigerant pipe that allows the cold refrigerant on its {{way back to the}} engine bay to cool the warm refrigerant traveling to the cabin. A unique, spiral groove along the outside of the inner pipe increases the surface area and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer between the outer and inner tubes. This improves the thermal efficiency of the air-conditioning system and, as a result, less effort is required from the compressor, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.|$|E

500|$|Because the SABRE engine {{uses the}} {{atmosphere}} as reaction mass at low altitude, {{it will have}} a high specific impulse (around [...] for SABRE 4, or [...] for SABRE 3), and burn about one fifth of the propellant that would have been required by a conventional rocket.

While flying within the atmosphere, the use of wings to counteract gravity drag is more fuel-efficient than simply expelling propellant (as in a rocket), which again serves to reduce the total amount of propellant needed. The payload fraction would be significantly greater than normal rockets and the vehicle should be fully reusable, capable of performing in excess of 200 launches.|$|E
