2500|$|A second catholic parish {{was planned}} as the Uptown Catholic Parish {{to be located}} {{on the west side}} of Main Street between 7th and 8th streets in Dubuque.

[...] It is unclear to whom the parish would have been dedicated if it had been completed as planned. An early map of the city of Dubuque which included the church buildings of the local Christian denominations included the proposed church building as the Catholic Cathedral.|$|R

However, the saint's head was situated at Provins, which was brought over from Jerusalem by Henry I of Champagne, who built a church in this town to contain it. This still stands as the Saint Quiriace Collegiate <b>Church,</b> although <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> during the 12th century was never completed due to financial difficulties during the reign of Philippe le Bel.

George Mukkattukunnel for the erection of the church were unforgettable. The convenor of the <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> was Chacko Mathew Kollamparampil (Pappachan). Under the tenure of Fr. George Thachangaril, land was acquired for a cemetery and a big cemetery was constructed. The 150th Jubilee of the parish was also celebrated in 1937.|$|R

5000|$|In 1851, the {{creation}} of a joint benefice formally united St Leodegar's Church with St Stephen's Church in neighbouring North Mundham. In early 1885, church officials decided to demolish St Leodegar's Church and build a replacement. Work to knock down the old building started on 25 March 1885, and the site was cleared ready for the replacement to be erected. Arthur Blomfield was commissioned, perhaps because he had restored the church at North Mundham two years previously. A prolific church architect who worked extensively in Sussex—usually in the Gothic Revival style—this was one of about ten new churches he designed in the county: others include St Andrew's Church, Worthing, All Saints Church, Roffey, St Luke's Church, Queen's Park, Brighton, Christ Church, St Leonards-on-Sea, St John the Evangelist's Church, St Leonards-on-Sea and All Souls <b>Church,</b> Hastings. <b>Construction</b> <b>work</b> took about six months, and on 22 October 1885 the new building—also dedicated to St Leodegar—was consecrated by Bishop of Chichester Richard Durnford.

50|$|The exact date {{of a new}} <b>church</b> <b>construction</b> is unknown, but it is {{supposed}} to be between 1380 (fire of old church) and 1402 when there was a first written record. The first stage of <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> lasted probably until 1420. In this period the church was built as a five-nave basilica. The construction was done in a way that new cathedral was built around the original foundation. The south polygonal chevet of aisles were built as the first ones. This was followed by the south enclosure wall construction, the south portal and the west wall where first two levels of both towers were composed to floor plan of <b>church.</b> An advanced <b>construction</b> margin related to Silesian Gothic, which took part in the Franciscan <b>church</b> <b>construction</b> in the north part of town, was working at building of a new church. There exists a reference from 1411 about director Mikulas and about Sigismund´s master builder Peter from Budin.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth of the city and {{population}} increase, it became necessary {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century to build a larger church in the Belgrade quarter of Palilula. Frequent wars did not allow this until 1930 when a pair of Belgrade architects, the brothers Petar and Branko Krstić, both professors of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Architecture, designed the plans for the new St. Mark's Church. The present building of St. Mark's Church was built according to their drawings between 1931 and 1940. The eruption of World War II interrupted the full completion of the <b>church.</b> Only the <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> was finished. Divine service took place in the new church during the war in 1941 and after it until November 14, 1948 in the adapted narthex of the church. On that date the church was consecrated (by Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V) and the church opened for divine service. There were plans to decorate the whole interior with frescoes. The external walls are in two colors of natural materials in the Serbo-Byzantine style. The church bell tower is a part of the church itself on the west side.|$|R

50|$|Formerly, {{the site}} {{was that of a}} Old Lutheran place of worship. In 1897, the {{beginning}} of the <b>construction</b> of the <b>church</b> began. The <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> only took six months. The church was ceremonially blessed on October 10, 1897, and took the summons of St. Luke the Evangelist. During World War I, 29 Old Lutherans died - a memorial plaque has been set made in remembrance of them, {{on the wall of the}} church. After 1945, Brzeg became part of the Western and Recovered Territories, becoming again part of Poland. Up until 1952, the parish did not have permanent parish priest. Every two weeks, Priest Karol Jadwiszczok celebrated the liturgy and services in the Holy Trinity Church (Kościół Świętej Trójcy in Polish). When authorities ordered the church's deconstruction, the Lutherans started celebrating their services at the then vandalised Old Lutheran St. Luke's Church. The first permanent parish priest was Priest Stanisław Żwak, which already as a student helped out Priest Karol Jadwiszczok. After ordination, he became the leader of the denomination's parish in Brzeg and Kłodzko. He lived in Lewin Brzeski. Since 1999, the parish has been served by Priest Marian Niemiec from Opole. As of 2014, the parish has its own parish priest.|$|R
