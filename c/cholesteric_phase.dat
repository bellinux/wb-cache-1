5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This phase {{is often called}} the <b>cholesteric</b> <b>phase</b> because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E

How {{the microscopic}} DNA chirality is transferred into intermolecular twist in these mesophases {{and what is}} the role of chiral DNA-DNA electrostatic interactions is still not completely clear. In this paper, we first give an extended overview of experimental observations on DNA <b>cholesteric</b> <b>phases</b> and discuss the factors affecting their stability. Then, we consider the effects of steric and electrostatic interactions of grooved helical molecules on the sign of cholesteric twist. We present some theoretical results on the strength of DNA-DNA chiral electrostatic interactions, on DNA-DNA azimuthal correlations in <b>cholesteric</b> <b>phases,</b> on the value of DNA cholesteric pitch, and on the regions of existence of DNA chiral phases stabilized by electrostatic interactions. We suggest for instance that 146 bp long DNA fragments with stronger affinities for the nucleosome formation can form less chiral <b>cholesteric</b> <b>phases,</b> with a larger left-handed cholesteric pitch. Also, the value of left-handed pitch formed in assemblies of homologous DNA fragments is predicted to be smaller than that of randomly sequenced DNAs.

50|$|Tuning of {{the output}} {{wavelength}} {{is achieved by}} smoothly varying the helical pitch: as the winding changes, so does the length scale of the crystal. This in turn shifts the band edge and changes the optical path length in the lasing cavity. Applying a static electric field perpendicular to the dipole moment of the local nematic phase rotates the rod-like subunits in the hexagonal plane and reorders the chiral phase, winding or unwinding the helical pitch. Similarly, optical tuning of the output wavelength is available using laser light far from the pick-up frequency of the gain medium, with degree of rotation governed by intensity and the angle between the polarization of the incident light and the dipole moment. Reorientation is stable and reversible. The chiral pitch of a <b>cholesteric</b> <b>phase</b> tends to unwind with increasing temperature, with a disorder-order transition to the higher symmetry nematic phase at the high end. By applying a temperature gradient perpendicular to the direction of emission varying the location of stimulation, frequency may be selected across a continuous spectrum. Similarly, a quasi-continuous doping gradient yields multiple laser lines from different locations on the same sample. Spatial tuning may also be accomplished using a wedge cell. The boundary conditions of the narrower cell squeeze the helical pitch by requiring a particular orientation at the edge, with discrete jumps where the outer cells rotate to the next stable orientation; frequency variation between jumps is continuous.|$|E
