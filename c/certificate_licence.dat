40|$|In {{the paper}} we analyse Slovenia legal {{environment}} and conditions for public sector functioning {{in the area}} of non-financial services. We focus on comparing national le-gal framework specifics for public non-financial service activities in Slovenia {{as a part of the}} EU legal and operational environment. The specific conditions are the instru-ment of the regulation and determinate the restrictiveness (or openness) of the public service sectors. We would like to find out how the network of many legal acts and sub-acts influence on public service providers and which consequences on users (consumers) they have. First we define theoretically the types and specific features of services/service activi-ties together with the characteristics and properties of non-financial services. There is a specific definition of the concept of public services (public service activities) and pure public services. Moreover, we are interested in concessions in the field of public services as instru-ments of (quality) regulation of demand on the services market. These concessions are considered from the aspect of a historical overview of granting concessions, eco-nomic importance, regulation of this activity and the method of selecting concession-aires. We will compare various types of concessions and study their similarities and differ-ences. We will examine the arrangements provided for these activities by the legisla-tion of the Republic of Slovenia and recommendations (directives) of the European Commission in the field of public concessions. Later on other forms of public permit will subsequently be examined. This will be fol-lowed by a theoretical analysis of the importance of <b>licences</b> and <b>certificates</b> for the provision of services, the type and importance of <b>licences</b> (<b>certificates)</b> and <b>licences</b> under Slovenian legislation in the field of public services. The last part provides an analysis of legal requirements (restrictiveness) imposed by the laws of the Republic of Slovenia in the field of the provision of public services.
