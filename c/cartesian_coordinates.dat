5|$|Discovering the {{tertiary}} {{structure of a}} protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained {{in the form of}} <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinates</b> for each atom in the protein.|$|E

25|$|Because {{there are}} often many {{different}} possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures, {{it is important to}} understand how they are related. Such relations are described by coordinate transformations which give formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinates</b> (x,y) and polar coordinates (r,θ) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive x axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinates</b> is given by x=rcosθ and y=rsinθ.|$|E

30|$|Even {{though the}} input NetCDF files {{describe}} {{the depths of}} the boundary at the locations defined by the geographical coordinates, the FDM simulation model needs {{the depths of the}} boundary at grids in the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. Therefore, a coordinate transform is necessary to model seismic waves in the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. For this purpose, a coordinate transform based on a power-series expression of the Gauss–Krüger transform (Kawase 2011) is embedded in OpenSWPC. Users are requested to input the center of the simulation model in longitude and latitude for the coordinate transform, and the OpenSWPC automatically generates the velocity structure model in the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. Because the grid locations in a <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system are usually not identical to the grid locations of the input NetCDF files, a bicubic interpolation is applied to obtain the depth of the boundary.|$|R
