Another way people may experience <b>cyberphobia</b> is if they feel that they are incompetent, or that the new technology is not needed to advance in life, or that they feel that they lack skills for the new age of technology. Another way people may experience <b>cyberphobia</b> is if they feel like they are going to lose control, or the new technology will affect their status in life.|$|E

5000|$|Technophobia (from Greek τέχνη technē, [...] "art, skill, craft" [...] and φόβος phobos, [...] "fear") is {{the fear}} or dislike of {{advanced}} technology or complex devices, especially computers. Although there are numerous interpretations of technophobia, they seem to become more complex as technology continues to evolve. The term is generally used {{in the sense of}} an irrational fear, but others contend fears are justified. It is related to <b>cyberphobia</b> and is the opposite of technophilia. Dr. Larry Rosen, research psychologist, computer educator, and professor at the California State University suggests that there are three dominant subcategories of technophobes- the [...] "uncomfortable users", the [...] "cognitive computerphobes", and [...] "anxious computerphobes". First receiving widespread notice during the Industrial Revolution, technophobia has been observed to affect various societies and communities throughout the world. This has caused some groups to take stances against some modern technological developments in order to preserve their ideologies. In some of these cases, the new technologies conflict with established beliefs, such as the personal values of simplicity and modest lifestyles. Examples of technophobic ideas can be found in multiple forms of art, ranging from literary works such as Frankenstein to films like Metropolis. Many of these works portray the darker side of technology as perceived by the technophobic. As technologies become increasingly complex and difficult to understand, {{people are more likely to}} harbor anxieties relating to their use of modern technologies.|$|E
40|$|This project {{undertakes}} {{a critique}} and {{review of a}} decade (1990 - 2000) of available New Zealand literature to reveal {{the current state of}} Nursing lnformatics utilisation in nursing practice. Since the early 1990 s, nurses from diploma and baccalaureate nursing programs have been graduating with knowledge and skills in Nursing Informatics. Yet when scrutinising the two main nursing publications for New Zealand, it is surprising to note the scant publication of articles that pertain to this topic area of nursing. Why is this? Having taught Nursing lnformatics curricula over ten years, I now have concerns to voice. Is this an area of nursing that is seen as unimportant or irrelevant to the work nurses do in providing patient care? Are computers still the domain of the ward clerk and admissions personnel? Is <b>cyberphobia</b> still alive and well for nurses in practice? These are key considerations in reviewing the literature. Competencies as product of the 1989 Guidelines for Teaching Nursing lnformatics will be a key consideration in this discussion, including ways in which the articles may reflect the content or intent of the Nursing lnformatics curriculum as prescribed in these guidelines. This commentary enlightens readers as to how Nursing lnformatics has evolved in New Zealand nursing practice, situating its growth, or lack of, in the context of concurrent socio- political influences as well as conditions created by national and international nursing trends. It is significant however that due to the scope of this project, comments on specific Nursing lnformatics conferences held in New Zealand over the decade can not be addressed in any depth. This is an area that deserves further investigation. Several recommendations are discussed to guide the future direction of Nursing lnformatics for nursing education and practice in New Zealand...|$|E
