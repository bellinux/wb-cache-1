25|$|Ethylene/{{vinyl alcohol}} <b>copolymer</b> (EVOH) is (formally) a <b>copolymer</b> of PE and vinyl alcohol (ethenol), which is {{prepared}} by (partial) hydrolysis of ethylene-vinyl acetate <b>copolymer</b> (as vinyl alcohol {{itself is not}} stable). However, typically EVOH has a higher comonomer content than the VAC commonly used.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{copolymers}} have monomer residues arranged {{according to}} a statistical rule. A statistical <b>copolymer</b> in which the probability of finding {{a particular type of}} monomer residue at a particular point in the chain is independent of the types of surrounding monomer residue may be referred to as a truly random <b>copolymer</b> (structure 3). For example, the chain-growth <b>copolymer</b> of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate is random.|$|E
25|$|Alternating {{copolymers}} possess two regularly alternating monomer residues: n (structure 2 at right). An {{example is}} the equimolar <b>copolymer</b> of styrene and maleic anhydride formed by free-radical chain-growth polymerization. A step-growth <b>copolymer</b> such as Nylon 66 {{can also be considered}} a strictly alternating <b>copolymer</b> of diamine and diacid residues, but is often described as a homopolymer with the dimeric residue of one amine and one acid as a repeat unit.|$|E
50|$|Other special {{types of}} {{branched}} <b>copolymers</b> include star <b>copolymers,</b> brush <b>copolymers,</b> and comb <b>copolymers.</b> In gradient <b>copolymers</b> the monomer composition changes gradually along the chain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Copolymers</b> {{with other}} 2-alkyl-2-oxazolines and other {{monomers}} allow {{the preparation of}} random <b>copolymers</b> and block <b>copolymers.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{demonstrating the}} {{interest}} of gradient <b>copolymers</b> in supercritical CO 2 in comparison with block <b>copolymers.</b> Gradient <b>copolymers</b> exhibit a better solubility in supercritical CO 2 than block <b>copolymers,</b> as attested by cloud point data. The self-assembly of gradient and block <b>copolymers</b> in dense CO 2 has been characterized by Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and it is shown {{that it is not}} fundamentally modified when changing from block <b>copolymers</b> to gradient <b>copolymers.</b> Therefore, gradient <b>copolymers</b> are advantageous thanks to their easier synthesis and their solubility at lower pressure while maintaining a good ability for self-organization in dense CO 2...|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} general types of polypropylene: homopolymer, random <b>copolymer,</b> and block <b>copolymer.</b> The {{comonomer}} is typically used with ethylene. Ethylene-propylene rubber or EPDM added to polypropylene homopolymer increases its low temperature impact strength. Randomly polymerized ethylene monomer added to polypropylene homopolymer decreases the polymer crystallinity, lowers the melting point {{and makes the}} polymer more transparent.|$|E
25|$|If {{unsaturated}} esters are copolymerized with ethylene, {{either the}} alcohol moiety {{may be in}} the polymer backbone (as it is the case in ethylene-vinyl acetate <b>copolymer)</b> or of the acid moiety (e. g. in ethylene-ethyl acrylate <b>copolymer).</b> Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers are prepared similarly to LD-PE by high pressure polymerization. The proportion of comonomer has a decisive influence on the behaviour of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to copolymerization with alpha-olefins, ethylene {{can also be}} copolymerized {{with a wide range}} of other monomers and ionic composition that creates ionized free radicals. Common examples include vinyl acetate (the resulting product is ethylene-vinyl acetate <b>copolymer,</b> or EVA, widely used in athletic-shoe sole foams) and a variety of acrylates. Applications of acrylic <b>copolymer</b> include packaging and sporting goods, and superplasticizer, used for cement production.|$|E
5000|$|While {{there exist}} others (alternating <b>copolymers,</b> graft <b>copolymers,</b> and stereoblock <b>copolymers),</b> these three {{are more common}} in the {{scientific}} literature. [...] In addition, block <b>copolymers</b> can exist as many types, including triblock (A-B-A), alternating block (A-B-A-B-A-B), etc.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{reactive}} monomer, {{ethyl acrylate}} {{is used in}} homopolymers and <b>copolymers</b> with e.g. ethene, acrylic acid and its salts, amides and esters, methacrylates, acrylonitrile, maleic esters, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, styrene, butadiene and unsaturated polyesters. <b>Copolymers</b> of acrylic acid ethyl ester with ethene (EPA/ethylene-ethyl acrylate <b>copolymers)</b> are suitable as adhesives and polymer additives, just like ethene vinyl acetate <b>copolymers.</b> [...] <b>Copolymers</b> with acrylic acid increase the cleaning effect of liquid detergents, <b>copolymers</b> with methacrylic acid are used as gastric juices tablet covers (Eudragit®).|$|R
50|$|Block <b>copolymers</b> {{comprise}} {{two or more}} homopolymer subunits {{linked by}} covalent bonds (4). The union of the homopolymer subunits may require an intermediate non-repeating subunit, known as a junction block. Block <b>copolymers</b> {{with two or three}} distinct blocks are called diblock <b>copolymers</b> and triblock <b>copolymers,</b> respectively.|$|R
25|$|Monomers {{within a}} <b>copolymer</b> may be {{organized}} along the backbone {{in a variety}} of ways.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{copolymers}} {{are also}} used with styrene. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or ABS plastic is similar to HIPS: a <b>copolymer</b> of acrylonitrile and styrene, toughened with polybutadiene. Most electronics cases are made of this form of polystyrene, as are many sewer pipes. SAN is a <b>copolymer</b> of styrene with acrylonitrile, and SMA one with maleic anhydride. Styrene can be copolymerized with other monomers; for example, divinylbenzene {{can be used for}} cross-linking the polystyrene chains to give the polymer used in Solid phase peptide synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{amphiphilic}} block <b>copolymer</b> micelles {{display a}} similar behavior as surfactant micelles. These are generally called dynamic micelles and {{are characterized by}} the same relaxation processes assigned to surfactant exchange and micelle scission/recombination. Although the relaxation processes are the same between {{the two types of}} micelles, the kinetics of unimer exchange are very different. While in surfactant systems the unimers leave and join the micelles through a diffusion-controlled process, for copolymers the entry rate constant is slower than a diffusion controlled process. The rate of this process was found to be a decreasing power-law of the degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic block to the power 2/3. This difference is due to the coiling of the hydrophobic block of a <b>copolymer</b> exiting the core of a micelle.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the similar}} {{properties}} of gradient <b>copolymers</b> {{to that of}} block <b>copolymers,</b> they have been considered as a cost effective alternative in applications for other preexisting <b>copolymers.</b>|$|R
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of triblock <b>copolymers</b> as designed templates to synthesize nanoporous materials with various compositions. Asymmetric triblock <b>copolymers</b> have several advantages compared with symmetric triblock <b>copolymers</b> and diblock <b>copolymers,</b> because the presence of three distinct domains can provide more functional features to direct the resultant nanoporous materials. Here we clearly describe significant contributions of asymmetric triblock <b>copolymers,</b> especially polystyrene-block-poly(2 -vinylpyridine) -block-poly(ethylene oxide) (abbreviated as PS-b-P 2 VP-b-PEO) ...|$|R
25|$|Ethylene-ethyl {{acrylate}} <b>copolymers</b> behave {{similarly to}} ethylene-vinyl acetate <b>copolymers.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Copolymer</b> of {{ethylene}} and unsaturated carboxylic acids (such as acrylic acid) {{are characterized}} by good adhesion to different materials, by resistance to stress cracking and high flexibility. However, they are more sensitive to heat and oxidation than ethylene homopolymers. Ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers are used as adhesion promoters.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} {{differences}} in the building blocks, some block <b>copolymer</b> micelles behave like surfactant ones, while others don't. It is necessary therefore {{to make a distinction}} between the two situations. The former ones will belong to the dynamic micelles while the latter will be called kinetically frozen micelles.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} living radical {{polymerization}} techniques, RAFT allows chain extension of a polymer of one monomer {{with a second}} type of polymer to yield a block <b>copolymer.</b> In such a polymerisation, there is the additional challenge that the RAFT agent for the first monomer must also be suitable for the second monomer, making block copolymerisation of monomers of highly disparate character challenging.|$|E
30|$|The thermal {{behavior}} {{of all the}} <b>copolymers</b> was investigated by DMTA. The glass transition temperature of MAN <b>copolymers</b> with methacrylate monomers is {{higher than that of}} MAN <b>copolymers</b> with acrylate monomers since the α-methyl group in the main chain of methacrylate <b>copolymers</b> has reduced the flexibility of the polymer chains and increased Tg.|$|R
40|$|Copolymerization of two $AB_ 2 -$type {{monomers}} {{that incorporate}} spacer segments {{of similar lengths}} but different flexibility permitted, for the first time, the preparation {{of a range of}} hyperbranched <b>copolymers,</b> wherein the backbone rigidity was varied while maintaining similar branching densities. The <b>copolymers</b> were prepared via a recently developed melt transetherification methodology to yield moderately high molecular weight polymers, with molecular weights ranging from 20 000 to 50 000. $^ 1 H$ NMR spectroscopic studies revealed that the composition of the <b>copolymers</b> varied linearly with monomer composition, confirming the formation of truly random <b>copolymers.</b> Analogous linear <b>copolymers</b> based on suitably designed AB-type monomers, containing the same two spacers, were also prepared for comparison. Thermal analysis of these <b>copolymers</b> using DSC indicated that the $T_g's$ of both linear <b>copolymers</b> and hyperbranched <b>copolymers</b> varied with composition in a manner that was in complete accordance with the Fox equation, although all the linear <b>copolymers</b> exhibited significantly higher $T_g$ values than their hyperbranched counterparts. It is interesting that, despite their very different topology and the presence of large number of chain ends, hyperbranched <b>copolymers</b> exhibit a similar $T_g$ variation as their linear analogues. The generality of this observation in the broader context of hyperbranched <b>copolymers,</b> such as those possessing different branching densities and terminal functionalities, remains to be tested...|$|R
40|$|High—resolution NMR {{methods are}} {{extremely}} useful for microstructural analysis of ethylene <b>copolymers.</b> In {{the present study}} ethylene—vinyl alcohol (E—VOH) <b>copolymers</b> with an increasing content of ethylene were synthesized and the microstructure was investigated using 13 C NNR. The methylene sequence distributions in these <b>copolymers</b> were investigated. The occurence of anomalous linkages in E—VOH <b>copolymers</b> i. e. 1, 2 — and 1, 4 —diol structures were analyzed. The presence of 1, 4 —diol structures could readily be detected in all E—VOH <b>copolymers.</b> The 1, 2 —diol structure could be detected in E—VOH <b>copolymers</b> with a low content of ethylene...|$|R
25|$|Hydrophilic {{polymers}} for soft contact lenses. YTEC devised novel homopolymer and <b>copolymer</b> {{systems for}} soft contact lens preparations. A polymer system was formulated to exhibit {{a high degree}} of water containment in the swollen state and yet be sufficiently stable to form a precision lens to an individual prescription. YTEC developed a process to full production scale and commissioned the production facility on the client's premises.|$|E
25|$|Poly(styrene), for example, is {{composed}} only of styrene monomer residues, {{and is therefore}} classified as a homopolymer. Ethylene-vinyl acetate, on the other hand, contains more than one variety of repeat unit and is thus a <b>copolymer.</b> Some biological polymers are composed {{of a variety of}} different but structurally related monomer residues; for example, polynucleotides such as DNA are composed of four types of nucleotide subunits.|$|E
25|$|Most of the time, ‘artificial’ {{tissue is}} grown from the patient’s own cells. However, when {{the damage is}} so extreme that it is {{impossible}} to use the patient's own cells, artificial tissue cells are grown. The difficulty is in finding a scaffold that the cells can grow and organize on. The characteristics of the scaffold must be that it is biocompatible, cells can adhere to the scaffold, mechanically strong and biodegradable. One successful scaffold is a <b>copolymer</b> of lactic acid and glycolic acid.|$|E
40|$|Vinyl pyridines {{including}} vinyl stilbazole {{materials and}} vinyl styrylpyridine oligomer materials are disclosed. These vinylpyridines form <b>copolymers</b> with bismaleimides which <b>copolymers</b> have good fire retardancy and decreased brittleness. The cure temperatures of the <b>copolymers</b> are substantially below the cure temperatures of the bismaleimides alone. Reinforced composites {{made from the}} cured <b>copolymers</b> are disclosed as well...|$|R
50|$|Graft <b>copolymers</b> became widely studied due {{to their}} {{increased}} number of applications {{due to their}} unique structures relative to other <b>copolymers</b> such as alternating, periodic, statistical, and block <b>copolymers</b> which generally linear chains.|$|R
50|$|These {{addition}} fragmentation {{chain transfer}} agents do form graft <b>copolymers</b> with styrenic and acrylate species however {{they do so}} by first forming block <b>copolymers</b> and then incorporating these block <b>copolymers</b> into the main polymer backbone.|$|R
25|$|When block <b>copolymer</b> {{micelles}} don't {{display the}} characteristic relaxation processes of surfactant micelles, these are called kinetically frozen micelles. These {{can be achieved}} in two ways: when the unimers forming the micelles are not soluble in the solvent of the micelle solution, or if the core forming blocks are glassy at the temperature in which the micelles are found. Kinetically frozen micelles are formed when either of these conditions is met. A special example in which both of these conditions are valid is that of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide). This block <b>copolymer</b> {{is characterized by the}} high hydrophobicity of the core forming block, PS, which causes the unimers to be insoluble in water. Moreover, PS has a high glass transition temperature which is, depending on the molecular weight, higher than room temperature. Thanks to these two characteristics, a water solution of PS-PEO micelles of sufficiently high molecular weight can be considered kinetically frozen. This means that none of the relaxation processes, which would drive the micelle solution towards thermodynamic equilibrium, are possible. Pioneering work on these micelles was done by Adi Eisenberg. It was also shown how the lack of relaxation processes allowed great freedom in the possible morphologies formed. Moreover, the stability against dilution and vast range of morphologies of kinetically frozen micelles make them particularly interesting, for example, for the development of long circulating drug delivery nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|The {{butadiene}} industry {{originated in}} the {{years leading up to}} World War II. Many of the belligerent nations realized that in the event of war, they could be cut off from rubber plantations controlled by the British Empire, and sought to reduce their dependence on natural rubber. In 1929, Eduard Tschunker and Walter Bock, working for IG Farben in Germany, made a <b>copolymer</b> of styrene and butadiene {{that could be used in}} automobile tires. Worldwide production quickly ensued, with butadiene being produced from grain alcohol in the Soviet Union and the United States and from coal-derived acetylene in Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{polymers}} in the PLGA family include poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (glycolic acid) (PGA), {{and their}} <b>copolymer</b> poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). All three polymers {{have been approved}} by the Food and Drug Administration for employment in various devices. These polymers are brittle and they do not have regions for permissible chemical modification; in addition, they degrade by bulk rather than by surface, which is not a smooth and ideal degradation process. In an attempt to overcome the lack of functionalities, free amines have been incorporated into their structures from which peptides can be tethered to control cell attachment and behavior.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Different poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-{{hydroxyethyl methacrylate}}) <b>copolymers</b> (P(NIPAM-co-HEMA)) were {{synthesized}} from N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) comonomers by both radical and radiation polymerizations for comparison. PLLA-g-P(NIPAM-co-HEMA) graft <b>copolymers</b> were synthesized from L-lactide and respective P(NIPAM-co-HEMA) <b>copolymers</b> by ring opening polymerization. Both NMR and FTIR analyses demonstrated the PLLA chains have been grafted {{on to the}} P(NIPAM-co-HEMA) backbone. These graft <b>copolymers</b> revealed the cloud point temperature {{higher than that of}} PNIPAM homopolymer as determined by optical transmittance. The graft <b>copolymers</b> self-assembled into micelles with regularly spherical structures as observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM).

40|$|Hajime Yamonoue Polymerization of aniline with 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) {{in several}} molar ratios using {{ammonium}} persulfate yielded <b>copolymers</b> consisting of p-aminophenylene (unit A) and 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene- 2, 5 -diyl (unit B). The content of units A and B in the <b>copolymers</b> {{depended on the}} monomer feed ratio. Treatment of the <b>copolymers</b> with sodium hydride depro-tonated the NH groups to give polyanions. Subsequent treatment of these polyanions with 1, 3 -propanesultone yielded <b>copolymers</b> with sodium N-propylsulfonate side groups, which were converted into N-propylsulfonic acid moieties by treat-ment with diluted hydrochloric acid. The <b>copolymers</b> exhibited absorption peaks at approximately 330 and 650 nm, which can be ascribed, respectively, to the benzenoid – * and quinoid n– * transitions of unit A. The <b>copolymers</b> were subjected to electrochemical oxidation, which was dependent on the contents of units A and B. The electrical conductivity of <b>copolymers</b> withN-propylsulfonic acid side chainswas found tobehigher than that of <b>copolymers</b> bearing sodiumN-propylsulfonate groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{crystallinity}} {{development in}} heterogeneous ethylene- 1 -butene <b>copolymers</b> is {{compared with that}} in ethylene <b>copolymers,</b> with more bulky 1 -heptene as a comonomer. The thermal transitions of the 1 -heptene based <b>copolymers</b> persistently occur at higher temperatures than of the corresponding I-butene <b>copolymers.</b> The earlier crystallization onset is reflected in thicker primary crystals, which in turn {{are associated with the}} presence of longer ethylene sequences because of the inaccessibility of 1 -heptene to sterically shielded catalytic sites. In addition, the 1 -heptene based <b>copolymers</b> are characterized by a higher degree of primary crystallinity, whereas the 1 -butene <b>copolymers</b> exhibit more prominent secondary crystallization. The I-butene based <b>copolymers</b> thus have a less heterogeneous chemical composition distribution. At high comonomer contents, the highly heterogeneous nature of the 1 -heptene <b>copolymers</b> is emphasized by a more pronounced presence of low crystalline spherulite inclusions accomplished by the liquid-liquid phase separation of dissimilar polymeric chains before crystallization.
