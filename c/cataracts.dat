Recent findings Up to 75 % of blindness (visual acuity below 20 / 400) is due to <b>cataract.</b> <b>Cataract</b> remains the most common treatable cause of blindness. Reported <b>cataract</b> surgical coverage is low, and visual outcomes are poor and necessitate improvement. Phacoemulsification is the preferred technique for <b>cataract</b> surgery in developed countries, but large-scale implementation in developing countries may prove to be a challenge. An alternative surgical technique, manual sutureless small incision extracapsular <b>cataract</b> surgery, has been increasing in popularity, as the technique has been shown to yield similar surgical outcomes as phacoemulsification. Summary Treating <b>cataract</b> blindness worldwide continues to be a formidable challenge. Significant barriers include cost, lack of population awareness, shortage of trained personnel and poor surgical outcomes. Both phacoemulsification and manual small incision extracapsular <b>cataract</b> surgery achieve excellent visual outcomes with low complication rates, but manual small incision extracapsular <b>cataract</b> surgery is significantly faster, less expensive and requires less technology. Therefore, manual small incision extracapsular <b>cataract</b> surgery may be the preferred technique for <b>cataract</b> surgery in the developing world.

The questions tested their awareness about <b>cataract</b> and also about the potential ocular complications {{of the disease and}} the treatments available currently. Results: 65. 81 % (283 / 430) have heard about <b>cataract.</b> 50 students out of 283 students were aware about the basic facts about <b>cataract.</b> The rest 233 students have just heard of the term <b>cataract.</b> Overall only 11. 62 % (50 / 430) were aware about the basic facts about <b>cataract.</b> 34. 10 % (147 / 430) was not aware about <b>cataract.</b> Conclusions: The awareness of one of the leading cause of treatable blindness like <b>cataract</b> is low among students.
