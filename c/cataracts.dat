Recent findings Up to 75 % of blindness (visual acuity below 20 / 400) is due to <b>cataract.</b> <b>Cataract</b> remains the most common treatable cause of blindness. Reported <b>cataract</b> surgical coverage is low, and visual outcomes are poor and necessitate improvement. Phacoemulsification is the preferred technique for <b>cataract</b> surgery in developed countries, but large-scale implementation in developing countries may prove to be a challenge. An alternative surgical technique, manual sutureless small incision extracapsular <b>cataract</b> surgery, has been increasing in popularity, as the technique has been shown to yield similar surgical outcomes as phacoemulsification. Summary Treating <b>cataract</b> blindness worldwide continues to be a formidable challenge. Significant barriers include cost, lack of population awareness, shortage of trained personnel and poor surgical outcomes. Both phacoemulsification and manual small incision extracapsular <b>cataract</b> surgery achieve excellent visual outcomes with low complication rates, but manual small incision extracapsular <b>cataract</b> surgery is significantly faster, less expensive and requires less technology. Therefore, manual small incision extracapsular <b>cataract</b> surgery may be the preferred technique for <b>cataract</b> surgery in the developing world.

The questions tested their awareness about <b>cataract</b> and also about the potential ocular complications {{of the disease and}} the treatments available currently.
