5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton {{on the morning}} of December 26, 1776, Washington withdrew back to Pennsylvania. He subsequently decided to attack the British forces before going into winter quarters. On December 29, he led his army back into Trenton. On the night of January 2, 1777, Washington repulsed a British attack at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek. That night, he evacuated his position, <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> General Lord Cornwallis' army, and went to attack the British garrison at Princeton.|$|E
5|$|The radar {{contacts}} were, in fact, {{the approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> {{to the south}} of TF18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Auburn's Moon Ducote {{broke through the}} line toward the goal with {{blocking}} by Pete Bonner and William Donahue. After Guyon dove at Ducote and missed, Guyon gave chase and tackled him at the 26-yard line. For Auburn's only score Ducote <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> end for 17 yards and lateraled to Donahue, who ran down the sideline for a six-yard touchdown. Guyon was {{the star of the}} game, accounting for four touchdowns and having his best day passing. Strupper had touchdown runs of 62 and 50 yards. Auburn was considered a strong team, despite the lopsided score; Ducote and Bonner were the only non-Tech, unanimous All-Southern selections. Tech's starting lineup was Fincher (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Mathes (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Carpenter (right tackle), Bell (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Guill (fullback).|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{was anxious}} {{to learn about the}} {{condition}} of his family and property at Wappocomo; he also needed an additional change of clothing and a blanket. Accompanied by Lieutenant Blue and Adam Parrish, he traveled west along the Northwestern Turnpike to around Pleasant Dale, then followed a series of roads and paths until nighttime, when they reached Sugar Hollow two miles north of Romney. Parsons stayed behind in the hollow, while Blue and Parrish started out for Wappocomo to retrieve a set of Parsons' clothes. Knowing that the Union Army kept a 24-hour guard at the main house, Blue <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> {{to the rear of the}} mansion and knocked on the window of his uncle, Garrett W. Blue, who was residing with the Parsons family. Garrett Blue warned his nephew about the Union Army soldiers possibly stationed on the home's front porch, and he subsequently fetched Parsons' daughter, Kate, who provided Lt. Blue with a parcel for her father.|$|E

5|$|Team Canada {{responded to}} their {{previous}} defeat with strong {{play in this}} game. The first period was scoreless, but the Canadians used the period to intimidate the Soviets with hard body checking, especially from Cashman, Bergman, Peter Mahovlich and Parise, to throw the Soviets off their game. In the second period, the first goal of the match was again scored by Esposito, this time from a feed from his regular Bruins' linemate Cashman, who had retrieved the puck deep in the Soviets' zone after colliding with the Soviets' defenceman Vladimir Lutchenko. In the third period, Yvan Cournoyer wheeled around Alexander Ragulin and beat Tretiak. Yakushev got the Soviets on the board after teammate Yevgeni Zimin missed on a break-away. Lyapkin pounced on the rebound and fed it out front for Yakushev to bury the puck behind Esposito. Peter Mahovlich then scored a critical goal while Canada was short-handed, deking out the Soviet defender one-on-one, then Tretiak, to give Canada a two-goal lead. His brother Frank then finished the scoring on a feed from Mikita, who had <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> a Soviets' defenceman. Team Canada won the game 4–1 and tied the series.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on 9 August the {{regiment}} {{was behind the}} Auckland Mounted Rifles heading towards Abd. The brigade was to attack head on, {{while the rest of}} the division <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> to attack the flanks. At 05:30 the Aucklands were engaged by the Turkish defenders, so the 8th Squadron was sent forward on their left to assist, and immediately came under fire. To support them the 1st and 10th Squadrons moved up on the left. The 8th Squadron advanced and captured a ridge line facing east, followed soon after by the other squadrons occupying the high ground to the west of Abd. From there they could see the Turkish defences, which consisted of trenches and redoubts, supported by artillery that kept up a steady rate of fire on {{the regiment}}. At 06:00 the Turks left their trenches to counter-attack the regiment, but were stopped by small arms fire and the attached Somerset Battery Royal Horse Artillery. The regiment then moved downhill towards Abd, but were faced with heavy Turkish artillery fire, which by 10:30 had stopped the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades to their left. At noon a second Turkish counter-attack came in waves towards the regiment's lines. They managed to fight them off, with heavy casualties. By 14:00 the Turks were attacking all the division's brigades in strength. The 1st and 2nd Light Horse in the north and the 3rd in the south began to retire, leaving the New Zealanders' position exposed on the flanks. Only by keeping up a heavy rate of small arms and artillery fire did they hold off the enemy. At 17:30, the divisional commander Harry Chauvel called off the attack and ordered a withdrawal, but as the New Zealanders were in danger of being overrun the withdrawal was postponed until dark, with the regiment forming a rearguard. The battle cost the regiment nine dead, twenty-two wounded and six men missing in action.|$|E

25|$|On 18 December 1916, {{during an}} {{eastbound}} journey, Finland was halted by a French warship.

Two troops were sent to watch for the approach of Ottoman reinforcements; one troop to the north towards Khan Yunis and one to the east towards Shellal.|$|E

Alexander foresaw this and placed his cavalry, under the command of Coenus, opposite of them and out of sight. Their job was to break cover and follow the Indian cavalry, which forced the Indians to go forward, right into Craterus. Arrian states that 12,000 Indians and 80 elephants died in this mass pincer movement.|$|E
25|$|During Tahmasp' reign, {{he carried}} out {{multiple}} invasions in the Caucasus {{which had been}} incorporated in the Safavid empire since Shah Ismail I and for many centuries afterwards, and started with the trend of deporting and moving {{hundreds of thousands of}} Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians to Iran's heartlands. Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and minor other sections of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the Qizilbash, by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society. As Encyclopædia Iranica states, for Tahmãsp, the problem <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> the military tribal elite of the empire, the Qezelbāš, who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune, and material advancement. With this new Caucasian layer in Iranian society, the indisputed might of the Qizilbash (who functioned much like the ghazis of the neighboring Ottoman Empire) would be questioned and fully diminished as society would become fully meritocratic.|$|E

25|$|Pacthod's force {{departed}} from Vatry at dawn, having marched {{most of the}} night with the convoy. By 10:00 am Pacthod was in Villeseneux where he decided to rest his weary soldiers. At this time, the force came under attack from 1,200 dragoons and horse chasseurs supported by 12 guns under Fyodor Karlovich Korf. Pacthod anchored his right flank on Villeseneux while Amey's entire division in square formed his left flank and 16 French guns covered the front. Korff's cavalry corps belonged to Langeron's army corps. For 90 minutes, the French moved southwest deployed in six masses while easily fending off Korf's horsemen. At Clamanges Pacthod made the decision to abandon the convoy, taking the teams of horses to help haul his artillery pieces. More Russian cavalry arrived until Korf's force comprised 2,000 line cavalry and 1,000 Cossacks. Two horse chasseur regiments <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> to the west, blocking the French retreat toward Fère-Champenoise. One of Pacthod's brigades under Marie Joseph Raymond Delort formed attack columns and drove off the chasseurs. Between 2:00 and 3:00 pm the French reached Écury-le-Repos when more Allied cavalry came on the scene.|$|E
25|$|Like other Neolithic societies, the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture {{had very}} little {{division}} of labor, other than the ubiquitous dualistic division based upon a person's gender. Although this culture's settlements sometimes grew to become {{some of the largest}} on earth at the time (up to 15,000 people), there is no evidence yet discovered of large-scale labor specialization. Their settlements were designed with the houses connecting with one another in long rows that <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> the center of the community. Some settlements did have a central communal building that was designated as a sanctuary or shrine, but there is no indication yet whether or not a separate group or individual would have been supported by the community as a full-time priest or priestess. Almost every home was a self-supporting unit, much as if isolated {{in the middle of the}} woods, rather than part of a large settlement. Most homes had their own ceramic kilns, baking ovens, and work centers, indicating that almost all of the work that needed to be done to maintain human existence at the Neolithic standard of living could be done within each household in the community.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} the {{surrender}} of Japan on 15 August 1945, Lieutenant General Masao Baba as the supreme commander of Japanese military in northern Borneo surrendered at Layang-layang beach of Maeda-shima on 9 September 1945 where he was then brought to the headquarters of Australian 9th Division on the island to sign the surrender document in front the unit commander, Major General George Wootten. Earlier, Baba flew to the island with Tachikawa Ki-54 (Hickory) transport plane from Keningau whose small airstrip are not even known to the Allies. The plane <b>circled</b> <b>around</b> six to seven times before landing on the island before midday, which responded by around 2,000 RAAF personnel for a close inspection. Two language interpreters accompanied Baba along with his Chief-of-Staff Major General Kuroda. An Australian colonel then opening the plane door with its crews comes out and the huge crowds became silent. After {{being sent to the}} Australian headquarters, he was instructed by Wootten to surrender his sword and sign a surrender document, with the official surrender ceremony was held on the following day on 10 September at a place which become known as Surrender Point in the island. With the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army, the liberation mission was thus completed.|$|E
