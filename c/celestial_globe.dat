5|$|Mercator {{also added}} {{a feature of}} special value to seamen: from the {{numerous}} compass or wind roses he drew rhumb lines rather than great circles. The rhumb lines correspond to constant sailing directions but on the spherical globe they appear as spirals. The globe was manufactured in great numbers {{but it was never}} updated.

5|$|Molyneux's <b>celestial</b> <b>globe</b> was {{virtually}} {{a copy of}} Gerardus Mercator's globe of 1551, which itself {{was based on a}} globe of 1537 by Gemma Frisius that Mercator had helped to construct. To the constellations featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the Southern Cross and Southern Triangle, though somewhat to the west of their true positions. His source appears to have been Andrea Corsali's diagram of the Antarctic sky published in 1550.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed {{on the basis of}} his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the <b>celestial</b> <b>globe</b> from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
5|$|In Sanskrit, a {{well-known}} poem (Mahakavya) in 18 cantos called Vikramankadeva Charita by Kashmiri poet Bilhana recounts in epic style {{the life and}} achievements of his patron king Vikramaditya VI. The work narrates the episode of Vikramaditya VI's accession to the Chalukya throne after overthrowing his elder brother Someshvara II. The great Indian mathematician Bhāskara II (born c.1114) flourished during this time. From his own account in his famous work Siddhanta Siromani (c. 1150, comprising the Lilavati, Bijaganita on algebra, Goladhaya on the <b>celestial</b> <b>globe</b> and Grahaganita on planets) Bijjada Bida (modern Bijapur) was his native place.|$|E
5|$|Only six Molyneux globes {{are known}} to exist today, two {{terrestrial}} globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in Zerbst, Nuremberg (at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)) and Kassel (Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hesse Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but it {{is believed to have}} been destroyed during World War II.

5|$|The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were {{inherited}} {{from the collection of}} William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), a pioneer of astronomical research. William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the Fürstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, during the reign of Landgrave Frederick III. Only a <b>celestial</b> <b>globe</b> survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Tycho Brahe, also {{credited}} with Coma's designation as a constellation, included {{it in his}} 1602 star catalogue. Brahe recorded fourteen stars in the constellation; Johannes Hevelius increased its number to twenty-one, and John Flamsteed to forty-three. Coma Berenices also appeared in Johann Bayer's 1603 Uranometria, {{and a few other}} 17th-century celestial maps followed suit. Coma Berenices and the now-obsolete Antinous are considered the first post-Ptolemaic constellations depicted on a <b>celestial</b> <b>globe.</b> With Antinous, Coma Berenices exemplified a trend in astronomy in which globe- and map-makers continued to rely on the ancients for data. This trend ended {{at the turn of the}} 16th century with observations of the southern sky and the work of Tycho Brahe.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{navigator}} Amerigo Vespucci {{explored the}} New World {{at the beginning}} of the 16th century. He learnt to recognize the stars in the southern hemisphere and made a catalogue for his patron king Manuel I of Portugal, which is now lost. As well as the catalogue, Vespucci wrote descriptions of the southern stars, including a triangle which may be either Triangulum Australe or Apus. This was sent to his patron in Florence, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and published as Mundus Novus in 1504. The first depiction of the constellation was provided in 1589 by Flemish astronomer and clergyman Petrus Plancius on a -cm diameter <b>celestial</b> <b>globe</b> published in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographer Jacob Floris van Langren, where it was called Triangulus Antarcticus and incorrectly portrayed to the south of Argo Navis. His student Petrus Keyzer, along with Dutch explorer Frederick de Houtman, coined the name Den Zuyden Trianghel. Triangulum Australe was more accurately depicted in Johann Bayer's celestial atlas Uranometria in 1603, where it was also given its current name.|$|E

5|$|Newton's {{monument}} (1731) {{can be seen}} in Westminster Abbey, at {{the north}} of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent. The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a <b>celestial</b> <b>globe</b> showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism. The Latin inscription on the base translates as:Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25 December 1642, and died on 20 March 1726/7.—Translation from G.L.

25|$|Hipparchus {{was in the}} {{international}} news in 2005, when it was again proposed (as in 1898) that the data on the <b>celestial</b> <b>globe</b> of Hipparchus or in his star catalog may have been preserved in the only surviving large ancient <b>celestial</b> <b>globe</b> which depicts the constellations with moderate accuracy, the globe carried by the Farnese Atlas.

25|$|Late in {{his career}} (possibly about 135) Hipparchus {{compiled}} his star catalog, the original of which does not survive. He also constructed a <b>celestial</b> <b>globe</b> depicting the constellations, based on his observations. His interest in the fixed stars may {{have been inspired by}} the observation of a supernova (according to Pliny), or by his discovery of precession, according to Ptolemy, who says that Hipparchus could not reconcile his data with earlier observations made by Timocharis and Aristillus. For more information see Discovery of precession. In Raphael's painting The School of Athens, Hipparchus is depicted holding his <b>celestial</b> <b>globe,</b> as the representative figure for astronomy.|$|E

25|$|Volans is a {{constellation}} {{in the southern}} sky. It represents a flying fish; its name is a shortened form of its original name, Piscis Volans.

5|$|Several treatises were {{published}} {{to describe the}} Molyneux globes and provide guides on their use. Molyneux himself wrote a treatise, now lost, entitled The <b>Globes</b> <b>Celestial</b> and Terrestrial Set Forth in Plano, which Sanderson published in 1592. In the same year, Thomas Hood, a London-based mathematics lecturer who had written a 1590 work {{on the use of}} <b>celestial</b> <b>globes,</b> published The Vse of Both the Globes, Celestiall and Terrestriall. This was followed in 1594 by two works, one of which was Blundeville's book. The other, Tractatus de Globis et Eorum Usu (Treatise on Globes and their Use), was published by the mathematician Robert Hues. This work went into at least 13 printings and was translated from Latin into Dutch, English and French. In 1599, Edward Wright published Certaine Errors in Navigation, which included commentary {{on the use of the}} terrestrial and <b>celestial</b> <b>globes</b> developed by Molyneux.|$|R
