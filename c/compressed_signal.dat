Rather than bringing down the highest peaks for the purpose of dynamic range reduction, it reduces the dynamic range by bringing up the softest sounds, adding audible detail.

The performance of our proposed method was compared with basis pursuit denoising, Lorentzian-based iterative hard thresholding, OMP-PKS and distributed compressed sensing using simultaneously orthogonal matching pursuit.

30|$|This {{approach}} {{is similar to}} the MPEG- 4 Scalable Lossless Coding (SLS) [4] methodology according to which a <b>compressed</b> <b>signal</b> is enhanced by transmitting additional data to the receiver. The difference though between our method and the MPEG- 4 SLS method is that the latter uses a residual coding approach. In residual coding, a residual signal between the compressed and uncompressed signals is generated and subsequently entropy-coded. In MPEG- 4 SLS, the residual signal lies in the integer modified discrete cosine transform (IntMDCT) [5] domain and the preferred transform codec for encoding IntMDCT data is the advanced audio coding (AAC) [6] scheme. Our method does not employ the residual coding approach but instead it converts a <b>compressed</b> <b>signal</b> into its uncompressed version through a statistical conversion function applied strictly on the <b>compressed</b> <b>signal.</b> Therefore, no residual or difference signal between the compressed and uncompressed signals is generated.|$|E
