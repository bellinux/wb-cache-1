However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. Objects such as quasars and radio galaxies were observed to be much more <b>common</b> <b>at</b> <b>large</b> distances (therefore in the distant past) than in the nearby universe, whereas the Steady State predicted that the average properties of the universe should be unchanging with time. In addition, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 was considered the death knell of the Steady State, although this prediction was only qualitative, and failed to predict the exact temperature of the CMB. (The key big bang prediction is the black-body spectrum of the CMB, which was not measured with high accuracy until COBE in 1990). After some reformulation, the Big Bang has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense and physically paradoxical singularity at the starting time of Friedmann's cosmological model could be avoided by allowing for a universe which was contracting before entering the hot dense state, and starting to expand again. This was formalized as Richard Tolman's oscillating universe. In the sixties, Stephen Hawking and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable, and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity. This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age. However, due to a lack of a theory of quantum gravity, there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual origin point for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.|$|E

40|$|The thesis traces {{developments}} in executive compensation at {{a sample of}} American (US) and European banks from 1999 to 2013. Three investigative chapters examine {{developments in}} compensation arrangements in the boom period before the global financial crisis, during and following the crisis, and for cohorts of global-systemically-important-banks, EU banks, and US banks. The thesis reviews the value of banks’ human capital endowment by considering the full C-suite of executive directors in comparison to studies that focus solely on CEOs. The analysis uses a carefully constructed dataset, which contains detailed compensation data for executive directors plus information on their biographical characteristics. The dataset includes bank-level financial statements data and stock data. The first investigative research (Chapter Two) provides an answer as to which factors affect executive compensation in banking. It shows the contrast in pay between bank CEOs and other executive roles. The analysis identifies which biographical characteristics, features of corporate governance structure, and bank-related factors exert most effect on executive compensation and its constituents. The second investigative study (Chapter Three) considers the issue of pay-for-performance in banking, following claims that pay-for-performance systems had become weaker over time, and that powerful firm executives were able to extract rents, which suggests compensation contracts had become sub-optimal for shareholders. It sheds light {{on the extent to}} which executive pay growth reflects changes in bank performance. The chapter considers the design of compensation contracts and estimates the strength of pay-for-performance relationships across different pay incentives. The third study (Chapter Four) considers the behaviour of top management teams and investigates whether the size of differences in pay (pay gaps) between the CEO and other C-suite executives affects firm performance, for which the Z-score is a measure of bank stability. A shared finding of this thesis is that heterogeneity matters and not one size fits all. Results often show intertemporal variation and variation between the three cohorts of banks. Larger compensation awards, and considerably larger portfolio holdings, are <b>common</b> <b>at</b> <b>large,</b> complex firms with wide ranging international operations. This suggests that there are selection effects at work with the biggest and most prestigious firms using compensation packages to attract talented and ambitious individuals...|$|E

The very desire of that body to have such a trust contrary to law reposed in them, shows that they are not worthy of it. They certainly will abuse it; because all men possessed of an uncontrolled discretionary power leading to the aggrandizement and profit of their own body have always abused it: and I see no particular sanctity in our times, that is at all likely, by a miraculous operation, to overrule the course of nature.|$|R

50|$|During World War II, when Austria {{was part}} of the Third Reich, Steyr-Daimler-Puch's Generaldirektor Georg Meindl {{became one of the first}} German {{industrialists}} to suggest the use of slave labour from concentration camps to boost manpower at Steyr. The request was approved and prisoners were brought by guarded train from the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex at Gusen 30 km distant. Later, on 5 January 1942 Meindl wrote a letter to SS Gruppenführer Ernst Kaltenbrunner recommending a new 'satellite' prison camp be constructed to house prisoners nearer the Steyr factory complex, explaining how this would reduce the time and loss of prisoners in transit to and from work while also reducing security and transport overhead costs. This was approved and prisoners were used for facilities construction (bomb shelters, etc.), and to supplant manufacturing labor. This practice heretofore was not <b>common</b> <b>at</b> other <b>larger</b> German companies, though others followed suit including Mercedes-Benz and MAN.
