The engineering and physical science communities have dedicated much effort in understanding and modeling the compressive response of distended materials. Unfortunately, the endeavor to understand becomes more complicated when the material of interest is actually a heterogeneous mixture of individual components rather than a single distended solid. The mixture may inherently have components with widely disparate densities, moduli, and strengths, thus adding to the challenge. A material modeling approach is presented which is comprised of a thermodynamically consistent Hugoniot equa- tion of state (EOS) built into a mixture-modeling framework. This combination enables the user to describe a hetero- geneous combination of material components.

40|$|The performance, reliability, and {{ubiquity of}} {{automatic}} speech recognition systems has flourished in recent years due to steadily increasing computational power and technological innovations such as hidden Markov models, weighted finite-state transducers, and deep learning methods. One problem which plagues speech recognition systems, especially those that operate offline and have been trained on specific in-domain data, is the deleterious effect of noise on the accuracy of speech recognition. Historically, robust speech recognition {{research has focused on}} traditional noise types such as additive noise, linear filtering, and reverberation. This thesis describes the effects of nonlinear dynamic <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> on {{automatic speech recognition}} and develops a number of novel techniques for characterizing and counteracting it. Dynamic <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> is any function which reduces the dynamic range of an input signal.

Despite its ubiquity, this thesis is the first work to comprehensively study and address the effect of dynamic <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> on speech recognition. More specifically, this thesis treats the problem of dynamic <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> in three ways: (1) blind amplitude normalization methods, which counteract dynamic <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> when its parameter values allow the function to be mathematically inverted, (2) blind amplitude reconstruction techniques, i. e., declipping, which attempt to reconstruct clipped segments of the speech signal that are lost through non-invertible dynamic <b>range</b> <b>compression,</b> and (3) matched-training techniques, which attempt to select the pre-trained acoustic model with the closest set of compression parameters.

This is accompanied by a sudden discontinuity in unit cell volume at 53 (± 2) GPa, obtained from XRD data collected over the same <b>compression</b> <b>range.</b> These results are consistent with DFT calculations using an on-site Coulomb repulsion term (GGA+U), which predict a spin transition in ε-FeOOH at 64. 8 GPa.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{compression}} of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms {{is a time}} consuming, painful, and sometimes unsuccessful procedure. Thrombin injection has been advocated as a superior alternative. In this study, we compare our experiences with both techniques. Methods: All the records of femoral artery false aneurysms that were treated in the vascular laboratory from January 1996 to April 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment with ultrasound scan–guided compression was compared with treatment with dilute thrombin injection (100 U/mL). Results: Both groups had similar demographics and aneurysm sizes (P >. 2). Of the pseudoaneursyms, 88 % were caused by cardiac catheterization {{and the others were}} the results of femoral artery access for cardiac surgery (6 %), arteriography (5 %), and renal dialysis (1 %). Compression was successful in 25 of 40 patients (63 %). Nine persistent aneurysms necessitated operation, and six were treated successfully with thrombin injection. Primary thrombin injection successfully obliterated 21 pseudoaneurysms in 23 patients. Overall, 27 of 29 pseudoaneurysms were treated successfully with thrombin injection (93 %). Thrombosis occurred within seconds of the thrombin injection and required, on average, 300 units of thrombin (100 to 600 units). The patients who underwent successful compression required an average of 37 minutes of <b>compression</b> (<b>range,</b> 5 to 70 minutes) and required analgesia on several occasions. No patients in the thrombin group required analgesia or sedation. Neither group had complications. A cost analysis shows that thrombin treatment results in considerable savings in vascular laboratory resource use but not in overall hospital expenditures. Conclusion: Ultrasound scan–guided thrombin injection is a safe, fast, and painless procedure that completely obliterates femoral artery pseudoaneurysms. The shift from compressive therapy to thrombin injection reduces vascular laboratory use and is less expensive, although it does not significantly impact hospital costs.

Similarly, the same applies to the 55 kN machine with an uncertainty of ± 2 E- 5. For the 55 kN machine, both short-term and long-term uncertainty has been established. The machine had been the subject of an earlier comparison measurement with the PTB in the <b>compression</b> <b>range.</b> In addition, the periodic maintenance results of this 55 kN / 2. 2 MN lever deadweight force standard machine will also be discussed. To monitor the drift and stability of the force realised, a total of 5 SPRING FTS were measured according to fixed protocols over time. The lever amplification ratio was also checked at intervals using a 50 kN FTS. From an earlier maintenance check, it was discovered that there was a significant drift in the lever ratio in March 2003 (12 months after commissioning). However, the deadweight forces continued to be realised within the ± 2 E- 5 uncertainty. The lever ratio has since been adjusted back to producing loads which are magnified exactly 40 times from deadweight forces, demonstrating that it is capable of achieving ± 1 E- 4 short term uncertainty. This was confirmed by the comparison with PTB up to 2 MN in both loading directions. Subsequent measurements demonstrated that the lever ratio has been stable. The same is also true for load reproducibility and repeatability at both the deadweight and lever machine, indicating that the long-term uncertainty is now satisfactory as well. 1...|$|E

The method {{is based on}} the direct deposition of an insoluble surfactant at the interface of an air bubble, measuring the surface tension according to the classical axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) technique. This bubble configuration, in contrast to the classical ones for studying Langmuir monolayers have several remarkable advantages like the easy control of the surrounding bulk composition (opening new potential research applications), the fast experimental time for a monolayer to be ready (< 20 min), the small bulk volume (10 mL), and mostly the simple way to carry out dilatational rheology. The experiment consists of performing compression of an insoluble monolayer recording the Π-AB curve (Π is the interfacial pressure and AB the bubble area) and obtaining dilatational rheology over the <b>compression</b> <b>range</b> establishing the E-Π curve (with E is the elastic modulus). We showed that the experimental results can be satisfactorily fitted using the Volmer's equation of state including the two-dimensional compressibility factor ε, offering access to the excluded area per molecule ω 0 and to the number N of molecules at the interface, without initially knowing the amount of deposited material.

Likewise, dilatational rheology of these insoluble monolayers allows evidencing the compressibility of the DOPC monolayer in contrast to the DPPC monolayer, and finally, the compression domains where the interface loses the surfactant through a comparison of the dilatational elasticity with the Gibbs elasticity calculated from the compression curves.

Several major infrastructure facilities like ports or airports are strategically situated on these artificial lands. However, soft dredged deposits are intrinsically low in strength, and very high in compressibility. As a result of these inherently undesirable engineering characteristics, an appropriate ground improvement technique has to be employed so as to meet the engineering requirements necessary for the design and construction of overhead infrastructure facilities. The placement of a surcharge preload on a soft foundation facilitated with vertical drains is the most commonplace method used worldwide. Surcharge preloading with vertical drains is used to accelerate the rate of primary consolidation settlement and reduce the magnitude of the post construction secondary compression settlement. In this study, an attempt was made to provide insight into some factors, aimed at improving the efficiency of the preloading used in a man-made island. A series of laboratory tests was performed to evaluate the effect of clay fabric, altered due to the addition of hydrated lime into slurry, on the primary and secondary consolidation behaviour of the dredged mud samples. As a prime objective, a unique testing method was proposed to determine the threshold value of lime below which the maximum alteration in clay fabric takes place. This threshold is known as Lime Modification Optimum and presents the boundary between modification (i. e. ion exchange and flocculation) and solidification (i. e. formation of the pozzolanic products) phases in limeclay reaction. It was found that, for the type of the dredged mud used in this study, 4 percent of lime (dry weight basis) should be considered as lime modification optimum. A set of oedometer tests was conducted in both normally consolidated (NC) and artificially overconsolidated (OC) stages on both natural and lime treated samples.

40|$|The Super Dual Aural Radar Network (SuperDARN) forms a {{multinational}} collaboration consisting of over 30 HF radars {{used to monitor}} charged particle convections in the high latitudes of the ionosphere. This research is inspired by the antenna arrangement {{of one of these}} HF radars situated at the South African National Antarctic Expedition (SANAE) IV base. This radar consists of a steered 16 -element primary array, and a second 4 -element interferometer array. Phase wrapping is introduced into echoed returns due to the two arrays being separated by 100 m, several wavelengths of the carrier frequency. As a result, the radar system is only able to unambiguously determine the Angle of Arrival (AOA) for a given target provided it resides below 33 ᵒ in elevation when observing along boresight. This dissertation models a subcomponent of this phenomenon and develops an entirely separate pulsed-Doppler radar system on an FPGA platform known as the Red Pitaya. Operating parameters are specifically chosen to be consistent with the SANAE IV radar. An antenna arrangement consisting of two receivers and a transmitter is constructed to replicate the AOA issue experienced by the SANAE radar. Instead of focusing on detecting targets in elevation, as done with the SuperDARN radars, targets are detected in azimuth. Three algorithms are developed to autonomously measure the AOA and to counteract the effects of 2 π phase wrapping. The naïve measurement applies no corrections and is only able to detect targets at angles within ± 17. 10 ᵒ of boresight. This is the theoretical maximum measurable AOA when operating at 17 MHz. A second algorithm involving a Standard Deviation (STDEV) search process is used to successfully measure angles up to ± 70 ᵒ for the same arrangement. It does this by varying the carrier frequency and using numerous received aliased AOAs to correct and expand for a true AOA. Empirical results yield an average Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0. 29 between the true and measured target angles. A third algorithm involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) was shown to work in theory (albeit only up to ± 66 ᵒ), but failed to perform in practice. Results presented in this dissertation indicate that the maximum measurable AOA is expanded by a factor of 4 by using the STDEV algorithm. It is postulated that the same result can be achieved using the actual SuperDARN radar.

A typical frame varies in size from 7 inches to 20 inches. There are also key chain sized frames available. These frames also support a variety of formats like. jpeg,. tiff,. bmp and so on. Most of the frames provide an option to run the photos in a sequential or random manner as a slideshow with an adjustable time interval. The mode of input of the photos to the frame is also multi-fold. It can be done directly via the memory card of the camera, or else various memory devices like USB drives, SD Cards, MMC Cards and so on can be used. Nowadays even Bluetooth technology is being used. Another option that is becoming quite popular is that, users can take their photos directly from the Internet from sites like Flickr, Picassa or from their e-mail. Also these frames generally come with built in speakers and with remote controls. Our initial objective was to decide on which all features can be added to the Digital Photo Frame that we design. For this purpose we conducted simulation exercises in MATLAB so as to prove its feasibility. This simulation exercise was divided into two parts. The first part was to perform compression and decompression and the second half dealt with the various enhancements that can be added to the frame. For our compression and decompression we considered the JPEG standard. Joint Photographic Experts Group - an ISO/ITU standard for compressing still images. The JPEG format is very popular due to its variable <b>compression</b> <b>range.</b> A few limitations of JPEG include the fact that it is lossy and also not great for displaying text. The common extension for it include *. jpg, *. jff, *. m-jpeg,*. mpeg The various enhancement features that we tested for feasibility include Mean Filter, Median Filter, Image Sharpening, Negative Image Extraction, Logarithmic Transformations, Power Law Correction (Gamma Correction), Contrast Stretching, Grey Level Slicing, Bit Plane Slicing, Laplace Filtering. We then proceeded onto the hardware implementation of the above said features. We only implemented a handful of features owing to the complexity of design and lack of time. We first implemented the Compression and Decompression algorithm. The two enhancement features we implemented were Laplace Filter and Median Filter. For our implementation we used the VIRTEX 2 FPGA Board...|$|E
