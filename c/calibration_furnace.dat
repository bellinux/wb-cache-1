40|$|A layered {{heat flux}} gauge, which can {{withstand}} a high temperature environment for {{applications such as}} for use on thermal protection shields on aeroentry vehicles, is analyzed, designed, fabricated, and tested. The heat flux gauge consists of two resistance temperature detectors {{on the top and}} bottom faces of a thin ceramic substrate. The heat flux is calculated from temperature measurements of the two temperature detectors. An analytical model is used to simulate the gauge response. Several numerical methods to calculate the heat flux are investigated to improve the time response of the gauge. The error due to gauge intrusiveness and the validity of one-dimensional heat transfer within the gauge is studied by solving a steady state two-dimensional composite problem using a semi-analytical approach. Gauge fabrication techniques and measurement devices are discussed.

The thermophysical properties of a PbSnTe alloy used for semiconductors are investigated, and <b>furnace</b> <b>calibration</b> and fluid-flow measurements are performed. The alloy has a zero energy crossing at approximately 40 percent SnTe in its band-gap vs composition diagram, which facilitates the design of long-wavelength IR detectors and lasers. The uniformity of devices made from this material depends on the ratio of PbTe and SnTe and requires {{the composition of the}} crystal growth to be closely controlled. The main obstacle to such control is the fact that liquid of this material is always solutally or thermally unstable, and, in a high-temperature gradient, the double convective instability cannot be made stable by balancing thermal and solutal expansion.

The use of so called fixed-point calibration rods {{makes it possible to}} calibrate such sensors at one particularly chosen temperature easily. A second sensor for measuring the calibration temperature (reference sensor) is not necessary. In most cases, the calibration procedure can be performed in exactly that situation where the measuring application normally takes place (in-situ calibration). Thus the whole individual measuring circuitry and its specific thermal conditions are involved during calibration process. Fixed-point calibration rods are useful for quality management inspections in rough industrial application areas, for outdoor surveying tasks as well as for precision temperature measurements in <b>calibration</b> baths or <b>furnaces.</b> The paper presents structure and handling of fixed-point calibration rods. Examples of application including measuring uncertainty budgets are outlined...|$|R

40|$|During {{hypersonic}} flight, {{high temperatures}} and high heat fluxes are generated on {{the surfaces of}} vehicles. The Flight Loads Laboratory (FLL) at Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) {{is equipped with a}} <b>calibration</b> <b>furnace,</b> capable of calibrating heat flux gages up to 1100 kW per square meters, and temperature sensors up to 2600 C. One heating configuration of the <b>calibration</b> <b>furnace</b> is a cylindrical blackbody cavity. Throughout the blackbody there are temperature gradients due to various boundary conditions. These boundary conditions include resistance heating, radiant heat transfer, and conduction to water-cooled electrodes. Also, an inert gas is purged through the graphite blackbody to prevent it from oxidizing. Consequently, the various modes of heat transfer present during operation of the blackbody cavity must be well understood in order to produce accurate heat flux gage and temperature sensor calibrations for use in ground testing or flight testing of hypersonic vehicles. The first step towards understanding the heat transfer in the blackbody cavity was to perform experiments at 1100 C, with and without outer surface insulation, while taking detailed temperature measurements inside the blackbody cavity. Steady state thermal models of the blackbody cavity were then developed. These models included detailed thermal analysis using commercial thermal analysis software. Conduction, radiation, and convection were considered in the thermal models for two cases: one with the outside of the blackbody cavity insulated and the second without insulation. This paper describes the experimental and numerical efforts used to characterize the steady state operation of the blackbody cavity. It describes the analysis of the test measurements, the boundary conditions used in the numerical models, and how the models were calibrated to fit the experimental data. Effects of various uncertainties, such as material properties, and convection are discussed. Initial thermal models predicted temperatures in the deepest part of the blackbody cavity within 7 C of the measured value and produced trends comparable to the experimental data, throughout the models. Adjustment of the boundary conditions, which were included in the thermal models, produced good agreement with measured temperatures. Free and forced convection of the purge gas inside the blackbody was found to be insignificant...|$|E

The Bi- 2212 technology {{is being developed}} in close collaboration with industry, and has been partly supported by the US Very High Field Superconducting Magnet Collaboration (VHFSMC). Steady improvements were made {{over the last several}} years, with coil HTS-SC 08 reaching 2636 A, or about 85 % of its witness sample critical current (Ic). Though this is still a factor 3 to 4 too low to be competitive with Nb-based materials, it is expected that the required Ic can be achieved through further conductor optimizations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{evaluate}} the elevated temperature tensile properties of Alloy EP- 823, a leading target material for accelerator-driven waste transmutation applications. This alloy has been proven to be an excellent structural material to contain the lead-bismuth-eutectic (LBE) nuclear coolant needed for fast spectrum operations. Very little data exist in the open literature on the tensile properties of this alloy. The test material will be thermally treated prior to the evaluation of its tensile properties at temperatures relevant to the transmutation applications. The deformation characteristics of tensile specimens, upon completion of testing, will be evaluated by surface analytical techniques using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The overall results {{will lead to the}} development of a mechanistic understanding of the elevated-temperature deformation processes in this alloy as a function of thermal treatment. The resultant data may also provide guidance in developing future target materials possessing the improved metallurgical properties, and enhanced LBE corrosion resistance. Accomplishments ● The Materials Testing System (MTS) machine to perform tensile testing has been modified to accommodate high-temperature testing in the presence of an inert gas (nitrogen) using a custom-made chamber. The testing temperature using this hot chamber can be monitored by two K-type thermocouples. ● A laser extensometer having a scan rate of 100 scans/second has also been added to this MTS unit to measure the elongation in the gage section of test specimen during the plastic deformation under tensile loading at the desired strain rate. ● A pair of custom-built water-cooled specimen grips made of maraging steel (M 250) has been attached to the MTS machine to prevent these grips from being heated during high temperature testing. ● Testing has been performed at ambient temperature and 100 oC using tensile specimens fabricated from vacuum-melted and heat-treated (at the Timken Company, OH) bars of martensitic Alloy EP- 823. Preliminary data indicate that both the yield strength (YS) and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the tested material were slightly reduced at the elevated temperature. However, no significant reduction in ductility in terms of percent elongation (%El) and percent reduction in area (%RA) was observed in these tests. ● Temperature profiles have been developed to determine the times needed to achieve the desired test temperature, as a part of the <b>furnace</b> <b>calibration</b> process.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{calibrate}} thermometers {{they have to}} be used to measure the temperature of an isothermal cavity within an appropriate furnace. This temperature has to be compared with the temperature T_ 9 _ 0 measured by means of a normal instrument approximating the International Temperature Scale ITS- 90. Above 962 C the ITS- 90 can be realized only by means of a radiation thermometer. In many applications, however, the application of contact thermometers is required because of technical reasons. The noise thermometer is the only contact thermometer the signal of which is independent on drift behaviour caused by variation of material. Therefore, it is the most appropriate contact thermometer to approximate the ITS- 90 in this temperature range. In order to realize this application a special <b>calibration</b> <b>furnace</b> for temperatures up to 1500 C has been developed making available both isothermal blackbody cavity to measure the radiation temperature and cavities to insert contact thermometers. Special efforts were necessary to suppress electromagnetic fields influencing the measured noise signal and reducing the accuracy of noise thermometer measurement. As an important requirement a long term stability of the furnace temperature could be achieved with a deviation of 0. 1 K after 48 h at 1460 C. Ten separately controlled heating sections allow to optimize the temperature profile {{in the direction of the}} furnace axis and the remaining deviation of #+-# 0. 6 K over a length of 300 mm finally was one of the main error sources. This first direct comparison of the two thermodynamic temperature measurement techniques at 1460 C led to a difference of approximately 0. 2 K. This value being in the range or below the individual uncertainties demonstrates the applicability of a furnace with the described construction for precise calibration of contact thermometers at high temperatures. Thereby approximation of the temperature T_ 9 _ 0 is possible either by radiation or by noise thermometers. (orig.)
