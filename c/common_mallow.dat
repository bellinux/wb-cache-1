50|$|Tree mallow was {{considered}} a nutritive animal food in Britain in the 19th century, and is still sometimes used as animal fodder in Europe. For human consumption, some sources describe the leaves of tree mallow as edible, although not as palatable as <b>common</b> <b>mallow,</b> unless cut very thinly, because of the very velours-like hairy mouth-feel.|$|E

5000|$|Mauve, n. F., mallow, L. malva. So named {{from the}} {{similarity}} of the color {{to that of the}} petals of <b>common</b> <b>mallow,</b> {Malva sylvestris}. Webster's Dictionary In 1931 Maud Grieve wrote that the [...] "use of this species of Mallow has been much superseded by Marsh Mallow (Althaea officinalis), which possesses its valuable properties in a superior degree, but it is still a favourite remedy with country people where Marsh Mallow is not obtainable." ...|$|E
50|$|The stems, which {{die down}} in the autumn, are erect, 3 to 4 ft, but can reach 6′6″ (2m), simple, or putting out only a few lateral branches. The leaves, shortly petioled, are roundish, ovate-cordate, 2 to 3 in long, and about 1 inch broad, entire or three to five lobed, irregularly toothed at the margin, and thick. They are soft and velvety on both sides, due to a dense {{covering}} of stellate hairs. The flowers are shaped {{like those of the}} <b>common</b> <b>mallow,</b> but are smaller and of a pale colour, and are either axillary, or in panicles, more often the latter.|$|E

50|$|One of the longest-running soil seed {{viability}} trials {{was started in}} Michigan in 1879 by James Beal. The experiment involved the burying of 20 bottles holding 50 seeds from 21 species. Every five years, a bottle from every species was retrieved and germinated on a tray of sterilized soil which was kept in a growth chamber. Later, after responsibility for managing the experiment was delegated to caretakers, the period between retrievals became longer. In 1980, more than 100 years after the trial was started, seeds of only three species were observed to germinate: moth mullein (Verbascum blattaria), common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) and <b>common</b> <b>mallow</b> (Malva neglecta).|$|E

The effect of host transfer from cotton to <b>common</b> <b>mallow,</b> Malva sylvestris L., and okra, Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench 'Bamya 501 ', on performance of A. gossypii was studied at constant 25 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5 % relative humidity and 16 h of artificial light (5000 lux) in temperature cabinets. Three subsequent generations of A. gossypii from cotton were additionally tested on okra. Fecundity tables were constructed to compare {{the performance of the}} cotton aphid on the three different Malvaceae hosts. Developmental time (6. 0 days) was longer and fecundity reduced (4. 5 nymphs/aphid) on okra compared to <b>common</b> <b>mallow</b> (5. 6 days and 62. 8 nymphs/aphid) and cotton (5. 5 days and 37. 9 nymphs/aphid). The highest age-specific number of nymphs (m x occurred on <b>common</b> <b>mallow</b> at an age of nine days with 6. 8 nymphs/aphid, and the lowest on okra with only 1. 2 nymphs/aphid at the ninth day. A. gossypii on cotton produced a maximum age-specific number of nymphs at day ten with 3. 4 nymphs/aphid. Generation times (T O) were similar for all three host plants, however, the mean number of aphids laid during an individual’s lifetime (Ro) varied largely between 4. 2 aphids/aphid on okra to 65. 7 nymphs/aphid on <b>common</b> <b>mallow.</b> The significantly lowest intrinsic rate of increase (r m) (0. 129 aphids/aphid/day) was calculated for A. gossypii on okra. Even after three subsequent generations on okra, the performance did not improve, indicating that genetically distinct host races exist in A. gossypii. On <b>common</b> <b>mallow</b> an r m value of 0. 397 aphids/aphid/day occurred, whilst on cotton the intrinsic rate of increase was significantly lower with 0. 338 aphids/aphid/day.

50|$|Malvella leprosa is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mallow family known by the <b>common</b> names alkali <b>mallow</b> and alkali sida. It is native {{to much of the}} western United States, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile. It is known in parts of Australia as an introduced species. In many regions, whether native there or not, the plant is often a noxious weed and easily invades habitat, including areas with alkaline and saline soils. In California, the plant can be found in agricultural lands, including fields and orchards. This is a decumbent perennial herb producing a white-hairy stem up to about 40 cm long, spreading along the ground. The leaves are variable in shape but are generally lobed and wavy along the edges, measuring 1 to 3 cm wide. Leaves appear in the leaf axils singly or in clusters of up to 3.

6000|$|To {{the ideal}} {{landscape}} of the early religious painters of Italy I have alluded in the concluding chapter of the second volume. It is absolutely right and beautiful in its peculiar application; but its grasp of nature is narrow and its treatment in most respects too severe and conventional to form a profitable example when the landscape is to be alone the subject of thought. The great virtue of it is its entire, exquisite, and humble realization of those objects it selects; in this respect differing from such German imitations of it as I have met with, {{that there is no}} effort of any fanciful or ornamental modifications, but loving fidelity to the thing studied. The foreground plants are usually neither exaggerated nor stiffened; they do not form arches or frames or borders; their grace is unconfined, their simplicity undestroyed. Cima da Conegliano, in his picture in the church of the Madonna dell' Orto at Venice, has given us the oak, the fig, the beautiful [...] "Erba della Madonna" [...] on the wall, precisely such a bunch of it as may be seen growing at this day on the marble steps of that very church; ivy and other creepers, and a strawberry plant in the foreground, with a blossom and a berry just set, and one half ripe and one ripe, all patiently and innocently painted from the real thing, and therefore most divine. Fra Angelico's use of the oxalis acetosella is as faithful in representation as touching in feeling.[7] The ferns that grow on the walls of Fiesole may be seen in their simple verity on the architecture of Ghirlandajo. The rose, the myrtle, and the lily, the olive and orange, pomegranate and vine, have received their fairest portraiture where they bear a sacred character; even the <b>common</b> plantains and <b>mallows</b> of the waysides are touched with deep reverence by Raffaelle; and indeed for the perfect treatment of details of this kind, treatment as delicate and affectionate as it is elevated and manly, it is to the works of these schools alone that we can refer. And on this their peculiar excellence I should the more earnestly insist, because it is of a kind altogether neglected by the English school, and with most unfortunate result, many of our best painters missing their deserved rank solely from the want of it, as Gainsborough; and all being more or less checked in their progress or vulgarized in their aim.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminations in the leaf, stem and root tissues of <b>common</b> <b>mallow</b> (Malva sylvestris L.) were investigated by using gas chromatography to give an insight into the bioaccumulation of these persistent pollutants. The sampling stations {{are located in the}} Dilovası and İzmit Districts of Kocaeli Province in Turkey. Total PAH concentrations varied between 10. 44 and 61. 15 pg g- 1 dw (dry weight). The most dominant PAH congeners were Acenaphthene and Acenaphthylene which are low molecular weight. Total PCB concentrations were found to be between 326. 79 and 4496. 42 pg g- 1 dw. PCB 66, PCB 110, PCB 153 and PCB 180 were found to be the most dominant congeners. Detected concentrations in root tissues showed the plant’s ability in accumulating these pollutants.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{protective}} {{effect of the}} <b>common</b> <b>mallow</b> (Malva sylvestris) decoction on renal damages in rats induced by ammonium metavanadate poisoning was evaluated. On the one hand, vanadium toxicity is associated {{to the production of}} reactive oxygen species, causing a lipid peroxidation and an alteration in the enzymatic antioxidant defence. On the other hand, many medicinal plants are known to possess antioxidant and radical scavenging properties, thanks to the presence of flavonoids. These properties were confirmed in Malva sylvestris by two separate methods; namely, the Diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl assay and the Nitroblue Tetrazolium reduction assay. Results In 80 rats exposed to ammonium metavanadate (0. 24 mmol/kg body weight in drinking water) for 90 days, lipid peroxidation levels and superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured in kidney. A significant increase in the formation of free radicals and antioxidant enzyme activities was noticed. In addition, a histological examination of kidney revealed a structural deterioration of the renal cortical capsules and a shrinking of the Bowman space. In animals intoxicated by metavanadate but also given a Malva sylvestris decoction (0. 2 g dry mallow/kg body weight), no such pathologic features were observed: lipid peroxidation levels, antioxidant enzyme activities and histological features appeared normal as compared to control rats. Conclusion Malva sylvestris is proved to have a high antioxidative potential thanks to its richness in phenolic compounds. </p...|$|E
