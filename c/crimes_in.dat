5|$|However, not {{everything}} was always harmonious between {{the king and}} the archbishop. In 1156, Theobald supported the efforts of Osbert de Bayeux, {{who was accused of}} poisoning William the Archbishop of York, to secure a trial for his alleged <b>crimes</b> <b>in</b> an ecclesiastical court rather than in the royal court. The crime had taken place during Stephen's reign, but Stephen's death had prevented Osbert from being tried in 1154. The delay allowed the shifting of the trial to the church courts, which Henry opposed. Although Theobald's position displeased the king no open rupture ensued. Theobald himself admitted to the papacy in 1154 that English custom was to try clergy for <b>crimes</b> <b>in</b> the secular courts.|$|E
