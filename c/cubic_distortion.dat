40|$|<b>Cubic</b> to tetragonal <b>distortion</b> in spinel {{compounds}} {{have been}} a contentious issue for last two decades. Different groups have proposed different mechanisms to understand such a distortion in these spinels, which are: (i) spin lattice coupling mechanism known as the spin driven Jahn-Teller (JT) effect, (ii) the strong relativistic spin-orbit coupling, a moderate JT distortion and weak V-V interactions and (iii) the JT effect. Now, in order to know the possible cause for such a distortion, we have avoided these complexities (various interactions among spin, electronic, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom) by carrying out spin unpolarized calculations. The calculated values of bulk moduli for ZnV_ 2 O_ 4 (ZnCr_ 2 O_ 4), MgV_ 2 O_ 4 (MgCr_ 2 O_ 4) and CdV_ 2 O_ 4 (CdCr_ 2 O_ 4) {{are found to be}} ∼ 289 (∼ 254), ∼ 244 (∼ 243) and ∼ 230 (∼ 233) GPa, respectively. For vanadates and chromates, the order of calculated values of lattice parameter a are found to CdV_ 2 O_ 4 >MgV_ 2 O_ 4 >ZnV_ 2 O_ 4 and CdCr_ 2 O_ 4 >MgCr_ 2 O_ 4 >ZnCr_ 2 O_ 4, respectively and are consistent with the experimental results. The calculated values of <b>cubic</b> to tetragonal <b>distortion</b> (c/a), with c/a< 1 for ZnV_ 2 O_ 4 (ZnCr_ 2 O_ 4), MgV_ 2 O_ 4 (MgCr_ 2 O_ 4) and CdV_ 2 O_ 4 (CdCr_ 2 O_ 4) are ∼ 0. 996 (∼ 0. 997), ∼ 0. 995 (∼ 0. 994) and ∼ 0. 997 (∼ 0. 998), respectively. These values are in good agreement with the experimental data for ZnV_ 2 O_ 4, MgV_ 2 O_ 4, ZnCr_ 2 O_ 4 and MgCr_ 2 O_ 4 compounds. The present study clearly shows the role of ionic sizes in inducing the <b>cubic</b> to tetragonal <b>distortion</b> in these spinels.

40|$|Bandpass {{filtered}} transient-evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) waveforms {{are composed}} of short-latency (SL) and long-latency (LL) portions. The LL portion has latency consistent with generation through linear coherent reflection at the tonotopic place on the basilar membrane. The short-latency (SL) portion occurs earlier in time and exhibits less compressive growth. Several mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain generation of the SL portion, including 2 f 1 -f 2 intermodulation distortion and coherent reflection basal to the tonotopic place. Two experiments were designed to examine the generation mechanism and generation location of the SL portion. Experiment 1 tests {{the hypothesis that the}} SL portion results from low-side, <b>cubic</b> intermodulation <b>distortion.</b> Experiment 2 determines the region along the basilar membrane at which the SL portion of the TEOAE is generated. The null hypothesis that the SL portion of the TEOAE is generated through low-side, <b>cubic</b> intermodulation <b>distortion</b> requires stimuli with broad frequency content. Stimulus energy at different frequencies (f 1 and f 2) is presumed to interact simultaneously across the cochlear partition, generating a distortion-source OAE. To test this hypothesis, OAEs were evoked using 2 kHz tone-bursts with durations spanning the time-frequency continuum between a click and a pure tone. As tone-burst duration increases, stimulus energy at the primary frequencies (f 1 and f 2) decreases and the input to any nonlinear distortion source is reduced. Accordingly, if generated through 2 f 1 -f 2 distortion, the magnitude of the SL portion of the TEOAE was expected to decrease as tone-burst duration increased. Results were inconsistent with generation of the SL portion through intermodulation distortion. As tone-burst duration increased, the SL portion remained present in the TEOAE. The presence of the SL portion influenced the level-dependency of TEOAE latency and magnitude to the same extent across all tone-burst durations. The region of generation along the cochlear partition of the SL portion has implications for the mechanism through which it is generated. Generation through low-side, <b>cubic</b> intermodulation <b>distortion</b> (2 f 1 -f 2) would occur near the f 2 tonotopic place. If generation is through coherent reflection, a generation region basal to that of the tonotopic place is hypothesized. To determine the cochlear region where the SL portion is generated, TEOAEs were evoked by 2 kHz tone-bursts in the presence of different suppressor stimuli. The amount of suppression induced by each suppressor on the OAE was measured, and the suppressor frequency causing greatest suppression of a given portion of the TEOAE was interpreted as corresponding to that portion 2 ̆ 7 s generation place along the basilar membrane. For analysis purposes, the SL portion was divided into two SL time-windows (SL 1 and SL 2). The LL portion of the TEOAE was maximally suppressed by a 2. 07 kHz tone, consistent with generation at the tonotopic place. Both SL components were generated basal to the tonotopic place. The later-occurring SL portion of the TEOAE (SL 1) was generated between 1 / 4 - 1 / 3 -octave basal to the tonotopic place while the earlier-occurring SL portion (SL 2) was generated 3 / 5 -octave basal to the tonotopic place. The generation region of the SL 1 portion of the TEOAE was too apical to be consistent with generation through 2 f 1 -f 2 distortion. Although the generation region of the SL 2 portion was what would be expected for a 2 f 1 -f 2 distortion-source OAE, the latency was too early. Generation of both SL portions may be explained through basal linear coherent reflection. Per this mode of generation, the SL 1 and SL 2 portions of the TEOAE each likely mirror the underlying mechanics at different regions along the cochlear partition...|$|R

The TOI is always beyond operational power levels because the output power saturates before reaching this level.|$|E
5000|$|TMD {{fails to}} provide {{accurate}} estimates of ICP mostly because the acoustic impedance and its changes {{due to the}} acoustic reflex are dominantly determined by the structures and functional properties of the middle ear, and only marginally influenced by changes in ICP. A measurable acoustic phenomenon that originates in the inner ear would, at least in theory, allow for more precise assessment of {{the pressure of the}} peri- and endo-lymph, and consequently, of ICP. Otoacoustic emission (OAE), which is a sound generated by subtle oscillations of the endo- and perilymph caused by contractions of the outer hairy cells of the inner ear in response to a loud sound, seems to offer such a possibility. The sound is transmitted to the stapes, and further through the ossicles, to the tympanic membrane from which it can be detected with a sensitive microphone inserted into the ear canal. OAE is used in clinical practice to test for hearing deficits in babies and children who are too young to cooperate. The equipment can be made portable, and is relatively easy to use. Two approaches are commonly utilized that increase the unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio and facilitate extraction of the OAE waveform: transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). In a recent US patent issued to Meyerson and colleagues [...] thought the use of both the TEOAE and DPOAE for measurement of ICP. TEOAE is used first to determine the optimum OAE response frequency, after which the pair of pure tones is deployed in a DPOAE paradigm such that the <b>cubic</b> <b>distortion</b> product frequency equals the optimum response frequency while the ratio of frequencies f2/f1 is set to 5:4, and of intensities I2/I1 to 6:5. The inventors also proposed formulae that relate ICP to the intensity or phase of the measured OAE signal, and described how the other physiological signals or behaviors that are known to affect ICP such as small oscillations of ICP with each heart beat, respiration, or posture changes, can be used to confirm the validity of the obtained measurements (e.g. the absence of modulation of the measured OAE phase with respiration may indicate occlusion of the cochlear aqueduct, in which case OAE cannot provide any information about ICP). There is little data up to date about the clinical utility or accuracy of otoacoustic emission as a measure of ICP. A pilot study of Frank and colleagues that evaluated different modalities of OAE in 12 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with implanted ventricular catheters for direct ICP monitoring revealed that increased ICP or conditions known to increase ICP (e.g. posture changes, abdomen compression, coughing) were associated with notable decreases (between -2.1 and -7.9SPL) in intensity of the evoked OAE. All results were however reported only as group averages, and no attempt was made to derive a quantitative one-to-one relation between the OAE intensity and ICP. This method as all other correlation based approaches can not be used for absolute ICP value measurement because of impossibility of individual calibration.|$|E

The stable rhombohedral phase has all distortions in phase (ferroelectric, FE), whereas higher temperature phases have antiferroelectric coupling (AFE) in one, two, or three dimensions (orthorhombic, tetragonal, cubic). This FE–AFE model from QM explains such puzzling aspects of these systems as the allowed Raman excitation observed for the <b>cubic</b> phase, the <b>distortions</b> toward observed in the cubic phase using x-ray fine structure, the small transition entropies, the heavily damped soft phonon modes, and the strong diffuse x-ray scattering {{in all but the}} rhombohedral phase.

This work reports on the design and development of an optical fiber based multispectral NLOM developed around a laser generating broadband sub- 10 -fs pulses. An all-mirror dispersion-compensation setup is used to correct for quadratic and <b>cubic</b> phase <b>distortions</b> induced within the NLOM. Mouse tail tendon was used to characterize sub- 10 -fs pulses by interferometric autocorrelation. This is an effective method for characterizing dispersion from the optical system, immersion medium, and wet biological sample. The generation of very short autocorrelations demonstrates the ability to compensate for phase distortions within the imaging system and efficient second-harmonic upconversion of the ultrashort pulse spectrum within collagen. Reconstruction of ultrashort pulses at the focal plane of the objective allows the excitation of multiple fluorescent probes simultaneously. Multiple fluorescent probe excitation and spectral discrimination is demonstrated using mixtures of fluorescent dye solutions and an in-vitro angiogenesis model containing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC?s) expressing multiple fluorescent proteins. Sub- 10 -fs pulses can be propagated through polarization-maintaining single mode fiber (PMF) for use in NLOM. We demonstrate delivery of near transform-limited, 1 nJ pulses from a Ti:Al 2 O 3 oscillator via PMF to the NLOM focal plane while maintaining 120 nm of bandwidth. Negative group delay dispersion (GDD) introduced to pre-compensate normal dispersion of the optical fiber and microscope optics ensured linear pulse propagation through the PMF. Nonlinear excitation of multiple fluorophores simultaneously and polarization sensitive NLOM imaging using second harmonic generation in collagen was demonstrated using PMF delivered pulses.

This approach makes it possible to solve the second order Boltzmann equation explicitly, with the spectral y distortion and the momentum independent second order temperature perturbation, while generation of μ distortion cannot be explained even at second order in this framework. We also extend our method to higher order Boltzmann equations systematically and find new type spectral distortions, assuming that the collision term is linear in the photon distribution functions, namely, in the Thomson scattering limit. As an example, we concretely construct solutions to the cubic order Boltzmann equation and show that the equations are closed with additional three parameters composed of a cubic order temperature perturbation and two <b>cubic</b> order spectral <b>distortions.</b> The linear Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect whose momentum dependence is different from the usual y distortion is also discussed {{in the presence of the}} next leading order Kompaneets terms, and we show that higher order spectral distortions are also generated as a result of the diffusion process in a framework of higher order Boltzmann equations.

40|$|Texture-plus-depth ” {{has become}} a popular coding format for mul-tiview image compression, where a decoder can {{synthesize}} images at intermediate viewpoints using encoded texture and depth maps of closest captured view locations via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). As in other resource-constrained scenarios, limited avail-able bits must be optimally distributed among captured texture and depth maps to minimize the expected signal distortion at the decoder. A specific challenge of multiview image compression for DIBR is that the encoder must allocate bits without the knowledge of how many and which specific virtual views will be synthesized at the decoder for viewing. In this paper, we derive a <b>cubic</b> synthesized view <b>distortion</b> model to describe the visual quality of an interpo-lated view {{as a function of}} the view’s location.

We apply these non-central F mixed models to the analysis of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), retrograde sinusoidal pressure variations produced in the nonlinear cochlea by two-tone stimulation. Due to the narrowband nature of both the evoking stimuli and the emission, DPOAEs potentially represent a non-behavioural analogue of the pure-tone audiogram.

Its originality: the use of a battery of DPOAE measurements associated with contra-lateral acoustic stimulation. Changes in DPOAE amplitude due to ageing and gender were incidentally detected and EchoScan was more sensitive than impedancemetry to detect the stapedial reflex.

It is suggested that other oxygen-containing as well as so far unknown nitride-containing clusters should be feasible. For the first time, the dynamical behavior of the encapsulated hydride has been investigated by metadynamics simulations.

40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} “In situ crystallography {{and charge}} density analysis of phase transitions in complex inorganic sulfates” consists of six chapters. Structural changes exhibited by ferroic and conducting materials are studied {{as a function}} of temperature via in situ crystallography on the same single crystal. These unique experiments bring out the changes in the crystal system resulting in subtle changes in the complex polyhedra, distortions in bond lengths and bond angles, rotation of sulfate tetrahedral around metal atoms, phase separations and charge density features. The results provide new insights into the structural changes during the phase transition in terms of coordination changes, variable bond paths and variability in electrostatic potentials while suggesting possible reaction pathways hitherto unexplored. Chapter 1 gives a brief review of the basic features of structural phase transitions in terms of types of phase transitions, their mechanisms and related properties and outlines some of the key characterization techniques employed in structural phase transition studies like single crystal diffraction, thermal analysis, conductivity, dielectric relaxation, Raman spectroscopy and charge density studies. Chapter 2 deals with the group of compounds A 3 H(SO 4) 2, where A= Rb, NH 4, K, Na which undergoes ferroelastic to paraelastic phase transitions with increase in temperature. Crystal structures of these compounds have been determined to a high degree of accuracy employing the same single crystal at room temperature at 100 K and at higher temperatures. The data collection at 100 K allows the examination of the ordered and disordered hydrogen atom positions. Rb 3 H(SO 4) 2 show two intermediate phases before reaching the paraelastic phase with increase in temperature. However, in case of (NH 4) 3 H(SO 4) 2 and K 3 H(SO 4) 2, the paraelastic phase transition involves a single step. Chapter 3 deals with variable temperature in situ single crystal X-ray diffraction studies on fast super protonic conductors AHSO 4, where A= Rb, NH 4, K to characterize the structural phase transitions as well as the dehydration mechanism. The structure of KHSO 4 at room temperature belongs to an orthorhombic crystal system with the space group symmetry Pbca and on heating to 463 K it transforms to a C centered orthorhombic lattice, space group Cmca. The high temperature structure contain two crystallographically independent units of KHSO 4 of which one KHSO 4 unit is disordered at oxygen and hydrogen sites an shows a remarkable increase of sulfur oxygen bond distance – 1. 753 (4) Å. On heating to 475 K, two units of disordered KHSO 4 combine and loose one molecule of water to result in a structure K 2 S 2 O 7 along with an ordered KHSO 4 in a monoclinic system [space group P 21 /c]. On further heating to 485 K two units of ordered KHSO 4 combine, again to lose one water molecule to give K 2 S 2 O 7 in a monoclinic crystal system [space group C 2 /c]. In the case of RbHSO 4, both the high temperature structural phase transition and a serendipitous polymorph have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The room temperature structure is monoclinic, P 21 /n, and on heating the crystal insitu On the diffractometer to 460 K the structure changes to an orthorhombic system [space group Pmmn]. On keeping the crystallization temperature at 80 °C polymorph crystals of RbHSO 4 were grown. In case of NH 4 HSO 4 both the room temperature and high temperature structures are structurally similar to those in RbHSO 4, but the transition temperature is found to be 413 K. Chapter 4 deals with the crystal structure, ionic conduction, dielectric relaxation, Raman spectroscopy phase transition pf a fast ion conductor Na 2 Cd(SO 4) 2. The structure is monoclinic, space group C 2 /c, and is built up with inter connecting CdO 6 octahedra and SO 4 tetrahedra resulting in a framework structure. The mobile Na atoms are present in the framework, resulting in a high ionic conductivity. The conductivity measurement shows two phase transitions one at around 280 °C, which was confirmed later from DTA, dielectric relaxation, high temperature powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Chapter 5 describes the structure and in situ phase separation in two different bimetallic sulfates Na 2 Mn 1. 167 (SO 4) 2 S 0. 33 O 1. 1672 H 2 O and K 4 Cd 3 (SO 4) 5. 3 H 2 O. These compounds were synthesized keeping them as mimics of mineral structures. The structure of Na 2 Mn 1. 167 (SO 4) 2 S 0. 33 O 1. 1672 H 2 O is trigonal, space group R. The stiochiometry {{can be viewed as a}} combination of Na 2 Mn(SO 4) 22 H 2 O resembling the mineral Krohnkite with an additional (Mn 0. 167 S 0. 333 O 1. 167) motif. On heating the parent compound on the diffractometer to 500 K and keeping the capillary at this temperature for one hour, a remarkable structural phase separation occurs with one phase showing a single crystal-single crystal transition and the other generating a polycrystalline phase. The resulting single crystal spots can be indexed in a monoclinic C 2 /c space group and the structure determination unequivocally suggests the formation of Na 2 Mn(SO 4) 2, isostructural to Na 2 Cd(SO 4) z. The mechanism follows the symmetry directed pathway from the rhombohedral → monoclinic symmetry with the removal of symmetry subsequent to the loss of the two coordinated water molecules. In case of K 4 Cd 3 (SO 4) 5. 3 H 2 O the structure belongs to the space group P 21 /n at room temperature and on heating to 500 K and holding the capillary at this temperature for 60 minutes as before, the CCD images can be indexed in a cubic P 213 space group after the phase separation, generating K 2 Cd 2 (SO 4) 3, belonging to the well known Langbeinite family, while the other phase is expected to be the sought after K 2 Cd(SO 4) 2. The possible pathways have been discussed. Chapter 6 reports the charge density studies of phase transitions in a type II langbeinite, Rb 2 Mn 2 (SO 4) 3. The structure displays two different phases, cubic at 200 K, orthorhombic at 100 K respectively. After multiple refinements it is found that there are significant differences in the actual bond path (Rij) and the conventional bond length. In the <b>cubic</b> phase the <b>distortions</b> in sulfate tetrahedral are more than in the orthorhombic phase which could be the expected driving force for the phase transition to occur.

40|$|Otoacoustic emissions, sounds {{generated}} by the inner ear, are widely used for diagnosing hearing disorders and studying cochlear mechanics. However, it remains unclear how emissions travel from their generation sites to the cochlear base. The prevailing view is that emissions reach the cochlear base via a backward-traveling wave, a slow-propagating transverse wave, along the cochlear partition. A different view is that emissions propagate to the cochlear base via the cochlear fluids as a compressional wave, a fast longitudinal wave. These theories were experimentally tested in this study by measuring basilar membrane (BM) vibrations at the <b>cubic</b> <b>distortion</b> product (DP) frequency from two longitudinal locations with a laser interferometer. Generation sites of DPs were varied by changing frequencies of primary tones while keeping the frequency ratio constant. Here, we show that BM vibration amplitude and phase at the DP frequency {{are very similar to}} responses evoked by external tones. Importantly, the BM vibration phase at a basal location leads that at a more apical location, indicating a traveling wave that propagates in the forward direction. These data are in conflict with the backward- traveling-wave theory but are consistent with the idea that the emission comes out of the cochlea predominantly through compressional waves in the cochlear fluids...|$|E
40|$|It has {{previously}} not {{been possible to}} measure eardrum vibration of human subjects {{in the region of}} auditory threshold. It is proposed that such measurements should provide information about the status of the mechanical amplifier in the cochlea. It is this amplifier that is responsible for our extraordinary hearing sensitivity. Here, we present results from a laser Doppler vibrometer that we designed to noninvasively probe cochlear mechanics near auditory threshold. This device enables picometer-sized vibration measurements of the human eardrum in vivo. With this sensitivity, we found the eardrum frequency response to be linear down to at least a 20 -dB sound pressure level (SPL). Nonlinear cochlear amplification was evaluated with the <b>cubic</b> <b>distortion</b> product of the otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in response to sound stimulation with two tones. DPOAEs originate from mechanical nonlinearity in the cochlea. For stimulus frequencies, f 1 and f 2, with f 2 /f 1 = 1. 2 and f 2 = 4 – 9. 5 kHz, and intensities L 1 and L 2, with L 1 = 0. 4 L 2 + 39 dB and L 2 = 20 – 65 dB SPL, the DPOAE displacement amplitudes were no more than 8 pm across subjects (n = 20), with hearing loss up to 16 dB. DPOAE vibration was nonlinearly dependent on vibration at f 2. The dependence allowed the hearing threshold to be estimated objectively with high accuracy; the standard deviation of the threshold estimate was only 8. 6 dB SPL. This device promises to be a powerful tool for differentially characterizing the mechanical condition of the cochlea and middle ear with high accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{encoding}} of both {{texture and}} depth maps of mul-tiview images, captured {{by a set}} of spatially correlated cameras, is important for any 3 -D visual communication system based on depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation among texture and depth maps of multiview images. More specifically, suppose we are given a coding tool to encode texture and depth maps at the encoder and a view-synthesis tool to construct intermediate views at the decoder using neighboring encoded texture and depth maps. Our goal is to determine how to best select captured views for encoding and distribute available bits among texture and depth maps of se-lected coded views, such that the visual distortion of desired con-structed views is minimized. First, in order to obtain at the encoder a low complexity estimate of the visual quality {{of a large number of}} desired synthesized views, we derive a <b>cubic</b> <b>distortion</b> model based on basic DIBR properties, whose parameters are obtained using only a small number of viewpoint samples. Then, we demon-strate that the optimal selection of coded views and quantization levels for corresponding texture and depth maps is equivalent to the shortest path in a specially constructed 3 -D trellis. Finally, we show that, using the assumptions of monotonicity in the predictor’s quantization level and distance, suboptimal solutions can be ef-ficiently pruned from the feasible space during solution search. Experiments show that our proposed efficient selection of coded views and quantization levels for corresponding texture and depth maps outperforms an alternative scheme using constant quanti-zation levels for all maps (commonly used in video standard im-plementations) by up to 1. 5 dB. Moreover, the complexity of our scheme can be reduced by at least 80 % over the full solution search. Index Terms — Bit allocation, depth-image-based rendering, 3 -D image coding...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an in-flight scale and distortion calibration procedure {{that has been}} developed for the Ball Aerospace Systems Division Fixed-Head Star Trackers (FHST's) used on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The FHST is a magnetically focused and deflected imaging sensor {{that is designed to}} track stars as faint as m(sub v) = 5. 7 over an 8 degree by 8 degree field of view. Raw FHST position measurements are accurate to approximately 200 arcseconds, but this can be improved to 10 - 15 arcseconds by processing the raw measurements through calibration polynomials that correct for flat field, temperature intensity, and magnetic field effects. The coefficients for these polynomials were initially determined using ground test data. On HST the use of three FHST's {{is an integral part of}} the preliminary attitude update procedures required before the acquisition of guide stars for science observations. To this end, FHST-based attitude determination having single-axis errors no worse than 22 arcseconds (1 sigma) is required. In early 1991 it became evident that one of the HST FHST's was experiencing a significant change in its optical scale. By mid- 1993 the size of this error had grown to a point that, if not corrected, it would correspond to a maximum position error on the order of 100 arcseconds. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that substantial, uncompensated <b>cubic</b> <b>distortion</b> effects had also developed, the maximum contribution to position errors from the cubic terms being on the order of 30 arcseconds. To ensure accurate FHST-based attitude updates, procedures have been developed to redetermine the FHST scale and distortion calibration coefficients based on in-flight data gathered during normal HST operations. These scale and distortion calibrations have proven very effective operationally, and procedures are in place to monitor FHST calibration changes on a continuing basis...|$|E
40|$|Carboplatin is {{a second}} {{generation}} platinum-containing anti-tumor drug which selectively alters the micromechanical function of the inner hair cells (IHCs) of the organ of Corti in the chinchilla. Data from a recent study [Wake et al., Acta Otolaryngol. 116 (1996) 374 - 381], using the chinchilla model, have suggested that a moderate dose of carboplatin alters the efferent feedback loop gain of the OHCs. The present {{study was designed to}} evaluate the possible 'efferent feedback alteration mechanism' in the Sprague-Dawley rat using distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). A moderate dose of carboplatin (50 mg/kg body weight) was administered by a 30 min i. p. infusion. Pre- and 72 -h post-treatment DPOAE and auditory brainstem response (ABR) recordings were acquired from a group of 12 rats. The animals were anesthetized with a ketamine-atropin anesthesia administered in two consecutive phases. The DPOAE responses (<b>cubic</b> <b>distortion</b> products) were recorded with four asymmetrical protocols: P 1 = 60 - 50, P 2 = 50 - 40, P 3 = 40 - 30 and P 4 = 30 - 20 dB SPL (sound pressure level), in the frequency range from 4. 0 to 16 kHz. ABR responses were obtained for bipolar clicks and tone pips at the frequencies 8. 0, 10. 0, 20. 0 and 30 kHz using stimuli in the range from 100 to 30 dB SPL. Significant ABR threshold shifts of 15 dB were observed at 30 kHz, and shifts of 10 dB at 20, 16 and 10 kHz. The comparison of pre- and post-treatment DPOAE responses did not reveal any significant changes for protocols P 1, P 2 and P 4. Data from the P 3 protocol indicated a decrease of the DPOAE amplitude. The findings from the rat model suggest that (a) moderate doses of carboplatin do not affect the efferent feedback loop OHC function and (b) the cochlear susceptibility to carboplatin across species is different, even at moderate-dose regime...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the great}} {{psychological}} effect deafness has on one's social life, the scientific community has long sought {{the best way to}} define the hearing function. The development of new technologies in this field has set "early intervention" as the primary target for screening. For this reason, within the contest of a program of audiological newborn hearing screening, the Authors have used data from a selected group of 1250 newborns to (a) compare the clinical feasibility and performance of three different DPOAE protocols and (b) establish the scoring criteria defining "pass" or "fail" responses. All subjects participating in this study were randomly selected and their normal hearing was verified by linear TEOAE recordings. The test was carried out, using an Otodynamics ILO 92 Analyser version 5. 60, {{on the second day of}} life or later (in case of extended recovery), during natural sleep and after feeding. The DPOAE recordings were elicited using asymmetric stimuli with L 1 > L 2 and a frequency-ratio of 1. 22 following three different SPL protocols: 60 - 50 dB (PR 1), 65 - 55 dB (PR 2) and 75 - 65 dB (PR 3). Five frequencies of the <b>cubic</b> <b>distortion</b> product (referring to f 2) were tested with an ILO macro at 1. 5 KHz, 2. 0 KHz, 3. 0 KHz, 4. 0 KHz and 5. 0 KHz. The statistical evaluation of differences in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) between the PR 1 and PR 2 protocols showed no significant differences. On the other hand significant differences were found between the PR 3 and the PR 2 S/N ratios, the former providing the best performance (higher values). The scoring criteria were defined by minimum free distribution tolerance intervals of the S/N ratios at the five tested frequencies. In conclusion this study confirms the feasibility of DPOAE recordings in a un iversal newborn hearing screening program and shows the appropriate pass-fail parameters to be used for this purpose. It should be noted that this approach enables acquisition of frequency-specific information which might further improve audiological diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Distortion product otoacoustic {{emissions}} (DPOAE or DP) {{are generated}} using two primary tones at frequencies f 1 and f 2 at levels L 1 and L 2; {{the two most}} prominent DP are <b>cubic</b> <b>distortion</b> products at the frequencies 2 f 1 f 2 and 2 f 2 f 1. Current understanding of their origin indicates that they arise via two distinct mechanisms. One mechanism {{is thought to be}} non-linear distortion and the other linear coherent reflection. Recent investigations have confirmed that both components are present in the 2 f 2 f 1 DP, which conflicts with current understanding of the generation mechanisms, suggesting that the location of origin of the DP at 2 f 2 f 1 may be different from that at 2 f 1 f 2. Distortion and reflection components of DP combine in the cochlea. One method to separate them is time window separation, which utilises phase variation in the frequency domain to infer latency in the time domain, by means of inverse Fourier transformation. It is independent of the location of generation of the DP but depends on the generation mechanism. By contrast, DP can be reduced by the introduction of a third suppressor tone, which can be used to infer the location of DP generation based of the suppressor tone frequency, independent of generation mechanism. The aim of this investigation was to assess the effect of suppressor frequency and level on the 2 f 2 f 1 DP, in order to make inferences about where this DP originates. Twenty normally hearing participants took part in the investigation. DP were measured (L 1 = 65, L 2 = 55 dB SPL) with a fixed frequency ratio f 2 /f 1 = 1. 05. By sweeping the primary frequencies in the ranges f 2 = 1. 75 - 2. 25 and 3. 75 - 4. 25 kHz, suitable fixed test frequencies were identified for subsequent suppression testing in each ear, as the frequencies giving DP with the greatest signal-to-noise ratio. The frequency sweeps also allowed analysis by time window separation. Suppression was carried out with suppressor levels introduced at 0, 20, 40 and 60 dB SPL. The frequency of the suppressor was altered from 32 Hz to + 64 Hz relative to the DP, in 16 Hz increments. Results of time window separation confirmed that both non-linear distortion and reflection components were present in both the 2 f 2 f 2 DP and 2 f 2 f 1 DP. However, {{it was not possible to}} separate the two components of the 2 f 2 f 1 DP by suppression, which suggests that the 2 f 2 f 1 DP is not generated at a discrete place. It is concluded that the generation mechanism for the 2 f 2 f 1 DP may be distributed along the cochlear partition at or basal to the characteristic place corresponding to the DP frequency...|$|E
