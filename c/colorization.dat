25|$|One of Roman Vishniac's {{most famous}} endeavors {{in the field}} of photomicroscopy was his revolutionary {{photographs}} from the inside of a firefly's eye, behind 4,600 tiny ommatidia, complexly arranged. In addition, there were the images taken at the medical school of Boston University of the circulating blood inside a hamster's cheek pouch. Vishniac invented new methods for light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy. His method of <b>colorization,</b> (developed in the 1960s and early 1970s) uses polarized light to penetrate certain formations of cell structure and may greatly improve the detail of an image.|$|E

5000|$|Soon {{after the}} WB-7A merger was complete, the studio had 79 of these {{black-and-white}} cartoons redrawn in color {{due to the}} increased demand for color cartoons by TV stations; these <b>colorizations,</b> produced in South Korea by Fred Ladd, have often been criticized for their inferiority to the original animation. The same 79 cartoons were colorized again in the early 1990s (along with 25 other cartoons not redrawn in 1968), this time using a computer to add color to the cartoons, thus preserving the original animation, but still the cartoons were shown {{in a way they}} were not meant to be seen. Some of the computer-colorized versions mistakenly use the 1936-37 Looney Tunes opening theme (also known as the [...] "Porky Signature") for the 1941-42 cartoons instead of [...] "The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down" [...] (possibly due to an oversight). Time Warner wouldn't own the a.a.p. Warner Bros. cartoons until 1996, when they merged with Turner Broadcasting System, owner of the a.a.p. package (via Turner Entertainment Co.).|$|R
25|$|In 2006 Legend Films {{released}} a colorized version of Plan 9 from Outer Space on DVD. Though the <b>colorization</b> process was largely done straight, unlike the campy bright colors {{used in the}} studio's release of Reefer Madness, {{there were a few}} alterations. Legend had auctioned off the opportunity to insert new material into the film through two auctions on eBay. The first allowed the auction winner to provide a photograph that is digitally inserted into part of the scene between the Ghoul Man and Paula Trent. The second allowed the winner to have his or her name placed on a gravestone during a scene with Wood regular Tor Johnson. The third alteration is at a point where Eros gets punched and his skin briefly turns green.|$|E
25|$|With the {{scheduling}} revamp, TMC {{greatly increased}} the number of films it aired on a monthly basis, from about 40 to more than 100 titles per month, with the addition of older films to the slate (which were presented without <b>colorization,</b> in direct contrast to Cinemax, which at the time had aired remastered color versions of some classic films on its schedule). In addition, TMC began incorporating trailers for current and upcoming feature films released initially for theatrical exhibition, which aired during promotional breaks between films until 1997. It also began airing a 15-second daily entertainment news interstitial focusing on the film industry, The Movie Channel News, featuring stories read by a continuity announcer – which varied depending on the segment – over a segment title graphic; the segment would be discontinued in May 1991.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} year, Newlywed and Days wore down Password. CBS daytime head Fred Silverman, {{who was not}} a {{personal}} fan of the genre, had seen enough by Spring 1967 and decided to cancel Password. The cancellation occurred after squabbles over where the show would be taped (New York City or Hollywood). Silverman wanted the show permanently moved to CBS Television City (where it was moved for part of the 1966–1967 season to allow the show to tape in color, as CBS' New York studios had dragged out its full switch to <b>colorization).</b> Host Ludden had moved to California at that time, and commuted back to New York for {{the last part of the}} 1966–1967 season. During that season, Bern Bennett and Lee Vines (who replaced Jack Clark as primary announcer) shared West Coast announcing duties, and when the show returned to New York, Vines made the commute as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to see the amount of Escherichia coli in six different brands of 19 liter reusable bottles of water, {{and see if there}} is {{a significant difference between the}} amount of Escherichia coli they include or not. According to this, I came up with the research question: Is there any difference in terms of the amount of Escherichia coli in 19 liters reusable plastic bottles from 6 different brands, indicated by the membrane filter method? Six different brands of 19 liter reusable bottled water were chosen by considering their popularity and their prices. The ones with low popularity and price were chosen since they have a higher risk of contamination and named in alphabetic order as A, B, C, D, E and F. The amount of Escherichia coli in them was determined by the membrane filter method. The method can be briefly explained like this: The water is poured down the membrane filter system where the membrane filters don’t allow the passage of bacteria. Then, the filter papers are put on different petri plates and incubated. If there is right type of <b>colorizations</b> then, further tests are done to determine if the colonies are E. coli or not. At the end of the process, the numbers of colonies that are found out to be E. coli is counted and a result is obtained. In this experiment, ANOVA test is used and it proved that there is a significant difference between the amounts of E. coli in different brands of water since the p value is approximately zero...|$|R
40|$|Information on exotic species' {{current and}} {{potential}} distribution {{is vital for}} decisions on management. Species distribution models can predict where <b>colorizations</b> are likely; however, the collection of species' distribution data over large areas in order to parameterize the models is costly. Therefore, modelling methods {{that are able to}} use low-cost information such as citizen-reported data are potentially very useful. In this study, we used the species habitat modelling program Maxent to predict the potential geographical distribution of two non-native insect species in Sweden, the butterfly Araschnia levana and the shield bug Graphosoma lineatum. For this we used citizen-reported presence-only open-access data in combination with climate and land cover data from national databases. Our models showed that presence of A. levana was best predicted by winter temperature and habitats related to open grasslands. For G. lineatum, summer temperature and open green areas, in both urban and rural areas were the best predictors for species presence. These models show that large areas of non-colonized potential habitats exist within Sweden. For A. levana these yet-to-be-colonized habitats are mainly in the south, while for G. lineatum these habitats occur in the south and along the Baltic Sea coast. Comparisons of temporal patterns in species reporting for A. levana and G. lineatum to similar insects with known stable populations revealed large 'willingness to report' effects that could potentially bias range expansion rates. Once corrected for, current distribution expansion rates were estimated as 1. 9 km/yr and 1. 07 km/yr respectively. The study shows the use of public reports in conservation science as a way of gathering species information over large areas. This increases the data sources available for researchers to predict the distribution of species and have the additional value of the involvement of the public in conservation efforts...|$|R

500|$|The <b>colorization</b> {{controversy}} was {{a factor}} in the passage of the National Film Preservation Act in 1988 which created the National Film Registry the following year.

Although Jack Matthews of the Los Angeles Times called the finished product [...] "state of the art", it was mostly met with negative critical reception. It was briefly available on home video. Gary Edgerton, writing for the Journal of Popular Film & Television criticized the <b>colorization,</b> [...] "...Casablanca in color ended up being much blander in appearance and, overall, much less visually interesting than its 1942 predecessor."

500|$|During {{the comic}} book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often {{slightly}} altered the <b>colorization</b> of the original source.

[...] Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an [...] "...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related stylistically to the de Kooning Women". When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the Campbell's Soup Cans series to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then producing. He once said [...] "I've {{got to do something}} that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." [...] Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol. Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like Popeye and Mickey Mouse.|$|E

2500|$|A {{cumulonimbus}} {{cloud that}} appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water; hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives the cloud a blue color.

[...] Supercell type storms {{are more likely to be}} characterized by this but any storm can appear this way. Coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm, it only confirms its potential. Since a green/blue tint signifies copious amounts of water, a strong updraft to support it, high winds from the storm raining out, and wet hail; all elements that improve the chance for it to become severe, can all be inferred from this. In addition, the stronger the updraft is, the more likely the storm is to undergo tornadogenesis and to produce large hail and high winds.|$|E
