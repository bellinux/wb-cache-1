40|$|By {{adopting}} a multilevel approach to understanding decisions taken in security and defence policies by European member states, the paper argues that <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Security and Defence Policy, <b>the</b> proliferation <b>of</b> ad-hoc <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>willing,</b> and <b>the</b> subcontracting <b>of</b> security tasks from the UN has worsened <b>the</b> challenge <b>of</b> parliamentary accountability in foreign, security and defence policies.

Since international security is traditionally regarded as <b>the</b> parcel <b>of</b> nation-states, transnational terrorism is a conceptual new-comer to <b>the</b> playground <b>of</b> politics.

The recurrent reason given for debating the role and relevance of alliances in regard to counterterrorism is discussed in the literature to be a systemic change in world affairs marked by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War and globalization. The latter must be disaggregated to determine the essential elements and features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systemic differences and related threats.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an interdisciplinary}} {{study on the}} external ‘Responsibility to Protect’ (R 2 P) and international law. It focuses on the legal customary process on jus ad bellum by which states try to address {{the gap between the}} legitimacy and legality of humanitarian intervention to protect human security within a state against genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> specific legal rights for the Security Council, regional organisations and ‘coalitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> willing’ to protect by military means is examined through case studies of humanitarian interventions after the Cold War. Constructivist perspectives on security and norms are contrasted with legal positivist analyses <b>of</b> customary law, <b>the</b> applicable law on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force, and evolutionary interpretation and informal modification of treaties. Feminist theories and gender perspectives on human security, the R 2 P and humanitarian intervention are also integrated into the thesis. The decisions to authorise humanitarian interventions in Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, East Timor and Darfur confirm an external R 2 P for the Security Council in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a lex lata right to protect by military means where states have manifestly failed to do so and where peaceful means are considered inadequate. Furthermore, a similar customary right for regional organisations may also be emerging, when the state concerned manifestly fails to protect, the Security Council is unable or unwilling to act and peaceful means found inadequate. Finally, support is found for a lex ferenda right <b>of</b> regional organisations, <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> and individual states to intervene by military means in ‘exceptional circumstances’ in accordance with the theories on ex post facto or implied authority, or <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> necessity, to protect people in humanitarian crises where <b>the</b> criteria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R 2 P doctrine are met...|$|R
40|$|Representing Europeans takes a {{fresh and}} quizzical {{look at the}} {{problems}} facing the European Union. Bringing decades of experience {{to bear on the}} deep, structural problems currently facing the EU, Richard Rose spells out why it can no longer carry on with integration by stealth. Extraordinary challenges — such as saving the Eurozone and maintaining <b>the</b> free movement <b>of</b> peoples — now impose high-profile economic and political costs. These create huge political strains which EU institutions struggle to cope with. Rose shows the ways in which Europe's institutions do and do not represent its citizens, sometimes equally and sometimes unequally. This threatens worse crises of EU authority because people retain the power as national citizens to protest against their government making commitments in Brussels that they do not accept. The book's pragmatic approach rejects the assumption that more European integration is the solution for all of Europes problems. Likewise, it rejects UK withdrawal from the European Union because Britain cannot stop the world and get off. Instead, it suggests a pragmatic approach that asks about proposals emanating from Brussels: What problem does it address? How will this policy work? What are its visible costs and benefits? Instead of 'one size fits all' policies being imposed on 27 diverse countries, Rose recommends that enhanced European cooperation should be based on <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>willing.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> active use <b>of</b> pan-European referendums on major reforms can test popular commitment to EU treaties that permanently advance European integration.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s a growing {{emphasis}} on peacebuilding has marked the international community’s responses to conflicts. Supporters of peacebuilding have promoted it {{as a new}} international idea, usually tracing it back to then United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali’s An Agenda for Peace in 1992 in which he proposes responsibilities and responses for the UN and the international community. Peacebuilding is expressed in different forms – a set of policies, a humanitarian agenda, or a way of conflict resolution – but all involve <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> efforts made to prevent a relapse into conflict. We analyse debates about peacebuilding in order to clarify its character and history. We argue that despite appearing as something new, peacebuilding has the same assumptions as modernisation theory. Once considered dead, modernisation theory has been reborn, in radicalised form, as peacebuilding. <b>The</b> stages <b>of</b> modernisation, once understood to progress over many decades, have been shortened. Projects are ambitious, at times involving no less than a fundamental change of behaviour and values in target populations and these, too, in short order. Projects are claimed by powerful countries and <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> prepared to interfere in domestic affairs, with outsiders’ direct influence on <b>the</b> domestic affairs <b>of</b> countries in <b>the</b> South increasing by leaps and bounds. Why was this revised form of modernisation needed? Bretton Woods hegemons needed a strategy for dealing with challenges to the status quo.

Part 3 considers <b>the</b> discourses <b>of</b> peacebuilding and imperialism together, outlining <b>the</b> main arguments <b>of</b> critics.

Oslo, NUPI. 27 sider. Responsibility to Protect no. 3. This report focuses on <b>the</b> {{question}} <b>of</b> where authority should be located for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force. This {{question has been}} a matter of considerable controversy since NATO unilaterally employed force to protect the Kosovars in March 1999. At <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> this debate has been <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> UN Security Council should be the only body that can authorise <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force for humanitarian purposes. Or alternatively, are there substitutes for Security Council authority that can and should be invoked ? both legally and morally ? in cases where the Council is either unable (because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> veto) or unwilling (because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> majority support in the Council) to act to prevent or end mass atrocities. Restricting itself to a focus on <b>the</b> military dimension <b>of</b> R 2 P, this report identifies seven models of authority which span the boundary from consent to non-consensual action. These are: (1) consent freely given; (2) coerced and induced consent; (3) Security Council authorisation; (4) the Security Council as a global jury; (5) General Assembly authorisation; (6) Regional arrangements; and (7) <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>willing.</b> <b>The</b> level <b>of</b> controversy regarding <b>the</b> legitimacy and legality of using force for protection purposes increases as intervention moves into the non-consensual realm. Even if governments disagree about <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> using force, it is recognised that sovereign states have the right to request such assistance. Indeed, the UN Secretary-General and his advisors have identified assisting (the military component is only one dimension here) states in fulfilling their responsibilities for protection as a key goal in operationalising the 2005 Outcome Document. However, as my report argues, the boundary between consent and non-consent is an imprecise one, and it is necessary to recognise that consent for military deployments is often secured through <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> coercive pressures (as with <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> East Timor in September 1999) as well as inducements in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> rewards. From <b>the</b> seven models <b>of</b> authority identified, five are ones that might be employed by governments in cases where a target state is ?manifestly failing? to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity? (as set out in paragraph 139 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Outcome Document). The least controversial here is Security Council authorisation, but <b>the</b> proclivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council to interpret Article 39 of Chapter VII as permitting such uses of force is a recent normative development, and one that should not be underestimated when set against the Security Council?s narrow statist interpretation of Article 2 (7) during the Cold War. Nevertheless, the report points out that whilst <b>the</b> new norm <b>of</b> Security Council authorised protection has enabled interventions that were previously unthinkable, this has not ensured that action has been taken when it was most desperately needed such as in Rwanda, and more controversially in Darfur. There is also the possibility that future cases might see the Council reversing this expansive interpretation of Chapter VII, and many governments in the Non-Aligned Movement remain sensitive about the Council expanding its competence into matters that were previously covered by Article 2 (7) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Charter. The report explores <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> General Assembly authorisation when the Security Council is deadlocked (as could have happened if Western governments had sought a mandate for intervention in Darfur). However, this poses a host of problems that will caution governments, especially those with a vested interest in maintaining <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> veto from pressing their claims in this body. The legitimacy that would flow from an affirmative vote in the General Assembly is the strongest argument here, but critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Assembly who favour vesting authority in a ?concert of democracies? would reply that decisions on whether to save endangered peoples should not rest with an Assembly that is comprised {{of a large number of}} governments that do not have good human rights credentials in their own jurisdictions. The above criticism opens up the much larger question of UN reform but advocates of R 2 P have not been afraid to enter this terrain. The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty argued in 2001 that the five permanent members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Security Council (P 5) should limit <b>the</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> veto in cases where there was majority support for a resolution authorising intervention for human protection (unless vital interests were at stake). However, such a proposal would not resolve divisions between the P 5 such as those that arose over Kosovo because what was at stake in the latter case was not a capricious Russian and Chinese threat to veto NATO?s action but genuine differences of opinion over whether <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force was warranted. Moreover, what made the Kosovo case such a difficult one for the Council was that NATO was seeking a mandate (though it never tabled a formal resolution) to use force to prevent what it argued was an impending humanitarian catastrophe. Justifying preventive or anticipatory intervention for protection purposes is extraordinary difficult because action <b>will</b> always lack <b>the</b> legitimacy that comes from media reports of mass atrocities. This seems an inescapable problem and certainly one that will not be resolved by any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed reforms to the Security Council?s working methods or practices. Consequently, we are left with <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> future Kosovo-type situations where the permanent members (perhaps expanded beyond the P 5) are divided on <b>the</b> merits <b>of</b> military action. Yet the Security Council?s handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kosovo case might also offer the best precedent for how the international community should cope with future cases <b>of</b> this kind. <b>The</b> lesson <b>of</b> Kosovo, and especially <b>the</b> abject defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian draft resolution condemning the bombing, is that Council members are not ready to legally sanction armed intervention for humanitarian purposes that lacks express Council authorisation. But neither will they always condemn it. A majority of Council members were persuaded that NATO?s breach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strict procedural rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UN Charter should be excused and in this sense it operated an international equivalent to mitigation in domestic law. By contrast with those liberal interventionists who wish to establish <b>the</b> principle that <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> have <b>the</b> authority to consider using force in cases where the Security Council is paralysed from acting, <b>the</b> Kosovo model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Security Council as a global jury has <b>the</b> virtue <b>of</b> not directly challenging the Council?s authority whilst also preserving an emergency exit when it is ?manifestly failing? to protect populations from genocide and mass killing...|$|R
