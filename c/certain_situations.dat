5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{can also}} be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to <b>certain</b> <b>situations</b> such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal brain herniation.|$|E
5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in <b>certain</b> <b>situations,</b> especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses {{on the advice of}} Bates' book, wrecked his car.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to early Qenya, the grammar of Quenya {{was influenced by}} Finnish, an agglutinative language, but much more by Latin, a synthetic and fusional language, and also Greek, from which he probably took {{the idea of the}} diglossia of Quenya with its highly codified variety: the Parmaquesta, used only in <b>certain</b> <b>situations</b> such as literature. Also the phonology of Quenya was inspired by certain aspects of Finnish, but this is not easily recognised.|$|E
5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in <b>certain</b> <b>situations.</b> In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In <b>certain</b> <b>situations</b> it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during <b>certain</b> <b>situations,</b> such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In <b>certain</b> <b>situations,</b> anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{stresses}} {{the dynamic of}} players' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to <b>certain</b> <b>situations</b> and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues Squall has through the game.|$|E

5|$|Three {{positions}} {{are specific to}} the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H) and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off of a tee; however, a holder {{may be used in}} <b>certain</b> <b>situations,</b> such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR).|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In <b>certain</b> <b>situations</b> gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E
5|$|During <b>certain</b> <b>situations</b> {{the player}} {{will be put}} in a perilous situation, where they will be {{prompted}} to choose between two possible actions or suffer a certain penalty, if not instant death. These choices affect how the story unfolds and which ending is achieved. Additionally, a creature called Nemesis is encountered multiple times throughout the game as a recurring boss. Nemesis is considerably more powerful than the player and has the ability to use a rocket launcher as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and pursue the player from one area to the next. During one of these encounters, the player can choose to either fight Nemesis or run until he is evaded. A variety of encounters are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on certain choices made by the player. Even if evaded or defeated during one of these encounters, Nemesis will inevitably continue to pursue the player {{until the end of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|In {{the game}} of baseball, the {{official}} scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in <b>certain</b> <b>situations,</b> and wild pitches, {{all of which are}} included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.|$|E
5|$|The Sun Bowl was not {{the only}} bowl game to involve racial exclusion. Many {{football}} games during the twentieth century affected the integration of collegiate football and sports in general: in addition to Lafayette, there were games played at The University of California, Los Angeles (19381941), Drake University (19481952), Georgia Tech (19541956), and the University of Wyoming (19671970) that led to integrated football games. At the time, these schools conducted studies to monitor the treatment of African American players and how the schools reacted to <b>certain</b> <b>situations</b> involving segregation and prejudice. The teams that were in favor of African Americans participating in football gave players a chance to speak out against the racism {{that took place in the}} sport. As a result of protests and communities coming together to support black football players, college football slowly became integrated.|$|E
5|$|In most battle situations, Aya is {{accompanied}} by a group of allied NPC (non-playable character) soldiers that the player can direct around the battle area. Available commands include offering supporting fire, directly attacking enemies, or staying behind cover. They can also all fire at the same enemy in <b>certain</b> <b>situations,</b> dealing high damage. Each NPC has a separate health meter, and is permanently removed from battle upon defeat. Central to combat is Overdive, an ability which enables Aya to transmit herself between bodies. If her health is low, Aya can transport into the body of an allied NPC, taking on their health level, position and current weapon in the process. NPCs not controlled by Aya are controlled by the game's AI. Aya can remain in a body for the duration of a level, or until the unit has died. If Aya cannot jump to another body, she dies and the level must either be restarted or exited. Overdive can be activated at any time, enabling Aya to transport around the battlefield to avoid enemy attacks or save herself when her current unit's health is low. Overdive {{can also be used to}} attack enemies if Aya maintains a sustained assault. After a time, a triangle icon appears on enemies, allowing her to perform an Overdive attack, dealing high damage to the targeted enemy.|$|E

5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of <b>certain</b> <b>situations</b> – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E
5|$|Infamous is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts {{with the world of}} Empire City through Cole's newly gained electricity-based powers; these are used for movement, offense and defense in combat, and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City. In order for Cole to use his powers, he must have stored electrical power, represented by a node meter on the player's heads up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings; recharging also restores Cole's health, which is indicated by blood splattering onto the screen. The more damage that Cole takes, the more blood that covers the screen. When Cole's health is at a critical level, the screen will turn black and white, and if Cole takes a little bit more damage while the screen is black and white, a heartbeat will be heard and will get slower and slower as Cole takes more damage, until it is beating dangerously slow. At this point, further damage to Cole will kill him. If the player stays out of battle long enough, Cole's health will regenerate over time. The game features seventeen different electrical powers, ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole's energy to wide-field lightning storms that drain most of Cole's energy. The player can use such powers, giving the player options in <b>certain</b> <b>situations.</b> For example, the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents, then restrain them or fire at the body to kill the enemy.|$|E
