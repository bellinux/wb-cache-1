500|$|One of Manne's most adventurous 1960s collaborations {{was with}} Jack Marshall, the guitarist and {{arranger}} celebrated for composing the theme and incidental music for The Munsters TV show in that period. Two duet albums (Sounds Unheard Of!, 1962, and Sounds!, 1966) feature Marshall on guitar, accompanied by Manne playing drums {{and a wide}} variety of percussion instruments unusual in jazz, from [...] "Hawaiian slit bamboo sticks", to a <b>Chinese</b> <b>gong,</b> to castanets, to piccolo Boo-Bam.|$|E
2500|$|Film and {{television}} references to The Mikado include {{the climax of}} the 1978 film Foul Play, which takes place during a performance of The Mikado. In the 2010 episode [...] "Robots Versus Wrestlers" [...] of the TV sitcom How I Met Your Mother, at a high-society party, Marshall strikes an antique <b>Chinese</b> <b>gong.</b> The host rebukes him: [...] "Young man, that gong is a 500-year-old relic that hasn't been struck since W. S. Gilbert hit it at the London premiere of The Mikado in 1885!" [...] Marshall quips, [...] "His wife's a 500-year-old relic that hasn't been struck since W. S. Gilbert hit it at the London premiere".|$|E
2500|$|Wilson avoided {{standard}} rock percussion {{because he}} wanted his productions to sound more [...] "delicate" [...] and less [...] "boomy". Van Dyke Parks said: [...] "The first thing I can remember in the studio was how Brian used tuneful percussion, like a piano or a <b>Chinese</b> <b>gong.</b> Even a triangle has pitch. Brian was very fond of pitched instruments. They {{reminded me of the}} orchestrations of the early 20th century done by people like Percy Grainger, the man who wrote 'Country Gardens', who was infatuated with tuneful percussion. He stood out in my youth as a great composer because of what he did with sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.' He's feeling a certain thing, but coming at it from a musical idea rather than the conventions of the instrument." [...] One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and [...] "Don't Talk".|$|E

2500|$|In late 1959, Shindo's album [...] "Brass and Bamboo" [...] was {{released}} by Capitol Records. [...] The album featured 10 standards and two original compositions by Shindo, combining the sounds of traditional Japanese instruments, including koto, samisen, and bamboo flutes, with Western brass with [...] "orchestration in tempos and moods that range from ballads to swing." [...] The fanfare drums used in the recording were borrowed from the Tenrikyo Church in Los Angeles, and musicians from the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra contributed a <b>Chinese</b> <b>gong</b> acquired {{on a trip to}} Hong Kong. [...] At the time of the album's release, Shindo said: [...] "It [...] [...] [...] introduces a foreign sound to the American ear. Oriental instruments have been used for solo passages in record before, but as far as I know {{this is the first time}} they have ever been an integral part of the arrangements." [...] One reviewer rated it as the [...] "Album of the Month" [...] for April 1960, calling it a [...] "sparkling debut" [...] with [...] "a new, refreshing blend of music of the East and West, big band dance arrangements spiced with exotic instrumental sounds of the orient." [...] Esquire magazine in 1960 wrote: [...] "Tak mixes ancient Eastern and modern Western instruments in a steamy dance sukiyaki." [...] Another reviewer wrote that [...] "the music is neither Oriental nor jazz, but a delightful, different sound" [...] providing [...] "nothing but fun for stereo fanciers." [...] Writing for allmusic.com, Richard Pierson wrote that Shindo's [...] "skillful arrangements of big band chestnuts and Hollywood theme tunes achieved a blend that was witty, cosmopolitan, and almost immediately outmoded as the ascendancy of rock and its youth market turned American pop music into an arena of generational identity politics." ...|$|E

5000|$|In western music, China-type cymbals are a {{distinct}} type of crash cymbals designed {{to produce a}} bright, crisp, and explosive tone.

40|$|By {{analyzing}} {{the structures of}} the sound tracks of JUDOU, this thesis aims to reveal Zhang Yimou 2 ̆ 7 s high sensitivity and his cinematic expertise. The structural analysis of these sound tracks aims to explain {{the relationship between the}} sound tracks as the audio expression and the stroy itself. The audio component of this movie is characterized by its restrained usage―only two musical melodies and sound effects such as <b>Chinese</b> <b>gongs,</b> jingling of horse bells, running water, birds calling, and dying machines rattling. These sounds connote a certain meaning, similar to a leitmotif. Therefore, these sounds are not intended to only accompany the visual content but also narrate the story more clearly. JUDOU, despite its seemingly predictable plot, contains many bold experimental challenges in terms of its audio effects...|$|R
