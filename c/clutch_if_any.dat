50|$|The system employs sensors on {{the clutch}} pedal, gear shift, and transmission, and is coordinated by the ECU. When the clutch pedal is depressed, the system {{waits for the}} user to either move the shifter to a {{different}} position, or to re-engage the <b>clutch.</b> <b>If</b> a new gear is never selected but the clutch has been depressed {{long enough for the}} engine to lose speed, the system will bring the engine back to speed for the same gear if the driver begins to raise the <b>clutch.</b> <b>If</b> the shifter is moved to a higher gear and the clutch is re-engaged quickly, the system will let the natural deceleration of the engine sync the drive train with the higher gear. <b>If</b> the <b>clutch</b> is depressed long enough for the engine to fall below the speed of the higher new gear, the computer will blip the throttle to bring the engine back to speed. Most usefully, if a new, lower gear is selected, the computer will accelerate the engine to the new estimated speed, {{even to the point of}} redline.|$|R
50|$|While {{the exact}} {{mechanism}} {{of how the}} female controls the stored sperm to fertilize her eggs remains unclear, {{it is believed that}} the specialized pockets found in the reproductive tract play a key role. As a result, a female can mate with multiple males and choose when to fertilize her eggs. Furthermore, females can also produce offspring that can feature genetic material from multiple males in a single <b>clutch</b> <b>if</b> she mated with more than one male.|$|R

50|$|When {{the engine}} reaches a certain speed, the clutch activates, working {{somewhat}} like a continuously variable transmission. As the load increases, the speed drops, disengaging the clutch, letting the speed rise again and reengaging the <b>clutch.</b> <b>If</b> tuned properly, the clutch {{will tend to}} keep the speed {{at or near the}} torque peak of the engine. This results in a fair bit of waste heat, but over a broad range of speeds it is much more useful than a direct drive in many applications.|$|R

As well as the rear axle, the AWD front axle has a lockable differential. The ZT 305 also has brakes for the front wheels, bigger tyres and rear twin tyres, it was developed for slopes with gradients of up to 45 %.|$|R

50|$|This is an {{electric}} motor to automate the opening and closing of the car trunk door. When the trunk door lowers, if a sensor detects an obstruction such as a bag or hand, it will signal the motor to stop. The tolerance ring protects the motor and gearing from excessive force, acting as a <b>clutch.</b> <b>If</b> the trunk is subjected to a force opposite to the motion (i.e. when someone is manually opening the trunk when it is automatically closing), the tolerance ring will allow the components to slip against each other, at certain torque levels. This protects the other components in the trunk mechanism.|$|R

40|$|Avian eggs contain {{substantial}} {{amounts of}} maternal androgens, and several {{studies have indicated that}} these are beneficial for the chick. Nevertheless, there is a large and systematic variation in maternal hormone concentrations both within and between <b>clutches.</b> <b>If</b> maternal androgens also involve costs, this might explain why not all mothers put high levels of androgens in their clutches. However, the simultaneous occurrence of both benefits and costs has not yet been convincingly demonstrated. We show experimentally that yolk androgens suppress immune function and simultaneously stimulate growth in black-headed gull chicks. Thus, mothers face a trade-off between these costs and benefits and may tune hormone deposition to prevailing conditions that influence chick survival. ...|$|R
