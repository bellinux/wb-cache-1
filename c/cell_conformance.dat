40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how {{the concept of}} <b>cell</b> <b>conformance</b> testing developed within the CCITT could apply for connections with two types of traffic (namely with both CLP= 0 and CLP= 1 cells) in the Traffic Contract recommended by the CCITT (i. e., declaration of the peak cell rates of the CLP= 0 and the aggregate CLP= 0 + 1 cell streams). This issue is crucial {{in the sense that}} this Traffic Contract could be invalid if it were impossible to define an unambiguous conformance testing procedure. We show that most of the <b>cell</b> <b>conformance</b> testing mechanisms that could be naturally considered suffer from an undesirable phenomenon, namely measurement phasing which jeopardizes their use. We then propose a mechanism for <b>cell</b> <b>conformance</b> testing which does not suffer from any problem of measurement phasing and which can account for cell tagging. Along with this mechanism we propose a method of computing reference Cell Loss Ratios for connections with both CLP= 0 and CLP= 1 cells...|$|E
40|$|Background. Oxygen and glucose are two {{important}} nutrients for mammalian cell function. In this study, {{the effect of}} glucose and oxygen concentrations on C 2 C 12 cellular metabolism was characterized {{with an emphasis on}} detecting whether <b>cells</b> show oxygen <b>conformance</b> (OC) in response to hypoxia. Methods. After C 2 C 12 cells being cultured in the levels of glucose at 0. 6 [*]mM (LG), 5. 6 [*]mM (MG), or 23. 3 [*]mM(HG) under normoxic or hypoxic (1 % oxygen) condition, cellular oxygen consumption, glucose consumption, lactate production, and metabolic status were determined. Short-term oxygen consumption was measured with a novel oxygen biosensor technique. Longer-term measurements were performed with standard glucose, lactate, and cell metabolism assays. Results. It was found that oxygen depletion in normoxia is dependent on the glucose concentration in the medium. Cellular glucose uptake and lactate production increased significantly in hypoxia than those in normoxia. In hypoxia the cellular response to the level of glucose was different to that in normoxia. The metabolic activities decreased while glucose concentration increased in normoxia, while in hypoxia, metabolic activity was reduced in LG and MG, but unchanged in HG condition. The OC phenomenon was not observed in the present study. Conclusions. Our findings suggested that a combination of low oxygen and low glucose damages the viability of C 2 C 12 cells more seriously than low oxygen alone. In addition, when there is sufficient glucose, C 2 C 12 cells will respond to hypoxia by upregulating anaerobic respiration, as shown by lactate production...|$|R
