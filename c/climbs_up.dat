5|$|At {{the base}} of the first drop, the train banks a few degrees to the right and climbs the first air-time hill and descends. Following this, the train <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> to a hairpin 180-degree hammerhead turn to the left. The train descends from the height of the turn to travel up and over three more air-time hills. After the hills, the train <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> a steep slope into the mid-course brake run.|$|E
5|$|After the {{momentary}} reduction in speed, the train {{turns to the}} right and descends into a downward 540-degree helix. Immediately following the first helix, the train climbs into an upward 270-degree helix to the left. Following the climb is a small descent and a final hill. The train <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> from the final hill into the terminal brake run.|$|E
5|$|From Rosendale, NY32 <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> {{out of the}} Rondout {{valley and}} veers east into the hamlet of Maple Hill, where it crosses over the Thruway once again. It resumes a northerly course through Bloomington, and several miles further on crosses the Kingston city line.

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is insectivorous and <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> {{tree trunks}} like a mouse, {{to search for}} insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill. It then flies {{to the base of}} another tree with a distinctive erratic flight. This bird is solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts in cold weather.|$|E
5|$|The path now turns south again, {{passing the}} village of Perranuthnoe (or Perran) and Perran Sands, then {{skirting}} inland across the neck of Cudden Point to Prussia Cove and Bessy's Cove. A larger sandy beach is Praa Sands after which the path <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> onto a series of cliff tops such as Trewavas Head. This area shows many signs of Cornwall's mining history with abandoned engine houses such as Wheal Prosper close to the path.|$|E
5|$|While {{hunting the}} boar, Michael is wounded {{by one of}} the animals. Kate starts leading Michael back to the beach, while Locke goes on his own into the jungle. As Kate and Michael head back, she <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> a tree to attach the antenna. However, before she can finish, she hears the sounds of the monster, causing her to drop and break the equipment. The Monster heads {{straight}} for Locke, who stares straight at it.|$|E
50|$|The {{first floor}} was {{reserved}} for {{the lord of the}} manor. It is reached by <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> the monumental stairway on flying buttresses extending about two metres from the courtyard walls, which <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> the internal walls of the building.|$|R

5|$|Back in Oslo, {{his colleagues}} throw him a {{farewell}} party, but Odda timid manis {{uncomfortable with the}} attention. As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Janmashtami is {{the main}} festival that is celebrated during August and September with great fervor and piety {{as it was in}} the prehistoric times the abode of Krishna. The festival is marked by several night long {{celebrations}} to mark the birth of Krishna. Bhajans and sermons are part of the festivities. At midnight there is reenactment of Krishna's childhood in the form of Garba and Raas dances. On this occasion, the local boys create a pyramid and a young boy in the costume of Krishna <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> this pyramid to strike a pot holding butter, an act which Krishna had mischievously performed with the gopis.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{the river}} by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> {{to the main}} road, which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too {{dangerous}} and this road must be followed {{most of the way}} from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back {{to the level of the}} railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides.|$|E

5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E
5|$|The path {{crosses the}} harbour on the St Mawes Ferry and then passes St Anthony Head and Zone Point and northwards past {{the village of}} Portscatho and around Gerrans Bay. Beyond Nare Head is Portloe in Veryan Bay. The next big {{headland}} is Dodman Point after which the coast path resumes its northwards course through Gorran Haven and the fishing harbour at Mevagissey to Pentewan where the once busy dock has silted up with sand. The path then <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> around Black Head to reach Porthpean and then Charlestown. This was the first harbour to serve the china clay industry around St Austell and has featured in several films as {{it is home to}} a heritage fleet of sailing ships.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E

5|$|During an autopsy, Scully {{correctly}} deduces that Arlen was {{blinded by}} reptile venom. Meanwhile, Doggett and Harrison, having fallen into old bootlegger tunnels below the mansion grounds, encounter the creature and are sprayed with venom, temporarily blinding them. The two find Gary Sacks {{in dire need}} of medical attention nearby. Noting Doggett and Harrison's absence, Mulder searches the area around the mansion for clues and encounters the owner, Herman Stites, who identifies himself as a biologist. Mulder soon leaves the area as Stites notices Doggett about to escape the tunnels and knocks him back in. Mulder waits in his car in Stites' driveway until dark, telling Scully that he found the Apollo medallion near Stites' estate and is convinced Doggett is somewhere nearby. He spots the creature and chases it to the mansion where it <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> to a second floor. Mulder follows the creature into the house and down into the tunnels, where he encounters Harrison and Doggett. With the creature approaching, Mulder tells the still-blinded Doggett to open fire at him on his command. The blinded Doggett then shoots the creature as it leaps at Mulder; the deceased creature then turns into Stites.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of Exmouth, the coast path <b>climbs</b> <b>up</b> onto the High Land of Orcombe. This is the start of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The next town is Budleigh Salterton, beyond which lies the River Otter. The path then skirts Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay towards Sidmouth which sits {{at the mouth of the}} River Sid. Access to the beach is via a wooden {{staircase}} known as Jacob's ladder. Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon AONB. Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid. The cliffs have been heavily eroded, threatening cliff top homes and the footpath, which passes along the tops of the cliff, around Lyme Bay, avoiding The Undercliff towards Branscombe. The path then follows Seaton Bay past Beer, with Beer Quarry Caves a man-made cave complex, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through The Undercliff SSSI and NNR and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the state}} of the {{relationship}} between the two companies the MS was unhappy being wholly reliant on the Met for access to London and, unlike its railway to the north, south of Aylesbury there were several speed restrictions and long <b>climbs,</b> <b>up</b> to 1 in 90 in places. In 1898, the MS and the GWR jointly presented a bill to Parliament for a railway (the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway) with short connecting branches from Grendon Underwood, north of Quainton Road, to Ashendon and from Northolt to Neasden. The Met protested, claiming that the bill was 'incompatible with the spirit and terms' of the agreements between it and the MS The MS was given authority to proceed, but the Met was given the right to compensation. A temporary agreement was made to allow four MS coal trains a day over the Met lines from 26 July 1898. The MS wished these trains to also use the GWR route from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough into London, whereas the Met considered this was not covered by the agreement. A train scheduled to use the GWR route was not allowed access to the Met lines at Quainton Road in the early hours of 30 July 1898 and returned north. A subsequent court hearing found in the Met's favour, as it was a temporary arrangement.|$|E
