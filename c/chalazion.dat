40|$|Aim: To {{case report}} the {{efficacy}} of subcutaneous steroid injections {{in the treatment of}} multiple <b>chalazions</b> and to evaluate the safety of intralesional injection in primary and recurrent <b>chalazions</b> in juvenile patient. Case report: A 25 -year-old man noticed lesions which appeared on upper lid during past three months. It was clinically presented with three focal, large and painful nodules in upper right eyelid. Inflammation process began on May the 1 st of 2013. After one month in May 30 th 2013 was directly administered synthetic steroid, Kenalog- 40. Application of triamcinolone acetonide resulted in two satellite lesions, compared to the original, when the same incisions drained during the first surgery in July 5 th 2013, with topical antibiotic-steroidal drugs and hot compresses. Second surgery was in July 26 th 2013. Third surgery was performed in August 5 st 2013 with second application of Kenalog- 40. Combined treatment leads to recovery of clinical signs and inflammation of right upper eyelid with regressions of primary and recurrent <b>chalazions.</b> Conclusion: Two steroid subcutaneous injections produced complete resolution of multiple primary and recurrent <b>chalazions.</b> Clinical imperative was that recurrent or unusual refractory <b>chalazions</b> require referral to Hystopathological examination of curetting to exclude malignancy...|$|R
40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to compare {{the efficacy of the}} treatment of <b>chalazions</b> by injection of triamcinolone acetonide with conventional incision and curettage. Of the 39 injected cases 77 % resolved completely, though 54 % of the injected cases required a second injection. Of the 30 surgically treated cases 90 % resolved, but 27 % required a second operation. Injection of <b>chalazions</b> with a steroid suspension is a convenient and reasonably effective alternative to the standard surgical management of this common condition...|$|R

40|$|Aims : The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} different eyelid lesions appearing as a swelling or mass, using fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), to conduct a cytological diagnosis of these lesions with subsequent histopathological correlation, and to identify the problems faced during microscopical examination of the smears. Materials and Methods : Fine needle aspirates from 80 eyelid swellings and histopathological correlation in 62 cases were studied. Results: Forty eight cases of benign and 32 cases of malignant lesions were diagnosed by FNAC. The five leading benign lesions were <b>chalazions</b> (12 cases, 15 &#x 0025;), epithelial cysts (eight cases, 10 &#x 0025;), chronic nonspecific inflammation (six cases, 7. 5 &#x 0025;), seborrheic keratosis (five cases, 6. 25 &#x 0025;) and benign adnexal adenoma (four cases, 5 &#x 0025;). The most common malignant lesion was basal cell carcinoma (12 cases, 15 &#x 0025;) followed by sebaceous gland carcinoma (nine cases, 11. 25 &#x 0025;) and squamous cell carcinoma (eight cases, 10 &#x 0025;). Conclusions: Histopathological correlation showed that the accuracy of fine needle aspiration cytology in making diagnosis was 83. 87 &#x 0025;. Incidence of basal cell carcinoma in the study was lower, compared to most western studies. Therefore, there may be a racial and geographical variation...|$|R

50|$|<b>Chalazion</b> is a cyst in the eyelid {{due to a}} blocked oil gland. They are {{typically}} {{in the middle of}} the eyelid, red, and non painful. They tend to come on gradually over a few weeks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chalazion</b> {{surgery is}} {{normally}} performed by an ophthalmologist. This type of surgery {{is a simple}} procedure that is generally performed as a day operation, and the person {{does not need to}} remain in the hospital for further medical care.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chalazion</b> may {{be removed}} in two ways, {{depending}} on the size of cyst. Relatively small chalazia are removed through a small cut at the back of the eyelid. The surgeon lifts the eyelid so he or she can access the back of its surface and makes an incision of approximately 3 mm just on top of the <b>chalazion.</b> The lump is then removed, and pressure is applied for a few minutes to stop any oozing of blood that may occur because of the operation. Surgery of small chalazia does not require stitches, as the cut is at the back of the eyelid and therefore the cut cannot be seen, and the cosmetic result is excellent.|$|E
50|$|Larger chalazia {{are removed}} through an {{incision}} {{in front of}} the eyelid. Larger chalazia usually push on the skin of the eyelid, and this is the main reason why doctors prefer removing them this way. The incision is not usually larger than 3 mm and it is made on top of the <b>chalazion.</b> The lump is removed and then pressure is applied on the incision to prevent oozing. This type of surgery is closed with very fine stitches. They are hardly visible and are usually removed within a week after the surgery has been performed. Although chalazia are rarely dangerous, it is common to send the <b>chalazion</b> or part of it to a laboratory to screen for cancer.|$|E
50|$|In rare cases, {{patients}} are kept {{overnight in the}} hospital after <b>chalazion</b> surgery. This includes cases in which complications occurred and the patient needs to be closely monitored. In most cases however, {{patients are}} able to go home after the operation has ended.|$|E
50|$|People who undergo <b>chalazion</b> surgery are {{normally}} asked {{to visit their}} eye surgeon for post-op follow-up {{three to four weeks}} after surgery has been performed. They may start driving the day after surgery and they may return to work in one or two days.|$|E
5000|$|Other related {{conditions}} on the eyelids include <b>chalazion</b> ( [...] a granulomatous reaction to sebaceous glands on the eyelid), lacrimal duct cysts (cysts related to tear ducts) and nasolacrimal duct cysts (the nasolacrimal duct drains tears into the nose via a punctum on the lower eyelid).|$|E
50|$|If they {{continue}} to enlarge or fail to settle within a few months, smaller lesions may be injected with a corticosteroid, or larger ones may be surgically removed using local anesthesia. This is usually done from underneath the eyelid to avoid a scar on the skin. If the <b>chalazion</b> is located directly under the eyelid's outer tissue, however, an excision from above may be more advisable {{so as not to}} inflict any unnecessary damage on the lid itself. Eyelid epidermis usually mends well, without leaving any visible scar. Depending on the chalazion's texture, the excision procedure varies: while fluid matter can easily be removed under minimal invasion, by merely puncturing the <b>chalazion</b> and exerting pressure upon the surrounding tissue, hardened matter usually necessitates a larger incision, through which it can be scraped out. Any residual matter should be metabolized {{in the course of the}} subsequent healing process, generally aided by regular appliance of dry heat. The excision of larger chalazia may result in visible hematoma around the lid, which will wear off within three or four days, whereas the swelling may persist for longer. <b>Chalazion</b> excision is an ambulant treatment and normally does not take longer than fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, owing to the risks of infection and severe damage to the eyelid, such procedures should only be performed by a medical professional.|$|E
50|$|When {{surgery for}} a <b>chalazion</b> is considered, {{patients}} who take aspirin {{or any other}} blood-thinning medications are advised to stop taking them one week prior to the procedure as they may lead to uncontrollable bleeding. There are several tests taken prior the surgery {{to make sure the}} patient is in good condition for the operation.|$|E
50|$|After his {{discharge}} from the Army, Cardoza worked for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft in East Hartford, Connecticut, as a Heliarc welder on J-57 Jet engines, a trade he continued making a living from {{for a number of}} years into his show business career. However, in 1963, a doctor advised him to stop welding because of <b>chalazion</b> forming under his eyelids.|$|E
50|$|A <b>chalazion</b> {{may occur}} {{following}} a stye or from hardened oils blocking the gland. The blocked gland {{is usually the}} meibomian gland but can also be the gland of Zeis. A stye and cellulitis may appear similar. A stye, however, is usually more sudden in onset, painful, and occurs {{at the edge of}} the eyelid. Cellulitis is also typically painful.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} a stye is usually a {{bacterial}} infection by Staphylococcus aureus. The internal ones are due to infection of the meibomian gland while the external ones are due to an infection of the gland of Zeis. A <b>chalazion</b> {{on the other hand}} is a blocked oil gland without infection. They are typically {{in the middle of the}} eyelid and non painful.|$|E
5000|$|Staphylococcal {{blepharitis}} {{is caused}} by infection of the anterior portion of the eyelid by Staphylococcal bacteria. Symptoms include a foreign body sensation, matting of the lashes, and burning. Collarette around eyelashes, a ring-like formation around the lash shaft, can be observed. Other symptoms include loss of eyelashes or broken eyelashes. [...] The condition can sometimes lead to a <b>chalazion</b> or a stye.|$|E
5000|$|Stye {{complications}} {{occur in}} very rare cases. However, {{the most frequent}} complication of styes is progression to a <b>chalazion</b> that causes cosmetic deformity, corneal irritation, and often requires surgical removal. [...] Complications may also arise from the improper surgical lancing, and mainly consist of disruption of lash growth, lid deformity or lid fistula. Styes that are too large may interfere with one's vision.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chalazion</b> removal {{surgery is}} {{performed}} under local or general anesthesia. Commonly, general anesthesia is administered in children {{to make sure}} they stay still and no injury to the eye occurs. Local anesthesia is used in adults and it is applied with a small injection into the eyelid. The discomfort of the injection is minimized {{with the help of an}} anesthetic cream, which is applied locally.|$|E
50|$|Astigmatism may be {{corrected}} with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. Various considerations involving ocular health, refractive status, and lifestyle frequently determine whether one option {{may be better}} than another. In those with keratoconus, toric contact lenses often enable patients to achieve better visual acuities than eyeglasses. If the astigmatism {{is caused by a}} problem such as deformation of the eyeball due to a <b>chalazion,</b> treating the underlying cause will resolve the astigmatism.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chalazion</b> (plural: chalazia) {{is caused}} by the {{obstruction}} of the oil glands and can occur in both upper and lower eyelids. Chalazia may be mistaken for styes due to the similar symptoms. This condition is however less painful and it tends to be chronic. Chalazia heal within a few months if treatment is administered and otherwise they can resorb within two years. Chalazia that do not respond to topical medication are usually treated with surgery as a last resort.|$|E
50|$|Topical {{antibiotic}} eye drops or ointment (e.g., chloramphenicol or fusidic acid) {{are sometimes}} {{used for the}} initial acute infection, but are otherwise of little value in treating a <b>chalazion.</b> Chalazia will often disappear without further treatment within a few months, and virtually all will reabsorb within two years. Healing can be facilitated by applying a warm compress to the affected eye for approximately 15 minutes 4 times per day. This promotes drainage and healing by softening the hardened oil that is occluding the duct.|$|E
5000|$|Desmarres {{was one of}} {{the better}} known {{ophthalmic}} surgeons in 19th century France, and is remembered for an important textbook on diseases of the eye called TraitÃ© thÃ©orique et pratique des maladies des yeux (1847). He is credited for introducing a surgical procedure for pterygium, and has a number of surgical instruments named after him, including: [...] "Desmarres curved lid retractor", [...] "Desmarres corneal dissector" [...] and [...] "Desmarres <b>chalazion</b> forceps". His name is also associated with [...] "Desmarres' dacryoliths", defined as concretions consisting of Nocardia species, located in the lacrimal ducts.|$|E
50|$|Blepharitis {{usually does}} not cause {{permanent}} eyesight damage. Chronic blepharitis may result in damage of varying severity which may {{have a negative effect}} upon vision and therefore upon the eyeglass prescription. Long-term untreated blepharitis can lead to eyelid scarring, excess tearing, difficulty wearing contact lenses, development of a stye (an infection near the base of the eyelashes, resulting in a painful lump {{on the edge of the}} eyelid) or a <b>chalazion</b> (a blockage/bacteria infection in a small oil glands at the margin of the eyelid, just behind the eyelashes, leading to a red, swollen eyelid), chronic pink eye (conjunctivitis), keratitis, and cornea ulcer or irritation. The lids may become red and may have ulcerative, non-healing areas which may bleed.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, {{as a last}} resort, {{surgery is}} performed. The eyelid is {{injected}} with a local anesthetic, a clamp is put on the eyelid, then the eyelid is turned over, an incision is made {{on the inside of}} the eyelid, and the <b>chalazion</b> is drained and scraped out with a curette. A scar on the upper lid can cause discomfort as some patients feel the scar as they blink. Of course, as surgeries are intrusive and damage healthy tissue (e.g., leaving behind scar tissue or possibly even causing blepharitis), given other options, less intrusive treatment is always preferable. Similarly, chalazia may recur once the eye is predisposed and surgical intervention each time is not possible. So surgery should be considered only as a last resort, performed on as few as 5% of all chalazia patients.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of subcutaneous extralesional triamcinolone acetonide injection versus conservative treatment for <b>chalazion.</b> Design. Randomised controlled trial. Setting. Eye clinics of two regional hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients. Patients over 18 years old presenting with primary <b>chalazion</b> were randomised into two groups. In group 1, 12 patients were treated with lid hygiene, warm compresses, and chloramphenicol 1 % ointment 4 times a day. In group 2, 16 patients were treated with 0. 3 mL triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/mL) injection to the subcutaneous tissue extralesionally via the percutaneous route. Exclusion criteria were: acutely infected <b>chalazion</b> with preseptal cellulitis, recurrent <b>chalazion,</b> small <b>chalazion</b> (â¤ 2 mm), and prior treatment to <b>chalazion.</b> Main outcome measures. Size of <b>chalazion,</b> recurrence of <b>chalazion,</b> intraocular pressure, and complications from treatment, including skin pigmentary change or atrophy and pyogenic granuloma. Results. There was a clinically and statistically {{significant difference between the}} success rates in group 1 (58. 3 %) and group 2 (93. 8 %). In group 1, the mean prior duration of <b>chalazion</b> before treatment was significantly shorter in success cases than in failed cases.
