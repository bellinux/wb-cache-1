25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1960s, the footballing rivalry between England and Germany has been {{considered}} mainly an English phenomenon; this has been observed by several commentators of both English and German origin. In June 2009, British comedian Stephen Fry stated on the BBC show QI that, unlike the English, German football fans do not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> team's loss at the 1966 World Cup final and may not even remember that they had made it that far. Instead, German fans consider their rivalry with the Netherlands to be their traditional footballing rivalry and care more about the matches against them, such as the 1974 FIFA World Cup final.|$|E

25|$|Long-term {{decreasing}} {{rates in}} fertility and increasing life expectancy could have damaging consequences for almost every European nation. One consequence of ageing might be lower inflation rates as elderly {{people are more}} inflation averse and have sufficient political power for governments to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> preferences. These demographic trends provoked debate over the best policies that can reverse these trends and lessen their consequences. RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states {{that there should be}} an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement of social policy in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends. The research intends {{to examine the relationship between}} demographic trends and European government policies and determine which policies can reduce the consequences of low fertility and population ageing.|$|E

Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said that though the characters might be a turn-off to some viewers, the gore and [...] "derivative gall" [...] of the show were positives to fans of procedural dramas; TV Guides Matt Roush stated House was an [...] "uncommon cure for the common medical drama". Critics of The A.V. Club called House the [...] "nastiest" [...] black comedy from Fox since the 1996's short-lived television series Profit. Critics considered the series to be a bright spot among Fox's otherwise reality television-based broadcast schedule.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Horner is {{confident}} that he can seek out the married women {{who are willing to}} have affairs because {{they are the ones who}} do not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> honor. Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner’s lodgings despite his protest, conveying “his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch.” [...] They talk about him as if he was not present, referring to him as a ‘beast,’ ‘toad,’ and eunuch. Cohen says, “As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also ‘claps him on the back’ thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented.” [...] While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has “exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be.” [...] Horner’s true power is not in relationship to the women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.|$|E

[...] Stransky declared that he was [...] "tired of even wondering what's up with the Bolens," [...] as their [...] "who-cares-anyway mystery" [...] storyline continued to move too slowly. However, his interest in the storyline was renewed when John Barrowman joined the show as Patrick Logan, stating that the storyline had [...] "finally gotten hotter and, subsequently, better." [...] Stransky praised the [...] "sweet vendiction" [...] of the conclusion to Angie's storyline in the season finale. Cooper also enjoyed the conclusion of Angie's storyline, scoring her plot in the season finale with a 'B.' She wrote that de Matteo [...] "brought some needed fire and Italian backbone to a very bland street" [...] and was disappointed that the character was written off the series. However, Robert Bianco of USA Today dismissed the finale's devotion to resolving the Bolen family storyline, stating that the audience and other characters were not invested enough in the Bolens to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> life-threatening predicament or departure.

500|$|In November 2002, NCMP Steve Chia {{supported}} a motion by the Minister for Education stating that [...] "this House ...

[...] He suggested {{that there should be}} a focus on [...] "creative spontaneity", expressing the view that the education system in 2002 was one that focused on churning out a production line of workers, managers and instruction takers. Given that Singapore had reached the standards of a First World economy, Singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students, to encourage students to ask questions. He placed most emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the focus of education should be character building, stating: [...] "It will be failure of our education system if we are to train our best and brightest with our best resources only to be told that they are going to be the quitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion for the weak and the down; or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers; or that the elites only <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> own self-interests." ...|$|E
500|$|THQ was the {{publisher}} of the first game, but the studio put little effort into helping the game's development, leading to numerous technical issues and a lack of polish. However, the game's sales surprised THQ, and as a result, {{the publisher}} considered the first game a missed opportunity, and began to treat Metro as a franchise. Danny Bilson, then CEO of THQ, promised that the company would offer 4A more support and dedicate more resources in both the game's actual development and its marketing. Former THQ President Jason Rubin offered details of extremely difficult working conditions and demands put on the 4A Games team while completing the game. Their office was freezing due to frequent power failures, and the team was forced to smuggle computer equipment into the offices to avoid corrupt customs officials. Rubin added that {{the publisher of}}fered an unreasonably small budget to the development team, accounting for only 10% of its competitor's budget and that their workspace was so crowded and small that he compared it to [...] "a packed grade school cafeteria", and an [...] " [...] gym at EA Los Angeles". Rubin praised the team for producing a game that successfully achieved high critical praise in spite of the harsh working conditions. According to Andrew Prokhorov, Rubin was the only THQ president that to visit the studio. He noted that the team [...] "deserve the ratings [...] get" [...] and [...] "need no indulgence" [...] from consumers who do not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> working conditions.|$|E

500|$|The two kingdoms {{were based}} upon {{different}} cultures: Hoshido was themed after Japan, while Nohr used a Medieval European setting similar to earlier Fire Emblem games. The kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr {{were designed to}} contrast {{each other in a}} variety of ways, with the most obvious being its architecture: Hoshido was themed around light and air, while Nohr was themed around darkness and stone. When development first started, the team unanimously decided to ask Kozaki to return as character designer, as he had been for Awakening. The sheer number of characters this approach entailed made the staff worry about whether Kozaki would be willing to return. The Hoshido characters' clothing were influenced by Japanese culture and character designs drew inspiration from well-known people in Japan: a main instance was Ryoma, whose clothing was based on samurai, including historical figures such as Takeda Shingen, along with incorporating animal motifs such as lions. The colors used in their clothing were varied and mainly bright to emphasize the country's focus on light. For Nohr, a [...] "vampire-like taste" [...] equivalent to dark fantasy was used to highlight it as a kingdom where the sun did not shine. Kozaki used black and purple as key colors in character designs to create a cold and unified image. The nobility of Nohr were given similar design elements to represent their familial connections. The first character Kozaki designed was the Avatar. Kozaki did not put much thought into their general appearance, but took <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> clothing so that it was not overtly styled after either Hoshido or Nohr, keeping the neutrality of the player up to the main story decision point. They were given bare feet due to the animalistic impression Kozaki had after hearing of their strong ties to dragons, along with creating a [...] "hook" [...] for players equivalent to other characters in the game. The main key artwork, showing the two families together, was described by Kozaki as [...] "a pain to draw" [...] due to their clashing designs, and was the point of much discussion by staff before it was finalized. Azura was not included in artwork for the two physical editions, but she was more prominently presented in artwork surrounding Revelation as she played a much larger role in the story.|$|E

25|$|Perceived {{organizational}} support (POS) is {{the degree}} to which employees believe that their organization values <b>their</b> contributions and <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> well-being and fulfills socioemotional needs.

2500|$|Publishers Weekly {{said the}} third volume was [...] "one {{of the more}} {{rewarding}} examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy. [...] The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> fates. Those two fantasy greats are also evoked by Martin's ability to convey such sensual experiences as the heat of wildfire, the chill of ice, {{the smell of the}} sea and the sheer gargantuan indigestibility of the medieval banquet at its most excessive. Perhaps this saga doesn't go as far beyond the previous bounds of high fantasy as some claim, but for most readers it certainly goes far enough to command their attention." ...|$|E
