5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or <b>chromogenic</b> signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E
25|$|Beta-lactamase enzymatic {{activity}} {{can be detected}} using nitrocefin, a <b>chromogenic</b> cephalosporin substrate which changes color from yellow to red upon beta-lactamase mediated hydrolysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} uncertain, {{but it is}} thought to be caused by {{accumulation}} of epithelial squames and proliferation of <b>chromogenic</b> (i.e., color-producing) microorganisms. There may be an increase in keratin production or a decrease in normal desquamation (shedding of surface epithelial cells). Many people with BHT are heavy smokers. Other possible associated factors are poor oral hygiene, general debilitation, hyposalivation (i.e., decreased salivary flow rate), radiotherapy, overgrowth of fungal or bacterial organisms, and a soft diet. Occasionally, BHT may be caused by the use of antimicrobial medications (e.g., tetracyclines), or oxidizing mouthwashes or antacids. A soft diet may be involved as normally food has an abrasive action on the tongue, which keeps the filiform papillae short. Pellagra, a condition caused by a vitamin deficiency, may cause a thick greyish fur to develop on the dorsal tongue, along with other oral signs.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, the {{chemistry}} behind enzymatic detection compounds has been updated {{so that the}} indicating component is redox active, {{as opposed to the}} more usual <b>chromogenic</b> format, allowing faecal indicator bacteria such as E. coli and E. faecalis to be detected electrochemically without any sample pre-treatment. Since the colour of the detection compound is of no consequence, this allows detection in deeply coloured matrices.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chromogenic</b> color {{prints are}} full-color {{photographic}} prints made using <b>chromogenic</b> materials and processes. These prints may be produced from an original {{which is a}} color negative, slide, or digital image. The <b>chromogenic</b> print process was nearly synonymous with the 20th-century color snapshot.|$|E
5000|$|The first commercially {{available}} <b>chromogenic</b> print process was Kodacolor, introduced by Kodak in January 1942. Kodak introduced a <b>chromogenic</b> paper {{with the name}} Type-C in the 1950s, and then discontinued the name several years later. The terminology Type-C and C-print have remained in popular use since this time. The chemistry used to develop <b>chromogenic</b> prints today is known as RA-4. As of 2010, the major lines of professional <b>chromogenic</b> print paper are Kodak Endura and Fujifilm Crystal Archive. Plastic <b>chromogenic</b> [...] "papers" [...] such as Kodak Duratrans and Duraclear are used for producing backlit advertising and art.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>chromogenic</b> {{processes}} are C-41 for color (and <b>chromogenic</b> black-and-white) negative film, RA-4 for color negative paper (see Type C print), and E-6 for slide film.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chromogenic</b> {{refers to}} {{photographic}} processes that work by forming a conventional silver image and then {{replacing it with}} a dye image. Most films and papers used for color photography today are <b>chromogenic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some <b>chromogenic</b> {{black-and-white}} negative films also exist, {{mainly to}} exploit the wide availability of C-41 processing. These films have softer grain and less contrast than traditional silver halide films. In these films, a single emulsion layer has panchromatic sensitivity. The dye image is typically slightly blue because of the choice of dye couplers, and this tends to produce a dark sepia tone when printed on full-color <b>chromogenic</b> paper. Examples of black-and-white <b>chromogenic</b> negative films are Ilford XP2 Super and Kodak BW400CN.|$|E
50|$|The {{emulsion}} layers {{can include}} the colour dyes, as in Ilfochrome; {{or they can}} include colour couplers, which react with colour developers to produce colour dyes, as in type C prints or <b>chromogenic</b> negative-positive prints. Type R prints, which are no longer made, were positive-positive <b>chromogenic</b> prints.|$|E
