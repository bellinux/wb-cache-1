5|$|Fearful {{of arrest}} as a rebel once {{he left the}} Senate, Benjamin quickly {{departed}} Washington for New Orleans.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{article examines}} the phenomenon of ‘top people’s pay drift’ in UK public services in recent years, focusing on the senior civil service, <b>chief</b> <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> the National Health Service, and <b>chief</b> <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> local government. The article discusses why there is growing interest {{in the level of}} <b>chief</b> <b>executive</b> pay <b>in</b> these public services, which has culminated in the coalition government commissioning a ‘Review of Fair Pay in the Public Sector’. Drawing on recent evidence in the field, the article explains how top people’s pay is determined, top pay trends in these three sub-sectors, and the relationship of the pay of <b>chief</b> <b>executives</b> with that of lower level public servants. It concludes that levels of remuneration for <b>chief</b> <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> public services have been increasing faster than those for other public service workers and that top people’s pay is emerging as a public policy issue...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the <b>chief</b> <b>executive</b> positions <b>in</b> the Victorian and Queensland local government systems through Mintzberg’s three-dimensional model and Broussine’s capacity model, highlighting the complexities and diversities of these roles.
