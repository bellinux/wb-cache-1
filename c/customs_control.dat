2500|$|OLE <b>custom</b> <b>controls</b> were {{introduced}} in 1994 {{as a replacement for}} the now deprecated Visual Basic Extension controls.

OLE <b>custom</b> <b>controls</b> are usually shipped {{in the form of a}} dynamic link library with the [...]ocx extension. In 1996 all interfaces for controls (except IUnknown) were made optional to keep the file size of controls down, so they would download faster; these were then called ActiveX Controls.|$|R

On June 15, 2009, a larger, 45,000 m² international terminal completed construction {{in time for the}} BRICS summit, and took the role of Terminal B. The original one was merged with the domestic terminal. Terminal B has a capacity of 1600 pax/hour. The terminal consists of 2 floors and is conjoined to Terminal A. The ground floor houses the check-in desks, a baggage claim area with the baggage carousels, <b>customs</b> <b>control</b> and several retail stores. On the second floor there stand the security control, international business lounge, a duty-free shop, a smoking room and several retail shops. General renovations were made alongside the domestic renovation project. The business terminal was renovated as recent as February 2014.|$|E

The prototype fulfills the functionality well under both the Win 32 and the WinCE 6. 0 environment. Furthermore, the prototype efficiency is measured by testing time overhead for method calling crossing process boundaries in the prototype.
