40|$|Solids {{friction}} factor is a parameter required for predicting the {{pressure drop in}} a process of pneumatic conveying. It depends upon a number of non-dimensional parameters.

Although the model has been developed for a 2 m long straight pipeline with fly ash as the <b>conveying</b> <b>material,</b> it has also been scaled-up for a 173 m long straight pipeline.

40|$|There {{are many}} great {{advantages}} to using pneumatic conveying systems for transport of materials, {{one of these}} being flexibility of routing – a pneumatic pipeline can incorporate multiple changes of direction {{without the need for}} transfer points and additional drives which are needed everywhere a mechanical conveying system changes direction. However, one of the disadvantages of using bends in pneumatic conveyors is the wear of the bends, if the material being conveyed is at all abrasive e. g. if the particles are hard and angular such as minerals, coal, ash etc. Wear also often occurs in long straight sections just after pipe joints. This wear problem is often very costly, resulting in many unplanned stoppages for repair on systems conveying these materials, as well as producing severe mess from leakage of the material after a puncture. There are many different means of providing wear protection for bends and straight pipe sections, but they too can be costly, with the best wear resistant materials costing as much as 5000 per bend or even more to apply; and the wrong choice can lead to much wasted money if it does not give the protection hoped for. Other wear resistant solutions can severely increase the energy consumption of the conveyor, or limit its throughput, if applied too liberally. Hence {{it is very important to}} choose carefully the right means of wear protection. This paper will review the common sites and causes of conveying pipeline wear, and show that with the latest technology for characterising the erosiveness of the <b>conveyed</b> <b>material,</b> it is possible to choose a wear protection solution that will give cost-effective protection...|$|E

The <b>conveyed</b> <b>material</b> was flyash with a mean particle size of 30 μm and the solids loading ratio was in the range 20 – 70. A numerical study of gas–solid flow in complex three-dimensional systems was undertaken by means of commercial CFD software Fluent 6. 3. The simulation was performed using the Euler–Euler approach, accounting for four-way coupling. The calculated results of pressure gradient {{were found to be}} in good agreement with the measured data, with a fitting slope of 0. 781 for the first horizontal straight pipeline and 1. 017 for horizontal bend. It was also found that the pressure gradients increase with increase in particle diameter rapidly and reach the peak value when particle diameter is 150 μm, and then begin to decrease and show a slight steepening with increase in particle diameter with a value greater than 150 μm. An increase in particle density results in increase in pressure gradient. The pressure drop is much smaller when the roughness height is zero. The pressure gradient over the horizontal bend increases gradually with the increase of roughness height. The larger the roughness constant is defined, the greater the pressure drop will be. The bend pressure gradient decreases significantly when the bend radius ratio increases from 1 to 3, and then much slowly for bend radius ratios 3 – 6. With the increase of velocity difference, the pressure drop decrease is different at first, after 0. 2 – 0. 3 m, the pressure reduces the same...|$|E
40|$|The erosion {{processes}} {{resulting from}} flow of fluids (gas-solid or liquid-solid) are encountered {{in nature and}} many industrial processes. The common feature of these erosion processes is {{the interaction of the}} fluid (particle) with its boundary thus resulting in the loss of material from the surface. This type of erosion in detrimental to the equipment used in pneumatic conveying systems. The puncture of pneumatic conveyor bends in industry causes several problems. Some of which are: (1) Escape of the conveyed product causing health and dust hazard; (2) Repairing and cleaning up after punctures necessitates shutting down conveyors, which will affect the operation of the plant, thus reducing profitability. The most common occurrence of process failure in pneumatic conveying systems is when pipe sections at the bends wear away and puncture. The reason for this is particles of varying speed, shape, size and material properties strike the bend wall with greater intensity than in straight sections of the pipe. Currently available models for predicting the lifetime of bends are inaccurate (over predict by 80 %. The provision of an accurate predictive method would lead to improvements {{in the structure of the}} planned maintenance programmes of processes, thus reducing unplanned shutdowns and ultimately the downtime costs associated with these unplanned shutdowns. This is the main motivation behind the current research. The paper reports on two aspects of the first phases of the study-undertaken for the current project. These are (1) Development and implementation; and (2) Testing of the modelling environment. The model framework encompasses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) related engineering tools, based on Eulerian (gas) and Lagrangian (particle) approaches to represent the two distinct conveyed phases, to predict the lifetime of conveyor bends. The method attempts to account for the effect of erosion on the pipe wall via particle impacts, taking into account the angle of attack, impact velocity, shape/size and material properties of the wall and <b>conveyed</b> <b>material,</b> within a CFD framework. Only a handful of researchers use CFD as the basis of predicting the particle motion, see for example [1 - 4]. It is hoped that this would lead to more realistic predictions of the wear profile.

40|$|The author {{sketches}} the intellectuallandscape of twelfth-century Constantinople {{with the}} special reference to the trends in literature and variety of its genres. The period, dominated by the Komnenos dynasty, with an increasing economic prosperity and all its cultural and social consequences, generated a demand for trained bureaucrats in secular and ecclesiastical spheres and, as far as writers and literary practitioners are concerned, provided new possibilities of imperial and aristocratic families' patronage. By the 1120 s and 1130 s a more regular provision of higher education was in existence in Constantinople {{to such an extent}} that supply had outstripped demand. It bore a great significance as the extent to which writers depended on the patronage as their sole means of support was a new feature of the era. John Tzetzes' career is quoted as an example of this process and his literary output, covering much that would be classed now not as a literature but e. g. scholarship, leads to a problem of an understanding of a literature itself. The characteristic features of byzantine literature of the period are named, f. ex. the linguistic usages in fine writing, that followed those of the ancient grammarians and dictionaries and only on very rare occasions using the vernacular language that was in current use. The Byzantine literary production of the time, understood widely, conforms on the whole to the pattern, in which a deeply Christianized society focuses its most attention on composing and preserving material produced as aids to correct Christian thought and worship. In a consequence, secular material formed a very small proportion of the total writerly output and the existing literary forms aspired to <b>conveyed</b> <b>material</b> abhorent to many of the literary practitioners. There are, on the other hand, three particularly important divergences from what could be perceived as the standard Byzantine pattern. Writing in vernacular, colloquial Greek appears quite suddenly, usually in snippets, breaking the linguistic self-censorship that had been in place for centuries. Erotic fiction, created by Theodore Prodromos, Constantine Manasses. Niketas Eugenianos. Eumathios Makrembolites and the anonymous author of Digenis Akritis, reappeared in the form of novels created under the profound influence of the late antique authors. The third aspect is the copious production of verse for special occasions, a long Byzantine habit, deriving from the epideictic oratory of the Second Sophistic, and in the twelfth century widespread in the imperial and aristocratic households. The last part of the lecture focuses on Manganeios Prodromos, an author whose poetry of this genre survived, as well as on his social and literary connections (including a role of sevastokratorissa Eirene and lakovos Monachos) ...|$|E
