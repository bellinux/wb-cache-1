5|$|Blandy ordered Warren {{to explain}} his {{position}} to 1,400 skeptical officers and sailors. Some found him persuasive, but it was August 9 before he convinced Blandy. That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium was assumed to have a similar biological effect. When plutonium was discovered in the captain's quarters of Prinz Eugen, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that plutonium <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) was the women's {{branch of}} the British Army during the Second World War.

The ATS served in non combat roles as cooks, clerks and storewoman. Large numbers of ATS also served with the artillery divisions as crews for the guns, searchlights and barrage balloons. One notable ATS member was No. 230873 Second Subaltern Elizabeth Windsor, who trained as a driver and mechanic, drove a military truck, and rose {{to the rank of}} Junior Commander.

25|$|More than a {{month after}} the {{groundwater}} contamination was discovered, TEPCO started to contain the radioactive groundwater. They assumed that the radioactivity had escaped early {{in the beginning of the}} disaster in 2011, but NRA experts had serious doubts about their assumption. According to them, other sources could not be excluded. Numerous pipes were running everywhere on the reactor grounds to cool the reactors and decontaminate the water used, and leaks <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere.</b> TEPCO's solution resulted in redirection of the groundwater flows, which could have spread the radioactive contamination further. Besides that, TEPCO had plans for pumping groundwater. At that time the turbine buildings of units 2 and 3 contained 5000 and 6000 cubic meters of radioactive water. With wells in contact with the turbine-buildings, this could spread the radioactivity into the ground. The NRA announced that it would form a task force to find the leaks and to block the flow of the groundwater to the coastline, because the NRA suspected that the groundwater was leaking into the sea.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{possible}} to deploy radar decoys to confuse the defense. Decoys are made of lightweight materials, often strips of aluminum or mylar balloons, which can be packed in with the reentry vehicle (RV), adding little throw weight. In space, these are ejected to create a threat tube a few kilometers across and tens of kilometers long. Zeus had to get within about [...] to kill a warhead, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere</b> in the tube. The WSEG suggested that a single ICBM with decoys would almost certainly defeat Zeus. Considering a large missile with multiple warheads, a summer 1961 staff report by ARPA suggested a single missile could require four entire Zeus batteries to defeat it, making the system impractical.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of a set}} of complete dentures is a challenge for any dentist/denturist. [...] There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. [...] In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. [...] One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. [...] The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. [...] An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture {{in his or her own}} laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere</b> in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. [...] The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. [...] These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. [...] The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. [...] Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. [...] Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.|$|E
