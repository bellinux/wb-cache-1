As a different example, if we take a12 = a12 = 1, P = A, a22 = – (negative feedback) and a11 = 0 (no feedforward), we regain the simple result with two unidirectional blocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} motor {{redundancy}} is explored in numerous studies, usually {{with the goal}} of describing the relative contribution of a set of motor elements (e.g. muscles) in various human movements, and how these contributions can be predicted from a comprehensive theory. Two distinct (but not incompatible) theories have emerged for how the nervous system coordinates redundant elements: simplification and optimization. In the simplification theory, complex movements and muscle actions are constructed from simpler ones, often known as primitives or synergies, resulting in a simpler system for the brain to control. In the optimization theory, motor actions arise from the minimization of a <b>control</b> <b>parameter,</b> such as the energetic cost of movement or errors in movement performance.|$|E

Typically, {{there is some}} emergent behavior that the user would like to produce that is not directly controllable. Our goal is to develop an autonomous and domain-independent learning framework for adding non-explicit <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> to selforganizing systems that provide users with more intuitive realtime control of the system. These additional controls are created by using regression to learn a mapping between the explicit <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> and the non-explicit <b>control</b> <b>parameters.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Adaptation of <b>control</b> <b>parameters,</b> such as {{scaling factor}} (F), {{crossover}} rate (CR), and population size (NP), appropriately {{is one of}} the major problems of Differential Evolution (DE) literature. Well-designed adaptive or self-adaptive <b>parameter</b> <b>control</b> method can highly improve the performance of DE. Although there are many suggestions for adapting the <b>control</b> <b>parameters,</b> it is still a challenging task to properly adapt the <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> for problem. In this paper, we present an adaptive <b>parameter</b> <b>control</b> DE algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, each individual has its own <b>control</b> <b>parameters.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> of each individual are adapted based on the average parameter value of successfully evolved individuals’ parameter values by using the Cauchy distribution. Through this, the <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> of each individual are assigned either near the average parameter value or far from that of the average parameter value which might be better parameter value for next generation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more robust than the standard DE algorithm and several state-of-the-art adaptive DE algorithms in solving various unimodal and multimodal problems...|$|R
25|$|A {{fundamentally}} different mechanism for memristive behavior {{has been proposed}} by Pershin and Di Ventra. The authors show that certain types of semiconductor spintronic structures belong to a broad class of memristive systems as defined by Chua and Kang. The mechanism of memristive behavior in such structures is based entirely on the electron spin degree of freedom which allows for a more convenient control than the ionic transport in nanostructures. When an external <b>control</b> <b>parameter</b> (such as voltage) is changed, the adjustment of electron spin polarization is delayed because of the diffusion and relaxation processes causing hysteresis. This result was anticipated {{in the study of}} spin extraction at semiconductor/ferromagnet interfaces, but was not described in terms of memristive behavior. On a short time scale, these structures behave almost as an ideal memristor. This result broadens the possible range of applications of semiconductor spintronics and makes a step forward in future practical applications.|$|E

[...] Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when {{the order of the}} system was destroyed.

[...] In quantum phase transitions, [...] the temperature is set to absolute zero, and the non-thermal <b>control</b> <b>parameter,</b> such as pressure or magnetic field, [...] causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations originating from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct ground states of the Hamiltonian.

40|$|Prediction of {{tool wear}} pattern for sheet metal {{stamping}} die for processing of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) parts is a highly challenging task in automotive applications as there are many <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> involved in the production. It {{is important to understand}} the impact of these <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> in order to predict and enhance the tool life of stamping dies. This article presents a numerical simulation methodology to analyze the influences of various <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> such as the lubrication coefficient, binder holder force, clearance between die and punch, and blank thickness on tool wear pattern of a {{sheet metal stamping}} die with different die radius arc profiles. An equation consisting of adhesive wear and abrasive wear was developed and utilized in a numerical model for wear pattern and the simulations were performed using the finite element software Abaqus 6. 8. The numerical model was validated by a series of channel bending tests. The results suggest that various <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> have different impacts on the tool wear of die radius, depending on the specified die radius profile. However, for a certain die radius arc profile, the variation of <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> has limited effects on the locations of first and second peaks of tool wear work over die radius. To minimize tool wear, it would be necessary to optimize the shape for a particular combination of circular and elliptical profiles in relation to the <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> instead of only varying the <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> themselves...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of an optimization method often {{depends on the}} choosing {{of a number of}} <b>control</b> <b>parameters.</b> Practitioners have traditionally chosen these <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> manually, often according to elaborate guidelines or in a trial-and-error manner, which is laborious and susceptible to human misconceptions of what causes an optimizer to perform well. In recent years many variants to original optimization methods have appeared, which seek to adapt the <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> during optimization, so as to remedy the need for a practitioner to determine good <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> for a problem at hand. Ironically however, these variants typically just introduce new and additional parameters that must be chosen by the practitioner.

To fairly compare the performance of these optimizer variants against each other, their <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> are all tuned by an automated approach.
