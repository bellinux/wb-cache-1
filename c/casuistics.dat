40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose and {{consider}} a rationalist account of the effects of virtual experiences, such as engaging in simulated acts of violence in video games. This descriptive account will be based on sound principles for case-based reasoning, or what I will refer to as case-norm-case <b>casuistics,</b> and it is put forward as an alternative to emotivist explanations of the effects of virtual violence. Instead of asking how virtual violence might lead to changes in our moral intuitions, the proposed account asks how virtual violence might lead to changes in our moral reasoning. The controversial notion of ‘virtual rape ’ will be used as an example of how the two accounts ask fundamentally different questions and how the proposed account can yield an increased understanding of how experiences in virtual environments can change our moral norms. Prior to outlining the basics of this account and the issue of virtual rape in particular, I will outline some of the problems with emotivist claims about the effects of virtual violence, especially insofar as these claims rely on ethically and methodologically problematic experiments.

The vaccine against influenza is associated with adverse events of minor importance. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the early adverse events related to the vaccine against influenza. <b>CASUISTICS</b> AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety seven elderly individuals and health care workers vaccinated against influenza were included.

40|$|Medical {{ethics is}} {{commonly}} {{assumed to be}} a form of 'applied moral philosophy' in which practical moral judgments are deduced from moral theories. This account of the relationship between moral theory and moral judgment is inadequate in several respects. The deductivist approach often results in inadequate attention being given to social, historical and developmental contexts. It also fails to explain some common phenomena in practical moral reasoning. In contrast to the emphasis in deductivism, a case-centered or casuistic practical ethics insists on immersion in the particularities of cases and on interpretation of details in light of moral maxims and other mid-level forms of moral reasoning. Two features of <b>casuistics</b> that ought to be distinguished but frequently are not, are: (1) the emphasis on immersion and interpretation, and (2) a claim about the relation between moral judgment and moral theory as sources of moral knowledge.

Methods: The <b>casuistics</b> and variables related to cardiopulmonary bypass were studied. Serum creatinine levels were measured preoperatively, 24, 48 hours and on 7 th day postoperatively.
