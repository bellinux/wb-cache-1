The present study examined this idea with 4 female participants, ages 4 to 5  years old, who could not perform a series of problem-solving tasks involving arbitrary more than and less than relations. In a combined multiple baseline (across responses and participants) and multiple probe design (with trained and untrained stimuli), it was shown that reinforced multiple-exemplar training facilitated the development of arbitrary <b>comparative</b> <b>relations,</b> and that these skills generalized not just across stimuli but also across trial types. The sequence of training identified potential prerequisites in the development of <b>comparative</b> <b>relations</b> (e. g., nonarbitrary <b>comparative</b> <b>relations).</b> Taken as a whole, the present data, along with previous work by others in this area, suggest that relating arbitrary events comparatively is an operant.

30|$|Developing {{automatic}} facial age estimation algorithms {{that are}} comparable or even {{superior to the}} human ability in age estimation becomes an attractive yet challenging topic emerging in recent years. The conventional methods estimate one person’s age directly from the given facial image. In contrast, motivated by human cognitive processes, we proposed a comparative deep learning framework, called Comparative Region Convolutional Neural Network (CRCNN), by first comparing the input face with reference faces of known age to generate a set of hints (<b>comparative</b> <b>relations,</b> i.e., the input face is younger or older than each reference). Then, an estimation stage aggregates all the hints to estimate the person’s age. Our approach has several advantages: first, the age estimation task is split into several comparative stages, which is simpler than directly computing the person’s age; secondly, {{in addition to the}} input face itself, side information (<b>comparative</b> <b>relations)</b> can be explicitly involved to benefit the estimation task; finally, few incorrect comparisons will not influence much the accuracy of the result, making this approach more robust than the conventional approach. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first comparative deep learning framework for facial age estimation. Furthermore, we proposed to incorporate the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates (MAC) for training, which reduces the ill-conditioning problem of the deep network and affords an efficient and distributed optimization. In comparison to the best results from the state-of-the-art methods, the CRCNN showed a significant outperformance on all the benchmarks, with a relative improvement of 13.24 % (on FG-NET), 23.20 % (on MORPH), and 4.74 % (IoG).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{argument against the}} widespread view that ‘hard choices’ are hard because of the incomparability of the alternatives. The argument has two parts. First, I argue that any plausible theory of practical reason must be ‘comparativist’ in form, that is, it must hold that a <b>comparative</b> <b>relation</b> between the alternatives with respect to what matters in the choice determines a justified choice in that situation. If comparativist views of practical reason are correct, however, the incomparabilist view of hard choices should be rejected. Incomparabilism about hard choices leads us to an implausible error theory about the phenomenology of hard choices, threatens an unattractive view of human agency, and leaves us in perplexity about {{what we are doing}} when we choose in hard choices. The second part of the argument explores the main competitor to comparativist views of practical reason, noncomparativist view, according tow which a choice is justified so long as it is not worse than any of the alternatives. This view is often assumed by rational choice theorists but has its best philosophical defense in work by Joseph Raz. On Raz’s view, incomparabilism about hard choices avoids the problems faced if comparativism is correct, but it faces different difficulties. I argue that Raz’s noncomparativist view mistakenly assimilates practical reason to more restricted normative domains such as the law...|$|E
40|$|Pure syntactic, {{semantic}} and syntactic {{and pure}} syntactic features of subordinate comparative clauses as extrapolated on Marko Vovchok’s idiolect {{have been observed}} in the article. The topicality of such an approach is connected with {{the realization of the}} fact that, on the one hand, syntactic system of a language is the result of stabilizing of certain types of speech models which function in the text, and on the other hand, that typical features of a certain syntactic structure are highlighted and varied according to the individual and creative manner of the writer. The goal of the article is to realize the relevance of subordinate comparative clauses of the literary text of Marko Vovchok for the characteristics of the linguistic personality of the mentioned writer. According to the goal the following tasks have been set: to observe general linguistic systemic features of subordinate comparative structures in the texts written by Marko Vovchok; to actualize on the background individual author’s dominating features mentioned above; to define the peculiarity of the writer’s style in constructing complex comparisons. As a result of the investigation the following features of comparative technique typical of Marko Vovchok’s idiolect: the use of usual as well as folk-conversational semantic comparative tools of subordination; the use of deictic particle in the contact pre-position concerning the comparative conjunctions; preference of asymmetric sentences of unreal comparison complicated by the relation of hypothetic cause; anthropic character of situations (connected by the <b>comparative</b> <b>relation)</b> which are reproduced in the main and subordinate clauses.

40|$|Most {{properties}} have comparatives, {{which are}} relations. For instance, {{the property of}} width has the <b>comparative</b> <b>relation</b> denoted by `_ is wider than _'. Let us say a property is reducible to its comparative if any statement that refers to the property has the same meaning as another statement that refers to the comparative instead. Width is not reducible to its comparative. To be sure, many statements that refer to width are reducible: for instance, `The Mississippi is wide' means the same as `The Mississippi is wider than most rivers'. But some statements that refer to width are not reducible: for instance, `Electrons have zero width' is not. A property is not reducible to its comparative if it has absolute degrees, and specifically an absolute zero. A property's <b>comparative</b> <b>relation</b> places things in an order from those that have the property least to those that have it most. If there is an absolute zero point somewhere in this ordering, the property is not reducible to its comparative. For width, there is an absolute zero {{at one end of}} the ordering, so width is not reducible. 	The property of goodness is reducible to its comparative, betterness. In particular, there is no absolute zero of goodness. Things are ordered by betterness – some things are better than others – but nothing is absolutely good or absolutely bad. 	This is an exaggeration. In certain applications, goodness does have absolute degrees of a sort, and an absolute zero. For instance, it makes sense to say an event is good, and another event bad. These are absolute degrees of a sort, but they are themselves reducible to betterness. To say an event is good simply means the event is better than what would otherwise have happened. 	The goodness of lives has a different sort of absolute zero. Lives are ordered by betterness; some lives are better than others. We can make sense of the question `Where in this ordering is the division between lives that are good and those that are bad?' The division between good and bad lives is again reducible to betterness. To say a person's life is good means it is better that the person should continue living, rather than that she should die. Or it may mean it is better that her life should be lived rather than that it should never have been lived at all. As it is often put: a good life is a life worth living. 	Derek Parfit appears to attach a different sense to the idea of a good life. He appears to mean a life that contains a preponderance of good things (such as pleasure) over bad things (such as pain). If a life contains no good things and no bad things, it has zero goodness in this sense. In this sense, absolute goodness and the absolute zero of goodness are not reducible to betterness. However, this is a naturalistic sense of goodness, and it is subject to the open-question objection. If a life contains no good things and no bad things, it is an open question whether it has zero goodness. It might, for instance, be a bad thing that this life should be lived. 	In discussing the evil of death, some philosophers seem to have been searching for an absolute goodness that is not reducible to betterness. Thomas Nagel speaks of an asymmetry between what is good about life and what is bad about death. But if a person's life is good, that only means it would be better that she should continue living than that she should die. And if a person's death would be bad, that only means it would be worse that she should die than that she should continue living. So there can be no asymmetry...|$|E
40|$|How can humans acquire {{relational}} {{representations that}} enable analogical inference {{and other forms}} of high-level reasoning? Using <b>comparative</b> <b>relations</b> as a model domain, we explore the possibility that bottom-up learning mechanisms applied to objects coded as feature vectors can yield representations of relations sufficient to solve analogy problems. We introduce Bayesian analogy with relational transfor-mations (BART) and apply the model to the task of learning first-order <b>comparative</b> <b>relations</b> (e. g., larger, smaller, fiercer, meeker) from a set of animal pairs. Inputs are coded by vectors of continuous-valued features, based either on human magnitude ratings, normed feature ratings (De Deyne et al., 2008), or outputs of the topics model (Griffiths, Steyvers, & Tenenbaum, 2007). Bootstrapping from empirical priors, the model is able to induce first-order relations represented as probabilistic weight distributions, even when given positive examples only. These learned representations allow classification of novel instantiations of the relations and yield a symbolic distance effect of the sort obtained with both humans and other primates. BART then transforms its learned weight distributions by importance-guided mapping, thereby placing distinct dimensions into correspondence. These transformed representations allow BART to reliably solve 4 -term analogies (e. g., larger:smaller::fiercer:meeker), a type of reasoning that is arguably specific to humans. Our results provide a proof-of-concept that structured analogies can be solved with representations induced from unstructured feature vectors by mechanisms that operate in a largely bottom-up fashion. We discuss potential implications for algorithmic and neural models of relational thinking, {{as well as for the}} evolution of abstract thought...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is oriented {{around two}} moral ideals. The first is equality {{and the second}} perfection or excellence. In the chapter 2 I review some {{of the literature on}} the seemingly devastating ‘Levelling Down Objection’ to equality. I am in agreement with Larry Temkin that the Levelling Down Objection is true only if we believe that ‘person-affecting’ value, more specifically, welfare, {{is the only thing that}} matters in the moral universe. Hence, the Levelling down objeciton is premised on the truth of an undefended, highly contentious monism about value The purpose for introducing the Levelling Down Objection in chapter 1 is made clear in chapter 3, where I suggest a new problem for egalitarians. Equality is a <b>comparative</b> <b>relation</b> holding between people. Relations are not properties, and, since it is widely assumed that value supervenes exclusively on properties, we need to show how a relation could be of value. It is crucial to be able say how this could be the case. However, this issue has, to the best of my knowledge, not been addressed in the literature on equality. If we cannot answer this quesiton then the value of the equality relation must reduce to the value of its relata. I try to offer a framework which at least goes as far as demonstrating that this need not be true. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the value of perfection. I offer a careful reading of the work of an important defender and an important critic of this ideal, the former being Immanuel Kant and the latter being Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The aim of these two chapters is twofold; firstly, I show that the value of perfection consists in the development and cultivation of our capacities for rationality. Secondly I show how perfectionism illuminates the importance of culture and the arts. In the final chapter I bring the insights of this dissertation together in order to address a practical question; whether there are egalitarian reasons to support the arts...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the thesis is to present a novel {{analysis}} of comparative quantifiers such as more than three students. The prevalent view on such expressions advocated in Generalized Quantifier Theory is that they denoted generalized quantifiers ranging over individuals - entirely {{on a par with}} expressions like every student, some student(s), etc. According to this view, more than three is a determiner (like every) that is, even though morpho-syntactically complex, semantically a simplex expression that can be viewed as denoting a relation between sets of individuals. The proposal that will be developed in this thesis on the other hand maintains that expressions like more than three are also semantically complex. More specifically, an analysis of comparative quantifiers will be given that is fully compositional down to level of the formation of comparative determiners. The proposal is based on concepts that are independently needed to analyze comparative constructions. Three main pieces will be argued to form the semantic and syntactic core of comparative quantifiers: a degree function expressed by many, a degree description given by the numeral (which will be analyzed as measure phrase) and the <b>comparative</b> <b>relation</b> expressed by the comparative morpheme -er. Importantly, each of the three pieces can be empirically shown to interact in predictably (and partially independent) ways with elements inside the quantifier as well as with elements in the matrix clause. These interactions are unexpected unless comparative quantifiers are built in the syntax. Giving a fully compositional analysis is therefore not just conceptually appealing but also required to explain new empirical generalizations. The more general enterprise that this thesis hopes pave the way is giving a uniform and fully compositional analysis of comparative quantificational structures that does not exist so far. by Martin Hackl.

40|$|This study investigates sample {{plans of}} Cairene {{dwellings}} {{from the late}} 17 th to the mid 20 th century; a period which witnessed Egypt's first exposure to the West through the French Expedition of 1798 followed by major socio-economic and urban transformations during the 19 th century. These broader changes have managed to transform Cairo from a traditional medieval city to a modern metropolitan city. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to explore whether Cairene dwellings designed after Western intervention in the early 20 th century have represented a break or rupture with the traditional Cairene domestic architecture. Utilizing the concept of privacy as a vehicle to examine differentiation in conventions across time, the study investigates the relative hold to conventions for two socio-economic groups; the emergent middleincome occupational group, and the low-income labourers. Samples of the 19 th and 20 th century are compared with the reference period of the 17 th 1181 h century to assess change. The central assumption underlying the research methodology is that cultural ideas are present in both the spatial organization of plans, and the way these plans are used by inhabitants. The research has developed a methodology that takes into account the combined effect of utilizing space and time in assessing socio-cultural implications of sample plans. Three categories of encounter are considered; the inhabitants encounter with strangers outside, with each other, and with their visitors within the dwelling unit. The key findings of this study are twofold; methodological and empirical. The method employed could become a research tool for others who might be studying quite different issues in quite different times and places. As for the empirical investigation, results have indicated no rupture at the higher structural level of the dwelling's spatial and behavioural organization; Cairene dwellings are found to be hierarchically organized into clusters of activities of various levels of privacy connected by a branching system. At the local level of the activities' interaction in space and time, results have indicated the existence of local ruptures with respect to the dwelling's relation with strangers outside, and with guests within the dwelling unit. The inhabitants' encounter with each other reveals the minimum level of cultural maintenance. Overall, Cairene dwellings of the 1 st half of the 20 th century are found to be midway between maintenance of privacy conventions and total rupture. With respect to the <b>comparative</b> <b>relation</b> between the two income samples, empirical results indicate significant spatial differences across time in terms of the dwelling's size (metric area and number of spaces), and the status of all spatial indices of privacy. In terms of behaviour, results indicated common behavioural attitudes during the 18 th century with respect to the three categories of encounter, but the emergence of a significant social gap in the early 20 th century.
