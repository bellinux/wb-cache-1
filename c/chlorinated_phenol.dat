With increasing chlorination there is an increase in toxicity in which the convulsant action of phenol is replaced by the signs characteristic of poisoning by dinitrophenol; the higher <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> produce a contracture of the isolated rat phrenic nerve diaphragm and a stimulation of in vitro oxygen uptake of rat brain homogenate. These actions of the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> have been correlated with their dissociation constants; it is suggested that the higher <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> interfere with oxidative phosphorylation, and that this property may be attributed to the chlorophenate ion.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{bacterial}} {{community of}} anaerobic sludge could degrade o-chlorophenol, p-chiorophenoi, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid at concentrations {{as high as}} 100 mg/ 1. The time needed for the degradation of a given <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenol</b> derivative increased 1. 5 - to 2 -fold upon a twofold increase in its concentration (from 50 to 100 mg/l). The duration of the adaptation period depended on the compound studied and on its concentration. The degradation of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid proceeded via 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and p-chlorophenol as intermediates; the degradation of o-chlorophenol occurred {{with the formation of}} phenol. The dynamics ofp-chlorophenol degradation and chloride ion accumulation were studied. Key words: degradation, bacterial community, anaerobic sludge, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenol</b> derivatives. The problem of environment decontamination from stable xenobiotics, including halogenated organic compounds widely used in industry and agriculture, is currently urgent. Therefore, much attention is paid to research into the biochemistry of bacterial degradation of various halogenated xenobiotics, both aerobic [1, 2] and anaerobic [3, 4]. <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>phenol</b> derivatives are widely used in agriculture as pesticides and belong to the most stable xenobiotics. By now, sufficient data have been accumulated on the degradation of mono-, di-, and trichlorophenols by aerobic bacteria [6, 7], but only a few works have been devoted to the bacterial degradation of phenol and its chlorinated derivatives under anaerobic conditions [8, 9]. The latter processes deserve attention, since {{one of the most widely}} used pesticides is 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), whose degradation results in the accumulation of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, p-chlorophenol (p-CP), and o-chlorophenol (o-CP) ...|$|E

In particular, chlorinated aromatic compounds are recalcitrant to biodegradation and conventional treatment methods. Iron phthalocyanines were previously shown to be efficient catalysts for the oxidative degradation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> considered as priority pollutants. We have recently discovered mu-nitrido diiron phthalocyanines as powerful oxidation catalysts. Herein, we evaluate these emerging catalysts in the oxidation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> in comparison with conventional mononuclear complex. Catalytic performance of iron tetrasulfophthalocyanine (FePcS) and corresponding mu-nitrido dimer [(FePcS) (2) N] have been compared in the oxidation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> by hydrogen peroxide in water. The oxidative degradation of 2, 6 -dichlorophenol (DCP) and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (TCP) has been studied. The (FePcS) (2) N exhibited better catalytic properties than mononuclear FePcS in terms of conversion and mineralization (transformation of organic chlorine to Cl- and decrease of total organic carbon due {{to the formation of}} CO 2). Kinetics of the DCP oxidation indicated that different reaction mechanisms are involved in the presence of FePcS and (FePcS) (2) N. The high catalytic activity of (FePcS) (2) N in the degradation and mineralization of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> make mu-nitrido diiron phthalocyanines promising catalyst to apply also in environmental remediation.

It is harmful to human health even at a very low concentration [83]. For the sensitive detection of 2, 4 -DCP, Dong et al.

The fabricated sensors not only exhibited high selectivity toward 2, 4 -DCP compared with the interferences, but also showed a wide linear sensing range from 0.04 to 1.0  μM and an LOD of 9  nM. The employment of Cu 3 (BTC) 2 presents many advantages such as large specific surface area, high adsorption capacity, and good electron transfer efficiency, which enhance the performance of the electrochemical sensor. Furthermore, the sensor was successfully applied for the determination of 2, 4 -DCP in reservoir raw water samples with satisfactory results.|$|E

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} plant derived phenols can be degraded through {{bacteria in}} swine waste. <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>phenols,</b> {{which are not}} naturally present in the environment, are toxic and generated from industrial activities as such petrochemical, pharmaceutical, plastic, rubber, pesticide, iron, steel, paper production, coal conversion, wood preserving, and cellulose bleaching. Large scale coal gasification and carbonization plants are another source of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols.</b> Although not normally present in the environment, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> are structurally similar to many plant derived phenolics. It is our hypothesis that bacteria located in swine wastes may also {{have the ability to}} degrade <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols.</b> Identifying situations (and organisms) in which degradation of pollutants occurs is important field of research. Experimental work was focused on measuring the degradation of seven <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> in swine waste using solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) and gas chromatography(GC). Microbes in the waste perform respiration or fermentation to obtain the energy they need to carry out their life processes. Fermentation is a process in which electrons are transferred from one organic substrate to another and which results in incomplete degradation of organic compounds. Anaerobic respiration is a process in which organic substrates are degraded completely to CO 2, but using substances other than oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor (such as Fe(III), NO 3 - or SO 42 -). Anaerobic respiration using these alternative electron acceptors provides an easier pathway for degradation of aromatics than fermentation alone. Usually the abundance of these electron acceptors in waste is low since microbes consume them readily and thus they must be added to the mixture. Our work focused on development of methods for the quantification of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> in swine wastes and results of bioremediation research. In this study, chlorophenols were extracted by SPME and analysed by GC. This research project mainly focused on the anaerobic degradation of chlorophenols in swine waste. It was observed that the decreased concentration of the chlorophenols was likely due to partitioning of the chlorophenols to solids, sticking to glass bottles and by bacteria present in the swine waste. In summary, it was observed that by ANOVA and gas production analysis 2, 6 -dichlorophenol and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol were likely to be degraded by bacteria present in swine waste...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBecause natural {{organic matter}} is {{commonly}} present in surface water and might {{interfere with the}} removal of organic contaminants, we investigated the effect of humic acids (HA) on the adsorption of pentachlorophenol (PCP). The sorbents are synthetic clay compounds: surfactant-modified pillared montmorillonite (SMPM). First the cation exchange sites of an Algerian bentonite were blocked by intercalation of metallic polycations from either Fe(III) or Al(III); then cetyltrimethylammonium cations were adsorbed {{in order to obtain}} two hydrophobic and organophilic clay compounds. According to batch adsorption isotherms in single systems, both PCP and HA sorptions increased when pH decreased, especially for Fe-SMPM in comparison with inorganic pillared clays without cationic surfactant. The Fe-SMPM was more effective than the Al-SMPM for PCP sorption: at pH 6, the maximum PCP sorption capacities were 530 mg g− 1 vs. 300 mg g− 1, respectively. From data treatment with an extended Freundlich model, in binary systems at pH 6 and at various PCP/HA ratio (ranging between 1 / 4 and 4 / 1 g g− 1), the competition affected both forms of SMPM quite strongly. In addition, the competition between PCP and HA was more important for the Fe-SMPM than the Al-SMPM, with respective maximum PCP sorption capacities of 133 vs. 53 mg g− 1.

40|$|Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations {{have been}} carried out to explore the potential energy surface (PES) associated with the gas-phase reaction between 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol and CuO. A gas-phase model was constructed to account, from a theoretical perspective, for the most important reaction steps reported experimentally for the interaction between <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenol</b> and a CuO surface. This involves the facile production of the chlorophenoxy radical through hydroxyl H abstraction, formation of HO-Cu- 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenolate complex, and reduction of Cu-(II) into Cu(I) through chlorophenoxy desorption from the chlorophenolate complex. The overall process: 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol + CuO → 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxy radical + CuOH is significantly exothermic and facile (unlike the strongly endothermic process of 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol → 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxy radical + H) suggesting that in the gas phase, at least, CuO would be an efficient catalyst for production of polychlorinated phenoxy radicals which are known precursors of dioxins. Hence, the present study should be an important preliminary to a detailed investigation of the efficacy of CuO surfaces toward catalysis of dioxin formation. Lastly, we estimate the reaction energies for the reaction 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol + MO → 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxy radical + MOH for the first-row transition metal monoxides.

Phenol and a number of phenolic compounds, including 4 -methylphenol, all of the monohydroxybenzoates, and several dihydroxybenzoates, were very good carbon sources for Azotobacter sp. strain GP 1. The organism utilized up to 800 mg of TCP per liter; the lag phase and time for degradation, however, were severely prolonged at TCP concentrations above 500 mg/liter. Repeated additions of 200 mg of TCP per liter led to accelerated degradation, with an optimum value of 100 mg of TCP per liter per h. TCP degradation was significantly faster in shaken than in nonshaken cultures. The optimum temperature for degradation was 25 to 30 degrees C. Induction studies, including treatment of the cells with chloramphenicol prior to TCP or phenol addition, revealed that TCP induced TCP degradation but not phenol degradation and that phenol induced only its own utilization.

Contrary to that observed for <b>phenols</b> and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols,</b> the Quat-smectites were ineffective as adsorbents for triphenyltin hydroxide and bis(tributyltin) oxide at room temperature. Under microwave conditions, only bis(tributyltin) oxide was adsorbed by the quaternary ammonium exchanged smectites. Bis(tributyltin) oxide was adsorbed from ethanol {{on the surface of the}} smectite clays at room temperature and under microwave conditions. The adsorbate-adsorbent interactions were weak. Adsorption is accompanied by conversion of bis(tributyltin) oxide to a different tin(IV) species and the release of sodium cations from the montmorillonite interlayer region.

Analysis of the adsorption isotherms for 3 -monochlorophenol, 3, 5 -dichlorophenol, 3, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol and pen-tachlorophenol at different pH shows that the most energetic adsorption sites are the surfactant-occupied micropores between pillars.

The exponential growth of electronic waste contributes to a rapid increase in the rate of contaminants and waste entering landfills. This fact implies the need for an appropriate management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Printed circuit boards (PCB) are one of the most complex constituents of WEEE, with a mixture of both valuable and/or hazardous elements. Thermal treatments represent an interesting alternative to recycle this kind of waste, but particular attention has to be paid to the potential emissions of toxic by-products. In this study, the emissions from thermal degradation of printed circuit boards (with and without metals) have been studied using a laboratory scale reactor, under oxidizing and inert atmosphere at 600 and 850 oC. The study comprises the analysis of gases, halogens and hydrogen halides, carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenol,</b> chlorinated benzenes and brominated phenols, among other semivolatile compounds, as well as polybromo- and polychloro- dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls. The maximum formation of PAHs was found in pyrolysis at 850 oC, naphthalene being the most abundant. High levels of 2 -, 4 -, 2, 4 -, 2, 6 - and 2, 4, 6 -bromophenols were found, especially at 600 oC. Emissions of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs were very slow and much lower than that of PBDD/Fs, due to the higher bromine content of the samples. Combustion at 600 oC was the run with the highest PBDD/F formation: the total content of eleven 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted congeners (tetra- through heptaBDD/Fs) was 7240 and 3250 ng WHO 2005 -TEQ/kg sample, corresponding to the sample with and without metals, respectively.

40|$|Substantial {{environmental}} contamination has occurred from coal tar creosote and pentachlorophenol (C 5 P) in wood preserving solutions. The present studies {{focused on the}} characterization and remediation of these contaminants. The first objective was to delineate a sequence of biological changes caused by <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenol</b> (CP) exposure. In Clone 9 cells, short-term exposure to 10 ?M C 5 P decreased pH, GJIC, and GSH, and increased ROS generation. Long-term exposure caused mitochondrial membrane depolarization (25 ?M), increased intracellular Ca 2 + (50 ?M), and plasma membrane depolarization (100 ?M). Cells were affected similarly by C 5 P or 2, 3, 4, 5 -C 4 P, and similarly by 2, 3, 5 -C 3 P or 3, 5 -C 2 P. Endpoints were affected by dose, time, {{and the number of}} chlorine substituents on specific congeners. Thus, this information may be used to identify and quantify unknown CPs in a mixture to be remediated. Due to the toxic effects observed due to CP exposure in vitro, the objective of the second study was to develop multi-functional sorbents to remediate CPs and other components of wood preserving waste from groundwater. Cetylpyridinium-exchanged low pH montmorillonite clay (CP-LPHM) was bonded to either sand (CP-LPHM/sand) or granular activated carbon (CP-LPHM/GAC). Laboratory studies utilizing aqueous solution derived from wood preserving waste indicated that 3 : 2 CP-LPHM/GAC and CP-LPHM/sand were the most effective formulations. In situ elution of oil-water separator effluent indicated that both organoclay-containing composites have a high capacity for contaminants identified in wood preserving waste, in particular high molecular weight and carcinogenic PAHs. Further, GAC did not add substantial sorptive capacity to the composite formulation. Following water remediation, the final aim of this work was to explore the safety of the parent clay minerals as potential enterosorbents for contaminants ingested in water and food. Calcium montmorillonite and sodium montmorillonite clays were added to the balanced diet of Sprague-Dawley rats throughout pregnancy. Based on evaluations of toxicity and neutron activation analysis of tissues, no significant differences were observed between animals receiving clay supplements and control animals, with the exception of slightly decreased brain Rb in animals ingesting clay. Overall, the results suggest that neither clay mineral, at relatively high dietary concentrations, influences mineral uptake or utilization in the pregnant rat...|$|E
40|$|Composting is an {{aerobic process}} {{which allows the}} rapid {{proliferation}} {{of a variety of}} microbial groups such as aerobic actinomycetes, bacilli and fungi. Waste mushroom compost is readily available as a byproduct, with 400, 000 - 500, 000 tons produced per year in the UK, and is capable of acting as a carrier for the xenobiotic-degrading microorganisms and as a nutrient source in contaminated soils. Bacteria, particularly actinomycetes, were targeted as potential PCP degraders because of their ubiquitous distribution in composts, their ability to colonize composts by mycelial growth and to degrade a wide range of aromatic compounds using either endoor extracellular enzymes (McCarthy and Williams, 1992). Semple and Fermor (1995) showed that actinomycetes, isolated from PCP-contaminated mushroom compost, were capable of attacking this highly <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenol.</b> However, the individual putative PCP-degrading isolates tested did not achieve appreciable mineralization of UL- 14 C-PCP. It may be that a diverse population working in concert is required to biodegrade the chlorophenol to CO 2 and H 2 O. However, biotransformation of PCP is a possibility given that the Saccharomonaspora viridis strains, Streptomyces spp., and Thermomonospora spp. appear to remove the PCP from the growth media (Semple and Fermor, 1995). Mineralization of PCP by composts was found to be more impressive compared to that of the actinomycete isolates. This suggests that the physical relationship between compost solid substrate and the populating microflora {{play an important role in}} the degradation of PCP. A key phenomenon to be considered when applying a bioremediative technology is chemical ageing and its relationship to bioavailability of the contaminant to the soil microflora (Hatzinger and Alexander, 1995). The longer an organic compound is in a given soil environment, the more likely it is to be affected by chemical and physical processes, such as diffusion into soil micropores, partitioning into soil organic matter, strong surface adsorption and covalent binding to soil constituents. These processes result in a decrease in the bioavailability of the compound to the degradative microorganisms, thus reducing the effectiveness of the treatment. However, it has been suggested that desorption of compounds (previously unavailable), leading to an increase in bioavailability, may occur at elevated temperatures typically generated under composting conditions (Pignatello and Xing, 1996). This will require further investigation to understand the processes involved and to characterize its effects on the degradation of PCP by mushroom composts...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{discrepancies}} between polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin to polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDD to PCDF) ratios in laboratory and field {{studies in the}} exhaust of combustion sources are not fully explained by available formation models. In this paper we present the results of experimental studies of the surface mediated formation of PCDD/F at the conditions mimicking the combustion cool zone from a mixture of 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene (1, 2 -DCBz) and 2 -monochlorophenol (2 -MCP) over a model surface consisting of 5 % CuO/Silica. The PCDD to PCDF ratio {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on the ratio of chlorinated benzenes to <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> and oxygen content. The higher the 1, 2 -DCBz to 2 -MCP ratio, the lower the PCDD to PCDF ratio. PCDFs are formed predominantly from chlorinated benzenes, while <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> are responsible for majority of PCDDs. These laboratory results are in general agreement with full-scale measurement and can be used to improve predictive models of PCDD/F formation...|$|R
40|$|The reductive {{dechlorination}} of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> by vitamin B 12, {{supported by}} the reductant Ti(III) citrate, was examined. Procedures were developed, including a novel reactor system, for conducting these experiments. Most of {{the experiments were conducted}} in either hermetically-sealed glass ampoules, which could maintain vitamin B 12 in the fully-reduced vitamin B 12 s state for months, or in the novel two-chambered reactor (TCR), which could also support vitamin B 12 s for extended periods, and could easily be sampled to perform kinetic studies. Vitamin B 12 s reductively dechlorinates <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> by nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the cobalamin for a chlorine, followed by reductive cleavage of the arylcobalamin to form the reductively-dechlorinated product. Dechlorination occurs chiefly at positions ortho to another chlorine, but the 2 and 6 positions are extremely recalcitrant, even when another chlorine is adjacent. The proposed mechanism accounts for the observed regiospecificity, consistent with bond charge density and thermodynamic considerations. Pentachlorophenol, all of the tetrachlorophenols, and all of the trichlorophenol...|$|R
40|$|The {{contents}} of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorophenol (TeCP) in textile products are regulat-ed for safety. Since an organic solvent such as 2 -methoxyethanol {{is needed to}} extract <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> from textile samples, nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis {{has been applied to}} achieve the separation of PCP and isomers of TeCP. The run buffer was 100 mM Tris/acetate in methanol whose pH was adjusted to 8. 0. All of the analytes were negatively charged at pH 8. 0 and their electrophoretic velocities were higher than the elec-troosmotic flow of the methanol buffer. A reverse voltage of- 20 kV was applied along a 27 -cm fused silica capillary with ID of 50 µm, and PCP and 3 TeCP isomers were separated based on the difference in pKa values in less than 4 min. The limits of detection (S/N = 3) were about 0. 02 µM. By varying pH of the methanol run buffer, pKa values of the 4 <b>chlorinated</b> <b>phenols</b> were also estimated...|$|R
