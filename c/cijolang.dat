40|$|Segara Anakan Lagoon is an unique lagoon, {{where a lot}} {{of rivers}} enter into the lagoon such as Citanduy, Cibeureum, <b>Cijolang,</b> Cikawung and Ciseel Rivers. These rivers bring the {{sediment}} materials from upstream to the lagoon areas and resisted by Nusa Kambangan Island. The rate of sediment transportation every year occurred continuously and significantly. Its caused the creation of new land at eastern part of Segara Anakan Lagoon was about 376. 69 hectares which is located at Cilacap District, while in the western part is about 15, 78 hectares which is located at Ciamis District. Since 1999 to 2003 land accretion at Segara Anakan Lagoon was about 392. 47 hectares with the rate of accretion around 78. 50 hectares/year. In 1999 the area of the Segara Anakan Lagoon approximately 1, 595 hectares. Based on the averages of rate land accretion, its predicted that {{in the middle of the}} 2019 whole of Segara Anakan will be land. The study had been done in 2003 by using hand drilling up to 2 meters depth, grab sampler and GPS Garmin 250 Map. The hand drilling result at accretion area, show that at eastern part of study area is composed of silt and cly, while at Nusawere Bay and Solok Jero is characterized by fine to coarse sand...|$|E
40|$|Ciamis {{district}} {{is one of}} the industrial centers of tapioca starch in West Java. Industry has been utilizing solid waste into by-products, fertilizers and animal feeds, but the wastewater which consist a lot of organic substances still discharged directly into the water that potentially cause water pollution. This study aims to determine the wastewater treatment system that can be applied in tapioca starch industry based on five scenarios proposed by using fuzzy goal programming approach. The first objective is the achievement of stream standard (DO-dissolved oxygen and BOD-biochemical oxygen demand) and wastewater quality standards. The second objective is to minimize the cost of wastewater treatment. Wastewater treatment system that proposed, consists of a primary, secondary and collective treatment that shared by some of the industries in one segment with 20 % efficiency of BOD removal for primary, 60 % for secondary and 85 % for collective treatment. The results show that scenario five, which consists of primary, secondary and collective wastewater treatment is chosen for all industries by considering economic and environmental aspects. There was some improvement of water quality for the <b>Cijolang</b> middle-stream segment with DO 7. 35 mg/L and BOD 3. 68 mg/L; Citanduy middle-stream segment with DO 6. 24 mg/L and BOD 2. 37 mg/L, and also for Citanduy down-stream segment with DO 6. 11 mg/L and BOD 5. 52 mg/L. The fulfillment of BOD pollutant load limits obtained with achieving BOD concentration of 6. 32 to 27. 89 mg/L of each industry with total cost incurred is IDR 62, 689 pe...|$|E
