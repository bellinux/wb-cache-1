40|$|Peer-to-peer {{systems have}} {{recently}} gained {{a lot of}} attention in the academic community especially through the design of KBR (Key-Based Routing) algorithms and DHT (Distributed Hash Table) s. On top of these constructs were built promising applications such as video streaming applications but also storage infrastructures benefiting from the availability and resilience of such scalable network protocols. Unfortunately, rare are the storage systems designed to be scalable and fault-tolerant to Byzantine behaviour, conditions required for such systems to be deployed in an environment such as the Internet. Furthermore, although some means of access control are often provided, such file systems fail to offer the end-users the flexibility required in order to easily manage the permissions granted to potentially hundreds or thousands of end-users. In addition, as for <b>centralised</b> <b>file</b> systems which rely on a special user, referred to as root on Unices, distributed file systems equally require some tasks to operate at the system level. The decentralised nature of these systems renders impossible the use of a single authoritative entity for performing such tasks since implicitly granting her superprivileges, unacceptable configuration for such decentralised systems. This thesis addresses both issues by providing the file system objects a completely decentralised access control and administration scheme enabling users to express access control rules in a flexible way but also to request administrative tasks without the need for a superuser. A prototype has been developed and evaluated, proving feasible the deployment of such a decentralised file system in large-scale and untrustworthy environments...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} undertakes {{a systematic}} review of critical marketing literature {{in order to}} generate meaningful conclusions {{on the state of}} the existing body of critical marketing scholarship. The aim of the research is present a comprehensive synthesis of the current literature, revealing any systemic biases and limitations in the way critical marketing scholarship is produced. The PRISMA structure acted as a guiding framework to ensure a transparent and methodical process was followed. After all necessary exclusions were made, the sample revealed 54 eligible articles for the present study. Relevant data from each eligible article was extracted by the researcher after examination of the full-text article. Data regarding the year of publication, authorship characteristics, geographical location, paradigmatic stance, research method, and research topic was put into a <b>centralised</b> <b>file</b> for analysis. The aggregation of the data mined from each individual article revealed trends in the literature. The findings showed a general increase in the existence of critical marketing publication- articles accepted into the study spanned from the year 1994 to 2015. In contrast to the suggestion of previous literature, 44 % of articles were produced by an individual author and thus co-authorship and collaboration are not an overwhelming characteristic of the literature studied. Similarly, only 13 % of articles were identified as exhibiting evidence of international collaboration between authors. A total of 102 authors contributed to the articles in the study, 63 % of these identifying as male and 37 % as female. A further breakdown revealed that of the articles produced by a single author, 84 % were male and 15 % female. Over half of the articles were authored by academics working in the United Kingdom, and marketing theory was found to the most common topic of focus of the articles. The theoretical contribution of the study includes a heightened transparency of the characteristics behind the production of critical marketing literature, and the biases which exist. In terms of managerial implications, the study provides universities and peer-review journals alike with the impetus to improve equity amongst the opportunities of academic staff...|$|E
50|$|In April 2002, a {{group of}} lawyers from the Woomera Lawyers' Group set up and {{established}} the Refugee Advocacy Service of South Australia Inc.. The purpose of the center was to organise and <b>centralise</b> <b>files</b> for the vast number of asylum seekers who had sought, or were seeking, a judicial review of their original decisions in the Federal Court of Australia.|$|R
50|$|By May 1916 the Queensland Recruiting Committee {{had created}} a <b>centralised</b> and cross-referenced <b>filing</b> system. This filing system {{provided}} the Committee with detailed records of 120,000 eligible males in Queensland and used a classification system to show availability in terms of family responsibilities, work commitments and other factors. This enabled recruitment {{to be much more}} focussed, enabling the committee to initiate follow-up enquiries to those who might be eligible to serve by local recruiting committees and recruiting sergeants.|$|R
40|$|Distributed file {{systems are}} an {{expensive}} proposition {{and their use}} can only be justified if they are critical to an organisation’s business. Most organisations today settle for the common alternative, the use of <b>centralised</b> possibly replicated <b>file</b> servers based on the traditional client-server model. However both these systems pose certain problems, such {{as the need for}} expensive hardware in order to provide continuous unobstructed service to users, or the critical nature of some of the centralised components means greater performance bottlenecks, less fault-tolerance and the need for careful monitoring and administration. While peer-topeer systems can provide a more decentralised approach, there are practical difficulties i...|$|R
50|$|Napster was {{the first}} peer to peer service {{to be subject to}} {{copyright}} infringement litigation. In this case, the issue was regarding the infringement of copyrights through the ‘Music Share’ software of Napster. Whenever, this software was used on a computer system, it would collect information about the MP3 files stored on the computer and send it to Napster servers. Based on this information, the Napster created a <b>centralised</b> index of <b>files</b> available for download on the Napster network. When someone wanted to download that file, the Music Share software would use the Napster index to locate the user who already had that file on their system and then connect the two users directly to facilitate the download of the MP3 file, without routing the file through Napster’s servers.|$|R
50|$|By May 1916 the Queensland Recruiting Committee had {{instituted a}} <b>centralised</b> and cross-referenced <b>filing</b> system. This filing system {{provided}} the Committee with detailed records of 120,000 eligible males in Queensland {{and used a}} classification system to show availability in terms of family responsibilities, work commitments and other factors. This elaborate and detailed organisation was informed as much by the expectation of conscription as it was by the ongoing campaign for voluntary enlistment. Recruiting organisers increasingly believed that the voluntary system had reached its limit and invested {{in the success of}} compulsory conscription which had been publicly advocated by the Universal Service League and others since September 1915. The government under William Morris Hughes offered a plebiscite on the issue of conscription - campaigning for which proved highly socially and politically divisive. This debate helped to shatter any illusion of national unanimity around the war issue. The plebiscite was narrowly defeated on 28 October 1916. A second plebiscite in December 1917 was also defeated. Campaigning prior to the second vote proved even more vitriolic and divisive than the first. In the wake of these setbacks, recruiting organisers pulled out all stops to meet the quotas demanded by the government.|$|R
