For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500million to $1billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. Although {{it has been argued}} that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphics}} and sound of The Guardian Legend have been influential. Robert Dewar and Matthew Smosna {{of the open}} computing magazine Open Systems Today cited the game {{as an example of}} how graphics co-processors such as those in the NES can compensate for inadequate CPU speed in graphics-intensive <b>computer</b> <b>applications.</b> They noted that the fast-paced action seen in the game could not be replicated on a personal computer at that time (1992) without an expensive graphics board and regardless of CPU speed. The music of the game, composed by Masatomo Miyamoto and Takeshi Santo, has remained popular years after the game's release. Samantha Amjadali of the Melbourne-based newspaper The Herald Sun reported that a remixed tune from the game was rated as the second most popular track on the website OverClocked ReMix in March 2002. Video game cover band The Advantage's 2006 album Elf Titled featured a cover version of music from one of the game's dungeon levels.|$|E
