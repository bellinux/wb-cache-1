This research focuses on ink-saving strategies for process printing using color management technology in the prepress stage. Two ink-saving methods are discussed in this research. First method is reducing the AIC (Average Ink Coverage) in graphic design. A case study is carried out and verifies the rule that high AIC requires more ink usage than low AIC does. However AIC and ink usage are not committed to a linear relationship; instead, AIC variance, {{as a result of}} different graphic designs, will be amplified in terms of ink <b>usage</b> <b>variance</b> during the printing. Graphic design significantly affects the ink usage. The second method is processing images that have same graphic designs, with optimized GCR (Gray Component Replacement).

Using Markov Decision Process modeling, we show that the optimal policy for such hybrid systems varies the lot size in response to make-to-order backlogs as well as stock levels. We evaluate the performance of this flexible lot sizing policy for a two-product hybrid system. We find that it leads to savings of up to 23 % compared to policies that use either completely or partly fixed lot sizes.

Compared to the original as-cast alloy with internal friction (Q- 1) of 3. 0 × 10 - 2 at a strain amplitude ε = 2 × 10 - 4 and usage temperature of 43 °C, the largest Q- 1 (5. 0 × 10 - 2) and highest usage temperature (70 °C) can be obtained simultaneously by ageing treatment at 435 °C for 2 h, while homogenization-ageing, solution-ageing and overageing can just result in the limited improvement of damping <b>capacity</b> and <b>usage</b> temperature. This is because the highest nanoscale Mn segregation in Mn dendrites can be formed by spinodal decomposition during ageing, while carrying out the homogenization or solution treatment prior to the ageing, as well as overageing treatment can cause the weakening of Mn segregation at the macro/nano-scale and even the precipitation of α-Mn, thus leading to the undesirable damping <b>capacity</b> and <b>usage</b> temperature.

In particular, given a cluster of base stations (wireless network with a certain traffic capacity per base station), the objective of this thesis is to determine when it is optimal to increase capacity to each of the base stations of the cluster. Based on several time series taken from the wireless and bandwidth industry, it is argued that <b>capacity</b> <b>usage</b> is the major uncertain component in telecommunications. It is found that price has low volatility when compared to <b>capacity</b> <b>usage.</b> A real options approach is then applied to derive a two dimensional partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) to value investments in telecommunication infrastructure when <b>capacity</b> <b>usage</b> is uncertain and has temporary sudden large variations. This real options PIDE presents several numerical challenges. First, the integral term must be solved accurately and quickly enough such that the general PIDE solution is reasonably accurate. To deal with the integral term, an implicit method is suggested. Proofs of timestepping stability and convergence of a fixed point iteration scheme are presented. The correlation integral is computed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. Techniques are developed to avoid wrap-around effects. This method is tested on option pricing problems where the underlying asset follows a jump diffusion process. Second, the absence of diffusion in one direction of the two dimensional PIDE creates numerical challenges regarding accuracy and timestep selection. A semi-Lagrangian method is presented to alleviate these issues. At each timestep, a set of one dimensional PIDEs is solved and the solution of each PIDE is updated using semi-Lagrangian timestepping. Crank-Nicolson and second order backward differencing timestepping schemes are studied. Monotonicity and stability results are derived. This method is tested on continuously observed Asian options. Finally, a five factor algorithm that captures many of the constraints of the wireless network capacity investment decision timing problem is developed. The upgrade decision for different upgrade decision intervals (e. g. monthly, quarterly, etc.) is studied, and the effect of a safety level (i. e. the maximum allowed capacity used in practice on a daily basis—which differs from the theoretical maximum) is investigated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we assess the {{benefits}} of using statistical techniques to ascertain the shareability of protection channels when computing shared mesh restored lightpaths in optical mesh networks. These optical networks support wavelength conversion everywhere as a byproduct of the electronic nature of the switching in the OEO optical cross-connect used. Current deterministic approaches require a detailed level of information proportional {{to the number of}} active lightpaths. Although this is not an issue for good size networks in the foreseeable future, these approaches are not practicable for distributed route computation involving larger networks. On the other hand, distributed approaches that do not make use of shareability information require a significant amount of additional capacity compared to a centralized approach with access to complete shareability information. With the proposed approach we show that even with less information, independent of the amount of traffic demand, it is possible to predict the shareability of protection channels with remarkable accuracy. In addition, we propose a local distributed channel assignment scheme that is used in conjunction with our distributed route computation proposal to assign shared channels when provisioning the backup path.
