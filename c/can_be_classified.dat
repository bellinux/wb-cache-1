5|$|According {{to market}} {{researcher}} Mintel, about 12% of the U.S. population {{can be identified}} as True Greens, consumers who seek out and regularly buy so-called green products. Another 68% <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as Light Greens, consumers who buy green sometimes.|$|E
5|$|Forces <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as {{conservative}} or nonconservative. Conservative forces are {{equivalent to the}} gradient of a potential while nonconservative forces are not.|$|E
30|$|Many image {{contrast}} enhancement techniques <b>are</b> available which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> roughly <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> into two categories, i.e., spatial-domain algorithm and transform-domain algorithm.|$|R
50|$|A wedge <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as a digonal cupola.|$|R
5000|$|Ceramics <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{into three}} {{distinct}} material categories: ...|$|R
5|$|Many {{proteins}} (in Eucaryota ~33%) contain large unstructured but biologically functional segments and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as intrinsically disordered proteins. Predicting and analysing protein disorder is, therefore, {{an important}} part of protein structure characterisation.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{have evolved}} many {{secondary}} metabolites involved in plant defense, which are collectively known as antiherbivory compounds and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> into three sub-groups: nitrogen compounds (including alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates and benzoxazinoids), terpenoids, and phenolics.|$|E
5|$|Psychosocial {{interventions}} {{are used as}} an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> within behaviour-, emotion-, cognition- or stimulation-oriented approaches. Research on efficacy is unavailable and rarely specific to AD, focusing instead on dementia in general.|$|E
5000|$|Inhalants <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> by {{chemical}} structure. Classes include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Performance cars <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{according}} to their source: ...|$|R
5000|$|VCTs <b>can</b> usually <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{according}} to the following criteria: ...|$|R
5|$|Selection <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{in several}} {{different}} ways, such as by its effect on a trait, on genetic diversity, by the life cycle stage where it acts, by the unit of selection, or by the resource being competed for.|$|E
5|$|The laws of kashrut <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{according}} to {{the origin of the}} prohibition (Biblical or rabbinical) and whether the prohibition concerns the food itself or a mixture of foods.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of strains {{belonging}} to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups. Particularly the use of whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based on such data, five subspecies of E. coli were distinguished.|$|E
25|$|A {{megacolon}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> either acute or chronic. It <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{according to}} cause.|$|R
30|$|ITS {{wireless}} communication <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{according to the}} data contents.|$|R
2500|$|Endocarditis <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> by {{the side}} of the heart affected: ...|$|R
5|$|A {{stochastic}} process <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> in different ways, for example, by its state space, its index set, or the dependence among the random variables. One common way of classification {{is by the}} cardinality of the index set and the state space.|$|E
5|$|Airway {{management}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> into {{closed or}} open techniques {{depending on the}} system of ventilation used. Tracheal intubation is a typical example of a closed technique as ventilation occurs using a closed circuit. Several open techniques exist, such as spontaneous ventilation, apnoeic ventilation or jet ventilation. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it should be used.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids are organic {{compounds}} containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements {{are found in the}} side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> in many ways. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acid residues form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles and other tissues. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.|$|E

50|$|Crossovers <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{based on}} the type of {{components}} used.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} Garo {{musical instruments}} <b>can</b> broadly <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> into four groups.|$|R
5|$|As {{described}} previously, {{the molecules}} that underlie LTP <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, {{such as the}} NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} classification is a discipline {{in its own}} right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> by their effective range, their material composition, their size, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses {{the means by which}} they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{differential}} equations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{by considering the}} matrix of coefficients of the highest-order differential operators of the equation. For elliptic partial {{differential equations}} this matrix is positive definite, which has decisive influence {{on the set of}} possible solutions of the equation in question.|$|E
5000|$|Endocarditis <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> by {{the side}} of the heart affected: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> {{into three}} {{categories}} depending on the prevailing compositions: ...|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of worm depending on which direction they turn when encountering a new type of intersection. The different varieties of worm <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> systematically by assigning every direction a number and listing the choice made every time a new type of intersection is encountered.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|According to Article 142 of the Turkish Constitution, the organisation, {{duties and}} {{jurisdiction}} of the courts, their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law. In line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws, the court system in Turkey <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> under three main categories; which are the Judicial Courts, Administrative Courts and Military Courts. Each category includes first instance courts and high courts. In addition, the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes rules on cases that cannot be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system.|$|E
