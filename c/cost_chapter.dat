Moreover some elementary arguments are given for {{a better understanding of}} the mathematical tools. The first chapter introduces the concentration of measure principle.

The second chapter is devoted to the so-called weak transport inequality related to the general concentration of measure principle.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the empirical literature about how uncertainty affects firm-level investment behavior and capital accumulation using a structural econometric approach. Chapter 2 surveys the literature and highlights {{that there are two}} key channels through which uncertainty may affect investment decisions. One reflects the non-linearity of operating profits in stochastic demand or productivity parameters, summarized as the Hartman-Abel-Caballero (HAC) effect. Another reflects frictions in capital adjustment, summarized by different forms of capital adjustment costs: partial irreversibility, a fixed cost of undertaking any investment and quadratic adjustment <b>costs.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 3 presents simulation evidence about the effects of uncertainty on investment dynamics and capital accumulation through different forms of adjustment costs. Using the Method of Simulated Moments, Chapters 4 and 5 estimate fully parametric structural investment models, for panels of Brazilian and UK manufacturing firms, respectively. Chapter 4 investigates the effects of reducing capital adjustment costs. Counterfactual simulations indicate that investment would be much more responsive to new information about profitability if firms in Brazil faced a lower level of adjustment costs. A lower level of adjustment costs would also induce firms to operate with substantially higher capital stocks. Both these effects are mainly due to the importance of the estimated quadratic adjustment <b>costs.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 5 then investigates the effects of changing the level of uncertainty. The estimated investment models predict a small effect of uncertainty on investment dynamics in the short-run, and a negative and potentially large effect of uncertainty on capital accumulation in the long-run. The long-run effect of uncertainty operates through the negative effect of quadratic adjustment costs in the baseline model, or through a richer combination of effects in an extended model that allows discount rates to vary with the level of uncertainty.

40|$|Microporous {{coordination}} polymers (MCPs), materials {{built from}} metal clusters bridged with organic linkers, constitute {{a rapidly growing}} class of porous solids. The conventional synthetic strategies for production of MCPs involve coordination polymerization of one type linker with a single metal. Despite {{the success of this}} method, there exist several challenges with regard to producing highly porous and commercially viable MCPs. These disadvantages include interpenetration of frameworks upon linker extension causing a reduction in porosity and the requirement for synthetically complex linkers to achieve high porosity leading to a drastic increase in cost. This thesis is focused on multicomponent approaches for synthesis of structurally diverse MCPs. In addition, using multiple building units enables suppression of interpenetration, higher predictability over network topology, and an overall reduction in <b>cost.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 2 describes a coordination copolymerization approach of three carboxylate linkers; this strategy was employed to generate a series of isoreticular (having the same network topology) pillared-layer MCPs wherein structures were tuned uniaxially via controllable replacement of pillar linker. Moreover, pillar linker extension occurred in absence of interpenetration resulting in highly porous MCPs. The coordination terpolymerization strategy described in chapter 2 is also exploited to alter the connectivity within the layer arrangement of a pillared-layer MCP in chapter 3. Using a mixture of commercially available linkers of differing lengths enabled formation of a pillared-layer MCP with a non-regular layer structure and no interpenetration. In chapter 4 the power of the multicomponent approach is leveraged through covalent bond formation in tandem with coordination chemistry. A linker was designed which allows either coordination processes or a combination of coordination processes and covalent bond formation to occur in presence of Zn(II). Upon addition of various reaction partners, materials with variable architectures and pore characteristics are obtained.

40|$|Information {{processing}} in {{the brain}} depends upon the interactions of diverse signaling units, neurons, which vary in their circuit positions, biophysical and biochemical properties, and electrophysiological phenotypes. These distinguishing properties enable neurons to serve different computational and functional roles. For instance, the fast-spiking inhibitory subclasss, which synchronizes its firing at fast frequencies and makes divergent and convergent contacts onto the persimomatic compartments of its targets, is hypothesized {{to play an important}} role in regulating the timing and probability of spike output and thus the flow of information through the brain (reviewed in Chapter 1). However, the functional consequences of synchronized inhibition will depend on the integrative properties and circuit locations of the recipient neurons. Using a combination of in-vitro whole cell electrophysiology, modeling, and model-neuron hybrids (dynamic clamp), we determined how fast synchronized inhibition interacts with integrative properties of a variety of neuronal types to regulate the rate (Chapter 2) and timing (Chapter 3) of spike generation. We find that a neuron's intrinsic physiology substantially affects the ability of fast synchronized inhibition to control neuronal responsiveness. In addition, we demonstrate how the relevant physiology can be flexibly altered by contextual and neuromodulatory factors. The results of these experiments suggest that synchronized fast-spiking activity can differentially affect various circuit elements and each element's responsiveness can be adjusted on a range of time scales to suit the cortex's changing computational requirements. Because the brain is one of the most energetically expensive organs in the body with action potential generation accounting for significant portion of the energy usage, we hypothesized that differences in neuronal properties may also serve to minimize energy consumption subject to functional constraints. Again using electrophysiology, modeling, and dynamic clamp, we compared the energy needed to produce action potentials singly and in trains for a wide range of channel densities and kinetic parameters, and examined which combinations of parameters maximized spiking function while minimizing energetic <b>cost</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 4). We found evidence supporting our hypothesis in a wide range of neurons from several species. We conclude that neuronal biophysics are tuned to perform cost-effective function...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{informal and}} corruptive activities agents may pursue within organisations. Chapter 1 {{is a brief}} introduction to the general theme and the related literature. Chapter 2 develops a simple theory of non-monetary collusion, where agents collude by exchanging favours. It examines the optimal use of supervisory information in a simple hierarchy under potential collusion. It is shown that when only the supervisor's information about the agent is used, collusion does not arise, since favours can not be exchanged. Secondly, it is analysed whether the agent's information about his superior should be used. In this case collusion is possible, {{and there is an}} interesting trade-off between the benefits of using additional information and the costs of collusion. It is then shown that sometimes the principal may be better off when using less than all available information. Chapter 3 considers task assignment and whistle-blowing as measures a principal may use to break collusion. The principal's response to potential collusion is to allocate less time to monitoring, and he breaks collusion with money. It is shown that the principal may also break collusion by hiring a third worker, and the decision how to break collusion optimally is endogenously determined. Breaking collusion by task assignment is costly, and therefore we consider whistle-blowing as a collusion breaking device. It provides the principal strictly higher welfare than the collusion-proof solution. It is also shown that under reasonable conditions, the collusion-free outcome will be achieved with no further <b>cost.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 4 develops a model of blackmail, where a piece of information an agent prefers to keep private may facilitate blackmail when another agent, namely a blackmailer, threatens to reveal that information. The crucial feature of the blackmail game is the commitment problem from the blackmailer's side. The blackmailer can not commit not to come back in future to demand more despite the payments received in the past. The chapter outlines conditions under which successful extortion may arise, and shows that there is a unique Markov Perfect Equilibrium, which gives a precise prediction how much money the blackmailer is able to extort from the victim. It is also shown that the blackmailer receives a blackmail premium that compensates the blackmailer for not taking money from the victim and revealing information anyway...|$|E

This DC power supply is a combination of AC-DC Rectifier coupled with a battery bank to support the load when AC input is not available. Figures 0. 1 and 0. 2 show the line diagram of the DC power supply. The power supply is the most critical element in a telecom installation and it should be highly reliable in order to have un-interrupted service. (Fig) Besides reliability, power density and cost are the driving forces behind the success of a power supply in the market. Off late, the reach of telecom in the society is very wide covering remote villages and major metros. Given this environment, the power supply is exposed to extreme input conditions. It is desirable to design the power supply capable of withstanding wide AC input conditions. Another advantage is that the rectifier unit will keep the battery charged so that the battery will have long life. This thesis is aimed at designing a 1400 W (56 V/ 25 A) telecom power supply, keeping in view of the issues expressed above. The aim is to design a Switched Mode Rectifier (SMR) that tolerate wide input voltage variations (90 Vac to 300 Vac). In addition, the design covers unity input power factor, high efficiency (> 90 %), high power density (), parallel operation and low <b>cost</b> (). <b>Chapter</b> 1 of this thesis covers the context and motivation of the work.

40|$|In D. melanogaster, {{resistance}} to DDT is conferred by the upregulation of a cytochrome P 450 enzyme, CYP 6 G 1. Resistant flies have tandemly duplicated Cyp 6 g 1 alleles that possess the LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) of an Accord retrotransposon {{inserted in the}} cis-regulatory region, 291 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This DDT resistance allele (DDT-R) {{has been shown to}} have pleiotropic fitness benefits for female flies in at least one genetic background and with evidence of sexually antagonistic selection at this locus. In this thesis, I first review the role of transposable elements in conferring insecticide resistance and the evidence to date regarding the pleiotropic effects of DDT-R in D. melanogaster. By conducting life history and behavioural tests on flies of two genetic backgrounds I examine the sex-specific effects of expressing DDT-R in the absence of DDT. Finally I develop a single locus population genetics model based on these sex-specific effects and test the model using replicate laboratory populations. The first main finding is that DDT-R incurred a male mating cost that depended on the genetic background in which DDT-R was found and that this cost coincided with strong epistasis between genetic background and DDT-R that influenced male size (Chapter 3). Following on from this result, it was confirmed that the effect of DDT-R on male size does contribute to lowered mating success but does not fully explain this fitness <b>cost</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 4). Additionally, resistant males were found to have a lowered rate of courtship behaviour driven by aborted chasing of females and lower male-male aggression than susceptible males (Chapter 4). Fitness assays in wild caught strain females revealed that DDT-R confers a fecundity increase but unlike previous work, no offspring viability increases were detected (Chapter 5). Thus as with male costs, specific pleiotropic female fitness benefits to resistance depend on genetic background. Modelling of DDT-R using a simple single-locus approach (Chapter 6) provides, for the first time, a unifying explanation for past and present DDT-R frequencies in nature and in old laboratory populations. The model is consistent with an old origin for the original DDT-R mutation held at low equilibrium frequency through balancing selection of a sexually antagonistic nature. It is also consistent with continued near fixation of DDT-R long after discontinued use and matches empirical observations in laboratory populations of the Canton-S background...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Presentation date: 2009 - 03 - 12 One of {{the basic}} {{questions}} facing transportation planners and road managers is how to provide and maintain a road system that provides efficient access to the forest while limiting adverse effects roads can have on water and soil resources. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop decision support models that will lead to improved economic and environmental efficiency in the management of forest road networks. In particular, I focus on developing techniques to facilitate tradeoff analysis and help landowners identify optimal erosion control policies. Forest roads contribute to accelerated erosion, which can degrade water quality and aquatic habitat. Federal agencies in the Pacific Northwest are actively seeking to remove and/or improve roads in order to restore watershed condition, and private landowners face regulatory restrictions under the Clean Water Act and state forest practice acts. Though the treatment that best achieves management objectives for a single road can often be identified, at larger scales the combination of treatments to assign to a suite of roads can become too large for enumeration. In these circumstances decision aids can and have been used. This dissertation is comprised of five manuscripts that pair industrial engineering and forest engineering principles in order to provide relevant decision support tools to facilitate forest road management. The manuscripts address a range of available treatments, including regular maintenance, upgrading, and road removal. The first chapter describes the challenges associated with erosion control, reviews available road treatments, and summarizes salient applications of decision support for road management, focusing on applications where controlling road-related erosion was an objective. The second chapter introduces a tradeoff analysis framework for controlling road-related erosion. The third chapter presents an algorithm for routing maintenance vehicles (graders) across a forest road network in order to minimize total tour length, a proxy for operating <b>cost.</b> <b>Chapter</b> four extends this work to a multi-objective context, seeking efficient solutions that simultaneously minimize vehicle operating cost plus grading cost and hazard weighted rut depth, a measure of environmental performance.

Chapter six extends this work to a multi-objective context, approximating the efficient frontier for length of road removed and removal cost, and investigating further the potential for aggregate recycling to effectively subsidize decommissioning projects. Chapter seven concludes the dissertation with a review of the preceding chapters...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{and food}} {{are two major}} global issues. Interestingly, both {{of them have a}} close {{relationship}} with corn, a staple crop around the world. Bioethanol, which is the most popular gasoline alternative, is mostly produced from corn in the US. Since corn grain is for human food or livestock feed, the production of corn ethanol has caused some controversies. However, ethanol produced from corn stover is less controversial since corn stover is agricultural waste. On the other hand, more food needs to be produced globally to meet the fast-growing world population. Despite that, a stunning portion of food is being wasted every year, among which a lot of corn is being lost due to storage insect maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) in sub-Saharan Africa and around the world. One of the objectives of this project was to find an energy-efficient operation for corn stover size reduction processing, which is an unavoidable and energy-intensive process for lignocellulosic ethanol production. The other objective was to test the effectiveness of a new method to separate maize weevil, the most common corn storage insect, from corn kernels, to reduce the storage loss of corn grain. Chapter 1 of this thesis is the general introduction and literature review. Chapter 2, 3, 4 are three individual chapters for the three studies in this project. Chapter 5 is the summary, conclusions, and suggestions for future work. Chapter 2 and chapter 3 of this thesis are focused on corn stover size reduction process. Specifically, chapter 2 talks about a bench-scale experiment of grinding corn stover of different initial sizes and different moisture contents with a knife mill using different screens, looking for the most energy-efficient settings. The results showed that initial size of corn stover had no effect on grinding energy consumption. However, both moisture content of corn stover and the screen size affected the grinding energy consumption. As higher moisture content and smaller screen size, the grinding energy consumption would increase. In Chapter 3, a TEA and an LCA of the grinding experiment were conducted. CO 2 emissions and cost of 6 different grinding scenarios were compared on the basis of producing the same amount of fermentable sugars after the size reduction process. The results showed that grinding the corn stover at the moisture content of 5 % W.

The chapter considers two cases, the {{case in which the}} donor has unrestricted aid budget and the case where the donor has a fixed aid budget. The main concern in this chapter is determining the optimal contract for the donor that maximizes the effectiveness of the aid given her aid budget when she dealing with aid-recipients in the presence of moral hazard problem. The model analyzes the monitoring procedures between two players, donor and recipient in a one-shot game. It assumes that the decision to monitor and the choice of the recipient 2 ̆ 7 s action are taken simultaneously. It suggests that with a fixed aid budget the donor is unlikely to invest heavily in monitoring cost and reward payment since the primary purpose of such aid is to help the poor in the recipient country. The reward payment which provides incentives for the recipient to work does indeed have a stronger effect on the likelihood of project success. It also shows that both the probability of monitoring and the optimal reward respond differently to change in monitoring <b>cost.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 2 studies the effect of aid-recipient governance on the allocation of foreign aid. It examines the hypothesis that better governance can reduce aid transaction cost which increases the assistance received by developing countries. The following questions were the main concern of this chapter, does better governance increase the amount of foreign aid delivered to developing countries? Do donors consider the levels of recipient’s governance when they allocate their funding? The chapter adopts annual data on a group of 67 developing countries covering Africa, and South Asia for the period from 2003 to 2014. It shows a positive relationship between two of our six governance indicators and the quantity of foreign aid. In fact, only control of corruption and voice and accountability have statistically significant effect on the amount of aid. It also shows that control variables have important effect in the determinate of foreign aid expect GDP per capita. Chapter 3 studies the impact of aid-recipient governance on aggregate welfare in developing countries. It investigates whether the effect of foreign aid on human development depends on the level of governance in recipient countries. These relationships are explored in an econometric analysis, 2 SLS estimation, of panel data for the period from 2003 to 2014 in a sample of 67 developing countries. Our hypothesis is that better governance provides a better environment for foreign aid donor to achieve their goals. The main findings show that aid has a positive impact on human development only when it interacts with two out of the six indicators of governance: control of corruption and political stability. Aid by itself and military expenditures {{have a negative impact on}} the human development index...|$|E

40|$|Species and {{ecosystems}} worldwide {{are threatened by}} human activities, and intensive conservation efforts are needed to slow the ongoing biodiversity crisis (Tittensor et al. 2014). Islands are crucial to the conservation of global biodiversity: in just 5. 5 % of the earth's land area, they contain a disproportionate amount of terrestrial species, including an estimated 19 % of birds and 17 % of rodents. Islands are also highly vulnerable to human impact; 77 % of known terrestrial vertebrate extinctions have taken place on islands and 40 % of critically endangered species currently inhabit them (Tershy et al. In press). The leading cause of extinction and endangerment on islands is introduced species (Tershy et al. In press). In particular, animals associated with humans, such as such as rats, mice, pigs, goats, rabbits, and cats, have become feral on {{a large percentage of}} the world's roughly 400, 000 islands (Atkinson 1985). These invaders have a myriad of direct and indirect effects on insular species, such as overgrazing of native plants, predation of native animals, competition with natives for food and other resources, and alteration of important physical and chemical ecosystem processes (Croll et al. 2005, Towns et al. 2006, Fukami et al. 2006, Kurle et al. 2008, Spear and Chown 2009, Simberloff 2011, Medina et al. 2011). The eradication of invasive mammals from islands is an increasingly utilized conservation tool with a strong record of mitigating or reversing much of the damage caused by invasions (Barun et al. 2011 a). Nearly 1, 100 successful eradications to date have removed invasive mammals from 750 islands globally (DIISE 2014). Ongoing developments in eradication technologies are creating opportunities to eradicate invasive vertebrates from increasingly large and complex islands (Howald et al. 2007, Burbidge 2011, Campbell et al. 2011). Consequently, national and regional government agencies and conservation organizations are increasingly investing in vigorous eradication programs on islands. However, the global scale of island invasions greatly outweighs the resources available to undertake eradication projects. To ensure that biodiversity conservation resources are allocated as effectively and efficiently as possible, islands must be prioritized for eradications. In my dissertation I address the island prioritization problem comprehensively. First, I develop a statistical model that explains global island extinctions as a function of invasive mammal presence, native taxonomy, and island attributes (Chapter 1). I use this model to isolate and quantify the impacts of invasive mammals on globally threatened island vertebrate species, and to predict the benefits to these species from invasive mammal eradication. Then, I combine these predicted benefits with eradication cost estimates, and develop an optimization model that identifies sets of islands where specified conservation goals can be attained via eradication for the minimum <b>cost</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 2). Finally, I assess the importance of socio-political factors in global conservation planning (Chapter 3). Taken together, the sections of my dissertation synthesize global data on island biodiversity, threats, costs, and governance, and provide results and tools that strengthen global prioritization efforts for invasive mammal eradications on islands...|$|E
40|$|Game theory studies {{strategic}} decision making among multiple rational players. Since 1950 Nash’s famous paper, it has wide applications to many fields: political science, financial market, cooperate finance, industrial organization and etc. Researchers {{are not only}} interested in the applications of game theory but also focus on the mechanism design that considers the structure of game forms. In this dissertation, I explore both areas: the first two chapters consider the games played by multiple players in industrial organization and the third chapter considers the mechanism design problem for the assignment problem. Continued government support of public good programs (e. g. assistance to less developed countries, or to university researchers for work on a multistage project, or to communities for environmental improvement programs) often depends on grant recipients making adequate progress toward their goals. Chapter 1 studies a prisoner’s dilemma with positive payoffs that will repeat a given known number of times or until {{there is evidence of}} cheating, whichever comes first. Our discussion focuses precisely on how much cooperation is possible (i. e., for how many periods cooperation lasts). When the termination rule is based on perfect information about the players’ behavior and players are motivated to cooperate for at least one period, early termination of the game never occurs, i. e. cooperation continues until the last possible period. Cooperation may end sooner when the termination rule is based on imperfect information about the players’ behavior. For the case of imperfect information, I show how much cooperation can occur {{as a function of the}} model parameters and under the assumption that players are able to engage in mutual monitoring. Chapter 2 investigates the motivation of mutual recommendations. It seems irrational for people to refer customers to the other stores without having any profit. But such examples are around us, for example, a mechanical shop may refer customers to another one when it cannot fix the issues. In this chapter, I consider a two-player infinitely repeated game. Players, in each period, can either choose recommendation or not-recommendation that depends on the history of a public signal. A new mechanism, k + 1 punishment scheme, is proposed in which two players stop recommending when k consecutive bag signals occur. Among all possible k + 1 punishment schemes, there exists a unique optimal k* to maximize the player’s payoff. Thus, mutual recommendations between players can increase their overall profits even if such action incurs <b>cost.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 3 investigates a typical class of assignment problems, which relaxes the assumption of the completeness of bipartite graphs but enforces balance conditions. When the domain is 2 -connectivity (each agent has at most 2 available tasks), I find there exist mechanisms satisfying ordinal-efficiency, equal treatment of equals, and strategy-proof. This result does not restrict the number of players in the game. Since a strong negative result exists in the standard assignment problem, I propose a new mechanism, hybrid mechanism, to find a more relaxed domain to simultaneously satisfy all previous three conditions. The last chapter of my dissertation explores the portfolio management. It compares the results of the decay model with various DCC-GARCH models in risk parity strategy. 16 commodity futures data ranging from 1990. 1. 1 to 2013. 12. 31 are implemented to construct portfolio weights. The performance measures are risk attribution, Sharpe Ratio, total return, loss functions and rolling volatilities. I find the decay model and DCC-GARCH model have the similar performances under risk-parity strategy, even if they have different assumptions about the covariance matrix...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{beginning}} of the nineties, interconnection pricing emerged as a high priority regulatory policy question. As more and more state-owned monopolies were privatized, their essential facility (or simply their network) had to be opened to competition. The most viable practice was call-by-call services in telecommunications markets. Entrants were allowed to buy capacity of the incumbent’s network in order to provide service to customers. Because the incumbent always has an incentive to foreclose the market, these agreements between incumbent and entrant were and still are in the focus of regulatory authorities all over the world. Although this so-called one-way interconnection model is still valid, competition between fully fledged networks has become of growing importance. Today cable providers are also capable of offering telecommunication services. However they dispose of a mature network and can bypass the former incumbent’s essential facility. Early models of network competition, such as Laffont, Rey, and Tirole (1998 a) and Armstrong (1998) highlight the collusive role of interconnection charges in these settings. Hence the regulator is called for. The present thesis looks at instruments that can be used to regulate interconnection markets. It is comprised of three papers on access pricing in one-way as well as in twoway interconnection models. Chapter 2 looks at instruments that can be employed by the regulator, chapters 3 and 4 introduce fully decentralized mechanisms, where the role of the regulator is reduced to a minimum. Chapter 2 introduces a one-way interconnection model with a vertically integrated incumbent and an entrant who uses the incumbent network. Firms produce differentiated services and compete for customers. Traditional literature on interconnection pricing uses primarily per-unit access charges, hence the interconnection payment depends on he overall amount of traffic exchanged. In this paper we present a different approach to pricing interconnection. Because products are differentiated, the demand for end service is directly dependent on both firms’ retail prices. We generalize the access payment function and make it solely dependent on market prices. I show that a per-unit access price is a special case of a contract on both firms’ retail prices. Because such a function uses at east two instruments, we are able to reproduce specific access charge rules. Furthermore, due to the increased number of instruments, the set of possible outcomes is increased compared to a per-unit access charge. By comparing different benchmark cases and computing their respective parameters, we show that they can be used as a preliminary measure of goodness of the access mechanism. Additionally, we show that bill & keep, that is providing access free of charge, yields lower retail prices than regulating a per-unit access charge at <b>cost.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 3 uses the findings of chapter 2 and introduces as particular mechanism based on firms’ retail prices. We use the exact same model of industry structure, i. e. a vertically integrated incumbent and an entrant, that uses network capacity as an essential input. Product market competition is imperfect, i. e. products are differentiated. The access pricing mechanism is fully decentralized, i. e. other than setting up the rules of the game, the regulator does not intervene in the market at all. This is a particular strength of our mechanism, since traditional access pricing rules always require the regulator to dispose of almost full market information 1. The access payment mechanism is modeled as a game between the incumbent and the entrant. Each firm determines a parameter in a linear payment function on firms’ downstream retail prices. We show that this results in lower prices and higher welfare than the regulated per-unit access charge approach. Furthermore we present conditions for which the equilibrium in the model coincides with the optimal Ramsey outcome. Chapter 4 draws on the literature pioneered by Laffont, Rey, and Tirole (1998 a), Laffont, Rey, and Tirole (1998 b) and Armstrong (1998). It uses a two-way interconnection model, with network-based price discrimination, i. e. firms charge different prices for their own and the competitor’s network. The paper of Gans and King (2001) shows, that when firms are able to charge two-part tariffs, a per-unit access charge is used as a collusive device. The optimal equilibrium access charge is below marginal cost, hence customers save on off-net calls. However this is more than offset by an increase in the flat payment and overall welfare is reduced as compared to a regime with access priced at marginal cost Using a consumer’s net-utility function we derive a new retail price mechanism. Instead of competing in flat fees, firms offer net-utility levels. In that case, the monthly payment is derived from the equilibrium net-utility level and the gross utility of making calls to both networks. The paper shows that using such a mechanism eliminates the collusive power of access charge is vanished and overall welfare is increased. Since net-utility is a function of the flat payment, the result is reminiscent of the literature on Bertrand and Cournot Competition with substitutes. We employ a graphical argument used in Cheng (1985) to show that competition in net-utility levels is a dominated strategy. The same is true for price competition when prices are complements...|$|E

The truck-only system is always regarded as the counterpart of the intermodal freight system in this dissertation. To examine the environmental performance of the intermodal freight system, CO 2 emissions generated from all the processes in the intermodal chain, such as pre- and post-haulage, long distance haulage, and transshipment, are estimated considering different sources that generate electricity and transmission loss of electricity (Chapters 3 and 4). To examine the economic performance of the system, two approaches are considered: (1) finding the intermodal breakeven distance for which the intermodal system is more competitive than the truck-only system (Chapter 5); (2) examining the economies of scale in the intermodal network and finding the route/system choice that minimizes the total freight transportation <b>costs</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 6).
