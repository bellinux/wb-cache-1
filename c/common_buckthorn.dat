50|$|Rhamnus cathartica, the buckthorn, <b>common</b> <b>buckthorn</b> or purging buckthorn, is {{a species}} of small tree in the {{flowering}} plant family Rhamnaceae. It is native to Europe, northwest Africa and western Asia, from the central British Isles south to Morocco, and east to Kyrgyzstan. It was introduced to North America as an ornamental shrub in the early 19th century or perhaps before, and is now naturalized in the northern half of the continent, and is classified as an invasive plant in several US states and in Ontario, Canada.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant is}} similar to <b>common</b> <b>buckthorn,</b> but the stems are more stout and the leaves are longer. In its native range it may be up to 10 meters tall. It may also reach up to 9 meters in cultivation. The oppositely {{arranged}} leaves are up to 13 centimeters long by 6 wide in its native range, and usually smaller where it is introduced. The male flowers are just under a centimeter long and the female flowers are slightly smaller. The fruit is a drupe containing two seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Forest types {{typical in}} and around Wayzata have been [...] "maple-basswood forest, oak forest, lowland {{hardwood}} forest, and floodplain forest. Non-native forest types within the city were predominantly disturbed second growth forest types made up of elm, box elder, ash, cottonwood, with occasional basswood, maple, and oak." [...] Some of the species of plants that are considered invasive in the Wayzata area are purple loosetrife, narrow-leaf cattail, <b>common</b> <b>buckthorn,</b> leafy spurge, tartarian honeysuckle, garlic mustard, reed canary grass, Siberian elm, and Amur maple.

50|$|Billudden is the {{outermost}} part of Uppsalaåsen; here the esker forms a promontory {{into the sea}} before disappearing from sight underwater. The nature reserve is characterised by the hilly form of the esker, which is still rising with as much as 70 cm per century due to post-glacial rebound. Areas of windblown sand and sparse Scots pine woods {{can also be found}} in the nature reserve. The nature reserve furthermore contains the largest concentration of <b>common</b> sea <b>buckthorn</b> in Europe and several unusual fungi. There are two nature trails with information {{about the nature of the}} reserve intended for the educational use of both grown ups and children in the reserve.|$|R
50|$|The site is of {{considerable}} interest to ecologists in that {{several species of}} exotic woody shrubs have naturalized {{in the area to}} the exclusion of the native woody flora. The exotic shrubs that have become rampant are <b>common</b> <b>buckthorn</b> and common privet. Preferential deer herbivory of native species seems to be the primary cause of this invasion, and a deer exclusion has been attempted. The arboretum also has heavy and repeated infestation with Japanese beetle and this may also {{play a role in the}} dynamics of the shrub community which has developed in the garden over the last seventy years. The arboretum is currently directed by Dr. Ranessa Cooper and hosts art programs and children's programs during the summer.|$|E
50|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly on {{the leaves of}} either <b>common</b> <b>{{buckthorn}}</b> (Rhamnus cathartica) or alder buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) - the only two food plants - and females will wander far and wide in search for these particular shrubs. The larvae and pupae are both green and very well camouflaged making them difficult {{to find in the}} wild. Upon emerging from the pupae, brimstone butterflies spend the summer feeding on nectar to build up energy reserves for the winter {{and by the end of}} August they are already beginning their long sleep. They seek out evergreen scrub, a favourite being dense, old ivy growth. The brimstone usually hides until early spring, although a warm January day will occasionally wake an eager male. There is only one brood a year.|$|E
50|$|About 450 {{plant species}} were {{recorded}} in and around Nemrut Caldera, around 200 (44%) of them belonging to the region. The diversity of the flora points out to the variation of climate conditions in the past. Around 38 (8.4%) of the existing plant species are endemic. The upside down tulip, which grows here, is a world-famous flower. The climax vegetation of Nemrut Caldera forms the haired birch (Betula) and the trembling aspen (Populus tremula). Other notable plants growing around two lakes of the caldera are the trees dwarf juniper (Juniperus communis), Norway maple (Acer platanoides), European mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia), <b>common</b> <b>buckthorn</b> (Rhamnus cathartica), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), white willow (Salix alba), and the shrubs coinwort cotoneaster (Cotoneaster nummularius), cherry plum (Prunus divaricata), grey willow (Salix cinerea), Greek juniper (Juniperus excelsa), breaking buckthorn (Frangula alnus), alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus) and mahaleb cherry (Prunus mahaleb). Steppe-like vegetation is spread over wide areas in the caldera. Those are mainly species of milkvetch (Astragalus). Other subshrubs and herbaceous plants are prickly thrift (Acantholimon), sainfoin (Onobrychis), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella), Thymus, Alyssum, sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), Salvia, Ranunculus, Silene, rabbitfoot clover (Trifolium arvense), Pimpinella, Artemisia, squarrose (Centaurea triumfettii). Reedy areas are present In the northwestern part of Lake Nemrıt.|$|E
50|$|At {{the upper}} basin, {{the river is}} mainly {{surrounded}} by beech trees and beneath these grow bilberries, Cornish heath, sedges and luzulas.

50|$|The {{seeds and}} leaves are mildly {{poisonous}} {{for people and}} animals, but are readily eaten by birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings. The toxins cause stomach cramps and laxative effects that may function in seed dispersal. The chemical compounds responsible for this laxative effect are anthraquinone and emodin. The species name cathartica and the <b>common</b> name purging <b>buckthorn</b> refer to this effect.|$|R
5000|$|Puccinia coronata is a plant {{pathogen}} and causal agent of oat and barley crown rust. The pathogen occurs worldwide, infecting both wild and cultivated oats. It {{is a relatively}} new disease of barley in North America. It was first found in 1992 in a barley breeding nursery near Clay Center, Nebraska. Since then, crown rust has been found throughout the upper Midwest, with greatest incidence in the central Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota. In that region the alternate host, <b>common</b> <b>buckthorn</b> (Rhamnus cathartica), grows abundantly in shelter belts and riparian areas. Since 1993, outbreaks of crown rust have occurred on barley and forage grasses at several localities in this region. The extent of yield losses in barley caused by this disease have not been determined. Crown rust posed a threat to barley production, because the first infections in barley occur early in the season from local [...] Crown rusts have evolved many different physiological races within different species in response to host resistance. Each pathogenic race can attack a specific line of plants within the species typical host. For example, there are over 290 races of P. coronata. Crops with resistant phenotypes are often released, but within a few years virulent races have arisen and P. coronata can infect them.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the area}} is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common Twayblade, Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, <b>Common</b> <b>Buckthorn</b> and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch. The tree layer is dominated by beech trees that are more than 180 years old and, {{on the slopes of}} the hill, by equally ancient Scots Pines.|$|E
40|$|Oak forests {{throughout}} North America {{are declining}} due {{to changes in}} disturbance regimes {{that have led to}} increased competition from other tree and shrub species. We evaluated associations between oak regeneration, the occurrence of two common invasive shrubs (<b>common</b> <b>buckthorn</b> (Rhamnus cathartica L.) and Tartarian honeysuckle (Lonicera tatarica L.)), and forest edges in oak forests in a portion of the midwestern United States where bur (Quercus macrocarpa Michx.), red (Quercus rubra L.), and white oak (Quercus alba L.) were historically dominant. We found poor recruitment of oaks in comparison to other, more shade-tolerant tree species. Results further revealed a strong stand-scale association between bur oak, open canopy conditions, high soil nutrient levels, and the presence of <b>common</b> <b>buckthorn</b> and Tartarian honeysuckle; these same site characteristics were disassociated with red and white oak. Within red and white oak stands, however, the presence of the invasive shrubs was more pronounced near forest edges. While oak recruitment is hampered throughout stands, our research suggests that predominant constraints may vary based on soil and light gradients found along forest edges...|$|E
