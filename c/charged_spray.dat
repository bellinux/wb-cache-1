This method, along with other ambient sources, is gaining popularity for its ease-of-use {{and the lack of}} need for sample preparation for in situ analysis. The work demonstrated in this dissertation covers the fundamentals, method development, and applications for paper spray. The novel fundamental research deepens the understanding of the methodology to make future improvements in method development. High resolution images and measurement of the paper spray droplet sizes using a Phase Doppler Anemometer indicate that ionization from cellulosic microfibers provides a unique environment to create <b>charged</b> <b>spray</b> droplets. Further support of the mechanism is shown in a study of the ion current, analyte response, and internal energy deposition.

Much important geometrical and physical information are obtained in this paper. Droplets diameter and velocity distribution in electrostatic spray flow field are measured by PDPA. The spray characteristics including droplets size and velocity under different electrostatic voltages are investigated systemically and analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate that the droplets diameter and velocity distribution are affected apparently by electrical field. The droplets would produce secondary atomization in spray plume due to maintaining droplets stable conditions which are called as Rayleigh and Taylor instability respectively.

In order to investigate the convolution flow structure near the nozzle, discuss the effects of electrostatic voltages on convolution flow form, development and the aggrandizement of droplets mass transfer. PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) was employed to measure and analyze the convolution flow near the nozzle under different voltages, and the velocity vectors and streamlines were gained. Experiment and analysis indicate that convolution flow structure has been existed in electrostatic jet flow brim and the main jet flow section change is inconspicuous with voltages adding; Electrical filed intensity has been enhanced and the droplets convolution flow was picked up with the electrostatic voltages adding.

40|$|The {{maximum charge}} a drop may hold, for an {{electrically}} isolated, electrically con-ducting drop, in vacuum, {{is defined by}} the Rayleigh Limit. For spray plumes of electrically charged drops this condition is clearly not met due to the space charge field. We would like to simulate such spray plumes and to simulate drop break up within them, using stochastic methods. Since many simulated particles are re-quired a dynamic drop stability analysis is clearly not computationally feasible. Based upon a static analysis, and a thorough review of the previous experimental data on charged drop stability, it is shown that for dielectric drops in the presence of significant electric fields, and particularly those within spray plumes, the maxi-mum charge a drop may hold is less than the Rayleigh Limit. Typical values of sta-ble drop charge of 70 – 80 % of the conducting drop Rayleigh Limit are predicted, and this is supported by a majority of recent experimental work.

Great {{efforts have been}} taken in underground coal mines to prevent coal workers' pneumoconiosis by controlling respirable coal dust, but respirable coal dust levels in mines still often exceed occupational exposure limits. Water-based spray systems {{are one of the}} primary dust control methods in mines; studies have suggested a potential to improve spray dust collection efficiency by adding surfactants. This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of different surfactant-containing sprays in capturing lab-generated monodisperse polystyrene latex particles and polydisperse coal dust by analyzing the impact of particle diameter, aerosol charging condition, surfactant type, sign and magnitude of particle <b>charge,</b> <b>spray</b> solution surface tension, spray drop size, and sign and magnitude of <b>spray</b> drop <b>charge</b> on <b>spray</b> collection efficiency. In order to focus on how the electrical effects caused by adding surfactants to spray water impact spray collection efficiency, the spray surface tension and drop size were taken into account during statistical modeling. Results indicate that particle size had the most important impact on respirable dust capture by water-based spray. Most particles with a diameter greater than 2 �m can be removed by the spray regardless of other factors. The magnitude of particle <b>charge</b> affected <b>spray</b> efficiency in that highly-charged particles tended to be removed more efficiently than weakly-charged particles. The magnitude and sign of the <b>charge</b> on surfactant-containing <b>spray</b> drops depended on both surfactant classification and concentration. Pure water spray drops and spray drops with nonionic (Triton X- 100) and cationic (DAH) surfactants tended to carry net positive charges on average, whereas spray drops with anionic (SDS) surfactant tended to carry a net negative charge on average. However, the magnitude of <b>spray</b> drop <b>charge</b> was independent from the concentration of surfactant in the spray water. After controlling the surface tension and drop size, test results indicated a positive correlation between the magnitude of <b>spray</b> drop <b>charge</b> and <b>spray</b> collection efficiency. Nonionic surfactant-containing spray performed better in capturing respirable dust than the other sprays tested here, especially for weakly-charged aerosols. This superiority {{may be due to the}} relatively low surface tension and high charge magnitude of drops containing nonionic surfactant as compared to the other sprays tested here. Although the predominant mechanisms for respirable dust capture by water-based spray are inertial impaction and interception, electrical effects are also an important factor, especially for highly-charged particles. Therefore, the electrical effects caused by adding surfactants to spray water should be a consideration for future research regarding surfactant effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|In many {{applications}} liquid sprays are atomized using electrostatic methods, and typically these spray plumes containing drops {{that have a}} range of diameters. To understand and predict the dynamics of polydisperse electrically <b>charged</b> <b>spray</b> plumes, knowledge of how the electrical charge is distributed amongst the drops is required. This has been achieved by post-processing phase Doppler anemometry data for two electrostatically atomized liquid sprays and fitting the drop diameter-charge correlation to an assumed relationship of form q=ADn, Here q and D are drop charge and diameter and n and A are empirical constants that describe the correlation. Values of n and A were calculated to be 2. 1 to 2. 9 and 5. 8 × 10 - 5 for a spray of specific charge 1. 8 C/m 3 and 2. 1 to 3. 2 and its value of A is 2. 5 × 10 - 4 for a spray of specific charge 1. 2 C/m 6. It was found that the mean drop charge, for all drop diameters, for both data-sets, was almost always less than the drop Rayleigh limit. This latter fact gives confidence in the procedure used since no restriction was placed on this parameter during the processing. We also estimate the distribution of drop charge about the mean value and as a function of diameter and suggest that small drops possess higher rms charge levels...|$|E
40|$|A general {{procedure}} {{has been developed}} for the simulation of charged liquid and electrostatically atomized sprays. The procedure follows a Lagrangian approach for simulation of spray droplets and an Eulerian approach for gas phase variables, including the electric field generated by the charge presence on droplets. Validation of the procedure was examined through simulations of previously published <b>charged</b> <b>spray</b> experiments. Results showed that for the specification of initial droplet charge, modelling the droplet charge-diameter relationship through a scaling law is as reliable a method as using a directly obtained charge-diameter relationship from experimental measurements. The normalised root-mean-squared errors for sprays using the two methods were shown to be within 12 % of one another, for the prediction of spatially averaged profiles of mean droplet diameters, mean axial velocities and mean radial droplet velocities. Results showed that the general spatial characteristics and dynamics of a charged liquid spray can successfully be reproduced, including the axial and radial dispersal pattern of droplets, {{and the distribution of}} mean droplet diameters throughout the spray plume.

40|$|Desorption {{electrospray}} ionization {{mass spectrometry}} (DESI MS) is rapidly becoming {{accepted as a}} powerful surface characterization tool {{for a wide variety}} of samples in the open air. Besides its well-established high-throughput capabilities, a unique feature of DESI is that chemical reactions between the <b>charged</b> <b>spray</b> microdroplets and surface molecules can be exploited to enhance ionization. Here, we present a rapid screening assay for artesunate antimalarials based on reactive DESI. Artesunate is a vital therapy for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but artesunate tablets have been counterfeited on a very large scale in SE Asia, and more recently in Africa. For this reason, faster and more sensitive screening tests are urgently needed. The proposed DESI assay is based on the formation of stable noncovalent complexes between linear alkylamines dissolved in the DESI spray solution and artesunate molecules exposed on the tablet surface. We found that, depending on amine type and concentration, a sensitivity gain of up to 170 x can be obtained, in comparison to reagent-less DESI. Hexylamine (Hex), dodecylamine (DDA), and octadecylamine (ODA) produced proton-bound noncovalent complexes with gas-phase stabilities, increasing in the order [M + Hex + H]+ < [M + DDA + H]+ < [M + ODA + H]+. Tandem MS experiments revealed that complex formation occurred by hydrogen bonding between the amine nitrogen and the ether-like moieties within the artesunate lactone ring. After the reactive DESI assay was fully characterized, it was applied to a set of recently collected suspicious artesunate tablets purchased in shops and pharmacies in SE Asia. Not only did we find that these samples were counterfeits, but we also detected the presence of several wrong active ingredients. Of particular concern was the positive detection of artesunate traces in the surface of one of the samples, which we quantified with standard chromatographic techniques...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{predictions}} of the temporal evolution of pulsed sprays, typical of those used in gasoline direct injection spark ignition engines are presented, with the novelty that the drops are electrically charged. The rate of spray expansion, {{in terms of the}} fraction of maximum possible <b>spray</b> <b>charge</b> for a typical engine timescale, is investigated. The engine timescale chosen is the time available between spray injection and ignition, and for a low-speed engine operation, with injection during the intake stroke. The aim is to quantify the amount of electric charge, required to spread the spray throughout the engine cylinder, without causing excessive piston and wall impingement, prior to hypothetical ignition. It is found that experimentally realizable amounts of electric charge are sufficient to cause spray expansion throughout the engine cylinder within the timescale permitted. Also noted is a segregation of the smaller drops from their larger cousins, by virtue of the known non-linear variation in drop charge with drop mass.

40|$|The {{atomization}} of {{electrically insulating}} liquid fuels {{has been investigated}} using the charge injection method with consideration of its usefulness as a spray combustion technique. This requires electrostatic spraying systems that atomize unadulterated commercial grades of fuel oil sufficiently finely while being able to operate robustly in the ionized combustion environment. As a natural consequence of the liquid charging mechanism, the atomization quality improves with flow rate because of the dual action of aerodynamic shear and the higher specific charge {{that can be achieved}} in the liquid jet.

40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} is an {{important}} issue, as exposure to indoor allergens {{has been associated with}} recent increases in the prevalence of allergic disease. Reduction of indoor allergen levels can therefore {{play an important role in}} the overall management of these patients. Reviewed here are two new electrostatic techniques for controlling domestic dust and allergenic particles. A technique to improve the removal of airborne allergens has demonstrated enhanced precipitation of particles by charged liquid sprays. Charged sprays can be produced by maximising the shearing of electrical double layers during atomisation of liquids from domestic pressure-pack (PP) devices. Electrostatically charged sprays removed up to 45 % of the total mass of airborne dust particles. The effect on small particles (< 2. 0 μm) is most significant, the concentration of these being reduced by 73 % by the <b>charged</b> <b>spray,</b> compared with just 59 % by the equivalent uncharged spray. The removal of dust and allergen particles from normal carpets during vacuuming can be enhanced by the application of an electrostatically charged carpet care powder. Carpet powders, of the type used to deliver a fragrance to a domestic carpet, can be triboelectrically charged during delivery to above 1 x 10 (- 4) C/kg. It has been found that when this charged powder was applied to carpets, up to 99 % of dust was removed, 15 % more than when no powder was applied. Application of a standard, uncharged powder resulted in significantly less dust being recovered. It was proposed that the charged powder particles attract dust and allergen from within the carpet pile, and that these large agglomerates were more efficiently removed by vacuum cleaning. These novel techniques for dust and allergen particle control in the domestic environment represent new applications for electrostatic technology. They come at a time of increased public awareness and concern for indoor air quality, providing potential tools for allergen mitigation in the management of allergic disease patients...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough acetone, in DESI {{ionisation}} generally {{leads to}} protein aggregation, {{in this study}} we report unexpected multi-proton transfers to lysozyme using this aprotic solvent as a <b>charged</b> <b>spray.</b> The DESI/acetone mass spectrum of lysozyme displays (i) {{a significant increase in the}} average charge state (Zav) and (ii) an incomplete H+/Ca 2 + exchange, even though the overall contribution of cationised species is high, relative to those from spraying with a methanol/water solvent. This behavior is contrary to that expected from gas phase basicity, because GBacetone >GBmethanol. Decreasing the amount of sample deposited on the target (from 50 to 0. 050 pmole) leads to a charge state increase, as seen in ESI, but not in the extent of cationisation. Moreover, the DESI signal duration is extended with sprayed acetone even though the total ionic current is significantly lowered. With a d 6 -acetone spray, no incorporation of a deuteron occurs, and the ionization yield is strongly decreased for multi-protonated lysoi+ lysozyme. This is in contrast to that observed with a d 4 -methanol spray, which displays a distribution of 48 deuterons in the lyso 9 + ion as shown in high resolution with a LTQ/Orbitrap instrument. This unexpected behavior of the (CD 3) 2 CO spray suggests that protons do not originate from acetone. Furthermore, dry argon post-flow on the target surface results in the lysozyme signal suppression, whereas with a humid argon flow, the signal is regenerated. On the other hand, an argon stream bubbling in heavy water, yields incorporation of several deuterons. The interpretation of this behavior is explained by considering the acetone radical ions at the surface of the primary droplets (and/or offspring droplets and/or at the wet sample surface), being able to react with ambient moisture (or with traces of water adsorbed at liquid phase). Under these conditions, enough protons are produced to generate multi-charged solvated lysozyme aggregates which then become desolvated in the reduced pressure in the skimmer area...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, {{numerical}} methods {{useful for}} the simulation of gas-liquid multiphase flows are presented. Multiphase flows are commonly found throughout nature, human life, and engineering devices. As a result, accurate and predictive simulations of such flows will improve our understanding of these complex systems and aid {{in the development of}} more efficient engineering devices that exploit multiphase dynamics. The majority of multiphase flows dynamics occur at the gas-liquid interface. For example, many quantities (e. g., density and species concentrations) are discontinuous at the interface and surface tension is a singular force that acts at the interface. Therefore, accurately tracking the location of the interface, sharply handling discontinuities, and computing accurate interface curvature are critical components for predictive simulations of multiphase flows. In this work, two novel interface tracking strategies are proposed and tested. The methods extend the capabilities of both level set and volume-of-fluid (VOF) methods, which are commonly used interface capturing methodologies. A discretely consistent methodology is presented to transport VOF and additional quantities that may be discontinuous at the phase interface. By using the same transport scheme for the phase interface and the quantities, discrete conservation and second-order solution of the conservation laws is achieved. An improvement is proposed to the height function method, which is often used to compute the cur- vature in VOF simulations. Additionally, the height function method is extended to compute the curvature {{in the context of a}} conservative level set. These methods are used to simulate atomization, an important process in the combustion of liquid fuels. Namely, a liquid jet in cross-flow, an air-blast atomizer, and an electrically <b>charged</b> <b>spray,</b> are simulated and the results are compared to available experimental data. Qualitative comparisons of the spray appearance as well as quantitative measures of the spray penetration, drop size distributions, and droplet velocity distributions show that the simulations are capable of predicting the spray characteristics and are a viable tool in the engineering design process. Furthermore, the simulations provide a wealth of data that is useful for improving our understanding of multiphase flow systems...|$|E

However, SIMS has yet to be readily applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues because of its limited sensitivity at >500 Da and analyte fragmentation generated by the high-energy primary ion beam.

40|$|The work {{contained}} within this thesis concerns the behaviour of poly-dispersed and electrically charged particles in turbulent flows. Fundamental investigation has considered effects of momentum two-way coupling between particles and turbulence within such scenarios, and practical investigation {{has examined the}} potential utilisation of charge on fuel droplets to improve pre-combustion spray dynamics internal to marine Diesel combustion engines. A spectral formulation is derived for the mesoscopic Eulerian transport equation describing momentum and kinetic energy transport for mono-dispersed electrically charged particles suspended at isotropic or near-isotropic conditions. This spectral transport equation specifically takes into account momentum contributions from the random uncorrelated particle velocity field. An in-house pseudo-spectral direct numerical simulation (DNS) code has been extended and used to numerically investigate high order spectral statistics associated with momentum and kinetic energy transport equations for homogeneous and isotropic turbulence with particulate suspensions. Key results show that poly-dispersity can reduce the attenuation level of turbulent kinetic energy relative to mono-dispersed suspensions at similar mass loading ratios. In addition, two-way coupled charged particle suspensions were found to exhibit in their mesoscopic spectra, large scale augmentation of kinetic energy and small scale attenuation of kinetic energy, analogous to the behaviour of turbulence spectra {{in the presence of}} polymer chain additives. Furthermore, in the presence of gravity, two-way coupled charged particle suspensions were found under certain conditions, to fall with a velocity slower than their own Stokes settling velocity. A droplet charge-diameter distribution model suitable for attributing electrical charge to poly-dispersed droplets in electrostatically atomized dielectric liquid sprays, has successfully been validated against experimental data. A methodology has been developed that uses the charge-diameter distribution model to simulate and successfully predict characteristics of electrostatically atomized dielectric sprays for low pressure spray systems. A computational methodology has also been developed, suitable for predicting the characteristics of high pressure electrostatically charged sprays. This methodology has also been validated against existing experimental data, and is found to be reliable at predicting secondary atomization processes for both uncharged and <b>charged</b> <b>spray</b> plumes at elevated injection conditions...|$|E

The spray is driven by the voltage applied between the two electrodes. Numerical computations and order-of-magnitude estimates for a quiescent gas show that the droplets begin to fly back toward the injection electrode at a certain critical value of the flux of droplets in the spray, which depends very much on the electrical conditions at the injection electrode. As the flux is increased toward its critical value, the electric field induced by the charge of the droplets partially balances the field due to the applied voltage {{in the vicinity of the}} injection electrode, leading to a spray that rapidly broadens at a distance from its origin of the order of the stopping distance at which the droplets lose their initial momentum and the effect of their inertia becomes negligible. The axial component of the electric field first changes sign in this region, causing the fly back. The flow induced in the gas significantly changes this picture in the conditions of typical experiments. A gas plume is induced by the drag of the droplets whose entrainment makes the radius of the spray away from the injection electrode smaller than in a quiescent gas, and convects the droplets across the region of negative axial electric field that appears around the origin of the spray when the flux of droplets is increased. This suppresses fly back and allows much higher fluxes to be reached than are possible in a quiescent gas. The limit of large droplet-to-gas mass ratio is discussed. Migration of satellite droplets to the shroud of the spray is reproduced by the Eulerian model, but this process is also affected by the motion of the gas. The gas flow preferentially pushes satellite droplets from the shroud to the core of the spray when the effect of the inertia of the droplets becomes negligible, and thus opposes the well-established electrostatic/inertial mechanism of segregation and may end up concentrating satellite droplets in an intermediate radial region of the spray...|$|E

MaghirangThis {{research}} was conducted to investigate the potential of charged-water spray in controlling dust in livestock buildings. Specific objectives were to: (1) develop a method to measure the electrostatic charge of airborne particles; (2) characterize the size distribution and charge of airborne particles in a livestock building; (3) {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} charged-water spray in controlling dust concentration in enclosed spaces under laboratory conditions; (4) model the effectiveness of charged-water spray in controlling dust in an enclosed building; and (5) develop and evaluate an electrostatically-assisted particulate wet scrubber (EAPWS). A dynamic Faraday-cage sampler was developed for measuring the net charge-to-mass ratio of particles. The device involves collecting particles on a filter and measuring the charge induced. The sampler was calibrated and then used to measure the charge of dispersed particles (i. e., corn starch, NaHCO 3, positively <b>charged</b> water <b>spray,</b> negatively <b>charged</b> water <b>spray,</b> and uncharged water spray). The corresponding net charge-to-mass ratios were - 0. 11 (SD= 0. 07), + 0. 20 (0. 001), + 7. 24 (1. 6), - 6. 47 (0. 9), and - 0. 30 (0. 12) mC/kg. Characterization of dust in a swine building showed mean dust concentration of 0. 89 (SD= 0. 45) mg/m 3, geometric mean diameter of particles of 9. 34 μm, and geometric standard deviation of 2. 11. The Faraday-cage sampler was also used in the swine building; the net charge-to-mass ratio of particles was + 0. 68 mC/kg (SD= 0. 31 mC/kg). The effectiveness of charged-water spray in reducing dust concentration was investigated in an experimental chamber. Test particles (i. e., corn starch, NaHCO 3) were dispersed into the chamber and then <b>charged</b> water was <b>sprayed</b> into the chamber. The charged-water spray was significantly more effective than either the uncharged-water spray or no water spray. The removal efficiency of the <b>charged</b> water <b>spray</b> (4 min spray duration, 120 mL/min), based on mass, ranged from 88 % to 92 % for particles ≤ 10 µm equivalent aerodynamic diameter (EAD) and from 34 % to 70 % for particles ≤ 2. 5 µm EAD. A model based on coagulation was used to predict the particle concentration after <b>spraying</b> of <b>charged</b> water. Predicted values of concentration and removal efficiency agreed well with measured values. A prototype EAPWS was also developed. Laboratory and field evaluations of the EAPWS indicated that it had significantly higher particle removal efficiency than either the control (i. e., no water spray) or the uncharged wet scrubber...|$|R
40|$|Two {{versions}} of a charge injection electrostatic atomizer design, useful for producing <b>charged</b> <b>sprays</b> of highly insulating liquids, {{have been subjected to}} systematic changes of their physical and electrical characteristics. The aim is to enhance the atomization of these liquids by maximizing the amount of charge that can be introduced into the spray. Spray current measurements showed that atomizer internal geometry is the key parameter and a "point-plane" geometry was found to be optimum. The "point" is the charge injection site, the tip of a needle electrode, coaxial with the "plane," conceptually a disk which contains the atomizer orifice. An important requirement is to place the electrode tip as near as possible to this "plane," while maintaining sufficient current. A ratio of unity of the distance between the tip and the plane, and the orifice diameter, was found to be optimum, and independent of orifice diameter. The orifice length-to-diameter ratio was varied and was found to have little measurable effect on the electrical performance of the atomizer. An investigation of the atomizer electrical characteristics was also performed, by placing large resistances between the metal nozzle body and ground and also placing a ring electrode around the liquid jet as it emerged from the orifice. We found that electrical modifications to the atomizer can provide significant improvements in the spray current and hence the atomization quality...|$|R

The benefits of reducing dust levels will be a lesser risk of lung disease to coal miners, improved working conditions and a reduced risk of dust explosions. Coal dust is commonly suppressed by water sprays but suppression efficiency is not high because dust tends to travel in the air flow round the water droplets rather than being captured by them. If water <b>sprays</b> are electrostatically <b>charged,</b> then a significant improvement in dust suppression efficiency may be achieved. Of the three principal droplet charging mechanisms, i. e. corona charging, induction charging and contact charging, corona charging is {{the most widely used}} in many industrial fields including dust suppression, However, it requires a high applied voltage, ranging from thousands to more than a hundred thousand volts, depending on the geometry of the charging equipment. Induction charging has been used in agricultural spraying since Law (1978) developed an embedded-electrode induction <b>charging</b> <b>spraying</b> nozzle. This nozzle provides a compact, inexpensively fabricated droplet charger and, reduces design requirements on size and output voltage (of the order of 1000 volts). It also reduces the potential for mechanical damage, misalignment and personnel hazard. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} dust suppression, either the charge on individual droplets or the charge-to-mass ratio of water sprays needs to be known. However, the parameters which control the charge applied to water and the charging rate have been unsolved theoretically for any charging mechanism. The existing theories for the induction-charged and air-atomising a liquid jet have been found to be inadequate. And there is no theory available for corona charging of the droplets produced with a pneumatic nozzle in order to predict the <b>spray</b> <b>charge</b> level or the spray charge-to-mass ratio. In view of this situation, mathematical models have been developed in this thesis for both the corona and induction charging mechanisms. During the development of the theories, it has been assumed that for corona charging, that the jet is disintegrated into droplets and the droplets are then charged; for induction charging, that the jet is first charged and the charged jet is then disintegrated into charged droplets. The Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D 32, plays an important role in linking the individual droplet <b>charge</b> to the <b>spray</b> charge-to-mass ratio for both charging mechanisms. The developed theories are general models suitable for any liquid with both corona and induction charging. Theoretical calculations for the spray charge-to-mass ratio, individual droplet charge and the ratio of droplet charge to the Rayleigh charge limit have been presented for almost all of the influencing electrical and mechanical parameters such as applied voltage, air flowrate, liquid flowrate, liquid conductivity, liquid dielectric constant, nozzle dimensions, cylindrical electrode dimensions, and fluid parameters, for example, density, viscosity and surface tension. In the calculation for corona charging of droplets, the effect of the droplets on corona current and corona-onset voltage has been assessed for first time. The introduction of the Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D 32, makes the assessment possible. Theoretical calculations for induction charging of liquid jets have shown that provided liquids have a conductivity value higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m, then they can be charged satisfactorily by the induction charging method. Among all of the influencing parameters, the electrical and mechanical parameters determine the charging rate and the water <b>spray</b> <b>charge</b> level. The suitability of employing these two charging mechanisms to dust suppression in coal mine has been evaluated based on the <b>spray</b> <b>charge</b> level, safety issues and the simplicity or otherwise of the equipment. The induction charging method was considered to have advantages over its corona charging counterpart, and has been chosen for <b>charging</b> the water <b>sprays</b> in the experiment program. Water has a conductivity of s = - 10 2 S/m, higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m. Based upon theoretical considerations, it is concluded that water is an appropriate liquid for corona charging, based on its dielectric constant, and for induction charging, based on its conductivity. In order to facilitate the testing of electrostatically <b>charged</b> water <b>spray</b> cloud parameters, a spray charger/collector was designed and constructed by others and a computerised data acquisition system has been employed. According to the theory developed for induction charging, the optimum length of the charging electrode has been analysed based upon the assumption that water jet is first charged and then the charged jet is disintegrated into charged droplets by the high pressure air. An experimental program examined the dependence of spray current upon four parameters: air flowrate, water flowrate, applied voltage and jet diameter. The experiments have shown that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle used in the experiment is able to impart a significant charge into the water sprays. The spray charge-to-mass ratio calculated based upon the measured spray current demonstrates the same characteristics as predicted by theory: increasing with air flowrate, decreasing with water flowrate, increasing with applied voltage to a peak value then decreasing with further increase in the voltage, and increasing with jet diameter. A successful interpretation of an important phenomenon in the inductioncharged air-atomising a water jet, that spray charge-to-mass ratio and spray current increase with air pressure (or air flowrate) and decrease with increasing water flowrate, has been achieved based on the theories developed in this thesis. This phenomenon occurs because increasing air flowrate and/or decreasing water flowrate leads to a higher velocity of jet flowing through the induction electrode. However, when water flowrate becomes very small, a decrease in spray current with increasing air pressure (or flowrate) may be caused both by jet breakup inside the electrode and by contraction of the jet. In order to verify the theory, a preliminary comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions employing a constant kic in the air-jet interaction coefficient a which was assumed to be 0. 7 has shown a general agreement. However, the value of kic appears to be related to jet diameter, air/water mass ratio and applied voltage. An empirical equation for kic has then been formulated based on the experimental data for the spray charge-to-mass ratio. Finally a comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions using the formulated kic shows an improved agreement. It is concluded that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle has a potential application in dust suppression in coal mines, as the voltage required to <b>charge</b> water <b>sprays</b> is only 1000 ~ 1200 volts, and that the theory developed for induction <b>charging</b> of water <b>sprays</b> can be used to guide laboratory investigations and design processes for dust suppression and other industrial applications which might employ the electrostatic <b>charging</b> of liquid <b>sprays...</b>|$|R
