The TCP minimum retransmission timeout interval has effectively alleviated delay variations in its range from deteriorating TCP performance. But recently, this bound has been shortened in modern widely spread TCP implementations. The aim of our study is to find out how a shorter minimum retransmission timeout affects TCP performance over HS-DSCH. We have implemented a model of HS-DSCH in the network simulator ns- 2. Our simulations cover a wide range of different minimum retransmission timeout settings and loads, two types of schedulers (Round-Robin and Signalto-Interference-Ratio (SIR) scheduling) and two versions of TCP (SACK and NewReno). Our results show that the number of spurious timeouts increase with the load. The SIR scheduler causes fewer spurious timeouts than the RR scheduler for shorter minimum retransmission timeout settings, however, for longer settings the RR scheduler causes fewer spurious timeouts compared to the SIR scheduler. The minimum retransmission timeout has consequences for goodput fairness, but it does not affect the total system throughput. Both TCP versions produced similar results.
