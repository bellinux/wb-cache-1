5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was <b>certain,</b> <b>they</b> began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E

25|$|When {{the detectives}} are <b>certain</b> <b>they</b> {{have the right}} suspect(s), the police will take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a search and/or arrest warrant (though {{sometimes}} the commanding officer will consult with the New York City District Attorney's office {{to see if the}} case is strong enough) and whether or not any backup (such as uniformed officers or an armed tactical team) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with the police sometimes having to chase the accused through the streets of New York. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s) until they ask for a lawyer, their defense attorney shows up and asks the suspect not to talk anymore, or the Assistant District Attorney from the D.A.'s office decides they have enough to press charges.|$|E

25|$|The final group stage {{involved}} the teams who won their groups: Brazil, Spain, Sweden, and 1930 FIFA World Cup champions Uruguay, who were making their first World Cup appearance since winning the inaugural tournament. The World Cup winner {{would be the}} team that managed to finish {{on top of this}} group. The final group's six matches were shared between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Brazil played all its final group matches at the Estádio do Maracanã in Rio while the games that didn't involve the host nation were played in São Paulo. Brazil won their first two matches with a 7–1 thrashing of Sweden and 6–1 rout of Spain. Before the decisive match, Brazil was sitting on top of the final group and had one game left to play against Uruguay, in second and only a point behind. On 16 July, before a huge home crowd of 199,954 (some estimated as 205,000) in the Estádio do Maracanã, the host nation only had to draw against Uruguay and the trophy would be theirs. After such crushing victories over Spain and Sweden, it looked <b>certain</b> <b>they</b> would take the title, especially as the home nation went ahead in the second minute of the second half, thanks to a goal from Friaça; however, Uruguay equalised and then with just over 11minutes left to play, went ahead 2–1 when Alcides Ghiggia squeaked a goal past Moacyr Barbosa, and Uruguay was crowned World Cup champions for a second time. This stunning defeat surprised Brazil and {{is referred to as the}} Maracanazo.|$|E

500|$|There are 44 {{letters to}} White's friend Thomas Pennant (1726–1798), {{of which the}} first nine were never posted and are thus undated. Of those that were posted, the first, Letter 10 giving an {{overview}} of Selborne, is dated 4 August 1767; the last, Letter 44 on wood pigeons, is dated 30 November 1780. It is not known how the men became friends, or even if they ever met; White writes repeatedly {{that he would like}} to meet [...] "to have a little conversation face to face after we have corresponded so freely for several years" [...] so it is <b>certain</b> <b>they</b> did not meet for long periods, and possible they never met at all.

500|$|The story {{tells of}} a prince who wants to marry a princess, but is having {{difficulty}} finding a suitable wife. Something is always wrong with those he meets, and he cannot be <b>certain</b> <b>they</b> are real princesses because they have bad table manners or they are too fat or thin or not beautiful. [...] One stormy night a young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter in the prince's castle. She {{claims to be a}} princess, so the prince's mother decides to test their unexpected, unwitting guest by placing a pea in the bed she is offered for the night, covered by 20 mattresses and 20 feather-beds. In the morning, the guest tells her hosts that she endured a sleepless night, kept awake by something hard in the bed that she is certain has bruised her. The prince rejoices. Only a real princess would have the sensitivity to feel a pea through such a quantity of bedding, so the two are married.|$|E
500|$|Historian Jim Handy {{described}} Árbenz's {{economic and}} political ideals as [...] "decidedly pragmatic and capitalist in temper". According to historian Stephen Schlesinger, while Árbenz did have a few communists in lower-level positions in his administration, he [...] "was not a dictator, {{he was not a}} crypto-communist". Schlesinger described him as a democratic socialist. Nevertheless, some of his policies, particularly those involving agrarian reform, would be branded as [...] "communist" [...] by the Guatemalan upper class and the United Fruit Company. Historian Piero Gleijeses has argued that although Árbenz's policies were intentionally capitalist in nature, his personal views gradually shifted towards communism. A goal of Árbenz was to increase Guatemala's {{economic and political}} independence. He believed that to do this Guatemala needed to build a strong domestic economy. He made an effort {{to reach out to the}} indigenous Mayan people, and sent government representatives to confer with them. From this effort he learned that the Maya held strongly to their ideals of dignity and self-determination; inspired in part by this, he stated in 1951 that [...] "If the independence and prosperity of our people were incompatible, which for <b>certain</b> <b>they</b> are not, I am sure that the great majority of Guatemalans would prefer to be a poor nation, but free, and not a rich colony, but enslaved." ...|$|E

[...] This leaflet has been circulated to parents, teachers and youth workers and is meant to update sex education by telling older school students {{about the benefits of}} enjoyable sex. Its authors have said that for too long, experts have concentrated on the need for [...] "safe sex" [...] and committed relationships while ignoring the principal reason that many people have sex.

The Trustees used his famous name in large-scale fund-raising appeals and Lee transformed Washington College into a leading Southern college expanding its offerings significantly and added programs in commerce, journalism, and integrated the Lexington Law School. Lee was well liked by the students, which enabled him to announce an [...] "honor system" [...] like West Point's, explaining [...] "We have but one rule here, and it is that every student be a gentleman."

2500|$|As the {{election}} of 1920 approached, the Republican nominee, Warren Harding, campaigned on the domestic issues that united his party and sent confusing signals about his support for a League of Nations. With {{the election}} just weeks away, whole groups of League proponents chose different sides. One entire organization of independent voters chose James Cox, the Democratic candidate, who favored the League but showed no more flexibility than President Wilson. Lowell and many other prominent League supporters backed Harding, publishing a statement that {{became known as the}} [...] "Letter of the 31 Republicans" [...] on October 14, 1920. Lowell could not express his reasoning publicly. In his view, the League's proponents, and especially the League's Republican proponents, needed to control public perception of Harding's victory, which everyone knew was <b>certain.</b> <b>They</b> could not allow the election to appear as a victory of anti-League Republicans over pro-League Democrats.

2500|$|The German {{mathematician}} Carl Friedrich Gauss {{referred to}} mathematics as [...] "the Queen of the Sciences". More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics [...] "the Queen of Science... the main {{driving force behind}} scientific discovery". In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum, {{as well as in}} German Königin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding to science means a [...] "field of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of [...] "science" [...] in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting the meaning of [...] "science" [...] to natural science follows the rise of Baconian science, which contrasted [...] "natural science" [...] to scholasticism, the Aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as biology, chemistry, or physics.

Benjamin Peirce (1809–1880) called mathematics [...] "the science that draws necessary conclusions". David Hilbert said of mathematics: [...] "We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense.

This crisis assumed a political dimension when Beaverbrook and Churchill tried to rally support for the marriage in Parliament. However, the King's party could only muster 40 Members of Parliament in support, and majority opinion sided with Baldwin and his Conservative government. The Labour leader, Clement Attlee, told Baldwin [...] "that while Labour people had no objection to an American becoming Queen, [...] was <b>certain</b> <b>they</b> would not approve of Mrs. Simpson for that position", especially in the provinces and in the Commonwealth countries.
