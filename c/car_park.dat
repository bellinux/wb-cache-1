5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> A petition organised by the campaign group Save The <b>Car</b> <b>Park</b> collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> open. The group said that the closure of the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access to the <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E
5|$|At 20:45 on 25 April, the Lehi {{carried out}} {{an attack on}} a divisional <b>car</b> <b>park</b> in Tel Aviv. On that night, the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion. The attackers, around thirty men, {{established}} a fire base in a house overlooking the <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The attack began with a bomb thrown into a guard tent. Gunfire was directed at all of the soldiers in the area, then twenty of the attackers stormed the <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> Once inside the compound, they entered the guard tents, killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle racks of weapons. Another two off-duty soldiers, responding to the attack, were killed approaching the <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> In total, seven men from the division were killed.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of the station is a pay and display <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with 285 car parking spaces, six {{motorcycle}} spaces and a number of cycle racks. Cycle storage is also available. The <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is run by North Somerset Council. There is a bus stop adjacent to the <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> with services between Bristol and Nailsea.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in the {{immediate}} area for the railway station. They are operated by the railway <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> and National <b>Car</b> <b>Parks</b> (NCP).|$|R
50|$|With {{perpendicular}} parking, {{also known}} as bay <b>parking,</b> <b>cars</b> are <b>parked</b> side to side, perpendicular to an aisle, curb, or wall. This type of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> fits more <b>cars</b> per length of road (or curb) than parallel parking, and is therefore commonly used in <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> lots and <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> structures.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> {{systems and}} the {{accompanying}} technologies have increased and diversified. <b>Car</b> <b>parking</b> systems have been around almost since the time cars were invented. In any area {{where there is a}} significant amount of traffic, there are <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> systems. <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> systems were developed in the early 20th century in response to the need for storage space for vehicles.|$|R
5|$|The pub {{also has}} a lawned pub garden {{to the north and}} a <b>car</b> <b>park</b> to the south. The <b>car</b> <b>park</b> has a {{covenant}} that prevents it from being built upon, with underground channels, cables and pipes, and an adjacent substation. A well is also located in the rear yard of the pub, one of a number in the immediate area.|$|E
5|$|Three {{possible}} excavation {{sites were}} identified: the staff <b>car</b> <b>park</b> of Leicester City Council Social Services, the disused playground {{of the former}} Alderman Newton's School and a public <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on New Street. It was decided to open two trenches in the Social Services <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> with an option for a third in the playground. Because most of the Greyfriars site had been built on, only seventeen per cent of its former area was available to excavate; the area to be investigated amounted to just one per cent of the site, owing to {{the limitations of the}} project's funding.|$|E
5|$|A large <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with 1,500 spaces is {{provided}}, {{free with}} a maximum stay of four hours. Bicycle racks are provided for those cycling to the hospital.|$|E
50|$|There are ten {{park and}} ride {{commuter}} <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> on Fraser Avenue, and {{with the loss of}} <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> at Johnsonville Railway Station during replacement of the Broderick Road overbridge in 2014-15, a further 35 <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> were provided across Fraser Avenue.|$|R
25|$|<b>Cars</b> <b>parked</b> in {{parking lots}} with 50% canopy cover emit 8% less through {{evaporative}} emissions than <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> in parking lots with only 8% canopy cover.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 National <b>Car</b> <b>Parks</b> Limited was {{acquired}} by Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund II.

The Angus Council area had a recycling rate of 34.7% in 2007/08.|$|E
5|$|A {{weekly market}} was {{granted to the}} town by Baldwin de Redvers and the first market took place in 1149 at the {{junction}} of Castle Street and High Street. These weekly markets stopped in 1872 but resumed a century later in a <b>car</b> <b>park</b> next to the town hall, now the site of Saxon Square. When construction of the square began in 1983, the market was moved to a <b>car</b> <b>park</b> in Bank Close. Today it is held every Monday in High Street which is then closed to traffic. Periodically there are food fairs and a French market in the town.|$|E
5|$|Browncove Crags on {{the western}} side of the {{mountain}} has some north-facing routes. These are easier to access from a <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> and they can be linked with the Red Tarn routes.|$|E

5|$|In 1914 the {{graveyard}} was formally deconsecrated and the headstones {{were removed from}} the site, which became a children's playground in the 1930s and subsequently a multi-storey <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, when Manchester United Football Club {{owned the}} Manchester Giants, Manchester's {{basketball}} franchise, there were {{plans to build}} a 9,000-seater indoor arena on the site of what is now <b>Car</b> <b>Park</b> E1. However, the chairman at the time, Martin Edwards, did not have the funds to take on such a project, and the basketball franchise was eventually sold. In August 2009, the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> became home to the Hublot clock tower, a -tall tower {{in the shape of the}} Hublot logo, which houses four -diameter clock faces, the largest ever made by the company.|$|E
5|$|KSE's lease of the {{warehouse}} was terminated in 1999. KSE subsequently returned the licensed unit, while moving the three unregistered units to an unused <b>car</b> <b>park</b> in Bangkok's Prawet District, which was owned by its parent company. The <b>car</b> <b>park</b> was fenced, but the fence had been breached and nearby residents regularly entered to play football in its empty areas. KSE notified the OAEP of its transfer of the licensed unit, but {{did not mention the}} other three, which remained orphan sources.|$|E
50|$|Getting to Croydon by car is also {{feasible}} {{as there}} are numerous <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> around the centre including Centrale and Whitgift's own multi-storey <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b>|$|R

5|$|The episode's {{establishing}} exterior shots, {{and those}} of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The ventilation system through which the first victim is attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a multistory <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the ventilation system was built in a lower level of the <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most reverse angles would show a large <b>car</b> <b>park</b> across the street.|$|E
5|$|There is no <b>car</b> <b>park</b> or taxi rank. Cycle {{storage is}} {{available}} on the platform. There is a bus stop on South Road, and another on Redland Grove.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{the club}} had {{demolished}} virtually the whole street and this {{coincided with the}} redevelopment of the Park End stand. However at present {{the majority of the}} land is now an open <b>car</b> <b>park</b> for the club and its Marquee.|$|E
25|$|Heathrow is {{accessible}} via the nearby M4 motorway or A4 road (Terminals 2–3), the M25 motorway (Terminals 4 and 5) and the A30 road (Terminal 4). There are drop-off and pick-up areas at all terminals and short- and long-stay multi-storey <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> All the Heathrow forecourts are drop-off only. There are further <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> not run by Heathrow Airport Holdings, {{just outside the}} airport: the most recognisable is the National <b>Car</b> <b>Parks</b> facility, {{although there are many}} other options; these <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are connected to the terminals by shuttle buses.|$|R

Cycle storage is available on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Improbably, the {{excavators}} {{found the}} {{remains in the}} first location in which they dug at the <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> Coincidentally, they lay almost directly under a roughly painted 'R' on the tarmac. This had existed since the early 2000s to signify a reserved parking space.|$|E
50|$|The Oracle also {{provides}} two large <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> providing 2300 spaces. In line with other <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in central Reading, charges are comparatively high, especially for long term parkers.|$|R
