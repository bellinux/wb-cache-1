5|$|According to her account, {{all of the}} <b>children</b> <b>died,</b> as did her husband, {{within a}} short time of each other. She was imprisoned for larceny in Wexford in December 1864, when she was only about 15 years old, and came to England in 1867. In February 1868, she was sentenced to four years of penal {{servitude}} for committing larceny in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 27,000 Boer {{women and}} <b>children</b> <b>died</b> in British {{concentration}} camps, {{resulting in a}} long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners. The British won the war, but anti-British sentiment contributed {{to the rise of}} Afrikaner nationalism and the pro-Afrikaner National Party was the ruling party of South Africa from 1948 until 1994, the apartheid era.|$|E
5|$|By 1816, the Shelleys {{were living}} in Italy and in 1818 and 1819, two of their young <b>children</b> <b>died,</b> Clara and William. Mary entered into a deep {{depression}} and became alienated from Percy, who was not as deeply affected {{by the loss of}} their children. Mary Shelley revived a bit with the birth of Percy Florence later in 1819.|$|E

5000|$|The Maasai tell a {{story of}} how Le-eyo {{was told by the}} god Ngai that he must say a prayer when a <b>child</b> <b>dies,</b> {{to make sure that the}} child will come back to life. When a <b>child</b> <b>died</b> that was not his own, Le-eyo said a prayer for the child to remain dead but the moon to return. When his own <b>child</b> <b>died,</b> Le-eyo said the prayer {{properly}} but it would not work. In Maasai mythology, this is the reason that when men die, they do not return, but when the moon [...] "dies" [...] it returns the next night.|$|R

5|$|In 1531 Nostredame {{was invited}} by Jules-César Scaliger, a leading Renaissance scholar, {{to come to}} Agen. There he married a woman of {{uncertain}} name (possibly Henriette d'Encausse), who bore him two children. In 1534 his wife and <b>children</b> <b>died,</b> presumably from the plague. After their deaths, he continued to travel, passing through France and possibly Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{thousands}} of people were inadvertently exposed to lead containing soil / ore from informal gold mining with the northern state of Zamfara. While estimates vary, it is though that upwards of 400 <b>children</b> <b>died</b> of acute lead poisoning making this perhaps the largest lead poisoning fatality epidemic ever encountered. As of 2016, efforts to manage the exposure are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, the {{children}} were exhausted and virtually naked. Their appearance was skeletal, especially those transported from Stara Gradiška. Many had swollen bellies due to malnourishment, thin pale faces, and teeth falling out. Almost all were suffering from severe diarrhea, and most had multiple diseases. Some <b>children</b> <b>died</b> after the effort of simply getting up.|$|E

5|$|After the 1836 election, Harrison did {{not really}} stop running for president, nor did his {{supporters}} stop boosting him—an Ohio political convention endorsed him as early as 1837. His finances were somewhat secured by his appointment as clerk of Hamilton County's circuit court, a post that paid no salary, but allowed considerable income from fees. The years between 1838 and 1840 were years of personal tragedy for the general, as three of his adult <b>children</b> <b>died</b> and his wife Anna fell seriously ill. Harrison {{did his best to}} manage a network of acquaintances and supporters from his home in North Bend, corresponding extensively and seeking to have items favorable to him placed in the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hamnet was four, {{his father was}} already a London playwright and, as his {{popularity}} grew, he was probably not regularly at home in Stratford with his family. Honan believes that Hamnet may have completed Lower School, {{which would have been}} normal, before his death at the age of eleven (possibly from the Bubonic Plague). He was buried in Stratford on 11 August 1596. At that time in England about a third of all <b>children</b> <b>died</b> before age 10.|$|E
5|$|Children {{arrived at}} the camp in an {{emaciated}} and weak condition from other camps within the Ustaše camp system, {{with a total of}} 3,336 children passing through the camp. Between 449 and 1500 <b>children</b> <b>died</b> there, mainly from disease and malnutrition. A sub-camp was established in nearby Donja Reka. The Yugoslav Partisans liberated about 350 children from the main camp inAugust 1942. In October 1942, about 500 of the surviving children were dispersed among local families by the Catholic aid group, Caritas; 1,637 boys and girls were taken in by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages, and another 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška.|$|E

5|$|Hancock {{served in}} a number of {{assignments}} as an army quartermaster and adjutant, mostly in Fort Snelling, Minnesota and St. Louis, Missouri. It was in St. Louis that he met Almira ("Allie") Russell and they married on January 24, 1850. Allie gave birth to two children, Russell in 1850 and Ada in 1857, but both <b>children</b> <b>died</b> before their parents. Hancock was promoted to captain in 1855 and assigned to Fort Myers, Florida. Hancock's young family accompanied him to his new posting, where Allie Hancock was the only woman on the post.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1828 Greene married Mary Elizabeth Vinton, sister of his best friend at West Point, David Vinton. Elizabeth gave birth to three {{children}} {{over the next four}} years: Mary Vinton, George Sears, and Francis Vinton Greene. While assigned to Fort Sullivan in Eastport, Maine in 1833, tragedy struck Greene's family: Elizabeth and all three of their <b>children</b> <b>died</b> within seven months, probably from tuberculosis. To ease the pain on his mind and to escape the isolation and loneliness of peacetime Army garrison duty, he immersed himself in study of both the law and medicine, coming close to professional certification in both by the time he resigned his commission in 1836 to become a civil engineer.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been cases of {{available}} treatment being withheld during clinical trials. In 1996 in Kano, Nigeria, the drug company Pfizer compared a new antibiotic during a meningitis outbreak to a competing antibiotic that {{was known to be}} effective at a higher dose than was used during the trial. Goldacre writes that 11 <b>children</b> <b>died,</b> divided almost equally between the two groups. The families taking part in the trial were apparently not told that the competing antibiotic at the effective dose was available from Médecins Sans Frontières in the next-door building.|$|E

5|$|Worst {{affected}} was German Samoa, {{today the}} independent state of Samoa, {{which had been}} occupied by New Zealand in 1914. A crippling 90% {{of the population was}} infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of <b>children</b> <b>died.</b> By contrast, the flu was kept away from American Samoa when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade. In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%. In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918 which can be seen as quite detrimental considering World War 1 was still occurring.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's {{four-year}} term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, {{which included the}} building of new schools, increases to teachers' salaries, reorganization of the police department, and improvements to the water and sewer systems. His anti-discrimination bill passed, {{and gave him a}} reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited in a county where the population was 97 percent white. His relations with the increasingly militant civil rights movement were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama, in which four <b>children</b> <b>died,</b> was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to denounce a planned demonstration in support of the victims.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's {{family had}} been exiled to the Continent in 1539. It is not known exactly when they {{returned}} to England, but it was soon after the accession of Edward VI in 1547 that Cranmer publicly acknowledged their existence. Not much is known about {{the early years of the}} children. His daughter, Margaret, was likely born in the 1530s and his son, Thomas, came later, probably during the reign of Edward. Sometime around Mary's accession, Cranmer's wife, Margarete, escaped to Germany, while his son was entrusted to his brother, Edmund Cranmer, who took him too to the Continent. Margarete Cranmer eventually married Cranmer's favourite publisher, Edward Whitchurch. The couple returned to England after Mary's reign and settled in Surrey. Whitchurch also negotiated for the marriage of Margaret to Thomas Norton. Whitchurch died in 1562 and Margarete married for the third time to Bartholomew Scott. She died in the 1570s. Both of Cranmer's <b>children</b> <b>died</b> without issue and his line became extinct.|$|E
