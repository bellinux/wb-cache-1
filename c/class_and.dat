Standard data refinement techniques are adapted for <b>classes,</b> <b>and</b> process refinement techniques for capsules. We also propose techniques for behavioural inheritance of <b>classes</b> <b>and</b> capsules. Soundness is briefly addressed by relating UML-RT elements to OhCircus, a formal unified language of <b>classes</b> <b>and</b> processes. To illustrate the overall strategy, we develop a detailed design of an operating system resource scheduler from a high-level analysis model...|$|R

Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
