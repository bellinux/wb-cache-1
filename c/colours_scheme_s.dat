5000|$|From the {{beginning}} of 2000s, the vehicles are colouring by three <b>colour</b> <b>schemes</b> with blue bottom (trams are coloured by red and blue <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> from 2002, trolleybuses are coloured by orange and blue <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> from 2003 (for some units, but their current <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> is red from 2010), and buses are coloured by yellow and blue color scheme from 2004 (in future, their <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> will be red from 2015)).|$|R
50|$|All {{locomotives}} {{were issued}} to {{traffic in the}} standard <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> of Indian Red with chrome lining.

50|$|From 2002 to 2004, the <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> used {{to change}} with every test. As of 2005, a red <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> was {{implemented}} for the questions and blue for the answer section. A bevel-like shape was added with the new graphics, title sequence and <b>colour</b> <b>scheme,</b> but it is unclear why.|$|R

50|$|Limit has {{exactly the}} same <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> as Big Loop, a nearby steel roller coaster also {{manufactured}} by Vekoma. People often think that Limit and Big Loop are one long roller coaster due to their <b>colour</b> <b>schemes</b> and the similar locations. The bob-sled roller coaster elsewhere in the park has the same <b>colour</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In November 2008, to conside with a re-launch, the {{channels}} were renamed {{in order to}} have more distinctive names. Television X 2 became Television X Amateur (with an orange <b>colour</b> <b>scheme),</b> Television X 3 became Television X Brits (with a Union Jack <b>colour</b> <b>scheme)</b> and Television X 4 became Television X FFWD (with a purple <b>colour</b> <b>scheme).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{vehicles}} {{have been}} coloured by cream and blue <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> (like the private buses {{in the end}} of the 1990s, for example: one trolleybus ZiU-9 and one tram ČKD-Tatra KT4YU have been coloured in cream and blue <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> in 1993 (in collaboration with factory MIN (Machine Industry Niš)), and two trams ČKD-Tatra KT4YU have been coloured in cream and blue <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> in 2001).|$|R
50|$|The locos {{numbered}} 1312-1316 {{were delivered}} in 1956 in a Berlin blue <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> (the locos delivered in 1952 were {{delivered in a}} turquoise <b>colour</b> <b>scheme,</b> but were painted Berlin blue in 1955).|$|R
50|$|The {{series was}} built in two versions, as a {{first-class}} business train (5 sets of subseries 713-0xx, in green <b>colour</b> <b>scheme,</b> with 92 seats, a kitchen and loudspeakers) and as a standard commuter train (22 sets of subseries 713-1xx, in yellow-and-orange <b>colour</b> <b>scheme,</b> with 128 seats). All of the business trains were later converted into standard trains, and the <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> of all units is gradually being changed into red.|$|R
5|$|GoAir {{aircraft}} are painted in different <b>colour</b> <b>schemes</b> such as blue and pink with the logo on the tail. In 2011, the airline announced that all its aircraft will convert {{to a new}} grey <b>colour</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first run}} of this synth {{looks very much}} like the Pro Soloist in layout and <b>colour</b> <b>scheme,</b> though subsequently, it was {{produced}} using ARP's late-1970s Orange and Black <b>colour</b> <b>scheme,</b> like the Quadra and Odyssey Mk-3.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the concept and}} development of software to support the architectural design and planning of <b>colour</b> <b>schemes</b> for interiors and buildings. “Coloured Architecture” is a plausibility instrument for the formulation of <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> proposals for building interiors and elevations. In practice <b>colours</b> <b>schemes</b> are arrived at through the production of many different colour design studies before a final <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> is decided upon. With the help of intuitively usable light simulations, colour, material and spatial concepts can be assessed realistically. The development concept incorporates numerous aspects which {{must be considered in}} the selection of a <b>colour</b> scheme: <b>colour</b> <b>schemes</b> for built environments must be realisable. This initial development prototype already demonstrates the added value possible through the consequent use of CAAD: function, construction and not least design aspects have equal status and can be worked upon in direct relation with one another...|$|R

40|$|I {{have changed}} the way how colours and {{potential}} <b>colour</b> <b>schemes</b> are implemented. This is done through a new parameter (p_color-scheme) in teibp_parameters. xsl and which is set to 'red' for the established <b>colour</b> <b>scheme.</b> Currently 'blue' will also work, but {{has not been made}} into any sort of a well-balanced <b>colour</b> <b>scheme.</b> In order to use this latest iteration of TEI Boilerplate with a local copy of teibp_parameters. xsl pointing to this repository, one needs to update this local copy to the newest version...|$|R
50|$|In 1954, the {{repainting}} of the New Building was {{supervised by}} Professor Cumming, {{who was also}} responsible for the <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> at the Great Hall.

50|$|On Monday 26 July 2010, Metro Coastlines {{branding}} was discontinued and {{the company}} {{went back to the}} older name of Blackpool Transport. Buses had their Metro Coastlines logos removed and replaced with a new Tower and waves logo, along with a black and yellow <b>colour</b> <b>scheme.</b> The tramway now uses a purple and white <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> since 2012, based on Blackpool Council's main <b>colour</b> <b>schemes.</b> The Tower and waves logo does not feature on the Flexity 2 trams but is featured {{at the top of the}} central doors on the modernised Balloon trams.|$|R

50|$|Goldline Travel had a {{two-tone}} green <b>colour</b> <b>scheme,</b> {{although most}} services were operated by vehicles in <b>colour</b> <b>schemes</b> {{specified by the}} contracting organisation.

50|$|On delivery, the {{locomotives}} {{were painted}} in a Yellow and Grey livery. This was replaced {{within a year}} by a black / tan (“golden brown”) <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> with a thick white band similar to the Cravens coaching stock, delivered in 1963. With time, the <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> changed to tan with a black band. Soon after CIÉ Rail services became known as Irish Rail, the <b>colour</b> <b>scheme</b> was enhanced when two white bands (approx. 25 mm / 1") separating the colours were added. At the same time, as a safety aspect, self-adhesive high-visibility panels {{were added to the}} front of the Locomotives.|$|R
