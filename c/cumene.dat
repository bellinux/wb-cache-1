However, to operate economically, {{there must be}} demand for both phenol, and the acetone by-product. In 2010, worldwide demand for acetone was approximately 6.7 million tonnes, 83 percent of which was satisfied with acetone produced by the <b>cumene</b> process.|$|E

25|$|Benzene is used {{mainly as}} an {{intermediate}} to make other chemicals, above all ethylbenzene, <b>cumene,</b> cyclohexane, nitrobenzene, and alkylbenzene. More {{than half of the}} entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture <b>cumene,</b> which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives. Cyclohexane consumes ca. 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and pesticides. In 2013, the biggest consumer country of benzene was China, followed by the USA. Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa, whereas production capacities in Western Europe and North America are stagnating.|$|E
25|$|Benzene is {{a natural}} {{constituent}} of crude oil {{and is one of}} the elementary petrochemicals. Due to the cyclic continuous pi bond between the carbon atoms, benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon, the second -annulene (-annulene). It is sometimes abbreviated Ph–H. Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell, and is responsible for the aroma around petrol stations. It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure, such as ethylbenzene and <b>cumene,</b> of which billions of kilograms are produced. As benzene has a high octane number, it is an important component of gasoline.|$|E
2500|$|Because of phenol's {{commercial}} importance, many {{methods have}} been developed for its production.

2500|$|BisphenolA {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by the Russian chemist Alexander Dianin in 1891. This compound is synthesized by the condensation of acetone (hence the suffix A in the name) with two equivalents of phenol. The reaction is catalyzed {{by a strong}} acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or a sulfonated polystyrene resin. Industrially, a large excess of phenol is used to ensure full condensation; the product mixture of the <b>cumene</b> process (acetone and phenol) may {{also be used as}} starting material: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, 45 {{thousand}} {{metric tons}} of isopropyl alcohol {{were used in the}} United States. The vast majority of isopropyl alcohol was used as a solvent for coatings or for industrial processes. In that year, 5.4 thousand metric tons were consumed for household use and in personal care products. Isopropyl alcohol in particular is popular for pharmaceutical applications, it is presumed due to the low toxicity of any residues. Some isopropyl alcohol is used as a chemical intermediate. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to acetone, but the <b>cumene</b> process is more significant. [...] It is also used as a gasoline additive.|$|E
50|$|This <b>cumene</b> radical then {{bonds with}} an oxygen {{molecule}} to give <b>cumene</b> peroxide radical, {{which in turn}} forms <b>cumene</b> hydroperoxide (C6H5C(CH3)2-O-O-H) by abstracting a benzylic hydrogen from another <b>cumene</b> molecule. This latter <b>cumene</b> converts into <b>cumene</b> radical and feeds back into subsequent chain formations of <b>cumene</b> hydroperoxides.

5000|$|Acetone is {{produced}} {{directly or indirectly}} from propylene. Approximately 83% of acetone {{is produced}} via the <b>cumene</b> process; as a result, acetone production is tied to phenol production.

50|$|This {{section of}} the plant {{converts}} <b>cumene</b> into a mixture of <b>cumene</b> hydroperoxide and <b>cumene.</b> The reaction took place in four reactors. Each reactor was supplied with air from one large positive displacement compressor. The four reactors operated in series. The fourth oxidizer was a later addition to the plant in approximately 1981. Each oxider was run at a carefully controlled temperature, pressure and level of residual oxygen to optimize {{the production of the}} hydroperoxide. This {{section of the}} plant produced a large volume of residual air that contained small amounts of cumene; a highly odorous material. Carbon beds were installed to remove the <b>cumene</b> from this stream in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|In the {{chemical}} industry, the term intermediate may also {{refer to the}} (stable) product of a reaction that is itself valuable only as a precursor chemical for other industries. A common example is <b>cumene</b> which is made from benzene and propylene and used to make acetone and phenol in the <b>cumene</b> process. The <b>cumene</b> itself is of relatively little value in and of itself, and is typically only bought and sold by chemical companies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cumene</b> is {{the common}} name for isopropylbenzene, an organic {{compound}} {{that is based on}} an aromatic hydrocarbon with an aliphatic substitution. It is a constituent of crude oil and refined fuels. It is a flammable colorless liquid that has a boiling point of 152 °C. Nearly all the <b>cumene</b> that is produced as a pure compound on an industrial scale is converted to <b>cumene</b> hydroperoxide, which is an intermediate in the synthesis of other industrially important chemicals, primarily phenol and acetone.|$|E
50|$|It {{is called}} the Cumene-Phenol plant because of the intermedite {{materials}} is <b>cumene</b> or isopropylbenzene in the <b>cumene</b> process. It produces equimolar amounts of phenol and acetone. It was the only Cumene-Phenol plant built in Australia. Some cumene-hydroperoxide an organic peroxide was also sold.|$|E
50|$|The {{selective}} synthesis of hydroperoxides {{can be carried out}} by free-radical oxidation of alkanes with oxygen. Here the active site formed by a radical initiator reacts with oxygen to form a hydroperoxyl. The addition of oxygen results in a more active radical which can further extract hydrogen atoms and release the hydroperoxide, leaving a new radical. This process is used industrially for the synthesis of phenol from benzene and is called the <b>Cumene</b> process or Hock process for its <b>cumene</b> and <b>cumene</b> hydroperoxide intermediates.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{production}} of <b>cumene</b> is by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with propylene. <b>Cumene</b> producers account for approximately 20% {{of the global}} demand for benzene. Previously, solid phosphoric acid (SPA) supported on alumina {{was used as the}} catalyst. Since the mid-1990s, commercial production has switched to zeolite-based catalysts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most widely}} used route {{is similar to the}} <b>cumene</b> process in {{reaction}} mechanism and involves the dialkylation of benzene with propene to give 1,4-diisopropylbenzene.
