5000|$|Before World War I, the United States and Russia {{were the}} largest markets for Palestine wine. Due {{to the war}} and {{with the advent of}} Prohibition in the United States in 1920, the Palestinian wine market {{declined}} dramatically. [...] In the early 1920s, American Orthodox Jewish congregations unsuccessfully petitioned the authorities to allow the import of Palestinian wine for sacramental use over the Passover holiday. [...] Large stocks of unsold Palestinian wine was being used to make jam and <b>concentrated</b> <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> for the European markets. [...] In December 1926, the US prohibition department allowed the import of Palestinian kosher wine, which had to be obtained by worshippers through the rabbis of their respective congregations. [...] The Repeal of Prohibition in 1933 led to an American contract with Rothschild winery which initially provided for the importation of one million bottles of wines and liquor from Palestine over three years, a $15,000,000 concern. [...] The contract was later revised to allow for the import of for 3,000,000 bottles in 1934 alone. [...] Early 1934 saw a 30% increase in the export of Palestinian wine, most of it being shipped to the US, from where Palestine had been receiving [...] "urgent requests {{for tens of thousands of}} bottles of Jewish wine." [...] In order to meet the demand, Palestinian vintners had planned to establish new areas in Samaria for grape cultivation. [...] The lifting of the Prohibition in the United States and permission to import Palestinian wine rejuvenated the wine growing business in Palestine which had been facing increasingly dire prospects. [...] Yet, in Poland, sales of Palestinian wine reached a record low in 1936 owing to the poverty among Jewish buyers. [...] In March 1936, the issue of whether increasing alcohol consumption in Palestine was arousing resentment among the Arabs was raised in the House of Commons. The Colonial Secretary rejected a request that the issuance of retail liquor sale licenses in Palestine be halted.

40|$|ABSTRACT In this work, the {{improvement}} on the <b>concentrated</b> <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> physico-chemical characteristics {{by using an}} enzymatic treatment followed by Membrane Separation Process (MSP) has been investigated.

In micro/ultra filtration processes after enzymatic pretreatment, the best performance of the MSP with high permeate flux value and suitable grape juice characteristics was attained using 0. 05 mm membrane pore size, 1 bar pressure and 40 oC treatment temperature. When reverse osmosis process is operated at 40 bar and 40 oC, high soluble solid and low turbidity values are attained.

In this study, thirty-four strains belonging to Zygosaccharomyces have been identified and tested against a panel of eighteen killer yeasts.

Regarding Bax, animals that received <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> at 2 % decreased Bax immunoexpression when compared to AOM group. Furthermore, animals that intake <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> at 1 % after induced by AOM decreased Bax immunoexpression as well. 8 -OHdGLI did not show significant statistically differences (p> 0. 05) among groups. Conclusion: in summary, our results demonstrate that <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> is able to modulate rat colon carcinogenesis as a result of induction of apoptosis.
