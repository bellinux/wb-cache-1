30|$|The {{economic}} side {{is probably}} the most vulnerable. As in the majority of mega-events, also in the case of London the budget presented in the bid underestimated the real costs, and final expenditures almost tripled the initial spending plan. In addition, the crisis of 2008 pushed away all private investors, leaving the state with the task of covering all expenses. This was translated, among other solutions, in a council tax hike of 20  lb per household per year, particularly unfair for low-income families. In addition, the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> the <b>expenditures</b> for the maintenance of the park and sports venues is another major issue. Also, the cost of managing the event and the competitions, and the cost of ensuring the safety of spectators and athletes was extremely high (security costs were quantified in £ 553  m by The Guardian 2011). Also, the spectacular opening ceremony cost about £ 27  m (Interview 4).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{official}} statistics {{of persons with}} mental disorders who are granted disability pension (DP) in Russia and Norway indicate large differences between the countries. Methods This qualitative explorative hypothesis-generating study is based on text analysis of the laws, regulations and guidelines, and qualitative interviews of informants representing all the organisational elements of the DP systems in both countries. Results The DP application process is initiated much later in Norway than in Russia, where a 3 year occupational rehabilitation and adequate treatment is mandatory before DP is granted. In Russia, two instances are responsible for preparing of the medical certification for DP, a patients medical doctor (PD) and a clinical expert commission (CEC) while there is one in Norway (PD). In Russia, the Bureau of Medical-Social Expertise is responsible for evaluation and granting of DP. In Norway, the local social insurance offices (SIO) {{are responsible for the}} DP application. Decisions are taken collectively in Russia, while the Norwegian PD and SIO officer often take decisions alone. In Russia, the medical criterion is the decisive one, while rehabilitation and treatment criteria are given priority in Norway. The size of the DP in Norway is enough to <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> subsistences <b>expenditure,</b> while the Russian DP is less than the level required for minimum subsistence. Conclusion There were noteworthy differences in the time frame, organisation model and process leading to a DP in the two countries. These differences may explain why so few patients with less severe mental disorders receive a DP in Russia. This fact, in combination with the size of the DP, may hamper reforms of the mental health care system in Russia. </p...|$|R

However, because the growth of house prices is faster than the growth of disposable income of urban households in Beijing, the affordable housing areas of urban residents in Beijing is decreasing.

This study shows that partial compensation depends critically on the effect <b>of</b> current parental <b>expenditure</b> on a parent's future fitness (e. g., survival to and fecundity in subsequent breeding seasons). Partial compensation is favored and biparental care is stable when future fitness is a concave-down function <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (i. e., each increment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is more costly than the previous).
