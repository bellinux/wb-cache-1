The commercial software Fluent was adopted to carry out 3 dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3 D-CFD) simulations of the gas flow field under different, actually four kinds of, furnace designs in this article. The flow fields of the carburizing gas around the part were analyzed. According to the simulations and analysis, it was shown that the number of fans on gear’s carburizing is not a primary factor, using a air inducting tub can improve the carburizing process significantly and proper loading tray design can also be positive. The results indicate that the simulation provides a reference to the furnace’s design optimization...|$|E

40|$|The mass (e. g. carbon) {{transfer}} coefficient at {{a workpiece}} surface {{is an important}} kinetic factor to control the heat treatment process of the workpiece and to evaluate heat treatment equipment. The coefficient can be calculated from the carbon concentration at {{the surface of a}} sample carburized in a <b>carburizing</b> <b>furnace</b> for a given time. Two common measurement methods which use a thin plate and employ a component as samples respectively are evaluated and compared for sensitivity and uncertainty. The comparison shows that the use of a component produces higher measurement precision and also has the advantage in measuring the carbon transfer coefficients at different treated positions. This method is then extended and discussed methodologically. Also two equations are proposed to calculate the carbon transfer coefficient and its uncertainty, respectively. This method is also applied to measure the carbon transfer coefficient in a fluidized bed heat treatment furnace. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The mass {{transfer}} coefficient {{is an important}} kinetic factor to control the thermo-chemical treatment processes of metals and alloys. More importantly, the {{mass transfer}} coefficient is different at different surface positions of a metallic part treated, which depends on the dynamic characteristics of the atmosphere close to the treated surface. Understanding the local mass transfer coefficient would be significant to approach the expected physical and mechanical properties of treated surfaces. In this paper, a reverse method was proposed to measure the mass transfer coefficient at component surface and the diffusivity in metal during heat treatment. The methodology of the reverses method and the optimal parame-ters are discussed in some detail.

40|$|The {{carburizing}} atmosphere {{during the}} case hardening process contains {{a large proportion}} of hydrogen. Due to the rapid diffusion of hydrogen a high amount of hydrogen can be absorbed by the carburizing component. The amount of absorbed hydrogen is dependent on some factors such as for example the carburizing time and component dimensions. Hydrogen diffused in material can then cause hydrogen embrittlement and in some cases cause cracking under a static load. This hydrogen must therefore be removed. High amounts of hydrogen diffuse out spontaneously at room temperature. Tempering accelerates the process. The aim {{of this study was to}} experimentally measure the amount of absorbed hydrogen after case hardening and hydrogen content after storage at room temperature and also after tempering. The effect of the enriching gas in <b>carburizing</b> <b>furnace</b> on hydrogen absorption was investigated in this study. Three steel grades with different content of alloying elements were used in this investigation. Steel samples were case hardened by gas carburizing and tempering. The hydrogen content analyses included the measurement of hydrogen content before case hardening, after case hardening and after tempering using Leco-RHEN 602. Based on the results in this study it was concluded that all steel grades used in this investigation absorb hydrogen during case hardening by gas carburizing. A major part of the absorbed hydrogen is then released by effusion after being stored at room temperature and during tempering. Around 50 % of the absorbed hydrogen content during gas carburizing is due to the presence of the enriching gas in the carburizing atmosphere. Around 50 % of hydrogen diffuses out of the steel specimens after one day. It is likely that all of free diffusible) hydrogen has diffused out of the specimens of two steel grades after one week at room temperature or after tempering...|$|E

40|$|This {{program was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} microalloy-modified grade of standard carburizing steel that can successfully exploit the high temperature carburizing capabilities of current commercial low pressure (i. e. 'vacuum') carburizing systems. Such steels can lower {{the amount of energy}} required for commercial carburizing operations by reducing the time required for deep-case carburizing operations. The specific technical objective of the work was to demonstrate a carburizing steel composition capable of maintaining a prior austenite grain size no larger than ASTM grain size number 5 after exposure to simulated carburizing conditions of 1050 C for 8 hr. Such thermal exposure should be adequate for producing carburized case depths up to about 2 mm. Such carburizing steels are expected to be attractive for use across a wide range of industries, including the petroleum, chemical, forest products, automotive, mining and industrial equipment industries. They have potential for reducing energy usage during low pressure carburizing by more than 25 %, as well as reducing cycle times and process costs substantially. They also have potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing low pressure <b>carburizing</b> <b>furnaces</b> by more than 25 %. High temperature carburizing can be done in most modern low pressure carburizing systems with no additional capital investment. Accordingly, implementing this technology on <b>carburizing</b> <b>furnaces</b> will provide a return on investment significantly greater than 10 %. If disseminated throughout the domestic carburizing community, the technology has potential for saving on the order of 23 to 34 trillion BTU/year in industrial energy usage. Under the program, two compositions of microalloyed, coarsening-resistant low alloy carburizing steels were developed, produced and evaluated. After vacuum annealing at 1050 oC for 8 hrs and high pressure gas quenching, both steels exhibited a prior austenite ASTM grain size number of 5. 0 or finer. For comparison, a control alloy of similar composition but without the microalloy additions exhibited a duplex prior austenite grain size with grains ranging from ASTM grain size 3 down to ASTM grain size 1 after similar processing and thermal exposure. These results confirm the potential for using microalloy additions of Ti, B, Nb, Al, rare earths and/or N for austenite grain size control in Cr-Mo (i. e. 4000 -series) low alloy carburizing steels. They also demonstrate that these microalloy additions will not compromise the processability of the steel; all three materials produced under the program could be hot worked readily using normal steel processing protocols. To fully realize the technical and commercial potential of these steels, {{there is a need to}} continue development work using larger-scale heats. These larger-scale heats are needed to provide adequate material for fatigue testing of quenched and tempered alloys, to conduct more complete investigations of potential alloy chemistries and to provide additional material for processing studies. It will also be beneficial to carefully review intellectual property issues associated with this family of steels, since existing Japanese patent literature suggests that significant microstructural and/or process characterization work may be needed on new materials to confirm that these materials fall outside existing patent claims...|$|R
40|$|This Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) report {{deals with}} the {{development}} of nickel aluminide alloy for improved longer life heat-resistant fixture assemblies for batch and continuous pusher carburizing furnaces. The nickel aluminide development was compared in both coupon and component testing with the currently used Fe-Ni-Cr heat-resisting alloy known as HU. The specific goals of the CRADA were: (1) casting process development, (2) characterization and possible modification of the alloy composition to optimize its manufacturing ability and performance under typical furnace operating conditions, and (3) testing and evaluation of specimens and prototype fixtures. In support of the CRADA objectives, coupons of nickel aluminide and the HU alloy were installed in both batch and pusher furnaces. The coupons were taken from two silicon levels and contained welds made with two different filler compositions (IC- 221 LA and IC- 221 W). Both nickel-aluminide and HU coupons were removed from the batch and pusher <b>carburizing</b> <b>furnace</b> at time intervals ranging from one month to one year. The exposed coupons were cut and mounted for metallographic, hardness, and microprobe analysis. The results of the microstructural analysis have been transmitted to General Motors Corporation, Saginaw Division (Delphi Saginaw) through reports that were presented at periodic CRADA review meetings. Based on coupon testing and verification of the coupon results with the testing of trays, Delphi Saginaw moved forward with the use of six additional trays in a batch furnace and two assemblies in a pusher furnace. Fifty percent of the trays and fixtures are in the as-cast condition and the remaining trays and fixtures are in the preoxidized condition. The successful operating experience of two assemblies in the pusher furnace for nearly a year formed the basis for a production run of 63 more assemblies. The production run required melting of 94 heats weighing 500 lb. each. Twenty-six of the 94 heats were from virgin stock, and 68 were from the revert that used 50 % virgin and 50 % revert. Detailed chemical analysis of the 94 heats reflected that the nickel aluminide can be cast into heat-treat fixtures under production conditions. In addition to the chemical analysis, the castings showed excellent dimensional reproducibility. A total of six batch furnace trays and 65 pusher furnace assemblies of nickel aluminide alloy IC- 221 M are currently operating in production furnaces at Delphi Saginaw. Two of the pusher furnace assemblies have completed two years of service without any failure. The CRADA has accomplished the goal of demonstrating that the nickel aluminide can be produced under commercial production conditions and it has superior performance over the currently used HU alloy in both batch and pusher furnaces...|$|E

40|$|An {{atmosphere}} {{control system}} for a continuous <b>carburizing</b> pusher <b>furnace</b> has been developed. The atmosphere system is based on nitrogen/methanol with propane and water as additional gases for carbon potential control. It enables independent carbon potential control per furnace zone, which was not possible with the old control system. Important parameters for good results are proper location of gas and methanol inlets, the design of gas injection installations and the control system with gas and methanol flow control and related software. It was found {{that in order to}} reach a good atmosphere controllability it was necessary to install and use an oxygen probe for carbon potential control in the final diffusion zone. Still the existing CO 2 carbon potential control was used in the carburizing zone. The system has been in production since beginning of 1997 and has given a productivity increase of the order of 15 %. If {{there is no need for}} productivity increase it is possible to lower the carburizing temperature and still have the same output with the additional benefit of a lower running cost for the furnace. It is the experience that surfaces are cleaner after carburizing with the new system. 1...|$|R
