Our study documents how different NAO–EA and NAO–SCA combinations influence winter climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation) as a consequence of NAO dipole migrations. Using teleconnectivity maps, we find that the zero-correlated line of the NAO–winter-climate relationship migrates southwards when the EA is in the opposite phase to the NAO, related to a southwestwards migration of the NAO dipole under these conditions. Similarly, a <b>clockwise</b> <b>movement</b> of the NAO–winter-climate correlated areas occurs when the phase of the SCA is opposite to that of the NAO, reflecting a <b>clockwise</b> <b>movement</b> of the NAO dipole under these conditions. Our study provides new insights into the causes of spatial and temporal nonstationarity in the climate–NAO relationships, particularly with respect to winter precipitation.

The Qiongdongnan Basin is a NE-trending Tertiary basin oriented oblique to the Yinggehai Basin, which extended in a SSE direction during opening of the South China Sea. Through analogue modeling of these NW-trending and NE-trending basins, we draw following conclusions: (1) Rifting in the Yinggehai Basin must have been earlier than in the Qiongdongnan Basin because the NE-trending structures in the Qiongdongnan Basin do not occur west of No. 1 Fault; (2) The deformation of the Qiongdongnan Basin is strongly affected by the deformation of the Yinggehai Basin. In the western Qiongdongnan Basin, a northern depression bounded by E-W-trending faults was formed by the interplay of NW-trending structures and NE-trending structures; (3) The relative initial rifting ages of the Qiongdongnan (similar to 40 Ma), Yinggehai (similar to 50 Ma) and Beibuwan (similar to 60 Ma) Basins explain {{the differences in the}} structures that exist in their regions of overlap; (4) Initial rifting in the marginal basins of the South China Sea during the Late Cretaceous seems to be driven by retreat of the Pacific plate, but later <b>clockwise</b> <b>movement</b> of Indochina affected the NE-trending marginal basins of the South China Sea after the Eocene (similar to 50 Ma) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Glucose {{transporter}} 4 (GLUT 4) is an insulin facilitated {{glucose transporter}} that {{plays an important}} role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. GLUT 4 is sequestered into intracellular vesicles in unstimulated cells and translocated to the plasma membrane by various stimuli. Understanding the structural details of GLUT 4 will provide insights into the mechanism of glucose transport and its regulation. To date, a crystal structure for GLUT 4 is not available. However, earlier work from our laboratory proposed a well validated homology model for GLUT 4 based on the experimental data available on GLUT 1 and the crystal structure data obtained from the glycerol 3 -phosphate transporter. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, the dynamic behavior of GLUT 4 in a membrane environment was analyzed using three forms of GLUT 4 (apo, substrate and ATP-substrate bound states). Apo form simulation analysis revealed an extracellular open conformation of GLUT 4 in the membrane favoring easy exofacial binding of substrate. Simulation studies with the substrate bound form proposed a stable state of GLUT 4 with glucose, which can be a substrateoccluded state of the transporter. Principal component analysis suggested a <b>clockwise</b> <b>movement</b> for the domains in the apo form, whereas ATP substrate-bound form induced an anti-clockwise rotation. Simulation studies suggested distinct conformational changes for the GLUT 4 domains in the ATP substrate-bound form and favor a constricted behavior for the transport channel.

Binding of EF-G·GTP first induces rapid counterclockwise intersubunit rotation, followed by a slower, clockwise reversal of the rotational movement.

The leftward unidirectional flow results from tilting of the rotational axis of the cilium to posterior side. Because of the no-slip boundary condition at the cell surface, the upper stroke away from the boundary generates leftward flow, and the lower stroke close to the boundary generates slower rightward flow. By combining computational fluid dynamics with experimental observations, we demonstrate that the leftward stroke can be more effective than expected for cases in which cilia tilting alone is considered with the no-slip condition under constant driving force. Our results suggest that the driving force is asymmetric and that it is determined by the tilting angle and open angle of the rotating cilia.

Examination of various ciliary mutant mice shows that two rotating cilia are sufficient to initiate left-right asymmetric gene expression. Our results suggest the existence of a highly sensitive system in the node that is able to sense an extremely weak unidirectional flow, and may favour a model in which the flow is sensed as a mechanical force...|$|R

We investigated the main environmental determinants of foraging strategies in Cory"s shearwaters Calonectris diomedea by combining satellite-tracking information from 14 birds breeding on the Canary Islands with concurrent data on chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations and oceanic winds. Additionally, we took blood samples {{at the end of each}} foraging trip and analysed carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes to examine the use of trophic resources. All birds showed commuting trips, concentrating foraging activity exclusively on the African continental shelf. Foraging locations showed a strong association with chl a concentrations, suggesting birds select foraging areas according to prey availability. In contrast with other breeding colonies where Cory"s shearwaters use a dual-foraging method, birds showed a unimodal strategy and did not show differences in C and N isotope signatures in plasma, confirming that close proximity to highly productive areas strongly influences foraging strategies. In addition, birds tracked during 2 consecutive trips foraged in the same area, suggesting that high resource availability promotes fidelity to feeding grounds also at coarse scales. Persistent northeast trade winds blew during the study period, and commuting trips followed a consistent <b>clockwise</b> <b>movement</b> with a southwest heading while the birds foraged along the continental shelf, suggesting that birds used tail winds to reduce their flying costs.

It was tested whether merely executing and seeing <b>clockwise</b> (vs. counterclockwise) <b>movements</b> would induce psychological states of temporal progression (vs. regression) {{and according to}} motivational orientations toward the future and novelty (vs. the past and familiarity). Supporting this hypothesis, participants who turned cranks counterclockwise preferred familiar over novel stimuli, but participants who turned cranks clockwise preferred novel over old stimuli, reversing the classic mere exposure effect (Experiment 1). Also, participants rotating a cylinder clockwise reported higher scores in the personality measure openness to experience than participants rotating counterclockwise (Experiment 2). Merely passively watching a rotating square had similar but weaker effects on exposure and openness (Experiment 3). Finally, participants chose more unconventional candies from a clockwise than from a counterclockwise Lazy Susan, that is, a turntable (Experiment 4) ...|$|R
2500|$|Eukaryotic DNA is {{bidirectional}}. Here {{the meaning}} of the word bidirectional is different. Eukaryotic linear DNA has many origins (called O) and termini (called T). [...] "T" [...] is present to the right of [...] "O". One [...] "O" [...] and one [...] "T" [...] together form one replicon. After the formation of pre-initiation complex, when one replicon starts elongation, initiation starts in second replicon. Now, if the first replicon moves in clockwise direction, the second replicon moves in anticlockwise direction, until [...] "T" [...] of first replicon is reached. At [...] "T", both the replicons merge to complete the process of replication. Meanwhile, the second replicon is moving in forward direction also, to meet with the third replicon. This <b>clockwise</b> and counter-clockwise <b>movement</b> of two replicons is termed as bidirectional replication. On the other hand, in prokaryotes, replication is unidirection; and occurs only in clockwise direction.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{earliest}} {{surveys of the}} area, theories about {{the movement of the}} JF Microplate have evolved to include compression of the plate through rotational movement and also shear zones between two major plates and the JF Microplate driving this <b>clockwise</b> rotational <b>movement.</b> The Pacific Plate is estimated to have a spreading rate anywhere between 13 and 16 cm/yr in relation to the Juan Fernandez MicroPlate. This spreading ridge supplies magma {{to the west of the}} plate, acting as a lubricant. In the development stages of the microplate, the Pacific Plate also shared a coupled shear section to the south of the microplate and, together with the Nazca Plate, drove fast rotation of the microplate. Approximately 2.5 Ma ago the JF Microplate began decoupling from the Pacific Plate and coupling with the Antarctic Plate. The latter severely braked the rotational movement of the microplate. Now, the Nazca and Antarctica Plates, are the plates that share the current shear zones with transform faulting between them and the JF Plate. The Nazca Plate shears to the east while the Antarctica Plate shears relatively to the west, and this continues to drive the rotation of the microplate clockwise as well as consequential compression however at a much slower rate. Compression has been observed on the Juan Fernandez Microplate at the Pacific-Nazca-JF triple junction and the Nazca-Antarctic-JF triple junction, due to the slightly irregular shape of the plate which does not rotate perfectly about its center.|$|R
