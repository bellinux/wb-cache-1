40|$|Integrated coastal {{management}} (ICM) has been slowly accepted {{over the last}} decade as a unifying approach for <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> and management throughout the world. <b>Coastal</b> <b>planning</b> aimed at achieving the objectives of ICM can be implemented by varying processes and faces many challenges. One major challenge for <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> is to adapt the well-developed theoretical principles of ICM to practical and understandable outcomes in local areas. Associated with this challenge is the need to balance <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> objectives for conservation and economic development of a nation or state/province with the objectives of the local community. This article describes a three-tiered approach to <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> in Victoria, Australia, which will be of value to other countries, particularly those with subnational <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> jurisdictions. This approach not only has the aim of balancing subnational (e. g., state government) and local objectives, but also of applying the theoretical concept of ICM in practice on the ground. In addition, the approach sets out to achieve a sense of ownership of the planning process by local communities by maximizing their involvement at all levels of planning and also by making the state strategy as easy to understand and follow as possible. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Integrated coastal {{management}} (ICM) {{has been the}} basis for <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> and management since the 1970 s. The {{theory and practice of}} ICM is {{based on the premise that}} increased integration of planning and management in the coastal zone will lead to improved environmental and social outcomes for the coast. In the context of global and national trends, this thesis examines the application of ICM in three place-based coastal case studies in Victoria: the Gippsland Lakes, Point Nepean and the Geelong region. The particular focus is on the twin challenges of coastal urbanisation and the impacts of climate change. Through a wide range of applied research techniques including focus groups, the research explores the pressures, issues, impacts and implications for ICM and beyond. The case studies point to a number of important implications for ICM and identify opportunities for a more s ustainable approach to <b>coastal</b> <b>planning.</b> In reviewing the research findings, a set of five steps and six principles are proposed to respond to policy failures and provide for a transition to more sustainable <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> in Victoria. The five steps involve expanding the theory of ICM to be outcome based and regional in its approach to <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> and management. In the context of climate change, a more adaptive and systems approach has been incorporated along with recognising the even greater importance of community engagement in <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> processes during a period of increased uncertainty and change. The principal instrument for change is a tripartite intergovernmental agreement on sustainable <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> underpinned by a set of six principles. These include: agreed and shared outcomes for the coastal environment to facilitate horizontal and vertical integration; an adaptive and systems approach integrating science and urban planning drawing on experience and knowledge in both disciplin es; incorporation of the shared outcomes and an adaptive approach into urban and regional planning systems for local implementation; regional governance arrangements for integration of policy outcomes and community involvement; capacity building for sustainable <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> including interdisciplinary research and community education and long term monitoring and evaluation. The transition from ICM to sustainable <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> does not discard ICM but rather incorporates its strengths and adapts the concept to meet the twin challenges of coastal urbanisation and climate change. Further research questions are posed to indicate how the research findings could be further developed as part of a future coastal research agenda. The research findings seek to make a contribution to the theory and practice of ICM to build a pathway to <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> for the benefit of our coast and future generations...|$|R

40|$|This action-research project {{investigates the}} extent to which current <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> {{arrangements}} can respond to climate change impacts such as coastal erosion and recession in the southwest of Western Australia. The complex social ecological system that comprises <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> in the region was modelled in a collaborative process. This took the form of a major action research workshop followed by further small workshops and interviews with key actors. The modelling process has implications for <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> as it shows that despite recent changes to <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> policy there are still significant areas of liability resulting from climate change that are not yet accounted for by governance. More generally, private and public coastal developments in WA are in a phase of rapid growth, with observable degradation of the coastal environment. Within the context of the model system, this implies that the positive feedback subsystems are strongly driving the system, and current levels of response to public liability and environmental advocacy are relatively weak and inadequate to achieve sustainable coastal management. For this system to be stable requires that negative system feedback be stronger than positive feedback. Future modelling efforts will investigate potential interventions and restructuring of governance system to achieve goals of sustainable development. Thus far, the main use of the model has been as a heuristic device to discuss the <b>coastal</b> <b>planning</b> system with key informants, and to identify constraints and opportunities to coastal adaptation through the planning system...|$|R

In Sinaloa Navolato, there are three types of landscape: a <b>coastal</b> <b>plan</b> in the west, {{mountains}} (sierras) in the east, and valleys between them. In {{the eastern part of the}} state Sierra Madre Occidental is known by different names. Valleys lie between the ranges of mountains and the <b>coastal</b> <b>plan,</b> where the land is flat with few hills. The rivers rise in the Sierra Madre Occidental and cross the state to flow into the Gulfo de California and the Pacific Ocean. Major rivers are the Fuerte and Sinaloa.Sinaloa had a total population of 2,536,844 in 2000; of the total, 1,264,143 were men and 1,272,701 were women, according to the Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Mexican States. [...] It also stated that, “The population density was 44 people per square kilometer (114 people per square mile).”Almost all citizens speak Spanish as their first language. A small number, about 2.2% of the population speaks indigenous (native) languages in Sinaloa Navolato. According to the Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Mexican States, “77% of the population, or about two million people, were Roman Catholic; almost 3%, or 65,346 people, were Protestant.” That year there were also 32,783 Jehovah’s witnesses and over 180,000 people who reported no religion. Sinaloa Navolato is not very well known by most people, but it is a rather unusual place to know and learn about. For example, the name Sinaloa comes from the Chaita language. It is a combination of the words sina, which means pithaya (a plant with thorny stalks), and lobola, which means rounded. The pithaya is a common plant throughout the region, which has great meaning.|$|E
