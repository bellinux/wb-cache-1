To answer {{its real}} purposes, you must first possess {{the means of}} knowing the fitness of your man; and then you must retain some hold upon him by {{personal}} obligation or dependence. For what end are these primary electors complimented, or rather mocked, with a choice? They can never know anything of the qualities of him that is to serve them, nor has he any obligation whatsoever to them. Of all the powers unfit to be delegated {{by those who have}} any real means of judging, that most peculiarly unfit is what relates to a personal choice. In case of abuse, that body of primary electors never can call the representative to an account for his conduct.

By the new French Constitution the best and the wisest representatives go equally with the worst into this Limbus Patrum. Their bottoms are supposed foul, and they must go into dock to be refitted. Every man who has served in an Assembly is ineligible for two years after. Just as these magistrates begin to learn their trade, like chimney-sweepers, they are disqualified for exercising it. Superficial, new, petulant acquisition, and interrupted, dronish, broken, ill recollection, is to be the destined character of all your future governors. Your Constitution has too much of jealousy to have much of sense in it. You consider the breach of trust in the representative so principally that you do not at all regard the question of his fitness to execute it.|$|E

I {{have belonged}} to the Faculty of Arts for this period, before {{transferring}} {{in the last year}} of completion to the Faculty of Business. I had to seek the expertise of the School of Tourism due to the interdisciplinary nature of my thesis. This interdisciplinary thesis belongs to Marie Antoinette studies. The contemporary dissonant commodification of the controversial historical character of the last Queen of France, detected at her former home, Petit Trianon, drives the course of the thesis research. Considering the complexity and controversy of the subject, the thesis seeks to make a contribution to extant scholarship by clarifying important modern history issues through a fresh approach: by using art history as an indicator in assessing the historical truth of the narrative of Petit Trianon, the residence identified as home to the last Queen of France. The thesis examines Petit Trianon and Marie Antoinette in the context of four major narratives - the historical, cinematic, architectural and heritage narratives - relevant to the contemporary heritage interpretation of Petit Trianon as well as its visitor perceptions. In addition to sourcing evidence for the arguments originating in art history information, the thesis relies on the data collection provided by a tailor-made survey for the topic, placing the results in the wider context of a hermeneutical interpretation of data found in either history or contemporary popular culture. The array of Marie Antoinette’s images detected by the analysis charts the commodification of this historical character at Petit Trianon: its production and consumption. It is through the assessment of this commodification that the present thesis reveals the misconceptions surrounding the historical character best known as Marie Antoinette. The thesis argues that the true role of the last Queen of France was successfully obscured through juxtaposition with her perception by the French collective memory. In other words, the perception of Marie Antoinette had subverted historical truth. Furthermore, the commodification of her historical character is perpetuated in an endless <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> fuelled by postmodern consumerism...|$|R

This paper reflects {{on the experience of}} transferring knowledge and understanding between these two communities during the Learning Activity Design in Education project funded by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} algorithms for drawing, {{filling and}} shading polygons in 2 D, when a <b>chain</b> <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> the polygon is given. The <b>chain</b> <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> a polygon {{is unique in}} the sense that it does not impose any constraint on the user input, except that it should form a closed loop. Thus, it remains upto the algorithm to decipher the valid polygon represented by the chain. The paper first defines the polygon represented by a chain and then the algorithms which basically attempt to extract the polygon from the chain governed by this definition. 1 Introduction Majority of computer graphics systems, for example OpenGL, use polygons as their most common primitive and they generally expect the input to be the boundary of the polygon, which is formally defined later. In reality, the user has the freedom to input any chain, which is defined later, and this chain may or may not be a part of the boundary of the polygon. This may lead to non-deterministic and unanticipated behavior by the system on a misbehaved input (chain), where an input is considered to be misbehaved if it does not belong to the boundary of the polygon. The motivation behind this paper is to come up with semantics which would map any chain input by the user unambiguously to a polygon, and algorithms which would let the system actually render the polygon. The chain representation can be used to define all valid polygons in 2 D...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{introduces}} {{and uses}} a <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> defeasible inheritance networks where links in the network are viewed as propositions, and where defeasible links are tagged with a quantitative indication of the proportion of exceptions, called the doubt index. This doubt index is used for restricting the length <b>of</b> the <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> inference. The <b>representation</b> also introduces the use of defeater literals that disable the <b>chaining</b> <b>of</b> subsumption links. The use of defeater literals replaces the use of negative defeasible inheritance links, expressing “most A are not B”. The new representation improves the expressivity significantly. Inference in inheritance networks is defined {{by a combination of}} axioms that constrain the contents of network extensions, a heuristic restriction that also has that effect, and a nonmonotonic operation of minimizing the set of defeater literals while retaining consistency. We introduce an underlying semantics that defines the meaning of literals in a network, and prove that the axioms are sound with respect to this semantics. We also discuss the conditions for obtaining completeness. Traditional concepts, assumptions and issues in research on nonmonotonic or defeasible inheritance are reviewed in the perspective of this approach...|$|R
40|$|A linear {{ordering}} (X,≺) is a Debreu chain (or has the Debreu property) if each sub-ordering (Y,≺) of X can be embedded into X with an injective {{function that}} is both order-preserving and continuous {{with respect to the}} order topology on X and Y. The most typical example <b>of</b> a Debreu <b>chain</b> is the linearly ordered topological space (R, <, τ<) of real numbers endowed with its usual order < and the order topology τ<. The Debreu property is of fundamental importance when dealing with utility representations. Recall that a utility representation for a chain (X,≺) is a pair (U, f), where (U,<) is a chain and f: X → U is an order-preserving embedding, i. e., for each x, y ∈ X, if x ≺ y then f(x) < f(y); the linear ordering U is called the base <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> the <b>representation,</b> and the map f a utility function. Traditionally, the literature has been dealing with utility representations such that the base chain (Y,<) is the set R of real numbers, endowed with its natural order <.
