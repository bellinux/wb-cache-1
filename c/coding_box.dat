40|$|In {{order to}} perform precise {{identification}} {{and location of}} artificial coded targets in natural scenes, a novel design of circle-based coded target and the corresponding coarse-fine extraction algorithm are presented. The designed target separates the target box and <b>coding</b> <b>box</b> totally and owns an advantage of rotation invariance. Based on the original target, templates are prepared by three geometric transformations and are used as the input of shape-based template matching. Finally, region growing and parity check methods are used to extract the coded targets as final results. No human involvement is required except for the preparation of templates and adjustment of thresholds in the beginning, which is conducive to the automation of close-range photogrammetry. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed recognition method for the designed coded target is robust and accurate...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to identify other noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the corpus luteum (CL) during early pregnancy in buffalo. Materials and Methods: For this study, CL (n= 2) from two buffalo gravid uteri, obtained from the slaughter house, was transported to laboratory after snap freezing in liquid nitrogen (- 196 Â°C). The stage of pregnancy was determined by measuring the crown-rump region of the fetus. This was followed by isolation of RNA and deep sequencing. Post-deep sequencing, the obtained reads were checked and aligned against various ncRNA databases (GtRNA, RFAM, and deep guide). Various parameters, namely, frequency of specific ncRNAs, length, mismatch, and genomic location target in several model species were deciphered. Results: Frequency of piwi-interacting RNAs (piwi-RNAs), having target location in rodents and human genomes, were significantly higher compared to other piwi-RNAs and ncRNAs. Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) deduced had nucleotides (nts) ranging from 17 to 50 nts, but the occurrence of small length rRNAs was more than lengthier fragments. The target on 16 S rRNA species confirms the conservation of 16 S rRNA across species. With respect to transfer RNA (tRNA), the abundantly occurring tRNAs were unique with no duplication. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), identified in this study, showed a strong tendency for <b>coding</b> <b>box</b> C/D snoRNAs in comparison to H/ACA snoRNAs. Regulatory and evolutionary implications of these identified ncRNAs are yet to be delineated in many species, including buffaloes. Conclusion: This is the first report of identification of other ncRNAs in CL of early pregnancy in buffalo...|$|E

All the other code words have weights that are multiples {{of four and}} have a minimum weight equal to 12. This code may be encoded systematically and arises from a strict binary representation of the (8, 4; 5) Reed-Solomon (RS) code over GF (64).

The Mattson-Solomon representation of the cyclic decomposition of these codes and their parity sums are used to detect an odd number of errors {{in any of the}} six codes.

Additionally the council identifies and keeps a register of the contaminated land use in the area.
