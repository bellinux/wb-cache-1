50|$|On {{mechanical}} looms {{the technology}} of 'wire weaving' still exists, using modern technology and electronics. This weaving technique allows users to obtain both loop <b>pile</b> and <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> in the same fabric. Other techniques involve the weaving of two layers of fabric {{on top of each}} other, whereby the warp ends used for the pile are inserted {{in such a way that}} they form a vertical connection between the two layers of fabric. By cutting the pile ends in between the two layers one obtains two separate <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> With this technique only the <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> effect can be obtained. This is known as 'face-to-face weaving'. Both 'wire weaving' and 'face-to-face' weaving are used for the manufacturing of upholstery and furnishing fabrics as well as in rug making (knotted-pile carpet).|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{from the}} dye {{industry}} contains {{high level of}} organic nitrogen derived from urea. Thus, an effective nitrogen removal process is needed to reduce effluent nitrogen concentration. We have developed a new nitrogen removal process using non-woven biomass carriers. In this study, we used <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which are products of the local industry in the Wakayama prefecture, instead of non-woven materials as biomass carriers to improve nitrification rates. Several <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> were then used for nitrification and continuous nitrification/denitrification experiments. The specific NOx-N production rate using an acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> was 3. 4 times {{higher than that of}} non-woven carriers. About 75 % nitrification efficiencies were obtained under a T-N loading rate of 0. 5 kg-N/m 3 /day and a HRT of 10 hours during continuous nitrification using acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Furthermore, continuous nitrification/denitrification experiments were carried out using acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> in a base cloth with a mesh structure to improve the diffusion rates. Little biomass accumulated on the <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> surfaces so a high diffusion rate through the pile was maintained for long periods. Denitrification efficiencies of 56 and 77 % were achieved at HRTs of 12 and 19 hours, respectively, with influent concentrations of 200 mg/l T-N and 450 mg/lTOC...|$|R
50|$|Moquette, {{derived from}} the French word for carpet, {{is a type of}} woven <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> in which <b>cut</b> or uncut threads form a short dense <b>cut</b> or loop <b>pile.</b> As well as giving it a {{distinctive}} velvet-like feel, the pile construction is particularly durable, and ideally suited to applications such as public transport. Its upright fibres form a flexible, non-rigid surface, which are constantly displaced to give durability and anti-stain benefits. Traditional moquette fabrics are made from a wool nylon face with an interwoven cotton backing.|$|R
50|$|People {{restoring}} classic {{cars will}} often freshen up the interior by putting in new carpet to cover new floor pans. When they do replace the carpet {{in their cars}} they have quite a few options in molded carpet. There are several websites that specialize in molded carpets. There are several styles of molded carpet, the most popular include 80-20 loop, cutpile and essex. Most cars from the 1940s to the mid-1970s used 80-20 loop carpet. The major exception being Cadillac which used <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> in their cars at various times. After 1974 car makers used <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> or essex carpet exclusively. 80-20 loop which is 80% rayon 20% nylon thus the name. It has a texture similar to berber house carpet. <b>Cut</b> <b>pile</b> is {{what you see in}} modern cars. It looks like little strands of hair. Essex is a longer more plush version of <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> carpet. It's softer to the touch than <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> and 80-20 loop, but is also more expensive than the other two.|$|R

50|$|Polar fleece {{originated}} in Massachusetts in 1979 when Malden Mills, (now Polartec LLC), and Patagonia developed Synchilla (synthetic chinchilla). It was a new, light, strong <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> meant to mimic—and {{in some ways}} surpass—wool. Aaron Feuerstein intentionally declined to patent Polar fleece, allowing the material to be produced cheaply and widely by many vendors, leading to the material's quick and wide acceptance.|$|R
5000|$|Mockado (also moquette, moucade) is a woollen <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> made in {{imitation}} of silk velvet from the mid-sixteenth century. Mockado was usually constructed with a woollen pile on a linen or worsted wool warp and woollen weft, although the ground fabric could be any combination of wool, linen, and silk. Mockado was used for furnishings and carpeting, and also for clothing such as doublets, farthingales, and kirtles.|$|R

50|$|John Rylands Library {{archives}} {{show that}} {{the roots of the}} Christy company date from at least 1833, when the Stockport firm of W. M. Christy & Sons Ltd - established by banker and hatter William Miller Christy - was manufacturing cotton goods. Christy's son, the noted collector and ethnologist Henry Christy, discovered the product that would make the company famous. While travelling in Istanbul, he saw an example of the looped <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> that is known today as terry towelling, but which was initially known as the 'Turkish towel'.The company found a method of weaving the looped <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> on an industrial scale using a machine designed by one of their employees Samuel Holt, who patented the design. The first Christy towels factory opened in Droylsden in 1850. A year later, Christy towels were displayed at The Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace, Queen Victoria became an early client. By 1891, the company's Fairfields Mill in Droylsden had 310 looms and 30,000 spindles, according to Worrall's Cotton Spinners Directory.|$|R

40|$|BF-T 9 P, a {{nonwoven}} fiber material, {{can be used}} as {{an effective}} biomass carrier for yeast (UY 7 strain) in the treatment of wastewater generated during the production of seasoned salty plums. However, the cost is a major problem in small and medium scale companies. We investigated the feasibility of using a <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> biomass carrier that can be produced at low cost with existing equipment. The TOC removal rate of E-pile, a polyester <b>pile</b> <b>fabric,</b> was as high as that of the nonwoven material under a volumetric loading rate of 4 to 15 kg-TOC/m 3 /d. A packing ratio of 0. 17 m 3 -carrier/m 3 -reactor was sufficient for TOC removal if the volumetric loading rate was less than 8 kg-TOC/m 3 /d. In a system using a biomass carrier, the decrease in TOC removal caused by a temperature drop from 25 to 5 ℃ was slower and the increase in TOC removal upon raising the temperature to 10 ℃ was faster, compared with a system without a biomass carrier. These results may be attributed to the stable retention of yeast in the reactor by entrapment inside the biomass carrier...|$|R
50|$|The {{tufted carpet}} {{is the most}} common {{manufacturing}} technique. It implies poking yarn tufts in a textile support close to a sewing machine. The carpet is then equipped with a folder (rewoven, jute, plastic or cotton) pasted {{on the back of the}} tuft. This technique makes possible the production of <b>cut</b> <b>pile,</b> curly or structured carpets.|$|R
50|$|Usually, when yarn is cut, {{the ends}} fray {{similar to the}} way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying must be avoided in {{cut-pile}} carpets by all means. A <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> carpet with frayed yarn ends would have a poor appearance, a shorter life cycle and ergonomic disadvantages for the “walker” as scientific research has proven. The carpet is less elastic and doesn’t absorb the steps of the user as well as a heat set carpet would. A carpet manufactured from heat set yarn is more attractive, durable and comfortable for the user. The added value of heatset carpet is significant. Normally a heat set carpet can be identified by its grainy structure, which is called “pinpoint tip definition” in the industry. The appearance of the <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> ends is similar to pin points.|$|R

50|$|Moquette {{originated}} in France, {{where it was}} woven by hand. The standard width was a Flemish ell of 27 inches. There were two finishes: moquette velouté, which had a <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> like English Wilton, and moquette bouclé, which had an uncut pile like Brussels carpet. It is still woven in Yorkshire using traditional techniques. A long-standing moquette manufacturer is Holdsworth Fabrics which dates back to 1822.|$|R
50|$|Pile weave {{is a form}} of textile {{created by}} weaving. <b>Pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> used to be made on {{traditional}} hand weaving machines. The warp ends that are used for the formation of the pile are woven over metal rods or wires that are inserted in the shed (gap caused by raising alternate threads) during weaving. The pile ends lie in loops over the inserted rods. When a rod is extracted the pile ends remain as loops on top of the base <b>fabric.</b> The <b>pile</b> ends lying over the rod may be left as 'loop pile', or cut to form 'cut pile' or velvet.|$|R

Another important invention in connection with silk manufacture was his velvet loom for <b>piled</b> <b>fabrics</b> which made him very rich. He had his portrait painted with a model of one of his inventions. However, the business was seriously affected by the prohibitory duties imposed by the United States, making him an early critic of the British policy of free trade.|$|R

30|$|Current {{residential}} mattresses use a {{wide range}} of tickings, including <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> knits, woven fabrics and jacquard designs. To address issues of physiological comfort, fire safety, and the growing incidence of allergies within the U.S. population, a variety of functional coatings, including water-proof, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and/or flame retardant finishes, are applied to the ticking of the mattress. The majority of modern ticking materials have a high polypropylene and/ or polyester fiber count, with the fiber content varying significantly with the fabric structure and design pattern. While cotton, polyester and polypropylene fibers dominate the ticking industry, blends of luxury fibers, such as wool and silk, are becoming more prevalent. Renewable resources like corn, soybean and bamboo fibers are also gaining popularity as more environmentally friendly alternatives. Viscose rayon derived from bamboo is of particularly high interest because of its inherent anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties and its good breathability and moisture absorption. However, very {{little is known about the}} flammability of these green alternatives.|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{coatings}} {{in actual}} use {{are subject to}} wear and tear. In this experiment, we look into the dewetting instability of more realistic polymer coatings wherein topographical fluctuations pre-existed. The topographical defects, produced by rubbing the film surface with a <b>piled</b> <b>fabric,</b> could be varied for the density by changing the number of rubbings, N. First, the dewetting mechanism was determined by comparing the dewetting morphology between the unrubbed and rubbed films. Nucleation dewetting was ascribed to samples wherein the characteristic wave vector, q{*}, of the final dewetted morphology increased with increasing N, whereas spinodal dewetting was ascribed to samples wherein was affected little. Second, the evolution of dewetting was compared between the unrubbed and rubbed films. Our, result shows that perturbations from rubbing do not produce changes in the free energy, of the films that will alter the prevailing dewetting mechanism or the characteristic wave vector in spinodal dewetting. Nonetheless, the rubbing-induced defects do affect the rupturing process, in manners depending on the dominating dewetting mechanisms...|$|R

5000|$|A rya is a {{traditional}} Scandinavian wool rug with a long pile of about 1 to 3 inches. They were made using a form of the Ghiordes knot to make the double-sided <b>pile</b> <b>fabric.</b> Though rya means [...] "rug" [...] in English, the original meaning in Sweden of rya was a bed cover with a knotted pile. The first ryas originated in the early fifteenth century as coarse, long-piled, heavy covers used by mariners instead of furs. As time progressed, the rugs have evolved to be lighter and more colorful. The insulation that ryas provide protect against the cold Scandinavian climate. Ryas are a knotted pile carpet, with each knot composed of three strands of wool, which enables the rug to exhibit rich texture from all the different shades of color. The name originates from a village in southwest Sweden. [...] The term rya may also refer to a breed of sheep whose wool is used to make rya carpets (see Rya (sheep)).|$|R
