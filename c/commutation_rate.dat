40|$|In {{this work}} a two-valued state {{feedback}} control for a plant of second order with known constant coefficients and an additive bounded disturbance is designed. In this controller the control signal can take only two possible values. The controller design is based on Lyapunov-like function method, achieving the convergence of the tracking error to a user-defined residual set. A boundedness condition for the user-defined reference signal is defined, which is necessary to allow out-put tracking. The developed scheme avoids large <b>commutation</b> <b>rate</b> of the control input. The controller design and stability analysis have important contributions with respect to closely related controllers based on the direct Lyapunov method, namely, (i) conditions to guarantee the expected convergence of the tracking error are established. These conditions are imposed on the reference signal and the extreme values of the control input. The stability analysis is developed {{by means of the}} Lyapunov-like function method and the Barbalat's Lemma and includes (ii) the bounded nature of the Lyapunov function, (iii) the monotonic convergence of the Lyapunov function to a residual set, and (iv) the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error to a residual set of user-defined size...|$|E

The {{results of}} a {{hardware}} evaluation of PAM-NRZ/FM are presented along {{with a description of}} the conditions under which the data were taken. State-of-the-art commutators, transmitters and receivers procured from commercial sources were utilized in the evaluation tests. The principal characteristics of PAM-NRZ/FM considered were data channel response, performance at low signal-to-noise ratios compared to equivalent FM/FM and PCM/FM systems, linearity, crosstalk, overmodulation, transmission noise, data resolution, decommutator synchronization and a comparison of performance at <b>commutation</b> <b>rates</b> of 25, 000, 100, 000 and 250, 000 samples per second. The test data indicates that PAM-NRZ/FM is capable of 2 to 5 percent data transmission accuracy and that performance at low RF levels is comparable to that of FM/FM or PCMJFM under the test conditions specified...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} the commutation time estimator (CTE) for PM BLDC motor drives. The proposed scheme is aimed to enhance motor output torque by minimizing the generated torque ripples. The torque ripples originating from commutation instances cause spikes and dips in the motor output torque. The motor output torque could be enhanced by mitigating the phase current mismatch rate during phase current <b>commutation</b> period. This <b>rate</b> could be almost matched by introducing the commutation time estimator (CTE) in order to control the rate of the energized phase current to be matched with the de-energized phase rate. Results obtained have validated and verified the proposed CTE effectiveness with a 50...|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} {{procedure with}} a high current-density anodic electrodissolution unit (HDAE) is proposed for the determination of aluminium, copper and zinc in non-ferroalloys by flame atomic absorption spectrometry, based on the direct solid analysis. It consists of solenoid valve-based commutation in a flow-injection system for on-line sample electro-dissolution and calibration with one multi-element standard, an electrolytic cell equipped with two electrodes (a silver needle acts as cathode, and sample as anode), and an intelligent unit. The latter is assembled in a PC-compatible microcomputer for instrument control, and for data acquisition and processing. General management of the process is achieved by use of software written in Pascal. Electrolyte compositions, flow <b>rates,</b> <b>commutation</b> times, applied current and electrolysis time were investigated. A 0. 5 mol l- 1 HN 03 solution was elected as electrolyte and 300 A/cm 2 as the continuous current pulse...|$|R
40|$|Switching {{converters}} {{are used}} in electric drive applications to produce variable voltage, variable frequency supply which generates harmful large dv/dt and high-frequency common mode voltages (CMV). Multilevel inverters generate lower CMV as compared to conventional two-level inverters. This paper presents simple carrier-based technique to control the common mode voltages in multilevel inverters using different structures of sine-triangle comparison method such as phase disposition (PD), phase opposition disposition (POD) by adding common mode voltage offset signal to actual reference voltage signal. This paper also presented the method to optimize {{the magnitude of this}} offset signal to reduce CMV and total harmonic distortion in inverter output voltage. The presented techniques give comparable performance as obtained in complex space vector-based control strategy, in terms of number of <b>commutations,</b> magnitude, and <b>rate</b> of change of CMV and harmonic profile of inverter output voltage. Simulation and experimental results presented confirm the effectiveness of the proposed techniques to control the common mode voltages...|$|R
