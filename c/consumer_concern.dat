25|$|In 2015, McDonald's {{pledged to}} stop using eggs from battery cage {{facilities}} by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch {{is expected to have}} a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by <b>consumer</b> <b>concern</b> over the harsh living conditions of hens. The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems. The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked up into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.|$|E

25|$|On 26 July {{more than}} 2,800 cattle carcasses, fed with cesium-contaminated food, had been shipped for public {{consumption}} to 46 of the 47 prefectures in Japan, with only Okinawa remaining free. Part of this beef, which {{had reached the}} markets, still needed to be tested. In an attempt to ease <b>consumer</b> <b>concern</b> the Japanese government promised to impose inspections on all this beef, and to buy the meat back when higher-than-permissible cesium levels were detected during the tests. The government planned to eventually pass on the buy-back costs to TEPCO. The same day the Japanese ministry of agriculture urged farmers and merchants to renounce the use and sale of compost made of manure from cows {{that may have been}} fed the contaminated straw. The measure also applied to humus from leaves fallen from trees. After developing guidelines for safety levels of radioactive caesium in compost and humus, this voluntary ban could be lifted.|$|E

In one survey, consumers were asked to rate hypothetical products based on brand, price, and production technology attributes. In a second survey, consumers rated hypothetical products that included government certification, price, and production technology attributes. Both the individual and aggregate results indicate that government certification would be more effective at assuaging <b>consumers</b> <b>concerns</b> than would the use of a familiar brand, although a familiar brand was sufficient to address <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns</b> for a significant number of respondents.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{want to show}} that <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns</b> can be {{implemented}} in food chains by organizing ethical discussions of conflicting values that include them as participators. First, it is argued that there are several types of <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns</b> about food and agriculture that are multi-interpretable and often contradict each other or are at least difficult to reconcile without considerable loss. Second, these <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns</b> are inherently dynamic because they respond to difficult and complex societal and technological situations and developments. For example, because of the rising concern with global warming, carbon dioxide absorption of crops is now attracting public attention, which means that new requirements are being proposed for the environmentally friendly production of crops. Third, there are different types of consumers, and their choices between conflicting values differ accordingly. Consumers use different weighing models and various types of information in making their food choices. Changing food chains more in accordance with <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns</b> should at least take into account the multi-interpretable, dynamic, and pluralist features of <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns,</b> for example, in traceability schemes. In discussing usual approaches such as codes, stakeholder analysis, and assurance schemes, I conclude that these traditional approaches can be helpful. However, in cases of dynamic, pluralistic, and uncertain developments, maintaining some pre-existing evaluating scheme or some clear cut normative hierarchy, such as codes or assurance schemes, can be disastrous in undermining new ethical desirable initiatives. Instead of considering ethical standards and targets as fixed, which is done with codes and schemes, it is more fruitful to emphasize the structure of the processes in which ethical weighing of relevant <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns</b> get shaped. The concept of ¿Ethical Room for Maneuver¿ (ERM) is constructed to specify the ethical desirable conditions under which identification and weighing of paramount values and their dilemmas can be processed. The main aims of the ERM are making room in all the links of the food chain for regulating and implementing the relevant <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns</b> by (1) balancing and negotiating, (2) supporting information systems that are relevant and communicative for various consumer groups and (3) organizing consumer involvement in the links of the food chain. The social and political context of agriculture and food production, particularly in Europe, gives ample opportunity for implementing several types of Ethical Rooms for Maneuver. Finally, I discuss several types of Ethical Rooms for Manoeuvre in the food chains that can be communicated by means of specific traceability schemes to less involved stakeholders with the potential consequence that the stakeholders will be motivated to be more involve...|$|R

40|$|Ten {{years after}} the first {{generation}} of genetically engineered (GE) varieties became commercially available, adoption of these varieties by U. S. farmers is widespread for major crops. Driven by farmers' expectations of higher yields, savings in management time, and lower pesticide costs, the adoption of corn, soybean, and cotton GE varieties has increased rapidly. Despite the benefits, however, environmental and <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns</b> may have limited acceptance of GE crops, particularly in Europe. This report focuses on GE crops and their adoption in the United States over the past 10 years. It examines the three major stakeholders of agricultural biotechnology and finds that (1) the pace of R&D activity by producers of GE seed (the seed firms and technology providers) has been rapid, (2) farmers have adopted some GE varieties widely and at a rapid rate and benefited from such adoption, and (3) the level of <b>consumer</b> <b>concerns</b> about foods that contain GE ingredients varies by country, with European <b>consumers</b> being most <b>concerned.</b> Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R

Consumers were worried about the farming practices by which food is produced, processed and the health and safety aspects of certain foods.
