50|$|Asplenium australasicum {{specimens}} {{were taken}} from logged areas, which helped them become popular in horticulture. It adapts readily to cultivation, {{as long as it}} has good drainage. Poor drainage renders it vulnerable to rotting. It can be grown in a tub or barrel. In cultivation it is occasionally attacked by white <b>coconut</b> <b>scale</b> {{on the underside of the}} fronds.|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{commenced}} on {{an intensive}} biological control programme of the <b>coconut</b> <b>scale,</b> Aspidiotus destructor sign, in Sri Lanka. Out {{of the natural}} enemies of the <b>coconut</b> <b>scale</b> recorded, an aphelinid parasite Aphytis chrysomphali Mercet and two coccinellid predators, Chilocorus nigritus F. and Pullus xerampelinus Mulsant {{were found to be}} important, the latter being recorded for the first time from Sri Lanka. Other indigenous predators recorded for the first time are two coccinellids, Chilocorus circumdatus Sch., Pullus sp. ? coccidivora Ayyar and a nitidulid Cebocephalus sp. Ch. nigritus and P. Xerampelinus were attacked byu parasites, Homalotylus flaminius sp. on H. flaminius was also recorded...|$|E
50|$|However, {{the coconut}} {{industry}} {{is faced with}} several threats from cocolisap to the coconut lumber trade. When cocolisap posed a huge threat to the coconut industry, the government had to act swiftly with countermeasures aimed at fighting the <b>coconut</b> <b>scaling</b> insect.|$|R
50|$|In the Island Challenge, Sting {{went first}} with Shya and Michael passing the coconuts. On the first coconut, Claw fired three arrows, {{but all of}} them missed and Sting easily {{delivered}} their first <b>coconut</b> to the <b>scales.</b> On the next few coconuts, Claw's Brandon got a few hits, but Sting were not shaken as they calmly continued. On the fifth coconut, Sting dropped it after an arrow from Claw disrupted them. Claw were soon out of arrows, and Sting quickly hurried as they quietly got more <b>coconuts</b> into the <b>scales.</b> With only a few coconuts need to balance the scales, Michael fell off the wood as he got a coconut from Shya. Then Michael had almost caused a coconut to be null and void as he almost touched the ground when putting the <b>coconut</b> in the <b>scales.</b> Sting then started to feel pressure as Shya and Michael were hurrying too fast and dropped a few more coconuts, but finally tipped the scales. Claw had given three 15-second penalties to Sting, bringing their final time to 6:35. On Claw's turn, Power Captain Abbey along with Brandon were passing the coconuts and Bronte was handing them at the start. On their first coconut, Maddy shot an arrow straight at them, giving them a time penalty. Abbey and Brandon were rather shaky as they passed the coconuts across, but concentrated carefully. Michael from Sting tried to put Claw off by once again, distracting them saying there were bugs on them. Soon, a short distraction from Brandon caused him to drop a coconut, and on the next one he fell off a wood plinth. Then, Abbey stumbled off his plinth and then dropped yet another coconut. Sting used their last two arrows and missed on both times. On their eighth coconut, Brandon was very close to dropping his bamboo shoot but quickly recovered and got it into the scales. As they were so close to tipping the scales, Abbey started to panic, and he and Brandon were rushing so much that Abbey dropped another coconut. On their last coconut needed, Claw rushed quickly and successfully tipped the scales in 6:38, which included one 15 second time penalty from Sting. So, Sting won the Island Challenge by three seconds and won the last Sands of Time.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} know the level of cost, revenue, profit, profitability, efficiency, and risk of <b>coconut</b> sugar business <b>scale</b> home industries in Wonogiri Regency. The basic method {{of this research is}} descriptive analysis method. The research location is Wonogiri Regency, and then Paranggupito subdistrict was selected as the only one area in Wonogiri Regency that having coconut sugar industry and located in Indonesian ocean coastal area. The election of sample locations used the purposive sampling method, then the sample of locations choosen named Gudangharjo, Sambiharjo, Paranggupito, and Gunturharjo village. Amount 40 respondents found and gathered by using the proportional method. The data used in this research are primary and secondary data. The data are collected through an observation, interview and recording. The result of this research shows that total average cost spent by those industrialists in Wonogiri Regency is Rp 34. 120, 02 per day. The average revenue for each of them is Rp 39. 151, 56 and the profit is Rp 5. 031, 55 per day. The business of coconut sugar industry in Wonogiri Regency is profitable business of which profitability value is 14, 75...|$|R

25|$|Most of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making {{irrigation}} and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting {{to less than}} 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, coffee and tropical fruits. Goat, sheep, and camel husbandry is widespread elsewhere {{throughout the rest of}} the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid tropical monsoon climate, in particular the Dhofar and Al Mahrah areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large <b>scale</b> <b>coconut</b> plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical monsoon rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid desert climate or arid steppe climate. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally tropical sea with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in symbiosis with the Red Sea coral, the protozoa and zooxanthellae, have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the indopacific coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the Persian Gulf, mostly caused by phosphate water pollution and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.|$|R

Moore, oil palm, Elaeis guineensis Jacq. and an oil palm hybrid OxG: E. oleifera x E. guineensis (Arecaceae) in continental Colombia, and on coconut from Venezuela. Previously, P. bennetti was known only on the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and San Andres, causing serious damage to coconut, its only known host until now. A brief characterization of P. bennetti and an updated list of 23 species of scale insects of the family Diaspididae reported worldwide on Elaeis spp. is provided...|$|E
