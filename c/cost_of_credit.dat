25|$|On December 19, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> default swaps {{to insure}} the debt of Ford was 68 percent the sum insured for five years in {{addition}} to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8million paid upfront to insure $10million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year. In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt for equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position. These actions yielded Ford a $2.7billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years.|$|E

40|$|Part I of this Article {{provides}} an overview of the importance <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> monitoring and <b>of</b> tort claims related to cybersecurity. It also discusses the duty to protect digital personal information and to disclose breaches of cybersecurity, as well as the reasons why the economic loss rule should not bar claims for the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> monitoring. Part II of this Article discusses the precedent dealing with credit-monitoring damages, related business practices, class-action settlements, and judicial and administrative sanctions. Part III explores the issue of whether credit-monitoring damages are analogous to the medical-monitoring damages that many states award to victims of toxic exposure. Part IV then considers arguments against the compensability of credit-monitoring damages in cybersecurity lawsuits. These include the alleged lack of present injury in cases where the plaintiff has not experienced identity theft and the ability of potential plaintiffs to self-protect against economic harm by purchasing credit-monitoring services. Part V then explains why courts should allow victims of data-security breaches to recover compensation for the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> monitoring. The Article argues that protection from identity theft should be as widespread as commercial use of computerized personal information and that businesses should be required to internalize the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> their negligent data practices. In many instances, businesses are well-situated to efficiently spread identity theft prevention costs among those who benefit from the use of computerized personal information.

The total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> (for either short-term or unsecured loans) is applied here {{to a number of}} loan amounts and loan periods. The total monthly <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is indicated in rands; this rand amount is indicated as a monthly percentage of the initial loan. This monthly percentage gives the most accurate possible indication of the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> in each case.

It is assumed for the purposes of these calculations that the maximum rates of interest and fees are charged, for the reasons explained above. It is also assumed that the total initiation fee is charged to the borrower and capitalised: that is to say, is paid off over the same period as the loan, at the same interest rate (five per cent per month if it is a short-term loan, or 3.3 per cent per month if it is an unsecured loan). If the initiation fee were regarded as a separate loan, it would attract its own initiation and service fees, which would make the initiation fee even more expensive. For the sake of simplicity, interest is not charged on unpaid interest and other fees (although this is permitted by the Act), which would make the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> even more expensive.|$|E
