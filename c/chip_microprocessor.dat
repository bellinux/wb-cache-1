50|$|Federico Faggin (born December 1, 1941), is an Italian physicist, {{inventor}} and entrepreneur, {{widely known}} for designing {{the first commercial}} microprocessor. He led the 4004 (MCS-4) project and the design group during {{the first five years}} of Intel's microprocessor effort. Most importantly, Faggin created in 1968, while working at Fairchild Semiconductor, the self-aligned MOS silicon gate technology (SGT) that made possible dynamic memories, non-volatile memories, CCD image sensors, and the microprocessor. In addition, he further developed at Intel his original SGT into a new methodology for random logic chip design that was essential to the creation of the world’s first single <b>chip</b> <b>microprocessor</b> and all other early Intel microprocessors. He was co-founder, with Ralph Ungermann, and CEO of Zilog, the first company solely dedicated to microprocessors. He was also co-founder and CEO of Cygnet Technologies and of Synaptics.|$|E

50|$|CTC did {{not believe}} it could meet its design goals for the CPU built from {{discrete}} TTL chips, and so Ray and Roche arranged dinner with Bob Noyce, the President of Intel, along with the President of Texas Instruments. Having pre-drawn the schematic for the microprocessor on two postcards, Ray gave one to each of his guests, and then made a bet: that the first company to build a computer on a <b>chip</b> (<b>microprocessor)</b> would forgive Datapoint their outstanding invoice. In part this was fiscally driven, as both supplier debts were large, and the annulment of either would mean that CTC could avoid a second IPO. Noyce initially questioned the approach, suggesting that development of the microprocessor would reduce Intel's sales of their dumb shift registers, but eventually agreed to the deal. The result was {{the development of the}} Intel 8008 microprocessor by Ted Hoff and Stan Mazor of Intel with IBM's Chief Scientist Larry Potter.|$|E
5000|$|Faggin, {{the sole}} chip {{designer}} among the engineers on the MCS-4 project, {{was the only}} one with experience in metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) random logic and circuit design. He also had the crucial knowledge of the new silicon gate process technology with self-aligned gates, which he had created at Fairchild in 1968. At Fairchild in 1968, Faggin also designed and manufactured the world's first commercial IC using SGT, the Fairchild 3708 [...] that was featured on the cover of Electronics (Sept. 29, 1969). As soon as he joined the Intel MOS Department he created a new random logic design methodology based on silicon gate, and contributed many technology and circuit design inventions that enabled their single <b>chip</b> <b>microprocessor</b> to become a reality. His methodology set the design style for all the early Intel microprocessors and later for the Zilog Z80. He also led the MCS-4 project and was responsible for its successful outcome (1970-1971). Marcian [...] "Ted" [...] Hoff, head of the Application Research Department, contributed the architectural proposal for Busicom working with Stanley Mazor in 1969, then he moved on to other projects. When asked where he got the ideas for the architecture of the first microprocessor, Hoff related that Plessey, [...] "a British tractor company", had donated a minicomputer to Stanford, and he had [...] "played with it some" [...] while he was there. Shima designed the Busicom calculator firmware and assisted Faggin during {{the first six months of}} the implementation. The manager of Intel's MOS Design Department was Leslie L. Vadász. At the time of the MCS-4 development, Vadasz's attention was completely focused on the mainstream business of semiconductor memories and he left the leadership and the management of the MCS-4 project to Faggin.|$|E

40|$|The {{trend in}} {{high-performance}} microprocessor design is toward increasing computational {{power on the}} <b>chip.</b> <b>Microprocessors</b> can now process dramatically more data per machine cycle than previous models. Unfortunately, memory speeds have not kept pace. The result is an imbalance between computation speed and memory speed. This imbalance is leading machine designers to use more complicated memory hierarchies. In turn, programmers are explicitly restructuring codes to perform well on particular memory systems, leading to machine-specific programs. It is our belief that machine-specific programming {{is a step in}} the wrong direction. Compilers, not programmers, should handle machine-specific implementation details.
