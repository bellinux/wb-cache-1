40|$|Abstract. Very {{recently}} a new inversion method has been developped {{to analyze the}} intergalactic medium seen in absorption in quasar spectra (the so-called Lymanα forest). This method is applied to recover {{the temperature of the}} gas and the underlying density field. Using constraints from the Lyman-β forest, it is possible to recover this field up to over-densities δ ∼ 10. By inverting the H <b>i</b> and <b>C</b> iv absorptions together {{it has been shown that}} the <b>C</b> iv/H <b>i</b> <b>ratio</b> varies through the profile of strong lines, beeing larger in the wings. The method can be applied to reconstruct the 3 D density field from multiple lines of sight and is shown to give good results up to mean separations of 3 arcmin. Results from a survey of QSO pairs performed with HST/STIS and VLT/UVES-FORS are summarized. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim Combined {{hepatocellular}} cholangiocarcinoma (combined tumor) {{has been}} described as either a variant of hepatoma or a variant of cholangiocarcinoma. Prior studies evaluated fewer than 50 patients with combined tumors, precluding multivariate analyses. Posited was the notion that analysis of a large database would yield more definite answers. Methods This study used SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute) to analyze 282 combined tumors, 2, 035 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and 19, 336 hepatomas between the years 1973 - 2003. Multinomial logit regression calculated point estimates and 95 % confidence intervals (<b>c.</b> <b>i.)</b> for relative risk (rr). Cox regression calculated point estimates and 95 % confidence intervals (<b>c.</b> <b>i.)</b> for hazard <b>ratios</b> (ĥ). Results Men less often had cholangiocarcinomas than they had combined tumors (rr = 0. 63, <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> = 0. 49 - 0. 81). Hepatomas less often than combined tumors presented with distant spread (rr = 0. 56, <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> = 0. 43 - 0. 72). Men (rr = 1. 50, <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> = 1. 17 - 1. 93) and patients with a known Asian or Pacific birthplace (rr = 2. 36, <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> = 1. 56 - 3. 56) more often had hepatomas than they had combined tumors. Among patients not known to have an Asian/Pacific birthplace, a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (ĥ = 0. 72, <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> = 0. 63 - 0. 82) or hepatoma (ĥ = 0. 75, <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> = 0. 66 - 0. 86) provided a better prognosis than did a diagnosis of combined tumor. Conclusion Combined tumors differ from hepatomas and cholangiocarcinomas in terms of distribution and survival patterns in the population; they should be considered neither cholangiocarcinomas nor hepatomas...|$|R

Additional denaturation is achieved by combined solution, which contains 1. 2 g of picric acid in 30 % solution of glacial acetic acid. By chloramine B application as blocking agent in form of 1 % DMSO solution the dye's affinity for eviromental tissue is decreased.

40|$|Abridged) We have {{discovered}} a strong DLA coincident in redshift with the faint QSO Q 2343 -BX 415 (R = 20. 2, z_em = 2. 57393). Follow-up observations at intermediate spectral resolution reveal that the metal lines associated with this 'proximate' DLA consist of two sets of absorption components. One set is moving towards the quasar with velocities of ~ 150 - 600 km/s; this gas is highly ionized and does not fully cover the continuum source, suggesting that it is physically close to the active nucleus. The other, which accounts {{for most of the}} neutral gas, is blueshifted relative to the QSO, with the strongest component at ~ - 160 km/s. We consider the possibility that the PDLA arises in the outflowing interstellar medium of the host galaxy of Q 2343 -BX 415, an interpretation supported by strong C IV and N V absorption at nearby velocities, and by the intense radiation field longward of the Lyman limit implied by the high <b>C</b> II*/H <b>I</b> <b>ratio.</b> If Q 2343 -BX 415 is the main source of these UV photons, then the PDLA is located at either ~ 8 or ~ 37 kpc from the active nucleus.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Due to the patients’ growing {{interest}} {{in the use of}} dental implants, medical staff should be completely aware of treatment success and prognostic factors to prevent failures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of different crown to implant <b>ratio</b> (<b>C</b> / <b>I</b> <b>Ratio)</b> in the posterior areas of the maxilla and mandible as one of the most important principles of biomechanics on marginal bone loss around the implant neck (MBL). Material & Methods: This study was conducted as a prospective cohort study. In this study, patients treated at a private dental implants office during the years 2013 - 2014 were selected. Parallel digital radiographs 6 months and 12 months after loading the implants were measured to evaluate the effects of prosthetic implants on posterior areas of the maxillary and mandibular crowns by a digital caliper. All patients were evaluated radiographically and data were collected and analyzed by SPSS 16 with non parametrical tests. Results: A total of 48 fixtures of SIC Implant System in 18 patients, including 28 pcs in maxilla and 20 pcs in mandible were evaluated. Statistical analysis of marginal bone level around the implant neck in radiograpy taken showed no significant difference in the effect of different C/I Ratio of marginal bone loss around implants (P= 0. 094). Comparison of posterior areas of the maxilla and mandible also showed no difference between the effects of different amounts of C/I Ratio of the marginal bone. Conclusion: The present study showed that the marginal bone loss was not statistically significant after the placement of implants in the posterior region of the jaw with a different range of crown – to- implant ratio from 0. 87 to 2. 55. Thus, it seems that there is no relationship between marginal bone loss around the implant neck with different proportions of crown - implant and with the location of the treatment (P> 0. 05).

The potentiometric titration experiment is used to investigate acid-base properties of the sediment surface with a constant capacitance surface complexation model. The parameters controlling the sorption such as solution pH and ion strength, as well as the influence of organic carbon and Ca 2 + ion on the adsorption, are evaluated. It is shown that the titration data can be successfully described by the surface protonation and deprotonation model with the least-squares FITEQL program 2. 0. The sorption isotherm data are fitted to the Freundlich equation in a nonlinear form (1 /n = 0. 3 - 0. 9) for all tested dyes. With increasing pH value, the sorption of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Mordant Black 11 and <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Direct Blue 86 on the sediment decreases, while for <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Basic Yellow X- 5 GL and <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Basic Red 13, the extent of sorption slightly increases.

40|$|Wiebe's criterion, which recognizes {{complete}} intersections of dimension zero {{among the}} class of noetherian local rings, is revisited and exploited {{in order to provide}} information on what we call <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideals (those such that the corresponding quotient is a complete intersection of dimension zero) and also on chains of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideals. A correspondence is established between <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideals and a certain kind of matrices which we call x-nice, and a chain of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideals corresponds to a factorization of some x-nice matrix. When the local ring A itself is a complete intersection of dimension zero, a <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideal is necessarily of the form (0 :bA) for some b∈ A. Some criteria are provided to recognize whether an ideal (0 :bA) is <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 or not. When y is a minimal generator of the maximal ideal of A, it is also proved that the ideals yA and (0 :yA) are <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 simultaneously and that this is the case exactly when the ideal (0 :yA) is principal. These <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideals of the form (0 :yA), y being a minimal generator of the maximal ideal, are investigated. They are of interest because the smallest nonnull <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideal in a strict chain of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideals of the maximal length is necessarily of that form, and their existence has some implications for a realization of the ring, i. e. for the way the ring can {{can be viewed as a}} quotient of a regular local ring.

All {{the samples were}} irradiated with 2 MeV fast electrons. Radiation-produced defects are studied using infrared spectroscopy by monitoring the relevant bands in optical spectra. For the VO defects, it is established that the doping with Ge affects the thermal stability of VO (830 cm - 1) defects {{as well as their}} fraction converted to VO 2 (888 cm - 1) defects. In Ge-free samples containing carbon, it was found that carbon impurity atoms do not affect the thermal stability of VO defects, although they affect the fraction of VO defects that is converted to VO 2 complexes. Considering the oxygen-carbon complexes, it is established that the annealing of the 862 cm - 1 band associated with the <b>C</b> <b>i</b> O i defects is accompanied with the emergence of the 1048 cm - 1 band, which has earlier been assigned to the C s O 2 i center. The evolution of the <b>C</b> <b>i</b> O i I bands is also traced. Ge doping does not seem to affect the thermal stability of the <b>C</b> <b>i</b> O <b>i</b> and <b>C</b> <b>i</b> O i I defects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the stability of the defect clusters (VO, <b>C</b> <b>i</b> O <b>i,</b> <b>C</b> <b>i</b> O i I) at an atomic level. Both experimental and theoretical results are consistent with the viewpoint that Ge affects the stability of the VO but does not influence the stability of the oxygen-carbon clusters. DFT calculations demonstrate that C attracts both O i and VO pairs predominately forming next nearest neighbor clusters in contrast to Ge where the interactions with O i and VO are more energetically favorable at nearest neighbor configurations...|$|R
