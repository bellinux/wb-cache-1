40|$|The {{work which}} is here {{reported}} was undertaken {{in part as}} an extension of our previous observations on the behavior of pox viruses in the respiratory tract (1, 2) and in part {{to determine whether or not}} fowl pox virus was capable of simulating the clinical syndrome of chickens referred to as roup. Roup, which is also known by a variety of names as infectious catarrh, infectious rhinitis, and fowl coryza, is defined as a communicable disease of natural occurrence in chickens characterized by nasal and ocular inflammation which may or may not be accompanied by an outward discharge. Even before the etiology of roup was established a number of investigators, Haring and Kofoid (3), Beach (4), Doyle and Minett (5), were agreed that it was a distinct entity and unrelated to fowl pox. Their evidence was incomplete but was nevertheless significant since reciprocal protection was not demonstrable. We began an investigation of the syndrome in 1932 shortly after De Blieck (6) had shown that the influenza-like bacterium now known as Hemophilus gallinarum was of etiological significance. His work and ours (7 - 9), which led to the recognition of three clinical types of the disease, were likewise in agreement with these conclusions and afforded ample evidence that roup may. occur naturally and be reproduced experimentally in the absence of fowl pox. Much of the earlier work was concerned with the skin inoculation of normal birds with nasal exudates from naturally infected <b>chickens,</b> fowl <b>pox</b> virus not infrequently being demonstrable. The actual nasal instillation of virus suspensions or of exudates was only occasionally undertaken, with scant reference to the results even though an ocular-nasal form of fowl pox was recognized.

25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like <b>chicken</b> <b>pox</b> as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E

500|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} {{caused by}} environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. Enamel hypoplasia {{is a condition}} in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate. This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency {{than the rest of the}} tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors, an exanthematous disease (<b>chicken</b> <b>pox,</b> congenital syphilis), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, dental fluorosis, birth injury, preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth. [...] Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis. Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad. Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy.|$|E
