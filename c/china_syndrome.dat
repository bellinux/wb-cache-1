5|$|Fonda {{made her}} Broadway {{debut in the}} 1960 play There Was a Little Girl, for which she {{received}} {{the first of two}} Tony Award nominations, and made her screen debut later the same year in Tall Story. She rose to fame in 1960s films such as Period of Adjustment (1962), Sunday in New York (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), Barefoot in the Park (1967) and Barbarella (1968). Her first husband was Barbarella director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for They Shoot Horses, Don't They (1969) and went on to win two Best Actress Oscars in the 1970s for Klute (1971) and Coming Home (1978). Her other nominations were for Julia (1977), The <b>China</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (1979), On Golden Pond (1981) and The Morning After (1986). Her other major competitive awards include an Emmy Award for the 1984 TV film The Dollmaker, two BAFTA Awards for Julia and The <b>China</b> <b>Syndrome</b> and four Golden Globe Awards.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after {{fracturing}} her foot while filming The <b>China</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> {{she was no}} longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The Leni Workout became the Jane Fonda Workout, which began a second career for her, continuing for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled Jane Fonda's Workout, inspired by her best-selling book, Jane Fonda's Workout Book. Jane Fonda's Workout became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series. She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the book}} Who Killed Karen Silkwood, the {{assassination}} scene in the movie The <b>China</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> in which the character Hector's car is run off the road, {{is based on a}} theorized version of Silkwood's death. In the film, the power plant's agents come up behind Hector's vehicle and ram him, repeatedly, from behind until a device on their front bumper engages his rear bumper and lets them lift the rear end of his vehicle off the road, thereby pushing his car over a cliff. Subsequently, police officers remove the evidence from his vehicle and hand it to the villains because their company's name is on the documents. This could be construed as an attempt by the film's producers to influence the jury in the Silkwood case. According {{to the book}}, it was for this reason that the jury was forbidden from seeing that then-new movie while they were hearing the case and deliberating.|$|E

40|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MetS) is {{a significant}} health care problem worldwide and is characterized by increased fasting glucose and obesity. Resistin is a protein hormone produced both by adipocytes and immunocompetent cells, including those residing in adipose tissue, and is believed to modulate glucose tolerance and insulin action. This study examined the association of resistin gene polymorphisms, rs 1862513 and rs 3745368, and related haplotypes {{with the development of}} metabolic syndrome in a Han Chinese population. This case-control study was performed on 3792 subjects, including 1771 MetS cases and 2021 healthy controls from the Jilin province of <b>China.</b> Metabolic <b>syndrome</b> was defined according to the criteria of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the relationship between gene polymorphism and MetS. Our results showed that there were no significant associations between MetS and the genotype distributions in four kinds of inheritance models, allele frequencies, and related haplotypes of resistin gene polymorphisms rs 1862513 and rs 3745368 (all p values[*]>[*] 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background Pathologic studies play an {{important}} role in evaluating patients with Alport syndrome besides genotyping. Difficulties still exist in diagnosing Alport syndrome (AS), and misdiagnosis is a not-so-rare event, even in adult patient evaluated with renal biopsy. Methods We used nested case–control study to investigate 52 patients previously misdiagnosed and 52 patients initially diagnosed in the <b>China</b> Alport <b>Syndrome</b> Treatments and Outcomes Registry e-system. Results We found mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN, 26. 9 %) and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS, 19. 2 %) were the most common misdiagnosis. FSGS was the most frequent misdiagnosis in female X-linked AS (fXLAS) patients (34. 8 %), and MsPGN in male X-linked AS (mXLAS) patients (41. 2 %). Previous misdiagnosed mXLAS patients (13 / 17, 76. 5 %) and autosomal recessive AS (ARAS) patients (8 / 12, 66. 7 %) were corrected after a second renal biopsy. While misdiagnosed fXLAS patients (18 / 23, 78. 3 %) were corrected after a family member diagnosed (34. 8 %) or after rechecking electronic microscopy and/or collagen-IV alpha-chains immunofluresence study (COL-IF) (43. 5 %) during follow-up. With COL-IF as an additional criterion for AS diagnosis, we found that patients with less than 3 criteria reached have increased risk of misdiagnosis (3. 29 -fold for all misdiagnosed AS patients and 3. 90 -fold for fXLAS patients). Conclusion We emphasize timely and careful study of electronic microscopy and COL-IF in pathologic evaluation of AS patients. With renal and/or skin COL-IF as additional criterion, 3 diagnosis criteria reached are the cutoff for diagnosing AS pathologically. </p...|$|R

It is clinically characterized by abdominal pain, fever, as well as obstructive jaundice. During cholecystectomy, MS {{is seen as a}} dangerous adherent and inflammatory tissue in the area of Calot’s triangle. In the general population, aberrant right posterior hepatic duct, one of the causes of bile duct injury during duct surgery, is present in 4. 8 %– 8. 4 % of people. Herein we report a rare case of a 76 -year-old female patient, with hepatolithiasis of right posterior lobe and cholecysto-aberrant right posterior hepatic duct fistula. This is a special type of MS; however, interestingly, she did not have any symptoms, and the disease was found by physical examination incidentally. This case highlights another situation, namely, there may be difficulty in diagnosing MS and dissecting for operation.

40|$|Objective: To screen common {{traditional}} Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome {{factors of}} {{chronic renal failure}} (CRF) via questionnaire investigation among experts. Methods: A questionnaire was developed {{based on the results}} of our previous researches. The investigation was carried out with the questionnaire among experts who are engaged in clinical research and treatment of nephrosis with the title of chief or associate chief physician from 15 hospitals in <b>China.</b> Common TCM <b>syndrome</b> factors of CRF were obtained based on the data analysis of the mean value on general evaluation, cumulative percentage and coefficient of variation. Results: A total of 114 sets of the questionnaire were sent out and all of them were returned back, 113 of which were effective. The recovery rate was 100 %. The TCM syndrome factors were regarded as common factors of CRF syndrome if the cumulative percentage was more than or equal to 60 % and the coefficient of variation was less than or equal to 0. 35. The syndrome factors related to the disease location were the kidney, spleen, stomach, heart, and lung; the syndrome factors related to the disease type were dampness, turbid toxin, blood stasis, water retention, and phlegm which belong to excess type, and qi deficiency, yin deficiency, yang deficiency, blood deficiency, and essence deficiency which belong to deficiency type. Conclusion: The common TCM syndrome factors of CRF were obtained from the representative experts through the questionnaire investigation among the experts. The results enable us to have a deeper understanding of the disease in view of TCM compared with the previous literature data and may contribute to the establishment of TCM syndrome diagnosis criteria of the disease in the future...|$|R
40|$|The Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) {{syndrome}} {{has been}} a known clinical entity for over fifty years. In 1967 Durrer et al postulated WPW syndrome was due to an accessory pathway, bypassing the AV node, from the atria to the ventricles 1. This was later confirmed by epicardial mapping. WPW {{is the second most}} common cause of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias in the western world and the most common cause in <b>China</b> 2. WPW <b>syndrome</b> has a prevalence of 1. 5 to 3. 1 per 1000 persons in western countries 3, 4, 5. Patients with the WPW syndrome may present with palpitations, presyncope, syncope, or sudden cardiac death (SCD). In some patients the first and only manifestation of the disease is SCD. This is more likely to occur in the setting of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrocardiographic findings of WPW syndrome consist of preexcitation manifested by a shortened PR interval (100 msec) a delta wave (abnormal initial QRS vector) and supraventricular tachycardia. The EKG finding of preexcitation is a result of early ventricular depolarization through the accessory pathway. SVT can occur with retrograde or antigrade conduction through the accessory pathway forming the basis of the so-called “macro-reentrant” arrhythmia model 6. Rapid conduction through the accessory pathway in the setting of atrial fibrillation markedly increases the risk of SCD 7. We recently identified the gene responsible for familial Wolff-Parkinson-White 8. The gene (PRKAG 2) which encodes for a protein AMPK (AMP- activated protein kinase) was identified as the causal gene. Missense (single nucleotide change) mutations in this gene were identified in families with WPW. Six such mutations have been identified. Along with preexcitation the affected families had conduction abnormalities (AV block) and cardiac hypertrophy...|$|R

They are differentiated based on the fraction of the body surface area affected. Optimal therapy for SJS and TEN is a controversial issue. Objective: We compared the treatments given to and the clinical outcomes of 39 cases of SJS and 48 cases of TEN seen at a single institution between January 2007 and December 2013 for {{better understanding of the}} clinical characteristics and development of the two conditions. Methods: Demographic data, clinical characteristics, treatments given, and therapeutic responses observed were retrospectively collected. Results: The incidence rates of hypoproteinemia and secondary infections are significantly higher in TEN than in SJS (P= 0. 001 and P= 0. 002, respectively). The corticosteroid dose did not influence the time from the initiation of therapy to control of the lesions in SJS, but increasing the dosage of corticosteroids progressively decreased the time from the initiation of therapy to control of the lesions in TEN. With increases in the utilization ratio of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), the length of the hospital stay became shorter, whereas the time from the initiation of therapy to control of the lesions remained the same in SJS. However, for TEN, both the length of the hospital stay and the time from the initiation of therapy to control of the lesions became shorter with increases in the utilization ratio of IVIG. Conclusion: SJS and TEN are two variants of the same spectrum, and they differ from each other not only in the severity of epidermal detachment but also in other clinical parameters and their distinct clinical courses. Thus, differential treatment of both conditions may have benefits for their prognosis.
