40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to analyze the special class of {{turbulent}} premixed flames that we call intermediate steady propagation (ISP) flames. These flames are common to industrial premixed combustion chambers which operate at intensive turbulence when velocity pulsations are {{significantly higher than the}} flamelet combustion velocity. They are characterized by a practically constant turbulent combustion velocity, controlled by turbulence, chemistry and molecular processes, and by an increasing flame width, controlled mainly by turbulent diffusion. The main content of this work is a description of physical backgrounds and outcome of the original asymptotical (i. e., valid at high Re and Da numbers) premixed combustion model, that, from a methodological point of view, is close to Kolmogorov analysis of developed turbulence at high Re numbers. Our analysis starts from the thickened and strongly wrinkled flamelets combustion mechanism. Quantitative results for this model are based on the Kolmogorov assumption of the equilibrium fine-scale turbulence and on additional assumption of the universal small-scale structure of the wrinkled flamelet sheet. From this background it is possible to deduce formulas for the thickened flamelets parameters and the flamelet sheet area and hence the turbulent combustion velocity of the premixed flame. These formulas are used for the closure of the <b>combustion</b> <b>equation</b> written in terms of a progress variable leading to the so called turbulent flame closure (TFC) model for the numerical simulation of ISP flames.

We use an ecosystem <b>combustion</b> <b>equation</b> developed with the physical chemistry of atmospheric variables to estimate and simulate fire probability and mean fire interval (MFI). The calibration of ecosystem fire probability with basic combustion chemistry and physics offers a quantitative method to address wildland fire in addition to the well-studied forcing factors such as topography, ignition, and vegetation. We develop a graphic analysis tool for estimating climate forced fire probability with temperature and precipitation based on an empirical assessment of combustion theory and fire prediction in ecosystems. Climate-affected fire probability for any period, past or future, is estimated with given temperature and precipitation. A graphic analyses of wildland fire dynamics driven by climate supports a dialectic in hydrologic processes that affect ecosystem combustion: 1) the water needed by plants to produce carbon bonds (fuel) and 2) the inhibition of successful reactant collisions by water molecules (humidity and fuel moisture). These two postulates enable a classification scheme for ecosystems into three or more climate categories using their position relative to change points defined by precipitation in combustion dynamics equations.

In other words the combustion rates enter in the <b>combustion</b> <b>equation</b> through a physical model similar to the molecular dissipation in the Kolmogorov "k - ε" turbulence model. The concrete analyzed premixed combustion problem refers to the case of strong turbulence and flames with increasing brush width (this combustion regime is preceded to the traditional stationary flames). Two main equilibrium states are assumed for quantitative description of this coupling: equilibrium fine-scale turbulence, which controls thickened flamelet parameters and equilibrium small-scale structure of strongly wrinkled amelet sheet that controls the flamelet area. We examined integral turbulent ame speed Ut and the local combustion rates across the flame ρW. It has been shown that at the same Ut, the possibility of accurate prediction of the ρW distribution is closely connected with the possibility to describe the counter-gradient transport phenomenon. Finally we generalize the premixed combustion model equation in terms of the progress variable to the general case of partially premixed combustion. These more general equations are in terms of PDF of a passive concentration and a conditional progress variable, the transport terms are controlled only by physical gradient diffusion, equations contain only the dissipation of the passive concentration. At equilibrium products (fast chemistry) the coupling between chemistry and turbulence is described similar to the premixed case by a model source term.

Two cases are considered, a single-mode vortex array and a multimode combination of vortices obeying the Kolmogorov spectrum. It is shown that the velocity of flame propagation depends strongly on the vortex intensity and size. The dependence on the vortex intensity is almost linear in agreement with the general belief. The dependence on the vortex size may be imitated by a power law (proportional to D- 2 / 3. This result is different from theoretical predictions, which creates a challenge for the theory. In the case of the Kolmogorov spectrum of vortices, the velocity of flame propagation is noticeably smaller than for a single-mode vortex array. The flame velocity depends weakly on the thermal expansion of burning matter within the domain of realistically large expansion factors. Comparison to the experimental data indicates that small-scale turbulence is not the only effect that influences the flame velocity in the experimental flows. Large-scale processes, such as the Darrieus-Landau instability and flame-wall interaction, contribute considerably to the velocity of flame propagation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to explore the contributions of cement industry to global warming with special reference to the flourishing and rapidly growing Cement industry in Sudan. International agreements were discussed and mathematical models for the representation of climate change were developed. As a case study, emissions of Carbon dioxide from Atbara cement factory were calculated and analyzed through collection of the necessary information on the productivity of the factory, fuel types and the properties of raw materials used in cement production. Molecular weights, used carbon fuel <b>combustion</b> <b>equations</b> and calcinations processes were utilized in the calculation of CO 2 emissions. The second method has been used for recalculation with the assumption of pre-heaters addition and the utilization of fuel alternatives. The results obtained revealed that, using natural gas, five stage preheaters and raw materials with low organic subestances contributes the best to the positive performance. The study recommended continuing dissemination of global warming and climate change culture and information to different concerned parties. To reduce the influence and contribution of cement industry to global warming, it is recommended to add a pre-heater to kilns, use natural gas as an alternative fuel instead of furnace, develop alternative cement to replace the costly and pollutant Portland cement. It is also recommended to look for ways and means to minimize carbon dioxide emission or through absorption and use of absolute ethanol or blend thereof...|$|R
