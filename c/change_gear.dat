25|$|The dive boat {{provides}} a means of transport to and from dive sites which may be too far or inconvenient for shore access. This {{is the case with}} the majority of recreational dive sites. It can also provide a base of operations where the divers can shelter, rest, store and <b>change</b> <b>gear,</b> socialise with other divers, eat and sleep between dives. They can provide enhanced safety, comfort and convenience, and provide guided access to sites of particular interest. They can also provide access to diving procedures which may be difficult, dangerous or impossible from the shore.|$|E
25|$|A {{transition}} area {{is set up}} where the athletes <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> for different segments of the race. This is where the switches from swimming to cycling and cycling to running occur. These areas are used to store bicycles, performance apparel, and any other accessories needed for {{the next stage of}} the race. The transition from swim to bike is referred to as T1 and that between the bike and run is referred to as T2. The athlete's overall time for the race includes time spent in T1 and T2. Transition areas vary in size depending on the number of participants expected. In addition, these areas provide a social headquarters before the race.|$|E
25|$|Bottas {{entered the}} pit lane on lap eleven with Vettel, Alonso and Ricciardo doing {{likewise}} {{on the next}} lap. After Kvyat made his stop, he rejoined behind Rosberg but overtook him shortly after. Hamilton made his pit stop from the lead on lap 14, and emerged back in first, narrowly ahead of Button. Rosberg was informed over the radio {{that he could not}} go beyond 6,500 revolutions per minute in first gear because his pit lane limiter was faulty. He drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 14 and purposely stalled his car as his tyres and steering wheel were changed. Mechanics switched his car off and Rosberg selected multiple buttons on his steering wheel in an attempt to <b>change</b> <b>gear.</b> After being stationary for nearly two minutes, Rosberg's car was pushed back into his garage and retired. Massa overtook Pérez for sixth place on the 15th lap, and Vergne was handed a five-second stop-and-go penalty on the next lap after being judged to have exceeded track limits. Gutiérrez drove into his garage to retire with an engine electrical problem on lap 19. Chilton was forced into making an unscheduled pit stop two laps later after his front-right tyre was punctured because of a valve problem on the wheel.|$|E

60|$|We {{have all}} gone quiet again. So {{at last he}} climbs back and takes his seat with the driver once more. The road is still straight, {{swinging}} on through the moorland strip by the sea. And he leans to the silent, nerve-tense Mr. Rochester, pleading again. And at length Mr. Rochester edges aside, and lets him take the driving wheel. And so now {{we are all in}} the hands of our friend the bus-mate. He drives--not very well. It is evident he is learning. The bus can't quite keep in the grooves of this wild bare road. And he shuts off when we slip down a hill--and there is a great muddle on the upslope when he tries to <b>change</b> <b>gear.</b> But Mr. Rochester sits squeezed and silently attentive in his corner. He puts out his hand and swings the levers. There is no fear that he will let anything go wrong. I would trust him to drive me down the bottomless pit and up the other side. But still the beseeching mate holds the steering wheel. And on we rush, rather uncertainly and hesitatingly now. And thus we come to the bottom of a hill where the road gives a sudden curve. My heart rises an inch in my breast. I know he can't do it. And he can't, oh Lord--but the quiet hand of the freckled Rochester takes the wheel, we swerve on. And the bus-mate gives up, and the nerve-silent driver resumes control.|$|E

50|$|Maudslay did not {{invent the}} slide-rest (as others such as James Nasmyth have claimed), {{and may not}} have been the first to combine a lead screw, slide-rest, and set of <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> all on one lathe (Jesse Ramsden may have done that in 1775; {{evidence}} is scant), but he did introduce the three-part combination of lead screw, slide rest, and <b>change</b> <b>gears,</b> sparking a great advance in machine tools and in the engineering use of screw threads.|$|R
5000|$|Gear change: The <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> in MMT is noticeable, {{unlike in}} a full {{automatic}} car. Under E gear, the car will automatically <b>change</b> the <b>gear</b> depending on speed and gradient information. It is recommended that the accelerator pedal should be momentarily lifted off during <b>gear</b> <b>change.</b> A constant throttle can also be maintained on the accelerator, and <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> can still occur, although the car will feel noticeably more jerky during <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> than {{in a full}} automatic.|$|R

50|$|Combo Racer is a Sidecar {{video game}} {{developed}} by Imagetic Design {{and published by}} Gremlin Graphics in 1990. The game uses an isometric view and the player has to <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> manually. It contains a training mode, a normal game mode and a track editor.|$|E

25|$|The {{coordination}} of various machine elements including leadscrew, slide rest, and <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> was the technological advance {{that allowed the}} invention of the screw-cutting lathe, which was the origin of single-point threading as we know it today.|$|R
5000|$|A crash gearbox, {{also known}} as a crash box, is a {{transmission}} type used in old cars, trucks, and other automotive vehicles. It is more properly called a [...] "sliding mesh" [...] gearbox and has the nickname [...] "crash" [...] because it is difficult to <b>change</b> <b>gears,</b> so <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> are often accompanied by loud noises. The etymology of [...] "crash" [...] is probably [...] "clash".|$|R
50|$|Fully synchronous, hydrau-pneumatic {{systems are}} {{designed}} to <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> based on engine performance and other velocity indicators, delivering torque to drive wheels. These transmissions have synchronizing mechanisms (called cone and collar synchronizers) that {{are designed to}} keep gear dog-teeth from being broken off.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the Wilson, these {{clutches}} {{were controlled}} by a simple dashboard or column-mounted switch, described as [...] "a cherry on a cocktail stick", and relays.

As we topped the arch we saw a Foresters' band with banners marching down the street.|$|R
50|$|The central {{position}} of the handbrake and ball <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> lever revealed the gearbox's US origin. It also made for easy entry through the driver's door and no cold steel up a driver's leg. The petrol tank was in the scuttle and its filler was above the gear lever in {{the centre of the}} dashboard.|$|E
50|$|The {{motorcycle}} sequential gearchange is retained {{and operated}} via a gear shift inside {{the cockpit and}} requires a forward or backward movement to <b>change</b> <b>gear.</b> The brake, accelerator and clutch operate as per a car and are adjustable for reach to accommodate drivers of different size. The seat and steering wheel are fixed in position.|$|E
50|$|It was a {{good idea}} but it created {{problems}} in practice. If the mechanical stock was at the back, the driver might forget to <b>change</b> <b>gear,</b> and this could lead to gearbox damage. In 1969 (after a serious accident in 1968) the Class 127s were re-labelled with the (then disused) Red Triangle coupling code, and mixed running was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Francis' {{career at}} Paramount <b>changed</b> <b>gears</b> when Warner Bros. promised her star status {{at a better}} salary.

After Francis' career skyrocketed at Warner Bros., she would return to Paramount for Ernst Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise (1932).|$|R
5000|$|For manual {{transmission}} equipped cars, it is a component that replaces the stock gear selector (shifter). A shift kit usually shortens the throws of selecting a gear (also {{known as a}} short throw shift), therefore allowing a driver to reduce the shift time and <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> more efficiently.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{was invented}} in 1927 by Tullio Campagnolo, an Italian bicycle racer. He was frustrated when he attempted to <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> during a race. At the time there was but one cog {{on each side of}} the rear hub, so <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> necessitated stopping, removing the rear wheel, rotating it horizontally so that the opposite cog is engaged by the chain, and finally reinstalling the wheel. The weather had turned cold, and his hands were numb, so he could not operate the wingnuts which retained the wheel. He had been well-placed prior to the <b>gear</b> <b>change,</b> but lost valuable time. This prompted him to develop the quick release.|$|R
