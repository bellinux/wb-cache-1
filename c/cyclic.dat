5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. <b>cyclic</b> neutropenia and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} infection. In <b>cyclic</b> neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration occurs during periods of severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents the cycle of ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E

5|$|The first acyclic {{persistent}} carbene {{was reported}} in 1996, thus showing that a <b>cyclic</b> backbone was not necessary for their stability. Unlike the <b>cyclic</b> derivatives, the acyclic carbenes are flexible with respect to rotation of the bonds to the carbenic atom. By measuring the barrier to rotation of these bonds, {{the extent of their}} double bond character could be measured, and the ylidic nature of this carbene could be determined. Like the <b>cyclic</b> diaminocarbenes, unhindered variants tend to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} table {{gives an}} idea of the complexity of the higher homotopy groups even for spheres of dimension 8 or less. In this table, the entries are either the trivial group 0, the infinite <b>cyclic</b> group Z, finite <b>cyclic</b> groups of order n (written as Zn), or direct products of such groups (written, for example, as Z24times&Z3 or Z22 = Z2times&Z2). Extended tables of homotopy groups of spheres are given {{at the end of the}} article.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the entry}} is an integer, m, the {{homotopy}} {{group is the}} <b>cyclic</b> group of that order (generally written Zm).|$|E
5|$|Where {{the entry}} is ∞, the {{homotopy}} {{group is the}} infinite <b>cyclic</b> group, Z.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{examples}} of protein pairs related by a circular permutation were subsequently discovered in nature or produced in the laboratory. As of February 2012, the Circular Permutation Database contains 2,238 circularly permuted protein pairs with known structures, and many more are known without structures. The CyBase database collects proteins that are <b>cyclic,</b> {{some of which are}} permuted variants of <b>cyclic</b> wild-type proteins. SISYPHUS is a database that contains a collection of hand-curated manual alignments of proteins with non-trivial relationships, several of which have circular permutations.|$|E
5|$|In <b>cyclic</b> neutropenia, {{there is}} a {{reduction}} in the level of circulating neutrophils in the blood that occurs about every 21 days. Opportunistic infections commonly occur and aphthous-like ulceration is worst during this time.|$|E
25|$|A {{group is}} called {{virtually}} <b>cyclic</b> if {{it contains a}} <b>cyclic</b> subgroup of finite index (the number of cosets that the subgroup has). In other words, any element in a virtually <b>cyclic</b> group can be arrived at by applying {{a member of the}} <b>cyclic</b> subgroup to a member in a certain finite set. Every <b>cyclic</b> group is virtually <b>cyclic,</b> as is every finite group. An infinite group is virtually <b>cyclic</b> if and only if it is finitely generated and has exactly two ends; an example of such a group is the product of Z/(n) and Z, in which the factor Z has finite indexn. Every abelian subgroup of a Gromov hyperbolic group is virtually <b>cyclic.</b>|$|E

25|$|A <b>cyclic</b> polygon is any convex polygon {{about which}} a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied {{example is the}} <b>cyclic</b> quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every {{triangle}} is a <b>cyclic</b> polygon. A polygon that is both <b>cyclic</b> and tangential is called a bicentric polygon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclic</b> nucleotide-gated channels: This {{superfamily}} {{of channels}} contains two families: the <b>cyclic</b> nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels and the hyperpolarization-activated, <b>cyclic</b> nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. It {{should be noted}} that this grouping is functional rather than evolutionary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclic.</b> A module {{is called}} a <b>cyclic</b> module if it is {{generated}} by one element.|$|E
25|$|In {{many cases}} facies changes and other lithological {{features}} in sequences of sedimentary rock have a <b>cyclic</b> nature. This <b>cyclic</b> nature {{was caused by}} <b>cyclic</b> changes in sediment supply and the sedimentary environment. Most of these <b>cyclic</b> changes are caused by astronomic cycles. Short astronomic cycles can {{be the difference between}} the tides or the spring tide every two weeks. On a larger time-scale, <b>cyclic</b> changes in climate and sea level are caused by Milankovitch cycles: <b>cyclic</b> changes in the orientation and/or position of the Earth's rotational axis and orbit around the Sun. There are a number of Milankovitch cycles known, lasting between 10,000 and 200,000 years.|$|E
25|$|A field {{extension}} {{is called}} a <b>cyclic</b> extension if its Galois group is a <b>cyclic</b> group. The Galois group of every finite extension of a finite field is finite and <b>cyclic,</b> with an iterate of the Frobenius endomorphism as its generator. Conversely, given a finite field F and a finite <b>cyclic</b> group G, there is a finite field extension of F whose Galois group is G.|$|E
25|$|A locally <b>cyclic</b> {{group is}} a group in which each finitely {{generated}} subgroup is <b>cyclic.</b>|$|E
25|$|A metacyclic {{group is}} a group {{containing}} a <b>cyclic</b> normal subgroup whose quotient is also <b>cyclic.</b>|$|E

25|$|Every {{infinite}} <b>cyclic</b> {{group is}} isomorphic to the additive group of Z, the integers. Every finite <b>cyclic</b> group of order n is isomorphic to the additive group of Z/nZ, the integers modulo n. Every <b>cyclic</b> {{group is a}}n abelian group (meaning that its group operation is commutative), and every finitely generated abelian group is a direct product of <b>cyclic</b> groups.|$|E
25|$|For <b>cyclic</b> group, H0 is {{the same}} as H2, so H2(E/F) = |E/F| for all <b>cyclic</b> layers.|$|E
25|$|The group S1 of all {{rotations}} of {{a circle}} (the circle group) is not <b>cyclic.</b> Unlike the infinite <b>cyclic</b> group, {{it is not even}} countable. There also exist other infinite rotation groups (such as the set of rotations by rational angles) that are countable but not <b>cyclic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the <b>cyclic</b> {{behavior}} is apparent from an arithmetic exercise of long division of : the sequential remainders are the <b>cyclic</b> sequence {1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5}. See also the article 142857 for more properties of this <b>cyclic</b> number.|$|E

25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, <b>cyclic</b> softening can occur due to <b>cyclic</b> undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during <b>cyclic</b> loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the <b>cyclic</b> loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then <b>cyclic</b> liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then <b>cyclic</b> mobility takes place.|$|E
25|$|Of all n-gons with given sides, the {{one with}} the largest area is <b>cyclic.</b> Of all n-gons with a given perimeter, {{the one with}} the largest area is regular (and {{therefore}} <b>cyclic).</b>|$|E
25|$|In several sources, the {{structure}} of phenol red is shown with the sulfur atom {{being part of a}} <b>cyclic</b> group, similar to {{the structure}} of phenolphthalein. However, this <b>cyclic</b> structure could not be confirmed by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
25|$|A polygon {{which has}} a {{circumscribed}} circle is called a <b>cyclic</b> polygon (sometimes a concyclic polygon, because the vertices are concyclic). All regular simple polygons, all isosceles trapezoids, all triangles and all rectangles are <b>cyclic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>cyclic</b> group (Z/pZ)× for a {{prime number}} p, is also written (Z/pZ)* because it {{consists}} of the non-zero elements of the finite field of order p. More generally, every finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of any field is <b>cyclic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The direct {{product of}} two <b>cyclic</b> groups Z/n and Z/m is <b>cyclic</b> if {{and only if}} n and m are coprime. Thus e.g. Z/12 is the direct product of Z/3 and Z/4, but not the direct product of Z/6 and Z/2.|$|E
25|$|The real {{projective}} {{line has}} a <b>cyclic</b> order {{which is an}} important mathematical structure in showing that the real line is totally ordered and complete. The <b>cyclic</b> order is addressed by a separation relation which has the properties necessary for appropriate deductions.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} infinite {{abelian group}} is the infinite <b>cyclic</b> group Z. Any finitely generated abelian group A is isomorphic to the direct sum of r copies of Z and a finite abelian group, {{which in turn is}} decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many <b>cyclic</b> groups of primary orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number r, called the rank of A, and the prime powers giving the orders of finite <b>cyclic</b> summands are uniquely determined.|$|E
