40|$|In 2008, the World Health Organisation’s life {{expectancy}} {{for an average}} South African was forty eight years of age. South Africa therefore has a drastic need to improve its <b>health</b> <b>care</b> facilities with regards to ease of access, quality of service {{and the level of}} care in order to ensure and improve the health of its citizens. Currently, the Department of Health is implementing a change from a traditionally <b>curative</b> based <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system to a preventative and promotive based system. This thesis will indicate how a preventative and promotive health system can complement the curative system. It will as a result develop a new type of building and spaces to accommodate the new <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system’s needs: A Preventative Community Health Centre (CHC). The two main types of diseases that are critically effecting South Africans and attributing to high mortality rates are HIV/AIDS and Non- Communicable Diseases (non- contagious disease i. e. heart diseases and stroke). These diseases result from unhealthy lifestyles and behaviour and there is as yet no known cure for them other than preventive care. The centre in this thesis aims to educate South African citizens in a suburban context of a township on healthy behaviour and healthy lifestyles in healthy spaces. However, the success of a CHC depends on the participation of the community in which it is situated. Therefore, to encourage the frequent use of the building, the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> facilities must be de-stigmatised. The project is located between a curative institution and a shopping mall.

Health status is defined in terms of illness prevalence rate and functional disability based measures. Descriptive evidence on the measures of morbidity and choice of health care shows that there is considerable variation across the socio-economic and demographic attributes of individuals and households. The household demand framework is used to specify the reduced-form health status and curative care functions. These functions are estimated using maximum likelihood probit, tobit and multinomial logit methods. The results indicate a U-shaped relationship between age and morbidity. Both education and income exert a negative impact on morbidity measures used in this study. An interesting result is the significant negative effect of smoking on adult and elderly morbidity. Morbidity is found to be higher among the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe population. The study also sheds light on the effect of other household and village infrastructure variables on the measures of morbidity. The estimates of the multinomial discrete choice model of <b>curative</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> show that the real choice in rural India is between private health care and other types of health-care facilities. Primary-level education, household income, and village-level infrastructure and amenities are found to increase the probability of choosing private health care over any other type of facility.

While the level of investment in public health does not explain cross-country variations, higher investments in <b>curative</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> are associated with weaker effects of long-term illness on work duration.

At the moment of (residential) care home admittance, many elderly people are in need of oral <b>health</b> <b>care</b> urgently. The key factor in realizing and maintaining good oral health is daily oral hygiene care. For proper daily oral hygiene care, many residents are dependent on nurses and nurse aides. In 2007, the Dutch guideline "Oral <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in (residential) care homes for elderly people" was developed. Previous implementation research studies have revealed that implementation of a guideline is very complicated. The overall aim {{of this study is to}} compare a supervised versus a non-supervised implementation of the guideline in The Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium). Methods/Design The study is a cluster randomized intervention trial with an institution as unit of randomization. A random sample of 12 (residential) care homes accommodating somatic as well as psycho-geriatric residents in The Netherlands as well as in Flanders (Belgium) are randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. Representative samples of 30 residents in each of the 24 (residential) care homes are monitored during a 6 -months period. The intervention consists of supervised implementation of the guideline and a daily oral <b>health</b> <b>care</b> protocol. Primary outcome variable is the oral hygiene level of the participating residents. To determine the stimulating or inhibiting factors of the implementation project and the nurses' and nurse aides' compliance and perceived barriers, a process evaluation is carried out.
