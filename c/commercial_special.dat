40|$|Mica based {{pearlescent}} pigments {{are widely}} applied in plastics, cosmetics, automobiles coatings among others, {{but they seem}} not explored by the ceramic industry. In this work, the potential of two <b>commercial</b> <b>special</b> effect pigments (with gold and silver lustre respectively) in the decoration of ceramic tiles was appraised by testing them dispersed into several ceramic coatings fired {{in a wide range}} of temperatures (700 - 1150 ?C). The pigments were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, XRF and PSD, while their technological behavior was assessed determining phase composition (XRD) and colorimetric parameters (DRS) of ceramic materials, including a pearlescence index. Results indicate that titania mica pigments are stable into glassy coatings up to 900 ?C, being any deterioration of their optical properties due to anatase-to-rutile and muscovite-to-feldspar transformations occurring at higher temperatures or after long firing times. The pigment type with a gold shine is particularly suitable for third fire decoration of ceramic tiles, involving low temperatures and fast firing schedules, where it can replace expensive precious metals lustres. Moreover, a certain satin effect was appreciable in porcelain stoneware tiles, unexpectedly persistant after firing at 1200 ?...|$|E

40|$|The {{formulation}} of {{corporate social responsibility}} standards must deal with conflicting interests among stakeholders. The standards formulation process occurs at the junction between market stakeholders and special interest groups, which implies that it may help increase understanding of the marketing–society relationship. Drawing on the power and urgency dimensions of stakeholder identification theory and decision process analysis, this study examines four case studies pertaining to animal welfare issues in food marketing. The standards formulation processes contain control mechanisms that solve the potential conflicts between stakeholders by constraining <b>commercial</b> and/or <b>special</b> interests. These mechanisms vary in {{the degree to which}} discussion centers on the relationship between <b>commercial</b> and <b>special</b> interests, the presence of new parties that may alter the negotiations, the stage at which special interest groups become involved in the process, {{and the extent to which}} <b>commercial</b> and <b>special</b> interests constrain each other. The findings have critical implications for how companies and their stakeholders can organize the process of formulating corporate social responsibility standards.
