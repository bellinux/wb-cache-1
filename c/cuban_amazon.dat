5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata), {{also known}} as the Puerto Rican parrot or iguaca, is the only extant bird endemic to the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico belonging to the Neotropical genus Amazona. Measuring , the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form gracilipes from Culebra Island, extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona leucocephala) and the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis).|$|E
5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the Puerto Rican amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic studies show that the Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon</b> than to the black-billed amazon.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to being kept as pets locally, many Cuban macaws (perhaps thousands of specimens) were traded and sent to Europe. [...] This trade has also been suggested as a contributing cause for extinction. Judging {{by the number of}} preserved specimens that originated as captives, the species was probably not uncommon in European zoos and other collections. It was popular as a cagebird, despite its reputation for damaging items with its beak. Furthermore, collectors caught young birds by observing adults and felling the trees in which they nested, although sometimes nestlings were accidentally killed. [...] This practice reduced population numbers and selectively destroyed the species' breeding habitat. This means of collection continues today with the Cuban parakeet (Psittacara euops) and the <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona leucocephala).|$|E
500|$|In 1953, the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka {{suggested}} the broad-billed parrot was nocturnal, like the kakapo {{and the night}} parrot, two extant ground-dwelling parrots. Contemporary accounts do not corroborate this, and the orbits are of similar size {{to those of other}} large diurnal parrots. The broad-billed parrot was recorded on the dry leeward side of Mauritius, which was the most accessible for people, and it was noted that birds were more abundant near the coast, which may indicate that the fauna of such areas was more diverse. It may have nested in tree cavities or rocks, like the <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon.</b> The terms raven or crow may have been suggested by the bird's harsh call, its behavioural traits, or just its dark plumage.

50|$|The two sites, with a {{combined}} area of 276 ha, have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of West Indian whistling ducks (with 10 breeding pairs), white-crowned pigeons, <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazons</b> (10 pairs), Caribbean elaenias, thick-billed and Yucatan vireos, and vitelline warblers.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is from March to September. <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazons</b> nest in tree cavities {{throughout most of}} its range, the only exception being that the parrots living on the Abaco Islands nest underground in limestone solution holes, where they are protected from pineyard wildfires. Two to four white eggs are laid, which are incubated by the female for 26-28 days.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon</b> was seldom-seen in aviculture {{outside of}} Cuba and Florida (where it was bred in captivity by Cuban immigrants) until the 1980s and is {{considered}} one of the more difficult to breed amazon parrots, with aggressive behaviour from cock birds towards their mates and their own chicks a relatively common occurrence. Despite increased availability in recent times, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon</b> is still one of the highest-priced of all amazons. Several colour mutations have been observed in captive-bred stock.|$|E
50|$|With an {{estimated}} population of only 600 - 800 birds, the Fernandina's flicker {{is one of}} the most endangered woodpeckers in the world. Overall, that population is declining, principally because of habitat loss. Farming, logging, hurricane damage and the caged bird trade - trappers bring down whole palm trees in order to capture nestling <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazons</b> (Amazona leucocephala leucocephala) - are combining to squeeze the remaining birds into smaller and smaller isolated tracts. In addition, West Indian woodpeckers have been observed killing the chicks of Fernandina's flickers.|$|R
25|$|World of Birds, which {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades {{in the summer}} of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazons,</b> pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden lion tamarins, Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so. In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works towards preserving this species in the wild as well.|$|R

50|$|The Bluff {{is a low}} plateau of karstic limestone, gently rising {{towards the}} eastern end of the island.

The forest {{has a long history of}} logging and is a mosaic of old growth and second growth trees. Some 473 ha has been identified by BirdLife International as the Bluff Forest Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant populations of white-crowned pigeons, Cuban amazons, Caribbean elaenias, thick-billed vireos and vitelline warblers. The IBA encompasses the 82 ha National Trust’s Brac Parrot Reserve which protects mature and standing dead trees as nesting habitat for the <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon</b> parrots.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon</b> is a {{medium-sized}} parrot 28 - 33 cm long. It is mainly green with some blue feathers in its wings. The green feathers are edged with a terminal black rim. Its lower face, chin and throat are rosy pink, and its forehead and eye-rings are white. The {{extent of the}} various colours of the head, {{the extent of the}} rosy pink on the upper chest, and the extent of the dull red on the abdomen vary between the subspecies. Its irises are pale olive-green, its beak is horn-coloured, and the feathers over the ears are blackish. [...] The legs are pink. [...] The juvenile has little or no red on the abdomen, less black edging on the green feathers, and some of the feathers on the top of its head may be pale yellow rather than white.|$|E
5000|$|Populations of amazon parrots {{that lived}} on the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe are now extinct. It is not known if they were {{separate}} species, subspecies, or if they originated from parrots introduced to the islands by humans, so they are regarded as hypothetical extinct species. No evidence of them remains, and their taxonomy may never be established. Populations of several parrot species were described mainly in the unscientific writings of early travelers, and subsequently scientifically described by several naturalists (to have their names linked to the species that they were proposing) mainly in the 20th century, with no more evidence than the earlier observations and without specimens. An illustration of a specimen termed [...] "George Edwards' parrot" [...] has sometimes been considered a possibly distinct, extinct species, {{but it may also}} have been a yellow-billed or <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon</b> with aberrant colouration.|$|E

This means of collection continues today with the Cuban parakeet (Psittacara euops) and the <b>Cuban</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona leucocephala).A hurricane in 1844 is said to have wiped out the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and caused them to seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable to hunting.|$|E

Many other endemic species of Mauritius were lost after the arrival of man, so the ecosystem of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, almost all of which have since been lost to deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The broad-billed parrot lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|E
