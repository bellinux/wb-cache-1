40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{research}} previously {{conducted at the}} University of Wollongong on block shear failure of bolted connections in <b>cold-reduced</b> steel sheets with low ductility to hot-rolled steel plates. It examines {{the applicability of the}} basic approach employed for <b>cold-reduced</b> sheet steel bolted connections, which makes use of the so-called active shear planes, to hot-rolled steel plate connections. The active shear planes lie midway between the gross and the net shear planes defined in the steel structures specifications. The paper shows that shear yielding leading to the block shear failure of a bolted connection in a hot-rolled steel gusset plate is typically accompanied by full strain hardening. The paper proposes a design equation that provides more accurate and consistent results compared to the American, Australian, Canadian and European code equations in determining the block shear capacities of bolted connections in hot-rolled steel gusset plates. A resistance factor of 0. 85 is recommended in order to achieve a target reliability index of 4. 0 or greater...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with double-shear bolted connections in <b>cold-reduced</b> steel sheets that undergo the pure bearing failure mode of the inside sheet. Compared to the published test results of bolted connections failing in the net section fracture, those involving the bearing failure mode had very wide scatter in the ultimate test loads of specimens having seemingly similar configurations. This technical note presents the laboratory test results of 51 specimens composed of G 2 and G 450 steel sheets, which have very different ductility properties. One new and significant finding is that the absolute bearing capacity can be considerably higher in the rolling direction of the <b>cold-reduced</b> steel sheet than in the perpendicular direction, even though the tensile strength has the opposite trend. Another result is that material ductility has a much greater effect on the bearing capacity than on the net section tension capacity. It was also found that snug tightening {{had little effect on}} the bearing capacity of specimens thicker than 1. 5 mm. For the inside sheet of a double-shear bolted connection, the current American Iron and Steel Institute provision for bearing capacity is reasonably accurate if the load is applied in the rolling direction of G 2 steel sheet, but is overoptimistic in the perpendicular direction...|$|E

50|$|These two {{stress-strain}} curves {{are typical}} for cold-formed steel sheet during tension test. The second graph is {{the representation of}} the steel sheet that has undergone the <b>cold-reducing</b> (hard rolling) during manufacturing process, therefore it does not exhibit a yield point with a yield plateau. The initial slope of the curve may be lowered {{as a result of the}} prework. Unlike Fig.1, the stress-strain relationship in Fig.2 represents the behavior of annealed steel sheet. For this type of steel, the yield point is defined by the level at which the stress-strain curve becomes horizontal.|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{research}} needs {{related to the}} mechanical properties include determining suitable heat rates that represent realistic fire conditions to study the material response during the heating and decaying phases of fire, and after cooling down. The influence of heat and load (or strain) rates on the mechanical properties at high temperatures needs to be studied, so {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of different types of test (i.e. steady-state and transient) are better comprehended. Furthermore, attention should be paid to the chemical composition of specimens tested since the mechanical response seems to differ among different materials, and even for the same material before and after the <b>cold-reducing</b> process. Since mechanical properties at elevated temperatures might depend on the loading conditions, compression tests are also needed for material characterization. Data needs also include the Poisson’s ratio, shear modulus, and characteristic stress-strain relations of CFS at elevated temperatures.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} multi-stage drawing process and tooling aided by finite element analysis (FEA) for fabrication of a miniature sheet metal component, made of a <b>cold-reduced</b> carbon steel material (SPCC). To design such a tooling, {{it is essential to}} figure out how many intermediate drawing steps are needed to produce the final part without deformation defect. First of all, a four-stage drawing process and a set of four-station tooling are designed. This pre-designed process is then analyzed by simulation, and the deformation behavior and formability in each stage is revealed. Based on the revealed deformation behavior and formability, the design of the process and tooling is confirmed. The reasonable drawing ratio and drawing depth in each drawing operation are determined. The size, clearance, and the corner radii of punch and die in each stage are also identified. The designed process and tooling are finally implemented. Through experiment, the "right design in the first time" is realized, and the simulation and experiment are found to have a good agreement. The research further demonstrates that the FEA simulation can be used as an effective tool to aid the design of metal-formed component, tooling, and process in upfront design process.

30|$|Significant {{limitations}} exist {{with the}} available data. At {{the most basic}} level, {{for use in the}} United States, the tested CFS does not conform to ASTM A 1003 as specified in AISI ([2012 a]). Further, the impact of temperature on residual stresses and strains has seen only limited study (Feng et al. [2003 a]; Lee et al. [2003]). Since the cold-working process influences both explicit design expressions (cold work of forming) and implicit design expressions (the basic column curve) the impact of temperature (potentially similar to annealing) could be influential. The relatively common practice of <b>cold-reducing</b> the steel to a desired thickness has also not seen separate study for its effect on properties under temperature. CFS creep effects and behavior after the cooling phase have been scarcely studied (Outinen [2006]). Moreover, unresolved issues at ambient temperature such as the difference in tensile and compressive yield strength in CFS (Karren [1970]; Uribe [1969]) also become more important as attempts to predict capacity are advanced.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the accuracy of}} design equations specified in the North American, European, and Australasian codes for cold-formed steel structures in determining the ultimate tilt-bearing capacity of single-shear bolted connections without washers in flat steel sheets. It points out that all the code equations do not properly distinguish the tilt-bearing failure mode from the conventional bearing failure mode. While the latter takes place downstream of the bolt, the former takes place upstream. Unlike the conventional bearing capacity, the tilt-bearing capacity {{is affected by the}} width of the connected sheet and does not vary linearly with either the sheet thickness or the bolt diameter. Furthermore, it is not affected by material ductility. Based on the test results of 156 specimens composed of G 2 and G 450 sheet steels having various dimensional configurations, this paper proposes a design equation that is dimensionally consistent and that is considerably more accurate than all the code equations. The proposed equation was also verified against single-shear single-row bolted connections tested by independent researchers which failed in the tilt-bearing mode. The verified thicknesses ranged from 0. 92 to 3. 0 mm, and the bolt diameters ranged from 6. 4 to 16 mm. An additional finding is that the tilt-bearing capacity is not significantly affected by the orientation of the bolt head or nut. A resistance factor of 0. 75 is recommended for use with the proposed equation for determining the tilt-bearing capacity of single shear single-row bolted connections in <b>cold-reduced</b> steel sheets...|$|E
40|$|G 450 steel to AS 1397 is a <b>cold-reduced</b> {{sheet steel}} with in-line galvanizing. Its grade is 450 MPa yield and 480 MPa tensile strength. It {{is widely used}} in Australia for purlins, and {{is being used to}} {{fabricate}} lightweight portal frames, often by welding. The effects of welding on G 450 sheet steel in the heat affected zone with respect to the connection strength were unknown. In the present work, transverse and longitudinal fillet, and flare-bevel welded connections in 1. 5 and 3. 0 mm G 450 steel were tested to failure. The test results are used to check the relevant design rules in the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structures AS/NZS 4600. It was found that the current design rules are not adequate for certain connection configurations in G 450 steel to achieve the target safety index of 3. 5. Reduced resistance (capacity) factors are proposed for some connections. It was also found that the current design rule for longitudinal flare-bevel welded connections is unnecessarily conservative. The quality of welded connections in thin sheet steels produced by industry fabricators was investigated. The need to complement the macrotest with the destructive prying test as part of the prequalification procedure for such connections is demonstrated. Part {{of the results of the}} present work has recently been incorporated into the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members with a lowering of the thickness to 2. 5 mm above which weld throat failure should be checked...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{collaborative}} research project involving the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) and Idaho State University (ISU) is to evaluate the feasibility of determining residual stresses of welded, bent (three-point-bend), and cold-worked engineering materials using a new nondestructive technique based on positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). The proposed technique is to use γ-rays from a small MeV electron linear accelerator (Linac) to generate positrons inside the test sample via 2 pair production. This method {{can be used for}} materials characterization and investigation of defects in thick samples that usually cannot be accomplished by conventional positron technique or other nondestructive methods. The data generated will be compared to those obtained by other nondestructive methods such as neutron diffraction (ND) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and a destructive method known as ring-core technique. Materials tested so far include unirradiated austenitic (Type 304 L) and martensitic (EP- 823) stainless steels that were <b>cold-reduced,</b> bent (three point-bending) and welded prior to the evaluation of the resultant residual stresses. While substantial progress has been made to evaluate residual stresses in all three specimen configurations of Alloy EP- 823 and Type 304 L stainless steel by the PAS and XRD methods, a large number of testing still needs to be performed by all four measurement techniques. Although, the Linac at ISU has been performing satisfactorily, some unforeseen problems related to the signal resolution are currently being experienced, which has delayed the desired measurements. Further, substantial measurements by ND and ring-core methods are yet to be performed. Collaboration has recently been established with the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) to conduct residual stress measurements by the ND technique. Preliminary results obtained at AECL indicate a significant potential for the ND method to analyze residual stresses in thick specimens of different configurations. Microstructural evaluations by optical microscopy have just been initiated. However, a lot more metallographic studies will be performed involving cold-worked and welded specimens following future residual stress measurements. In addition, deformation characteristics in terms of dislocations and their movements resulting from welding and plastic deformation will be analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), once this equipment is available at UNLV. Further, Alloys EP- 823, HT- 9, and austenitic materials (Type 316 L stainless steel and Alloy 718) irradiated by low energy photon beam at ISU will be included in this program during the third year...|$|E
40|$|Thin-walled steel {{sections}} {{made from}} high strength thin <b>cold-reduced</b> G 550 steel to Australian Standard AS 1397 - 1993 under compression are investigated experimentally and theoretically in this thesis. This thesis describes three series of compression tests performed on box-section stub columns, box-section long columns and lipped channel section columns cold-formed from {{high strength steel}} plates in 0. 42 mm or 0. 60 mm thickness with nominal yield stress of 550 MPa. The tests presented in this thesis formed part of an Australian Research Council research project entitled: Compression Stability of High Strength Steel Sections with Low Strain-Hardening. For the fix-ended stub column tests, a total of 94 lipped-square and hexagonal section stub columns were tested to study the influence of low strain hardening of G 550 steel on the compressive section capacities of the column members. For the pin-ended long column tests, a total of 28 box-section columns were tested to study the stability of members with sections which undergo local instability at loads significantly less than the ultimate loads. For the fix-ended lipped channel section columns, a total of 21 stub and long columns were tested to study the failure resulting from local and distortional buckling with interaction between the modes. A numerical simulation on the three series of tests using the commercial finite element computer program ABAQUS is also presented {{as part of this}} thesis. The post-buckling behaviour of thin-walled compression members is investigated. The effect of changing variables, such as geometric imperfections and end boundary conditions is also investigated. The ABAQUS analysis gives accurate simulations of the tests and is in good agreement to the experimental results. Theoretical studies using finite strip methods are presented in this thesis to investigate the buckling behaviour of cold-formed members in compression. The theoretical studies provide valuable information on the local and distortional buckling stresses for use in the interaction buckling studies. The finite strip models used are the semi-analytical and spline models. As expected for the stub columns tests, the greatest effect of low strain hardening was for the stockier sections where material properties play an important role. For the more slender sections where elastic local buckling and post-local buckling are more important, the effect of low strain hardening {{does not appear to be}} as significant. The pin-ended and fix-ended long column tests show that interaction, which is between local and overall buckling in the box sections, and between local and distortional buckling in the open channel sections, has a significant effect on their member capacities. The results of the successful column tests and ABAQUS simulation have been compared with the design procedures in the Australian & New Zealand Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structures AS&NZS 4600 and the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members prepared by the American Iron and Steel Institute. The stub column tests show that the current design rules give too conservative predictions on the compressive section capacities of the column members; whereas the long column tests show that the current column design rules are unconservative if used in their current form for G 550 steel. Three design proposals are presented in this thesis to account for the effects of high strength thin steels on the section and member capacities...|$|E
