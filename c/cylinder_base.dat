40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSurface pressure, drag and lift coefficients have been experimentally determined for a right circular cylinder located near a plane surface {{and placed in}} a cross flow of air. Parametric studies were carried out for Reynolds numbers varying from 90, 000 to 250, 000, three plate lengths and a variety of cylinder to plate spacings. The variation of the drag coefficient as a function of gap size was found to exhibit an interesting and unexpected trend. The drag was a minimum when the cylinder was resting on the plate and was a maximum at a gap size of approximately one cylinder radius. Flow visualization studies together with detailed measurements of the vortex shedding frequency in the cylinder wake indicate that the plate interferes with the formation of the vortex street in the cylinder wake when it is located within a cylinder radius of the cylinder.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis for}} predicting final forging dimensions for precision forged cylinders at various forging temperatures and loads is presented. This has been derived {{by studying the}} effects of various parameters such asforging load, forging temperature, die preheat temperature and spark gap on final forged dimensions. Experimental results compare well with theoretical predictions. It has been found for circular forgings that thefinish forged diameter increases {{with an increase in}} forging load, but ifloading is such that it induces an axial stress greater than twice theflow stress of the workpiece material, the dimension offinished product remains constant. Dimension-al variation of forgings due to elastic die deflection decreases when forging temperature increases and at high temperatures is insigniji-cant compared to other factors. For a given die preheat temperature, the higher the forging temperature the greater the increase in forging dimension due to thermal expansion of the die. Thermal shrinkage of the forging is the overwhelming factor influencing forged dimensions at medium and high temperatures. Although friction, work hardening and heat loss were neglected, the close agreement between experimental and theoretical results shows that the theory can be usefully employed in practical situations.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{of the origin of}} oblique vortex shedding in the laminar wake of circular cylinders was conducted in the range of Reynolds numbers from 40 to 160. Two transverse circular cylinders were positioned upstream of the main shedding cylinder to control the angle of shedding from the main cylinder. The respective distances between each transverse cylinder and the main cylinder were used to induce oblique shedding of different angles, curved shedding, as well as parallel shedding. Measurements of the mean static pressure distribution in the base region of the cylinder and of the mean spanwise component of the velocity in the wake were taken. These measurements revealed that a non-symmetric pressure distribution, which induced a spanwise flow in the base region of the cylinder, was responsible for the oblique shedding. By using a simple model based on the ratio of the streamwise to the spanwise vorticity components, the angle of shedding was predicted within 2 " of the value measured from flow visualization. The vorticity was simply evaluated from the spanwise and streamwise velocity profiles of oblique vortex streets obtained with the LDV measurement technique. Parallel vortex shedding showed a symmetric pressure distribution with zero spanwise component of the velocity and zero cross-shear in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>base.</b> It was shown that parallel vortex shedding results in a continuous Strouhal-Reynolds number curve...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Vortex {{shedding}} of both finite and infinite cylinders {{have been}} investigated {{by means of the}} Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique and compared. To obtain reliable turbulence statistics 5 ˙ 000 images have been taken for each test. Instantaneous and mean velocity fields are measured in many planes along the cylinder length, in order to study the flow evolution between the basis {{and the end of the}} cylinder. The Reynolds number investigated (Re = 16 ˙ 000) is within the Shear-Layer Transition Regime, indicated by Williamson (1996) for the infinite cylinder. This regime is characterized by the formation of Karman vortices. As regard the finite one, a counter-rotating pair of tip vortices forms at the free end, extends into the wake and interacts in a complex manner with Karman vortex shedding. For the aspect ratio used in this work (AR= 8), Kawamura et al. (1984) showed that the Karman vortices are present only in a small region near the <b>cylinder</b> <b>base.</b> In order to detect the Karman vortex shedding, a phase averaged method has been chosen.

40|$|The bubble-type vortex {{breakdown}} that occurs on {{the axis of}} a confined vortex, for example inside a cylinder with flow driven by rotation of the base, has applications in mixing. This configuration has well defined boundary conditions that are easily manipulated experimentally as well as numerically, and has traditionally been of interest to researchers {{in the fields of}} aircraft dynamics and stability theory or dynamical systems. Recently, interest in the {{vortex breakdown}} flow that develops on the axis in open cylindrical vessels has grown in relation to its application to mixing. In particular, it may provide a means for modulating certain fluid dynamic parameters of importance in mixing applications in fields including bioengineering. In most cell and tissue culture applications (be they suspension or scaffold based), a laminar, low-shear environment with high oxygen and nutrient density is desired. Therefore, levels of turbulence, shear stress, and the mass transport properties of mixing vessels are of great import. We investigate the vortex breakdown flow in the presence of immersed bodies and report on the flow states, and fluid dynamic properties achievable under different operating conditions, in a novel mixing vessel for use in scaffold-based tissue engineering.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were carried out {{in order to understand}} the relationship between wake structure and heat transfer for a transversely oscillating circular cylinder in cross-flow and to explore the dynamics of the vortex formation process in the wake. The cylinder's heat transfer coefficient was determined over a range of oscillation amplitudes up to 1. 5 cylinder diameters and oscillation frequencies up to 5 times the stationary cylinder natural shedding frequency. The results were compared to established relationships between oscillation conditions and wake structure. Digital particle image thermometry/velocimetry (DPIT/V) was used to measure the temperature and velocity fields in the near-wake for a set of cases chosen to be representative of the variety of wake structures that exist for this type of flow. The experiments were carried out in a water tunnel at a Reynolds number of 690. It was found that wake structure and heat transfer both significantly affect one another. The wake mode, a label indicating the number and type of vortices shed in each oscillation period, is directly related to the observed heat transfer enhancement. The dynamics of the vortex formation process, including the trajectories of the vortices during roll-up, explain this relationship. The streamwise spacing between shed vortices was also shown to affect heat transfer coefficient for the 2 S mode, which consists of two single vortices shed per cycle. The streamwise spacing is believed to influence entrainment of freestream temperature fluid by the forming vortices, thereby affecting the temperature gradient at the <b>cylinder</b> <b>base.</b> This effect may exist for other wake modes, as well. The cylinder's transverse velocity was shown to influence the heat transfer by affecting the circulation of the wake vortices. For a fixed wake structure, the effectiveness of the wake vortices at enhancing heat transfer depends on their circulation. Also, the cylinder's transverse velocity continually changes the orientation of the wake with respect to the freestream flow, thereby spreading the main source of heat transfer enhancement [...] the vortices near the <b>cylinder</b> <b>base</b> [...] over a larger portion of the cylinder surface. Previously observed heat transfer enhancement associated with oscillations at frequencies near the natural shedding frequency and its harmonics were shown to be limited to amplitudes of less than about 0. 5 cylinder diameters. A new phenomenon was discovered in which the wake structure switches back and forth between distinct wake modes. Temperature induced variations in the fluid viscosity are believed to be the cause of this mode-switching. It is hypothesized that the viscosity variations change the vorticity and kinetic energy fluxes into the wake, thereby changing the wake mode and the heat transfer coefficient. This discovery underscores the role of viscosity and shear layer fluxes in determining wake mode, potentially leading to improved understanding of wake vortex formation and pinch-off processes in general. Aspect ratio appears to play a role in determining the heat transfer coefficient mainly for non-oscillating cylinders. The heat transfer is also affected by aspect ratio for oscillation conditions characterized by weak synchronization of the wake to the oscillation frequency...|$|E
40|$|Numerous factors {{contribute}} to the three-dimensional behavior of the wake behind a finite cylinder with relatively large aspect ratio in a cross flow; among the more important ones are the trailing vortex shed from the free end and the necklace vortex formed at the <b>cylinder</b> <b>base.</b> The trailing vortex interacts strongly with the flow around the cylinder; thus giving rise to oblique vortex shedding and changes the flow structures, such as the vortex pattern, and the pressure distribution around the cylinder. Formation of a necklace vortex near {{the base of the}} cylinder could give rise to interaction between this vortex and the shed vortices along the cylinder span. Besides, the necklace vortex could even interact with the trailing vortex, depending on the cylinder aspect ratio. For aspect ratios greater than a critical value a suppressed two-dimensional region exists with vortex shedding resembling the Karman vortex street. In this paper, a lattice Boltzmann method is used to numerically simulate the flow past a finite cylinder with an aspect ratio of 10 at Reynolds numbers (Re) varying from 100 to 200. A major finding is that, even in this limited Re range, the wake behavior and flow-induced forces are greatly affected by Re. A suppressed two-dimensional region exists but its size decreases as Re increases. In addition, the effects of the trailing and necklace vortices on the variation of the Strouhal number, and the mean and root mean square drag and lift coefficients along the span are found to be affected by Re.

40|$|The {{effects of}} initial {{conditions}} on interaction between a boundary layer over a flat plate and flow around a wall-mounted finite-length cylinder were experimentally investigated. A square cylinder with a characteristic width (d) of 20 mm and {{a length of}} H= 5 d was vertically mounted on a horizontal flat plate. Three different boundary layers were investigated, their momentum thickness being 0. 07 d, 0. 13 d, and 0. 245 d, respectively, measured at the cylinder axis {{in the absence of}} the cylinder. All the experiments were carried out in a closed-loop water tunnel at a Reynolds numbers of 11 500 based on d and the free-stream velocity U[sub ∞]. It is found that initial boundary layer conditions have a profound effect on the near wake, including the flow near the cylinder free end that is well beyond the boundary layer. With increasing boundary layer thickness, the base vortex is enhanced, inducing a stronger upwash flow from the <b>cylinder</b> <b>base,</b> which acts to weaken the downwash free-end shear layer and the tip vortex. Consequently, spanwise vortices gain strength near the free end but impair near the wall, causing the ratio of symmetrically to antisymmetrically arranged vortices to vary and subsequently the Reynolds stresses to increase significantly in magnitude near the free end but to decrease near the wall.
