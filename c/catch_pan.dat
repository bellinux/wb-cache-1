500|$|Sodium forms {{flammable}} {{hydrogen and}} caustic sodium hydroxide on contact with water; ingestion and contact with moisture on skin, eyes or mucous membranes can cause severe burns. Sodium spontaneously explodes {{in the presence}} of an oxidizer such as water. Fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires; those based on carbon dioxide and bromochlorodifluoromethane should not be used on sodium fire. Metal fires are Class D, but not all Class D extinguishers are workable with sodium. [...] An effective extinguishing agent for sodium fires is Met-L-X. Other effective agents include Lith-X, which has graphite powder and an organophosphate flame retardant, and dry sand. Sodium fires are prevented in nuclear reactors by isolating sodium from oxygen by surrounding sodium pipes with inert gas. Pool-type sodium fires are prevented using different design measures called <b>catch</b> <b>pan</b> systems. They collect leaking sodium into a leak-recovery tank where it is isolated from oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Curtain coating is {{a process}} that creates an {{uninterrupted}} curtain of fluid that falls onto a substrate. The substrate is transported on a conveyor belt or calender rolls at a regulated speed through the curtain to ensure an even coat of the die. The curtain is created by using a slit or die {{at the base of the}} holding tank, allowing the liquid to fall upon the substrate. Some polymers are melted and extruded for coating. Many manufactures will also include a <b>catch</b> <b>pan</b> to retrieve and reuse the excess fluid.|$|E
50|$|Iceboxes had hollow {{walls that}} {{were lined with}} tin or zinc and packed with various {{insulating}} materials such as cork, sawdust, straw or seaweed. A large block of ice was held in a tray or compartment {{near the top of}} the box. Cold air circulated down and around storage compartments in the lower section. Some finer models had spigots for draining ice water from a <b>catch</b> <b>pan</b> or holding tank. In cheaper models a drip pan was placed under the box and had to be emptied at least daily. The user had to replenish the melted ice, normally by obtaining new ice from an iceman.|$|E

40|$|TerraPower LLC is {{designing}} a fast breed and burn reactor intended to operate {{for up to}} 40 years without refueling, designated as the Travelling Wave Reactor (TWR). Various U-Zr alloy fuel designs have been proposed for the TWR that may require a powder feed for fabrication. A simple and economic option for laboratory scale powder production is the Rotating Electrode Process (REP), which produces microsphere shaped powder by melting {{the tip of a}} rotating bar with an electric arc. In order to fully characterize this process for various U-Zr alloys and provide the feed material for testing fabrication techniques, a Rotating Electrode System (RES) was designed and built. The RES is largely based on a combination of two designs; an early REP system developed by Starmet Corporation in the 19 xxa and a later design optimized for U-Mo powder production by Idaho National Laboratory (INL). The RES designed for this work was improved based on input from vendors specializing in their respective areas of expertise and is capable of atomizing up to a 1. 26 cm diameter metal alloy rod at 40, 000 RPM. Every component of the machine can be disassembled and transferred through a 35. 56 cm (14 in) diameter air lock of a glovebox so that it can operate in a controlled environment. The RES was tested by atomizing various diameter copper rods to prove system functionality. The tests were carried out in air using an argon cover gas in the powder collection chamber, known as the <b>catch</b> <b>pan</b> to limit oxidation rates of the newly generated microspheres. The powder produced showed strong sphericity ranging from 50 ?m to 500 ?m in diameter. Problems and areas of concern that were encountered during operation have been addressed so that the RES can be further optimized to better atomize U-Zr alloys once transferred into the glovebox...|$|E
40|$|Various {{proposed}} metallic {{nuclear fuel}} designs for fast reactors may require powder fabrication methods and the reactive nature of uranium metal creates unique challenges. Spherical powder is desired in some fuel concepts over flaky or irregular powder {{because it will}} enable predictable packing fractions, even for low density fuels. A previously-established method for powder production is the Rotating Electrode Process (REP) which produces microsphere shaped powder by melting {{the tip of a}} rotating cylinder via electric arc. As droplets of molten metal are expelled radially outward, they solidify into spherical particles. A new REP system, named the TAMU Rotating Electrode System (TAMU RES), was developed at Texas A&M University in a previous study. This RES apparatus was placed inside of an inert atmosphere glovebox for this present study to enable uranium powder manufacture. The RES is based on previous designs by Starmet Co. and the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). It is capable of melting a metal rod up to 12. 7 cm (5 inches) in length and 1. 27 cm (0. 5 inches) in diameter as it rotates up to 19, 000 RPM. The RES is capable of operating at speeds up to 40, 000 RPM provided no mechanical instabilities are present in the rotating cylinder. Varying the RPM alters the diameter of the spheres produced in a predictable fashion, but {{in a manner that is}} unique to each material melted by the RES. The RES is capable of producing repeatable powder size distributions. Copper, depleted uranium (DU), and U- 10 wt% Zr (U- 10 Zr) powders were produced using the RES and their size distributions were characterized as a function of RPM for rotational speeds varying between 10, 000 and 19, 000 RPM. The copper powders were produced in both air and argon atmospheres, while the uranium and U- 10 Zr powders were produced under an argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation of the microspheres. Problems and areas of concern like material flaking and rotational instability issues were overcome by the installation of a helium cooling line inside the <b>catch</b> <b>pan,</b> and by selecting mechanically straight rods for melting. Continued characterization work of powders produced by the RES is also addressed...|$|E
30|$|When cooking on a {{barbecue}} grill, consumers often use aluminum grill pans. For one, the <b>pan</b> <b>catches</b> the {{fats and oils}} that would drip into the embers causing the formation of potentially noxious smoke, and the pan also protects the food from being burned by direct heat from the coals. In addition, new aluminum products for use in ovens and grills are becoming increasingly popular. Due to their light weight and excellent heat transfer camping, utensils made of aluminum are, for example, often used by fishermen and mountain climbers. Preparing food in aluminum utensils can, however, result in migration of the aluminum to the foodstuffs.|$|R

In his eagerness to avenge his father, Guan Xing pursues Pan Zhang into a valley but loses his way inside. After nightfall, Guan Xing wanders around until he finds a house inhabited by an old man and stays there for the night. He sees his father's portrait on the wall in the house. Later that night, Pan Zhang also finds his way to the house and asks to stay there. Guan Xing sees Pan Zhang and shouts at him. Just as Pan Zhang is about to leave, he encounters Guan Yu's ghost and is petrified. Guan Xing <b>catches</b> up with <b>Pan</b> Zhang, kills him, digs out his heart and places it on the altar as a sacrifice to his father's spirit.|$|R
50|$|Legend {{has it that}} a {{fisherman}} named Pan lived in Wenchang county, Hainan Island. One day while fishing out at sea, he caught a block of wood which he threw back into the sea, but he caught it again the next day. This happened repeatedly for a few days. As a result, Pan decided to bring the block of wood back to his home. He felt that the block of wood had a magical power and thus prayed to it, asking to be blessed with a great catch the next day. He promised that he would build a temple to enshrine the wood if his prayer were to be granted. Pan's prayer was actually granted. He came back from his fishing trip with a huge <b>catch.</b> However, <b>Pan</b> {{did not have enough}} money to build a temple, so he left the wood outside his house by the pig sty and forgot all about the promise he made. The next day, his pigs went ill and his neighbors saw a woman sitting on the branch of the longan tree near his house. It made him remember his promise to the block of wood. He informed his neighbours of the incident and they all raised funds for the construction of the temple and prayed to ask where they should build the new temple. Suddenly a child came by and showed them the location of where the temple should be built. That temple would then be the first temple for Goddess Shui Wei.|$|R
60|$|At {{the most}} {{favorable}} moment Pan spurred Sorrel to intercept the stallion. But the black, maddened with terror and instinct to rage, would not swerve out of Pan's way. On he came, swift as the wind, lean black head out, mane flying, a wild creature at once beautiful and fearful. Pan had to jerk Sorrel out of his way. Then Pan, having the black {{between himself and the}} fence, turned Sorrel loose. The race began--with Pan still holding the advantage. It did not, however, last long that way. The black ran away from Pan. He wanted to shoot but thought it best not to use his last shells. What a stride! He was a big horse, too, ragged, rangy, with action and power that delighted Pan. Knowing he could not <b>catch</b> the black <b>Pan</b> cut across toward the wash. Then the stallion, seeing the yawning gulf ahead, turned toward the fence, and quickening that marvelous stride he made a magnificent leap right {{at the top of the}} obstruction. He cleared the heavy wood and crashed through the branches to freedom.|$|R
