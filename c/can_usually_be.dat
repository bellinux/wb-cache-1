5|$|The third type, {{pancreatic}} mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) mainly {{occur in}} women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> successfully removed by surgery.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{you open}} your mouth and you don't {{know what you are}} going to say, and {{whatever}} comes out is the starting point. If that happens and you are lucky, it <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> turned into a song. This song is a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, and whoever likes it.|$|E

5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{variable in}} number: {{three or more}} small glands, and <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|E
5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E

5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam {{due to its}} stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in a review of}} fossil birds from Miocene and Pliocene deposits in North Carolina. Finds included an early Miocene loon Colymboides minutus, various ducks, a crested tern closely resembling the modern royal tern Sterna maxima, {{and a member of the}} crow genus, one of the few fossil passerine birds from that period. The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> placed in a modern family with a fair degree of confidence.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} method of production {{and the color of}} the diamond. CVD diamonds <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{we provide}} the cell edge {{performance}} for rectangular coordinate. The performance of cell edge <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> either noise limited or interference limited [21]. In noise-limited situation which typically occurs in large {{cells in the}} rural areas, the performance <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> improved by providing a power gain.|$|R

50|$|Asagao musubi ("morning glory") is a knot {{suitable}} for yukata. As its name suggests, it resembles the Japanese morning glory. The knot requires a great length of obi so it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>usually</b> only <b>be</b> made for little girls.|$|R
5|$|The Mediterranean species Boletus poikilochromus {{somewhat}} resembles I.torosus, but <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> {{distinguished by}} a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. Also, B.poikilochromus does not feature the colour {{change of the}} stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in I.torosus. Imperator luteocupreus and Caloboletus radicans are also similar but the pores of the former are red and the flesh of latter has a bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shooting}} medals {{were struck}} {{in honor of}} the Officers' Shoot held in Langenthal, Bern, in 1822. They <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> distinguished from shooting thalers by their lack of denomination and difference in weight and often composition, though there is evidence that many of thaler-size did circulate amongst the legal tender coins of Switzerland. Shooting medals were minted in a variety of metals, including silver, bronze, goldene and white metal.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> distinguished by their difference {{in size and}} plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with black cutting edge.|$|E

5|$|USB {{mice and}} {{keyboards}} <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> used with older computers that have PS/2 connectors {{with the aid}} of a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the hardware in the USB keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port. These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
50|$|The Rheinland {{contains}} an unproportianal amount of SG's, which are joint teams without the contributing clubs actually merging. The {{reason for this}} is the relatively low population density and therefore a lack of players. SG's <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> not <b>be</b> promoted above their Verbandsliga.|$|R
50|$|The Savannah sparrows proper (see below) {{are very}} similar, and migrant birds <b>can</b> not <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> {{related to a}} {{breeding}} population with certainty. The resident or partially migratory subspecies are well distinguishable by size and, particularly between groups, coloration.|$|R

5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
5|$|Several Psilocybe {{species have}} an {{appearance}} roughly similar to P.allenii, but these <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> distinguished by differences in morphology or distribution. The European species P.serbica var. moravica {{has a similar}} cap and stipe, but is generally more slender than P.allenii. The closely related P.cyanescens is indistinguishable by microscopic characteristics, but features a wavy cap in maturity, a longer fruiting season (from late September through April), and lacks a ring zone on the stipe often seen in P.allenii. P.azurescens has a broader cap, an umbo that may be broad or acute, a longer stipe up to , and a growing season {{similar to that of}} P.cyanescens. The authors also note that the Australian P.subaeruginosa is similar (including three taxa that have since been synonymized: P.australiana, P.eucalypta, and P.tasmaniana) but suggest that further research is required to better understand the delimitation of this species complex.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{lacrimal}} lake usually contains 7-10 µL of tears, the maximum fluid it <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> hold <b>is</b> 25-30 µL before tearing occurs. Aging usually causes the eyelids {{to become more}} loose which in turn enables the {{lacrimal lake}} to hold even more fluid.|$|R
50|$|In {{languages}} such as Eiffel, assertions {{form part}} of the design process; other languages, such as C and Java, use them only to check assumptions at runtime. In both cases, they can be checked for validity at runtime but <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> also <b>be</b> suppressed.|$|R
