5000|$|Officially {{supported}} {{export credit}} may {{be connected to}} official development assistance (ODA) in two ways. First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export credit is tied to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a tied aid credit, even if the ODA part is untied aid. Second, tied aid credits are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time {{when there is no}} repayment of the principal) and terms of repayment. Such credits are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of [...] "softness". [...] "Softness" [...] is measured by a formula that compares the present value of the credit with the present value of the same amount at standardized [...] "commercial" [...] terms. This difference is expressed {{as a percentage of the}} credit and called [...] "concessionality level". Thus a grant has a <b>concessionality</b> <b>level</b> of 100%, a commercial credit scores zero per cent. The higher the <b>concessionality</b> <b>level,</b> the more the tied aid credit looks like ODA, the lower, the more it looks like an export credit.|$|E

This paper proposes a new World Bank financing model for creditworthy emerging economies, such as India and Vietnam, which currently receive {{billions of dollars in}} IDA assistance. In contrast to the current IDA-centric financing model, the IBRD would provide the same loan volumes to qualifying emerging economies while IDA would provide grant subsidies to buy down the <b>concessionality</b> <b>level</b> of these IBRD loans. As such, these countries would be held harmless both in terms of aid volumes and lending terms. By better leveraging the IBRD’s balance sheet for loan capital, IDA then could re-allocate what it otherwise would have provided to emerging economies. For the current IDA- 15 replenishment period, this would mean up to $ 7. 5 billion in additional assistance for the world’s poorest, most vulnerable countries. In relative terms, this would entail a 30 percent increase over existing levels. Of this, African countries would have received an additional $ 5. 5 billion in IDA assistance. If donor governments find a way to scrape together increased contributions to IDA, then the allocation pie would grow by an even larger margin. The Inter-American Development Bank already successfully utilizes a similar approach for its lower middle-income and low-income country clients. It is time for World Bank shareholders to seriously consider the same resource-maximizing model. With the IDA- 16 replenishment and IBRD general capital increase negotiations currently underway, they have an excellent window of opportunity to implement this win-win-win approach.
