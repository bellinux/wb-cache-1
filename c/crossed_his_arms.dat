500|$|After {{joining the}} Giants in 2010, López {{became one of}} the premier lefty specialists in the game. On May 12, 2011, he {{recorded}} his first save since 2006 in a 3–2 victory over the Diamondbacks. Following the game, he <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> imitating Giants' closer Brian Wilson's post-save gesture. In 70 games in 2011, he had a 5–2 record, a 2.72 ERA, and 40 strikeouts in 50 innings pitched. He and Brad Ziegler were the only relief pitchers in the major leagues to toss at least 50 innings without allowing a home run. His [...]163 opponent batting average (OBA) against left-handers was the eighth-lowest in the NL.|$|E
2500|$|On January 5, 1870, Hardin {{was playing}} cards with Benjamin Bradley in Towash, Hill County, Texas. Hardin was winning almost every hand, which angered Bradley who {{threatened}} to [...] "cut out his liver" [...] if he won again. Bradley drew {{a knife and}} a six-shooter. Hardin said he was unarmed and excused himself but claims that later that night, Bradley came looking for him. Bradley allegedly fired a shot at Hardin and missed; Hardin drew both his pistols and returned fire, one shot striking Bradley {{in the head and}} the other in his chest. Dozens of people saw this fight, and from them there is a good record of how Hardin had used his guns. His holsters were sewn into his vest so that the butts of his pistols pointed inward across his chest. He <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> to draw. Hardin claimed this was the fastest way to draw, and he practiced every day. A man called [...] "Judge Moore", who held Hardin's stakes of money and a pistol, but refused to give them up without Bradley's consent, later [...] "vanished". Hardin eventually admitted killing two men in Hill County.|$|E

6000|$|... "I's heerd massa an' Cappin Fizzroy talkin' about you," [...] {{said the}} negro, <b>crossing</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> on <b>his</b> chest and {{regarding}} his questioner with a somewhat quizzical expression.|$|R
60|$|He let the gun {{fall between}} his knees, and moving {{back on his}} seat, leaned {{his head against the}} wall of the hut, <b>crossing</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> on <b>his</b> breast.|$|R
6000|$|Pursing {{his lips}} tightly, {{and looking at}} each of us {{for a few moments}} in silence, he finally <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> on his chest, and turning eagerly to Jack, said with extreme volubility-- ...|$|E

6000|$|Even this {{confession}} {{failed to}} move Father Benwell. He obstinately <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> obstinately tapped {{his foot on}} the floor. [...] "No!" [...] he said. [...] "Plead as generously as you may, my answer is, No." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes I did," [...] {{replied the}} captain, <b>crossing</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and nodding <b>his</b> head firmly, [...] "robbed him. I laid a bet {{with him to}} that extent and won it." ...|$|R

60|$|Heika was subdued by {{the gentle}} tone. He <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> on his heaving chest, and stood erect before {{them with his}} head {{slightly}} drooped, and a look of profound sadness, rather than disappointment, on his countenance.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No! no!' still stoutly {{said the}} {{constant}} Maurice. 'I don't want new guns; I've got my dear old one, and I'll keep {{him to the}} end of his days and mine!' and he <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> over it.|$|E
60|$|Romayne {{persisted in}} his refusal. As {{a matter of}} course, I {{supported}} him, with all needful care to avoid giving offense. The General took offense, nevertheless. He <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> on his breast, and looked at us fiercely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] he said, {{stopping}} suddenly, and <b>crossing</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> as {{he stood}} with his feet planted pretty wide apart, after the fashion of those who desire to be thought very resolute--"mother, I had a dream last night." ...|$|R
60|$|With this remark, Jo {{subsided}} into a peaceable man. Pulling a quid {{out of his}} pocket, {{he thrust}} it into <b>his</b> cheek, and, <b>crossing</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> on <b>his</b> breast, listened patiently--though not profitably, seeing {{that he did not}} understand a word--to the dialogue that followed.|$|R
50|$|Greg remarks {{what a great}} party it was, but now they're tired so it's time to go. They all {{say goodbye}} and fell asleep except for Jeff, who tries to wake {{everyone}} up but they don't wake up. Jeff then <b>crosses</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and shakes <b>his</b> head with a sigh.|$|R
60|$|He {{sat down}} and <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> fiercely. As {{he looked at his}} wife to see what effect he had {{produced}} on her, the sound of heavy carriage-wheels and the trampling of horses penetrated to the parlor from the garden-gate.|$|E
60|$|Seadrift colored to the temples, <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> meekly on his bosom, sunk in an {{attitude}} of leave-taking, that was so equivocal as to cause the attentive and critical young captain to smile, and then glided past him and disappeared through a hatchway.|$|E
60|$|Martin-Roget <b>crossed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> {{over his}} broad chest and {{clutched}} his elbows {{with his hands}} with an obvious effort to keep control over his movements and his temper in check. The quiet, almost indifferent attitude of the girl was exasperating to his over-strung nerves.|$|E
6000|$|Hake, who {{possessed a}} soft and deep bass voice of very fine quality, at once acceded to {{the request for}} a song. <b>Crossing</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> on <b>his</b> chest, and looking, as if in meditation, towards the eastern horizon, he sang, {{to one of his}} {{national}} airs, [...] "The Land across the Sea." ...|$|R
5|$|His head {{hangs in}} exhaustion, {{and his hands}} bleed from the {{puncture}} wounds suffered during his nailing to the <b>cross.</b> <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> are placed higher above his head and strain to carry {{the weight of his}} body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.|$|R

60|$|Then {{a sudden}} thought seemed to strike him, he threw back his head, gave a short laugh {{as if he}} were pleased with this new thought, then turned, meeting Mistress de Chavasse's stern gaze {{squarely}} and fully.

6000|$|... "Luckily, Montero {{is not a}} Caesar," [...] Decoud continued. [...] "Not the two Monteros put {{together}} would make a decent parody of a Caesar."

[...] "It is only you, Don Jose, who are a genuine old Roman--vir Romanus--eloquent and inflexible." ...|$|E
50|$|The Duke's {{arms were}} the Royal Arms of the House of Hanover, with a three-point label of difference.

6000|$|... "I am but a lowly laborer," [...] {{said the}} old man, meekly <b>crossing</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> [...] "but does not the lowliest laborer ask and receive his reward? and shall I miss mine?--But I beg charity of none. What I ask, I demand; and in the dread name of great Alma, who {{appointed}} me a guide." [...] And to and fro he strode, groping as he went.|$|R
