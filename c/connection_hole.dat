40|$|Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is a {{very new}} and {{blooming}} technology which takes care about the transportation system of ground level. The most important function of VANET is to broadcast or send emergency message {{to each and every}} vehicle in range of danger zone, such that vehicles can get out of that area without any further problems. There are several broadcast schemes which are used but they are not efficient enough to prevent shadowing or intersection problem, broadcast storm and <b>connection</b> <b>hole</b> problem. In this paper we propose an idea which can deal with above problems and improve road safety measures using carry and forward technique...|$|E
40|$|VANET means Vehicular Adhoc Network {{which is}} an {{upcoming}} field and a new technology for intelligent transportation system. It has a tremendous potential to reduce the traffic related issues and also to provide safety to the drivers of the vehicles and the passengers. The {{most important part of}} VANET is the broadcasting of the messages to the vehicles in order to solve the problems like building shadow, <b>connection</b> <b>hole</b> and intersection problems. VANET sends emergency messages to the vehicles. In most applications VANET need to broadcast messages periodically to the other vehicles regarding to their positions. These broadcasting messages make it easy to track the vehicles in case of any anomaly. In this paper we study the different broadcasting schemes for broadcasting emergency messages...|$|E

50|$|The recent {{proliferation}} of symmetric NATs has reduced NAT traversal success rates in many practical situations, such as for mobile and public WiFi <b>connections.</b> <b>Hole</b> punching techniques, such as STUN and ICE, fail in traversing symmetric NATs {{without the help}} of a relay server, as is practiced in TURN. Techniques that traverse symmetric NATs by attempting to predict the next port to be opened by each NAT device were discovered in 2003 by Yutaka Takeda at Panasonic Communications Research Laboratory and in 2008 by researchers at Waseda University. Port prediction techniques are only effective with NAT devices that use known deterministic algorithms for port selection. This predictable yet non-static port allocation scheme is uncommon in large scale NATs such as those used in 4G LTE networks and therefore port prediction is largely ineffective on those mobile broadband networks.|$|R

50|$|Construction on the Archer Avenue subway {{began on}} October 23, 1973 at 159th Street and Beaver Road, {{just south of}} Archer Avenue, {{paving the way for}} the {{southeast}} Queens subway line and the demolition of the Jamaica Avenue Elevated from 129th Street to the 168th Street terminal. It was then expected that the subway would be complete by 1980 or 1981; the Jamaica elevated between Queens Boulevard and 168th Street was closed in September 1977. The first tunnel between the Jamaica Avenue Elevated and the Archer Avenue subway was holed through in October 1977. The second tunnel <b>connection</b> <b>holing</b> through of the Archer Avenue subway tunnels occurred in December 1977. In October 1979, groundbreaking for a 1,300 ft cut-and-cover section of the Archer Avenue line occurred, which would connect the line with the IND Queens Boulevard Line. This section also included the Jamaica-Van Wyck station. Most of the project was constructed via cut-and-cover methods, with portions of the lines excavated with tunneling shield methods.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} results of sixteen experiments of bolted slip-critical connections with fillers. Fifteen of the <b>connections</b> used oversized <b>holes</b> and one <b>connection</b> used standard <b>holes</b> to establish a baseline comparison. Such <b>connections</b> with oversized <b>holes</b> are commonly fabricated for use with structures such as long-span trusses, since the use of oversized holes allows erection in-place rather than first assessing fit-up on the ground. Filler plates are used to connect members of different depths or widths. The Specification for Structural Steel Buildings of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC, 2005) currently requires <b>connections</b> with oversized <b>holes</b> to be designed as slip-critical at what is termed the ???required strength level,??? for which a resistance factor (LRFD) ?? of 0. 85 and a safety factor ?? (ASD) of 1. 76 are specified. These slip strengths are typically below values {{that had been used}} for years in the Specification for Structural Steel Buildings: Allowable Stress Design and Plastic Design (AISC, 1989). In addition, when fillers are used in these connections, the AISC (2005) provisions do not require changes in the strength calculations, whereas if standard holes are used, options are provided for connection design that include reduction of the bolt shear strength or development of the connection. The sixteen experiments reported herein highlight the behavior of bolted steel <b>connections</b> with oversized <b>holes</b> in which fillers are included and are undeveloped, partially developed, or fully developed. Both single-ply and two-ply filler are investigated, as are welded fillers, and specimens fabricated using either turn-of-the-nut or tension-controlled bolts. Extensive instrumentation was used on the specimens to document the flow of forces through the connection. The results document the slip and shear strengths of these connections, propose formulas for assessing these strengths for the different conditions investigated, provide revised recommendations for design of these types of connections, and include suggestions for further work. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

Clients with private addresses may also easily connect to public servers, {{as long as}} the client behind a router or firewall initiates the <b>connection.</b> However, <b>hole</b> punching (or some other form of NAT traversal) is required to establish a direct connection between two clients that both reside behind different firewalls or routers that use network address translation (NAT).|$|R

40|$|Purpose: FEA {{analyses}} are frequently faced with modeling situations where field surface and changing contact cannot be assumed ignored. Design/methodology/approach: The effect {{of stress in}} machine elements due to friction between working machine parts has {{to be considered for}} analyzing the machine component with ANSYS software package. The interaction between the hole surface and pin was modeled with contact elements. In this study, examination of stress in pin-pin <b>hole</b> <b>connections</b> was carried out by using ANSYS program. Findings: The <b>connection</b> in pin-pin <b>hole</b> plates occurs between surface of pin hole in plate and side surfaces of pin. Stresses in contact surface of selected machine elements were investigated. three different materials such as steel, aluminium and structure steel were analyzed under three different rates of cylindrical plate radius r and length of hexagonal pin 2 h (r/h = 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5). Stress analysis was carried out in x, y and z axises.

40|$|Classical {{black holes}} {{are defined by}} the {{property}} that things can go in, but don't come out. However, Stephen Hawking calculated that black holes actually radiate quantum mechanical particles. The two important ingredients that result in back hole evaporation are (1) the spacetime geometry, in particular the black hole horizon, and (2) {{the fact that the}} notion of a "particle" is not an invariant concept in quantum field theory. These notes contain a step-by-step presentation of Hawking's calculation. We review portions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime and basic results about static black hole geometries, so that the discussion is self-contained. Calculations are presented for quantum particle production for an accelerated observer in flat spacetime, a black hole which forms from gravitational collapse, an eternal Schwarzschild black hole, and charged black holes in asymptotically deSitter spacetimes. The presentation highlights the similarities in all these calculations. Hawking radiation from black holes also points to a profound <b>connection</b> between black <b>hole</b> dynamics and classical thermodynamics. A theory of quantum gravity must predicting and explain black hole thermodynamics.
