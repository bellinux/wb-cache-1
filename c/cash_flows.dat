5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Scotland {{became one}} of the {{commercial}} and industrial centres of the British Empire. With tariffs with England now abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with Colonial America. However, the economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3million. Some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815. The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776–83), when it sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began {{to make up for the}} loss of the tobacco business, reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750–1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.|$|E

40|$|Understanding marketing’s {{contributions}} to the financial performance of firms is an important question for the field. A critical performance metric is <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability, or the potential for downside <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> outcomes relative to a target level. In Essay One, I conceptually develop the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability construct and distinguish it from a seemingly related construct, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility, by tracing their unique nomological networks. I also provide a deeper examination of how market-based assets reduce <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability. Specifically, I systematically describe the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of two market-based assets—brand equity and customer relationships—on <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability. In Essay Two, my focus is on two value appropriation activities that support brand equity and customer relationships—advertising and receivables management, respectively. I examine how the incremental effect of advertising expenditures and accounts receivable on <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> outcomes is moderated by two contextual factors: business scope (a firm characteristic) and consumer sentiment (an environmental characteristic). I simultaneously explore three <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> outcomes—levels, volatility, and vulnerability. To test these relationships, I utilize a dataset composed of over 2, 500 firms from 1999 to 2013. I find that the incremental effect of advertising and receivables on <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> outcomes is contingent on business scope and consumer sentiment and provide managers strategic prescriptions based on these findings. Specifically, (1) narrow business scope firms can maximize <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> performance via low levels of receivables; high levels of advertising increase <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> levels and decrease <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility, but not <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability; (2) broad business scope firms can increase <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> levels and reduce <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability via low levels of advertising and receivables; however, high levels of advertising and receivables are needed to reduce <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility; (3) when consumer sentiment is low, firms can maximize <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> performance via low levels of advertising and receivables; and (4) when consumer sentiment is high, no clear strategy emerges and firms must engage in trade-offs based on their <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> performance goals...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to examine whether <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{can be a good}} {{predictor}} to debt restructuring companies. Sixty companies of Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) have been identified as a sample in the current study. Thirty companies were classified as debt restructuring and another 30 matching companies were classified as non-debt restructuring companies. The classification was done {{in order to determine the}} differences between <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> related ratios such as <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> changes, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> over total debt, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> over total assets, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> over current liabilities and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> per share issued. The study hypothesized that the means for the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> based ratios have no significant difference between debt restructuring and non-debt restructuring companies. Based on trend analysis, there is no obvious pattern obtained from the graph plotted using average figure for each of the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> related ratios.

While <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> covariance is of firstorder importance in explaining the cross-sectional variation of risk premia, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> duration still provides additional explanatory power through a second-order interaction term. <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> duration is particularly important in explaining the value premium given as value and growth stocks have significantly different durations. Empirically, I measure both <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics using only consumption and accounting data.

40|$|Noteworthy {{growth in}} free <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{has been well}} {{reported}} {{over the past few}} years as company management, financial analysts, and investors increasingly focus on <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> to validate reported earnings. Unfortunately, the calculation of free <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> has limitations, just like earnings.
