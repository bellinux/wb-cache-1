40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} lactic acid on immune mediator release from vaginal epithelial cells. METHODS: The human vaginal epithelial cell line, VK 2 /E 6 E 7, was cultured in {{the presence or absence}} of physiological concentrations of lactic acid, and in {{the presence or absence of}} the viral Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, poly (inosinic acid: <b>cytidylic</b> <b>acid).</b> Supernatants were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 23, transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. RESULTS: Vaginal epithelial cells spontaneously released IL- 1 beta (25. 9 pg/mL), IL- 8 (1. 0 ng/mL), TGF-beta (175 pg/mL), and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (33. 8 ng/mL). Only TGF-beta production was marginally enhanced (49 %) by addition of lactic acid alone. Poly (inosinic acid: <b>cytidylic</b> <b>acid)</b> by itself stimulated the release of IL- 6 (305 pg/mL) and enhanced IL- 8 production (2. 8 ng/mL). The combination of poly (inosinic acid: <b>cytidylic</b> <b>acid)</b> and lactic acid markedly increased IL- 8 production (5. 0 ng/mL) and induced the release of IL- 1 beta (96. 2 pg/mL). The poly (inosinic acid: <b>cytidylic</b> <b>acid)</b> -mediated lactic acid effect on IL- 1 beta and IL- 8 release was abrogated when the lactic acid was neutralized or if acetic acid was substituted for lactic acid. CONCLUSION: Lactic acid enhances the release of selective mediators from vaginal epithelial cells and stimulates antiviral immune responses.

With suboptimal concentrations of liver extract, the inhibition was reversed by nucleotides of adenine, guanine, uracil, cytosine, and thymine. When the medium contained partially purified sources of the two growth factors rather than crude liver extract, fewer compounds reversed the inhibition. Adenylic acid and guanylic acid reversed the action of either inhibitor. Inosinic acid reversed inhibition caused by deoxyguanylic acid, but not that caused by deoxyadenylic acid.

Poly I:C, at doses of 2, 6 and 12 mg/kg, induced a dose‚Äìresponsive sickness behaviour, decreasing locomotor activity, burrowing and body weight, and caused a mild hyperthermia at 6 h. The 12 mg/kg dose caused significant hypothermia at later times. The Remo 400 remote Telemetry system proved a sensitive measure of this biphasic temperature response. The behavioural responses to poly I:C were not significantly blunted upon a second poly I:C challenge either 1 or 3 weeks later. Plasma concentrations of IL- 6, TNF-? and IFN-? were markedly elevated and IL- 1 ? was also detectable. Cytokine synthesis within the CNS, as determined by quantitative PCR, was dominated by IL- 6, with lesser inductions of IL- 1 ?, TNF-? and IFN-? and there was a clear activation of cyclooxygenase- 2 at the brain endothelium. These findings demonstrate clear CNS effects of peripheral TLR 3 stimulation and will be useful in studying aspects of the effects of systemic viral infection on brain function in both normal and pathological situations...|$|E
40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease virus RNA {{has been treated}} with RNase H in the {{presence}} of oligo (dG) specifically to digest the poly(C) tract which lies near the 5 ' end of the molecule (10). The short (S) fragment containing the 5 ' end of the RNA was separated from the remainder of the RNA (L fragment) by gel electrophoresis. RNA ligase mediated labelling of the 3 ' end of S fragment showed that the RNase H digestion gave rise to molecules that differed only in the number of <b>cytidylic</b> <b>acid</b> residues remaining at their 3 ' ends and did not leave the unique 3 ' end necessary for fast sequence analysis. As the 5 ' end of S fragment prepared form virus RNA is blocked by VPg, S fragment was prepared from virus specific messenger RNA which does not contain this protein. This RNA was labelled at the 5 ' end using polynucleotide kinase and the sequence of 70 nucleotides at the 5 ' end determined by partial enzyme digestion sequencing on polyacrylamide gels. Some of this sequence was confirmed from an analysis of the oligonucleotides derived by RNase T 1 digestion of S fragment. The sequence obtained indicates that there is a stable hairpin loop at the 5 ' terminus of the RNA before an initiation codon 33 nucleotides from the 5 ' end. In addition, the RNase T 1 analysis suggests that there are short repeated sequences in S fragment and that an eleven nucleotide inverted complementary repeat of a sequence near the 3 ' end of the RNA is present at the junction of S fragment and the poly(C) tract...|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} {{an unusual}} codon-specific translational suppressor in Escherichia coli. The suppressor {{resulted from a}} spontaneous mutation in a chromosomal gene during a selection for suppressors of the auxotrophic nonsense mutation trpA(UGA 211). The suppressor allows readthrough of UGA mutations at two positions in trpA and at two sites in bacteriophage T 4. It does not, however, suppress amber (UAG) or ochre (UAA) mutations that were tested in both genomes, {{some of which were}} at the same positions as the suppressible UGA mutations. The suppressor also does not allow mistranslation of the UGA-related trpA missense mutations UGG at positions 211 and 234, AGA at 211 and 234, CGA at 211, or UGU and UGC at 234. The suppressor mutation was mapped by genetic procedures to position 89 on the E. coli genetic map. Localization of the suppressor mutation to rrnB was achieved by cloning it in the low-copy-number plasmid pEJM 007 by in vivo recombination from the chromosome. Recloning in bacteriophage M 13 and subsequent DNA sequence analysis allowed the identification of the suppressor mutation as a deletion of the <b>cytidylic</b> <b>acid</b> residue at nucleotide position 1054 of the 16 S ribosomal RNA. The mutant EcoRI-Xba I fragment from the suppressor gene was recloned, from M 13, in an otherwise wild-type rrnB in the plasmid pEJM 007, and UGA suppression was examined. The UGA-suppressing activity of the reconstructed suppressor-containing pEJM 007 was indistinguishable from that of the original recombinant suppressor-containing plasmid. This result demonstrates that the C 1054 deletion in 16 S rRNA is both necessary and sufficient for UGA suppression. The existence of this mutant suggests an important role for rRNA in codon recognition, at least for accurate polypeptide chain termination...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} polyribonucleotides {{adenylic acid}} (poly A), uridylic acid (poly U), <b>cytidylic</b> <b>acid</b> (poly C), and inosinic acid (poly I), whether single- or double-stranded (poly A:U, poly I:C), cannot replace mycobacterial ribonucleic acid (RNA) {{in the production}} of a high immune response in CF- 1 mice against tuberculous disease. These conclusions are {{based on the results of}} several types of experiments. (i) Poly A and poly U, used either singly or in combination, did not increase the immunogenicity of mycobacterial RNA preparations whether emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) or not emulsified. (ii) Mycobacterial ribosomal protein, extracted with 2 -chloroethanol, was not immunogenic; the addition of poly A:U to the protein did not produce an immune response and FIA did not affect these results. (iii) The RNA left after the protein was extracted was partially immunogenic when emulsified in FIA even though it was partially degraded. (iv) Mycobacterial RNA prepared with ethyl alcohol and partially degraded with ribonuclease had a significantly lower immunogenic activity, and the original higher immune response was not restored by the addition of poly A:U. (v) Mycobacterial RNA totally degraded by weak alkali was not immunogenic, the original immunogenic activity was not restored by the addition of poly A:U or poly I:C, and FIA again did not influence the results. These findings suggest that (i) protein, polypeptides, or other antigenic fragments, if present, are not the specific immunogens; and (ii) mycobacterial RNA is responsible for the high immunogenic activity of mycobacterial ribosomal and RNA preparations. In addition, since the double-stranded forms of these synthetic polynucleotides markedly potentiate the formation of circulating antibodies, these results also reemphasize the lack of correlation between conventional antibody formation and immunity against tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|F 1 hybrid {{offspring}} of New Zealand Black mothers and New Zealand White fathers [(NZB X NZW) F 1] female mice develop antibodies to single-stranded (ss) and native DNA, immune complex glomerulonephritis, massive proteinuria, and premature death with renal failure. By {{a series of}} matings, congenic (NZB X NZW) F 1. xid/xid mice were prepared. These mice were different from (NZB X NZW) F 1 mice in having the X chromosome-linked immune deficiency gene, xid, in homozygous form. Such congenic (NZB X NZW) F 1. xid/xid females failed to develop antibodies to single-stranded or native DNA. They also failed to develop fatal renal disease as measured by proteinuria, glomerular histology, glomerular immunofluorescence, and survival. To control for unknown genetic factors, studies were performed with littermates that were derived by mating NZB. xid/+ females with NZW. xid/Y males such that the resulting offspring were either (NZB X NZW) F 1. xid/xid (and therefore "defective") or (NZB X NZW) F 1. xid/+ [phenotypically like (NZB X NZW) F 1]. In these and in additional studies, mice were housed in the same cages and identified by ear tagging {{so as to avoid}} possible environmental variations from cage to cage. In these studies, xid/xid mice failed to develop the characteristic signs of autoimmunity, whereas the controls did. Similar results were also obtained with (NZW X NZB) F 1 xid/xid mice compared with (NZW X NZB) F 1 xid/+ mice. The effect of xid/xid upon (NZB X NZW) F 1 mice was further investigated by assessing responses to immunization and polyclonal B cell activation in vivo. The xid/xid mice failed to produce anti-ssDNA following immunization with ssDNA complexed to a protein carrier in fluid form or even emulsified in adjuvant. Finally, the xid/xid mice failed to produce antiDNA in response to multiple injections of the polyclonal activator, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or the polyclonal activator, polyribose inosinic acid. polyribose <b>cytidylic</b> <b>acid.</b> However, the xid/xid mice were neither generally hyporesponsive nor unable to recognize LPS because they made normal antibody responses following immunization with LPS to which multiple trinitrophenyl groups were chemically attached. We conclude from these studies that xid/xid, which is known to cause the deletion of a B cell subset, has a profound affect upon (NZB X NZW) F 1 mice, rendering them insusceptible to the naturally occurring autoimmune disease characteristic of (NZB X NZW) F 1 mice, and preventing them from producing antibodies to DNA despite purposeful immunization and polyclonal B cell activation. These results force a reevaluation of previous concepts regarding the mechanisms by which xid/xid might interfere with the development of autoimmunity, and a consideration of therapeutic implications...|$|E
