40|$|INTRODUCTION: Myelinolysis {{is defined}} as acute demyelinating disorder, {{associated}} with flaccid quadriplegia, speech and swallowing impairment. The pathogenesis is usually related to hydroelectrolytic imbalance, particularly with severe hyponatremia and its rapid correction.

AIM: The authors present a clinical case focusing on the follow up, rehabilitation program, and giving importance to functionality gains. The main clinical intercurrences related to the late diagnosis are also reported. CLINICAL CASE: A female patient with documented past psychiatric history and polidipsia was admitted with repeated seizures unsuccessfully controlled by drugs. Hyponatremia was identified and corrected. After the correction, a quadriplegia and a generalized hypotonia were noticed and the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging.

30|$|Patients and methods: A web {{anonymous}} survey {{including a}} summarized clinical report of four patients who {{stayed in the}} ICU was submitted to French intensivists. Patient 1 presented with prolonged hypoglycemic coma, patient 2 with intracerebral hemorrhage, patient 3 with <b>central</b> and extra <b>pontine</b> <b>myelinolysis,</b> patient 4 with a brainstem hemorrhage. All these patients received full treatment in the ICU and had a 6 -month follow-up. Physicians were provided with the four clinical vignettes including clinical history, brain imaging and other relevant exams (CSF, EEG,…), evolution of symptoms within {{the first days of}} the ICU stay. They had to estimate 6 -month outcome using modified Rankin scale (mRS) where a score from 0 to 3 was considered as a good outcome and 4 to 6 as a poor outcome. They had to provide a recommendation about care among the following—full treatment, care limitation, care withdrawal.|$|R
40|$|<b>Central</b> <b>pontine</b> and extra-pontine <b>myelinolysis</b> (CPM/EPM) {{is a rare}} {{neurological}} disorder, {{well documented}} for more than 50 years but whose pathogenesis remains obscure.

Alcohol withdrawal represents an additional vulnerability factor, being responsible for electrolyte imbalances which are not always demonstrable but are certainly involved in the development of CPM and/or EPM. CPM/EPM may be responsible for severe morbidity and is potentially life-threatening. The diagnosis of CPM/ EPM remains mostly clinical and is confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. It should be considered in the setting of any unexplained neurological symptoms during the course of alcohol withdrawal or for any patient with chronic alcohol abuse, as promptly as possible, given the potentially fatal outcome.

50|$|Care must {{be taken}} when {{correcting}} hyponatremia. A rapid rise in the sodium level may cause <b>central</b> <b>pontine</b> <b>myelinolysis.</b> Avoid correction by more than 12 mEq/L/day. Initial treatment with hypertonic saline may abruptly lead to a rapid dilute diuresis and fall in ADH.

50|$|<b>Central</b> <b>pontine</b> <b>myelinolysis</b> (CPM), {{also known}} as osmotic {{demyelination}} syndrome or central pontine demyelination, is a neurological disorder caused by severe damage of the myelin sheath of nerve cells {{in the area of}} the brainstem termed the pons, predominately of iatrogenic, treatment-induced cause.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{complex interplay}} between hypernatremic osmotic {{disturbances}} and cerebral lesions {{is yet to}} be clarified. In this review, we discuss, {{on the basis of the}} reported data of hypernatremic CNS challenge in the adult population, the clinical and radiologic features of the condition. Our search captured 20 case studies and 1 case series with 30 patients in total who acquired acute hypernatremia due to different etiologies and developed CNS lesions. We explored the associations between premorbid conditions, clinical presentation, hypernatremic state, correction rate, and radiologic appearance, including the localization of brain lesions and the outcomes. The results revealed that altered mental status was the most commonly reported symptom and osmotic demyelination syndrome in the form of extrapontine myelinolysis was the prevailing radiologic pattern. Finally, we contrasted, when appropriate, clinical and experimental data related to hypernatremic and hyponatremic osmotic insults to aid the understanding of the pathophysiology of CNS osmotic brain injury.

50|$|<b>Central</b> <b>pontine</b> <b>myelinolysis</b> {{presents}} {{most commonly}} as a complication of treatment {{of patients with}} profound hyponatremia (low sodium), which can result from a varied spectrum of conditions, based on different mechanisms. It occurs {{as a consequence of}} a rapid rise in serum tonicity following treatment in individuals with chronic, severe hyponatremia who have made intracellular adaptations to the prevailing hypotonicity.|$|E
50|$|Hypertonic saline may {{be given}} intravenously, however this must be done {{carefully}} as a rapid increase in serum sodium concentration may lead to <b>central</b> <b>pontine</b> <b>myelinolysis.</b> Concurrently the slow administration of intravenous diuretics such as furosemide can correct the sodium by diuresis, however these should be given with caution as they may paradoxically cause a reduction in serum sodium concentration. Raising the sodium {{at a rate of}} 1 mmol/L/hour is considered safe.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} cases of hyponatremia, extreme caution {{must be taken}} to avoid the fatal {{consequences}} of rapidly correcting electrolytes (e.g. <b>Central</b> <b>pontine</b> <b>myelinolysis,</b> edema). Special considerations with the treatment of potomania are needed. Because this could be a chronic condition, low sodium may be normal for the patient, so an especially careful correction is warranted. It is also very important to note that due to the normal kidney function, and lack of other intrinsic or toxic cause of the electrolyte disturbance, restoration of dietary solutes will correct the electrolytes to normal serum levels. This again must be done with caution.|$|E
40|$|Excess {{absorption}} of fluid distention media remains an unpredictable complication of operative hysteroscopy and {{may lead to}} lethal conditions.

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} feared {{complications}} during hysteroscopic surgery is haemodilution by absorption of distension media. One facet of haemodilution, i. e. hyponatremia, can lead to respiratory distress, pulmonary oedema, as well as cardiovascular collapse. Case presentation: Here we report the swift recovery of a 45 year, female, Caucasian patient with acute hyponatremia (74 mEq/L) and pulmonary oedema by the employment of rapid correctional strategies. Conclusion: The absorption of irrigation fluids, as presented in this case, is an inevitable side effect of hysteroscopic surgery. Utmost caution should, therefore, be mandatory to reduce and actively monitor fluid intake. If these measures fail, {{as in the case}} presented here, it is essential to rapidly eliminate any free water and to normalize the sodium levels.
