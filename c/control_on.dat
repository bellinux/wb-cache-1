40|$|A {{number of}} authors have {{recently}} argued that, {{in order to}} avoid financial instability, emerging countries should rely <b>on</b> capital <b>controls.</b> Two type of controls have been considered: <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> capital outflows, and <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> capital inflows. In this paper I review the historical evidence on the effectiveness of these two type of controls. I argue that <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> outflows have been ineffective.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the East Asian crisis a number of authors have argued that capital mobility is highly destabilizing, and that emerging countries would benefit from restricting capital flows. In this paper I investigate, from a historical perspective, the effectiveness of capital controls. I deal with Tobin taxes, <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> outflows and <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> inflows. I argue that <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> outflows have seldom worked as expected. They introduce major distortions and breed corruption. Market-based <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> inflows - similar to those implemented by Chile - have the potential for lengthening the maturity of foreign debt.

Despite {{the loss of}} Lindwall for 15 at 275/8, Tallon kept on batting, supported by Johnston and Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Australia's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston—who scored 29— before becoming Bedser's second victim for the morning. Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston was stumped from Wright's leg spin. Yardley was later criticised for not bringing Wright into the attack at an earlier stage, as the Australian tail were dealing well with the English pacemen. Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers, ending with 4/100 from 43 overs, while debutant Coxon took 2/90 from 35 overs.|$|E
