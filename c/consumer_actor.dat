40|$|The {{notion of}} {{creating}} unique and memorable experiences for consumers has become of primary importance for tourism research and practice. The way contemporary tourist experiences are created has however undergone a fundamental change. Experiences are transforming as consumers are increasingly empowered to co-create their own experiences. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have represented a catalyst {{of change that}} has opened unprecedented possibilities for tourist experience creation and enhancement. While the literature has recognised these paradigm shifts within the service-dominant logic and the services marketing and management discipline, a holistic understanding of this phenomenon is still missing to date. This doctoral study therefore aims to explore how the tourist experience can be enhanced by ICTs through company-consumer experience co-creation, throughout all stages of the travel process, i. e. pre/during/post travel. This thesis integrates the three theoretical streams of tourist experience, co-creation and ICTs to explore, conceptualise and develop the Technology Enhanced Tourist Experience concept. A comprehensive qualitative mixed methods strategy comprising three main research phases was adopted, consisting of a) a qualitative content analysis, b) a multiple case study and c) semi-structured consumer in-depth interviews to triangulate the findings and allow for a holistic knowledge development. The most significant findings contribute to knowledge by offering a) a comprehensive understanding of the granular elements of the tourist experience, b) both a company and <b>consumer</b> <b>actor</b> perspective on experience co-creation, c) a detailed enhancement process of the tourist experience through ICTs and d) a holistic model depicting the twelve distinct factors of the Technology Enhanced Tourist Experience. This study makes an original contribution to the services marketing and management discipline on a wider level and the three theoretical streams in specific. This thesis is significant and original {{in that it is}} the first study to explore the Technology Enhanced Tourist Experience and to create a theoretical foundation of this concept. The strength of this work thus lies in developing several conceptualisations and models that advance the service-dominant logic and provide critical strategic implications for services marketing and management practice. This knowledge has also wider implications and makes an impact on a global business, societal, technological and policy level beyond...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{presentation}} discusses {{findings from}} an ethnographic study of “school swappers” in Brittany, France: these are students {{who go to}} a private school and then to a public school and those who move from a public school {{to a private school}}. The French school system is made up of two sectors of education: the public or secular sector and the private sector in which the catholic faith schools represent ninety-five percent. Structural modifications have changed the double schooling system and the place of each sector in French society. Since the 1950 s, private education has known institutional transformations which have moved it closer to public education, especially since the 1959 law known as the “loi Debré” with the state contract: private education is identified as a “private service of public utility”. The function of private schooling changed again in the eighties: though its main vocation remained religious instruction, it was being used more and more as a “second chance” by parents of pupils encountering difficulties in public schools (Prost, 1982). At the same time, in a study on family choice, Robert Ballion (1982) observed changes in families’ behaviour: he underlined the increased demand for the best education possible and interpreted it as a “strategy” comparable to the one used by an informed and <b>consumer</b> <b>actor.</b> Reasons of geographical proximity or teachers’ availability also explain the choice of schools by families (Langouët & Léger, 1997; van Zanten, 2009). A larger part of the private sector is today dominated by state-subsidized and state-supervised catholic educational institutions. In the past and increasingly today with the introduction of more flexible catchment areas, private schools are part of the ordinary school landscape. The reconciliation of the two sectors creates favorable conditions for transfer students. The recourse to “school-swapping” hasn't stopped increasing: approximately 40 % of the students go at least for one year to a private school in France. Although “school-swapping” affects a high proportion of pupils and families, this issue is not widely-explored in the research and when it is addressed; it is often through quantitative and macrosociological methodology (Langouët & Léger, 1994; Reddy, 1994). But why do students change schools? How does each student live the change of school sector? What differences do they perceive? So our research questions the lived school experience of “school-swappers”, focusing particularly on the effects of the schooling context (Duru-Bellat & Mingat, 1988; Dubet & Martuccelli, 1996; Leroy-Audouin & Piquée, 2004). Indeed the context plays a fundamental role and has a strong impact (Hofman, Hofman, & Gray, 2008). What are the conditions for achieving school success? To what extent does the internal organization of education, notably through "relational styles", influence the subjective experience of “school-swappers”?Our methodology seeks to study the lived school experience of “school-swappers” and analyze the logic behind the functioning of each sector of education in Brittany. The fieldwork takes place in four secondary schools of different sizes located either in the country, or in semi-urban environment. The data collection consists of interviews with the students who have changed school and observations in class and on the playground for example. The ethnographer goes into school space during one school year. The immersion into the students’ and school actors’ daily life enables the researcher to find support, confidants, and informants (Woods, 1990; Reed-Danahay, 2007). The investigation becomes deeper with the interviews, when the actors explain their actions, their daily activities, their relationships with the other people. The repetition of some expressions, of some words in the interviews is an indicator of the actors’ experience. Also, these two bodies of data enable us to create links between the actors’ declarations and their practices. The school experience of students is singular. The change of school, chosen or not, perceived as a strength or a weakness by students, affects differently their subjective experience. Students perceive differences between schools, not necessarily between sectors. Beyond their individual characteristics, the school environment influences students’ lived experience. Relationships with teachers and peer group prove central in defining the school experience of students. Each school is a “world”, with a universe of speeches and practises. Each school is marked by its geographical and social location, its culture, buildings, the interactions between actors, the management style, and also other dimensions which are common to schools of both sectors, but every dimension has a particular position. This combination of elements can explain pupils' differentiated subjective experience...|$|E
