6000|$|Threading his way {{among the}} streets of [...] "Settlers' Town," [...] and pushing vigorously through the <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> beings who peopled it, George Dally led his new acquaintances to a tent in the {{outskirts}} of the camp-- a suburban tent, as it were.|$|R
6000|$|Kipps made stockish noises, and {{the young}} lady {{suddenly}} became the nucleus of a party <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> <b>friends</b> who were forming a syndicate to guess, and barred his escape.

In order to be prepared for emergencies Rob had taken the electric tube from his pocket, and now, as he examined the dress and features of the people below, the tube suddenly slipped from his grasp and fell to the ground, where one end stuck slantingly into the soft earth.|$|R
60|$|The {{conversation}} between the Druid and Parta had been heard by {{others in the}} hall, and the news spread rapidly among the tribesmen as they returned from the chase. Shouts of fury and indignation rose outside, {{and several of the}} minor chiefs, followed by a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> men, poured into the hall, demanding with loud shouts that war should be declared against the Romans. The Druid advanced {{to the edge of the}} dais.|$|R

60|$|The rifle flashed {{out with}} a loud report, and the great tawny beast sprang {{to one side and}} then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> natives had swarmed on to the scene, and their {{shouting}} speedily carried the glad news to the village, where a thumping of tom-toms took up the chorus of triumph. And their triumph and rejoicing found a ready echo in the heart of Mrs. Packletide; already that luncheon-party in Curzon Street seemed immeasurably nearer.|$|R

He held in {{his hand}} the huge silver-gilt padlock of the Ka’abah,[FN#10] and {{presently}} taking his seat upon a kind of wooden press in the left corner of the hall, he officially inquired my name, nation, and other particulars. The replies were satisfactory, and the boy Mohammed was authoritatively ordered to conduct me round the building, and to recite the prayers.

60|$|So {{one morning}} about dawn the young giant and his {{brothers}} had set to work to make a road about the world. They {{seem to have had}} an inkling of opposition impending, and they had worked with remarkable vigour. The world had discovered them soon enough, driving that road as straight as a flight of a bullet towards the English Channel, already some miles of it levelled and made and stamped hard. They had been stopped before midday by a vast <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> people, owners <b>of</b> land, land agents, local authorities, lawyers, policemen, soldiers even.|$|R
60|$|It {{may seem}} illogical to the reader, but this {{deference}} {{on the part}} of the old soldier did not amuse me. On the contrary it hurt me. A little pang went through me every time he yielded his leadership. I hated to see him display the slightest evidence of age, of weakness. I would rather have had him storm than sigh. Part of his irresolution, his timidity, was due, as I could see, to the unwonted noise, and to the <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> men, but more of it came from the vague alarm of self-distrust which are signs of advancing years.|$|R

60|$|As {{he and his}} {{companion}} pushed {{their way through the}} excited crowd that swarmed beneath these voices, towards the exit, Graham conceived more clearly the proportion and features of this room. Altogether, great and small, there must have been nearly a thousand of these erections, piping, hooting, bawling and gabbling in that great space, each with its <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> listeners, the majority of them men dressed in blue canvas. There were all sizes of machines, from the little gossiping mechanisms that chuckled out mechanical sarcasm in odd corners, through a number of grades to such fifty-foot giants as that which had first hooted over Graham.|$|R
60|$|<b>Crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited,</b> {{shouting}} children ran chattering {{along the}} pavements. The colliers, as they tramped grey and heavy, in an intermittent stream uphill {{from the low}} grey west, stood on the pavement in wonder as the cavalcade approached and passed, jingling the silver bells of its trappings, vibrating the wonderful colours of the barred blankets and saddle cloths, the scarlet wool of the accoutrements, the bright tips of feathers. Women shrieked as Ciccio, in his war-paint, wheeled near the pavement. Children screamed and ran. The colliers shouted. Ciccio smiled in his terrifying war-paint, brandished his spear and trotted softly, like a flower on its stem, round to the procession.|$|R
50|$|Indra Jatra: This festival {{named after}} Lord Indra - the God of Rain {{and also the}} King of Heaven is celebrated by both the Buddhists and Hindus in Nepal in August/September. This festival lasts for eight days with singing, mask dancing and rejoicing. The chariot of Kumari - the Living Goddess is taken through the main streets of Kathmandu with much fanfare. On the first day, the King of Nepal also pays homage to Goddess Kumari. The <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> people from {{performers}} to spectators engulfs the streets of Kathmandu during this festival. People get to enjoy various classical dances like elephant dance, lakhe - a very popular dance {{of a man with}} a mask.|$|R
60|$|The big Kafir came on at once, {{and made}} a blow at Pat's head with his knob-kerrie that would have ended the fight at once if it had taken effect, but the Irishman, well trained in the art, guarded it neatly, and {{returned}} with a blow so swift and vigorous that it fell on the pate of the savage like a flail. As well might Pat have hit a rock. If {{there is a strong}} point about a black man, it is his head. The Irish man knew this, but had forgotten it in the first flush of combat. He became wiser. Meanwhile a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> traders and Kafirs gathered round the combatants and backed them.|$|R

Sandro stops to admire her beauty. Zuria says he heard stories that Anna was spotted by a chemist in Troina. After bribing Zuria to run another story on Anna, Sandro heads to Troina. Meanwhile, Claudia meets up with her boating companions at Corrado's Villa Montaldo in Palermo. No one seems to take Anna's disappearance seriously except Claudia. Even Corrado's young wife Giulia openly flirts with the young prince {{in front of her}} husband.

5000|$|The Austrian writer Charles Sealsfield {{first used}} the word ahoy in its {{original}} form. Sealsfield, who was also known by his real name Carl Anton Postl, lived temporarily in New Orleans, where he had many contacts with sailors. In his novel Morton oder die große Tour, which was published {{for the first time}} in Zürich in 1835, a big <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> people in Piccadilly Circus in London is summoned with the exclamation [...] "Gare! Gare! take care! Hallo ho! A hoy!". The same exclamation is still to be found in the following editions of 1844 and 1846. In the footnotes to a reprint, the word Gare was appropriately corrected to Care, but wrongly used in the text in all three editions. The English form is correctly given, in two words, which was very common at that time.|$|R

"Winder's {{situation}} was an unenviable one.[A] With a comparatively strong foe on his front, ready to fall upon him or the capital {{he was expected}} to defend, he had only about twenty-five hundred armed and effective men in camp, and many of these had been from their homes only three or four days. They were undisciplined and untried, and surrounded and influenced by a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> civilians, to whose officious but well-intended information and advice the general was compelled to listen. In addition to this intrusion and interference of common men, he was embarrassed by the presence and suggestions of the President and his Cabinet ministers, the most of them utterly ignorant of military affairs. Better would it have been for Winder and the country if these civilians, from the President down, had kept away from the camp and the field, and prudently preserved silence." ...|$|R
2500|$|Later on 23 August, the British {{authorities}} armed 41 Jewish special constables, 18 Jewish ex-soldiers and {{a further}} 60 Jews were issued staves, {{to assist in}} the defense of Jewish quarters in Jerusalem. The following day, Arab notables issued a statement that [...] "many rumours and reports of various kinds have spread to the effect that Government had enlisted and armed certain Jews, that they had enrolled Jewish ex-soldiers who had served in the Great War; and the Government forces were firing at Arabs exclusively". The Mufti of Jerusalem stated that there was a large <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> Arabs in the Haram area who were also demanding arms, and that the excited crowd in the Haram area took the view that the retention of Jews as special constables carrying arms was a breach of faith by the Government. The Government initially denied the rumours, but by 27 August they were forced to disband and disarm the special constables.|$|R
60|$|He {{was lying}} on a little patch of grass beside {{one of the main}} avenues of the aeronautic park. The {{airships}} receded down a great vista, an immense perspective, and the blunt prow of each was adorned with a black eagle of a hundred feet or so spread. Down {{the other side of the}} avenue ran a series of gas generators, and big hose-pipes trailed everywhere across the intervening space. Close at hand was his now nearly deflated balloon and the car on its side looking minutely small, a mere broken toy, a shrivelled bubble, in contrast with the gigantic bulk of the nearer airship. This he saw almost end-on, rising like a cliff and sloping forward towards its fellow on the other side so as to overshadow the alley between them. There was a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> people about him, big men mostly in tight uniforms. Everybody was talking, and several were shouting, in German; he knew that because they splashed and aspirated sounds like startled kittens.|$|R
500|$|Dr. Hibbert {{introduces}} a frail Ben Matlock to a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> seniors at the Grand Opening of the Center for Geriatric Medicine. After seeing his idol mobbed {{to the ground}} by fans, Grampa becomes aware of his mortality and gives the family their inheritances early. He leaves the family a box of old silver dollars that they decide to spend at the mall right away. At the mall, Lisa sees the new talking Malibu Stacy doll in a toy store. Throughout the trip home, Grampa constantly tells stories and spouts useless advice, making the family shun him. Back home, Lisa is anxious {{to hear what the}} talking Malibu Stacy has to say, but is disappointed with her sexist phrases (such as [...] "Don't ask me, I'm just a girl" [...] and [...] "Thinking too much gives you wrinkles"). Lisa is angry that no one else can see the ridiculousness of the doll. She and Grampa sit at the kitchen table, bemoaning how they are treated because of their age while both of them decide to change, Grampa to get a job, and Lisa to find Malibu Stacy's creator, Stacy Lovell.|$|R
6000|$|My second [...] "chiel" [...] {{will take}} notes {{to the effect}} that while a {{friendly}} game of pinochle was in progress in the tenement rooms of Mrs. Andy McCarty, a lady guest named Ruby O'Hara threw a burglar down six flights of stairs, where he was pinioned and held by a two-thousand-dollar English bulldog amid a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> five hundred <b>excited</b> spectators.|$|R

60|$|The {{manner in}} which one so {{generally}} regarded with indifference, if not with contempt, had been selected from all that <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> courtiers, <b>excited</b> some surprise; but as the ordinary business of the antechamber went on, and the subordinates of office soon appeared in the rooms, to hear solicitations and answer questions, the affair was quickly forgotten. Luis withdrew disappointed, for {{he had hoped to}} enjoy another long discourse with Columbus, on a subject which, as it was connected with his dearest hopes, now occupied most of his thoughts. We shall leave him, however, and all in the ante-chambers, to follow the great navigator further into the depths of the palace.|$|R

An <b>excited</b> <b>crowd</b> cheered as Hook continued to reign blows on Salica in late rounds, {{but was unable to}} capture the decision.|$|R
6000|$|Someone {{brought a}} sheet from the [...] "Jolly Cricketers," [...] and having covered him, they carried him into that house. And there it was, on a shabby {{bed in a}} tawdry, ill-lighted bedroom, {{surrounded}} by a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> ignorant and <b>excited</b> people, broken and wounded, betrayed and unpitied, that Griffin, the first of all men to make himself invisible, Griffin, the most gifted physicist {{the world has ever}} seen, ended in infinite disaster his strange and terrible career.|$|R
6000|$|At Alos in Achaia Phthiotis, the {{stranger}} MIGHT {{have seen an}} extraordinary spectacle, though we admit that the odds would have been highly against his chance of witnessing the following events. As {{the stranger}} approaches the town-hall, he observes an elderly and most respectable citizen strolling in the same direction. The citizen is so lost in thought that apparently he does not notice where he is going. Behind him comes a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> but silent people, who watch him with intense interest. The citizen reaches {{the steps of the}} town-hall, while the excitement of his friends behind increases visibly. Without thinking, the elderly person enters the building. With a wild and un-Aryan howl, the other people of Alos are down on him, pinion him, wreathe him with flowery garlands, and, lead him to the temple of Zeus Laphystius, or [...] "The Glutton," [...] where he is solemnly sacrificed on the altar. This was the custom of the good Greeks of Alos whenever a descendant of the house of Athamas entered the Prytaneion. Of course the family were very careful, as a rule, to keep at a safe distance from the forbidden place. [...] "What a sacrifice for Greeks!" [...] as the author of the Minos(1) says in that dialogue which is incorrectly attributed to Plato. [...] "He cannot get out except to be sacrificed," [...] says Herodotus, speaking of the unlucky descendant of Athamas. The custom appears to have existed as late as the time of the scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius.(2) ...|$|R
60|$|While we looked, {{the waters}} {{increased}} so fast {{in this place}} {{that in a few}} minutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin encroaching steadily on the logs. We suddenly realized that this flood was not a mere holiday spectacle, but meant damage--and not only to the small log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river, for the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations and invading the great hay-corral adjoining. We ran down and joined the <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> men and frightened animals. We waded knee-deep into the log stable, unfastened the horses and waded out almost waist-deep, so fast the waters increased. Then the crowd rushed in a body to the hay-corral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of baled hay and roll the bales up on the high ground by the house. Meantime it was discovered that Owens, an overland driver, was missing, and a man ran to the large stable, and wading in, boot-top deep, discovered him asleep in his bed, awoke him, and waded out again. But Owens was drowsy and resumed his nap; but only for a minute or two, for presently he turned in his bed, his hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water! It was up level with the mattress! He waded out, breast-deep, almost, and the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted down like sugar and the big building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling.|$|R
6000|$|... "'A {{scene of}} {{excitement}} that recalled the palmy days of '49 was witnessed {{last night at}} the Arcade Saloon. A stranger, who might have belonged to that reckless epoch, and who bore every evidence of being a successful Pike County miner out on a [...] "spree," [...] appeared at one of the tables with a negro coachman bearing two heavy bags of gold. Selecting a faro-bank as his base of operations, he began to bet heavily and with apparent recklessness, until his play excited the breathless attention of every one. In a few moments he had won a sum variously estimated at from eighty to a hundred thousand dollars. A rumor went round the room that it was a concerted attempt to [...] "break the bank" [...] rather than the drunken freak of a Western miner, dazzled by some successful strike. To this theory the man's careless and indifferent bearing towards his extraordinary gains lent great credence. The attempt, if such it was, however, was unsuccessful. After winning ten times in succession the luck turned, and the unfortunate [...] "bucker" [...] was cleared out not only of his gains, but of his original investment, which may be placed roughly at twenty thousand dollars. This extraordinary play was witnessed by a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>excited</b> players, who were less impressed by even the magnitude of the stakes than the perfect sang-froid and recklessness of the player, who, it is said, {{at the close of the}} game tossed a twenty-dollar gold-piece to the banker and smilingly withdrew.

60|$|The Socialism of {{my beliefs}} {{rests on a}} profounder faith and broader proposition. It looks over and beyond the warring {{purposes}} of to-day as a general may look over and beyond a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> sullen, <b>excited</b> and confused recruits, {{to the day when}} they will be disciplined, exercised, trained, willing and convergent on a common end. It holds persistently to the idea of men increasingly working in agreement, doing things that are sane to do, on a basis of mutual helpfulness, temperance and toleration. It sees the great masses of humanity rising out of base and immediate anxieties, out of dwarfing pressures and cramped surroundings, to understanding and participation and fine effort. It sees the resources of the earth husbanded and harvested, economized and used with scientific skill for the maximum of result. It sees towns and cities finely built, a race of beings finely bred and taught and trained, open ways and peace and freedom from end to end of the earth. It sees beauty increasing in humanity, about humanity and through humanity. Through this great body of mankind goes evermore an increasing understanding, an intensifying brotherhood. As Christians have dreamt of the New Jerusalem so does Socialism, growing ever more temperate, patient, forgiving and resolute, set its face to the World City of Mankind.|$|R
