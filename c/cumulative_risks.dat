This paper presents an analysis of aggregate exposures and risks associated with exposures to a pesticide, Alpha, and the cumulative exposure to and risk from three pestic-ides, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma.

Additionally, moderate to vigorous physical activity was investigated as a moderator of the association between <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> and institutional commitment, specifically serving as a protective factor for students experiencing high levels of <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> factors. Data were collected through anonymous, online surveys from a convenience sample of undergraduate students enrolled at a large, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) -accredited, 4 -year private university located in Virginia. The statistical program, SPSS 22. 0 (2013) was used to analyze the descriptive analysis and test the assumptions. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to statistically analyze the association between: (a) <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> and institutional commitment, (b) moderate to vigorous physical activity and institutional commitment, and (c) the interaction between <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> and physical activity and institutional commitment.

Specific aims of this study included identifying 1) to what degree multiple predictors contributed to school readiness and 2) to what degree the <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> index contributed to school readiness. Participants included 176 Head Start children ages 3 to 5 years. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression to determine if the <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> model was a stronger predictor of school readiness than any risk factor in isolation. Hierarchical regression was also utilized to determine if individual risk factors contributed anything above and beyond the sum, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> index. Multiple regression analysis revealed that older age and previous enrollment in Head Start predicted higher scores, while low income predicted lower scores, as did taking the test in Spanish.

The present research was divided into two studies to examine the nature of the relation between <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> {{during the first year of}} life and cognitive and behavioral outcomes at 60 months. Both studies used a sample of 132 primarily low-income African American children exposed to cocaine (30. 8 %), heroin (14. 0 %), or both (55. 1 %). The first study examined <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> using four models: <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk,</b> threshold effects, specific indices, and unique effects. There were no direct linear or nonlinear relations between <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> with cognitive or behavioral outcomes. There was a direct association between psychosocial risk (specifically negative life events) with both internalizing and externalizing behaviors. None of the models of risk were associated with intelligence. The second study examined process variables (mental development scores, harsh caregiving, and caregiver change) to determine whether proximal risk factors may explain the relation between <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> and cognitive and behavioral development. The results of the second study suggested that mental development scores at 12, 18, 24, and 30 months were predictive of intelligence at 60 months, but not behavior. Harsh caregiving was directly associated with internalizing behaviors, and moderated the relation between <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> and internalizing behaviors. Finally, the number of caregiver changes from birth- 60 months was associated with greater attention problems at 60 months. Overall, the findings from the present study provide little support for an association between <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> with developmental outcomes within a drug exposed sample. The overall cognitive scores were very low and not associated with any risk factors, suggesting that the present sample was relatively low functioning, cognitively. Psychosocial risk was associated with behavior problems, especially caregiver negative life events and harsh caregiving.

We used a Bayesian discrete hazard regression model developed for this study to test the effect of patient and radiologic variables on a first false-positive screening and to calculate <b>cumulative</b> <b>risks</b> of a false-positive mammogram. Results: Of 9747 screening mammograms, 6. 5 % were false-positive; 23. 8 % of women experienced at least one false-positive result. After nine mammograms, the risk of a false-positive mammogram was 43. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 36. 6 %– 53. 6 %) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: The {{options for}} {{prevention}} of colorectal cancer in {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} are either a colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) or a total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Rectal cancer risk is eliminated by IPAA, but complication rate is higher than in IRA. Mutation analysis might predict severity of polyposis and be helpful in the surgical decision. METHODS: Patients from the Dutch Polyposis Registry with an IRA were subdivided according {{to the site of}} adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation into the attenuated (1), intermediate (2), and severe (3) genotype groups. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>risks</b> of secondary rectal excision and rectal cancer were calculated for each group. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients underwent an IRA: 26 patients from group 1, 121 from group 2, and 27 from group 3. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>risks</b> of rectal cancer 15 years after surgery were 6 %, 3 %, and 8 % in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>risks</b> of rectal excision 20 years after IRA were 10 %, 43 %, and 74 %, respectively. The risk of rectal excision was significantly higher in group 3 than in the other groups (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of secondary rectal excision after IRA can be predicted {{on the basis of the}} adenomatous polyposis coli mutation site. An IRA appears to be the appropriate treatment in patients with the attenuated genotype. Patients with a severe genotype are good candidates for an IPAA...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> at differing ecological levels is related to child maladjustment while high-quality extra-familial childcare can contribute to healthy psychological development. However, {{few studies have examined}} specific mechanisms of the childcare environment that may be protective. The present study of 274 preschool children and their primary caregiver examined whether accumulated risks at the individual, family, or social levels contributed to the development of internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and social competence. This study also explored the contribution of the childcare environment to the development of child behavior problems over and beyond the effects of <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk.</b> Finally, the present study investigated the moderational influence of the childcare environment in order to specify the mechanisms by which protection against <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> may be conferred. ^ Results were consistent with previous findings that <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> has a deleterious influence on child behavior outcomes. However, characteristics of childcare quality were found to have an overall negligible influence on child behaviors over and beyond <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk.</b> In terms of moderators, lower levels of program structure in conjunction with social-level risk predicted lower levels of social competence. Interestingly, interactions of <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> with positive classroom interactions and high levels of classroom activity predicted increased externalizing behaviors and impaired social competence, respectively. Although this study provides little guidance for intervention efforts, future researchers are urged to examine the childcare environment more carefully in order to uncover potentially protective aspects of this setting. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the gradual}} {{deterioration}} of the environment, the method of environmental risk assessment has been developed from basing only on a single source to basing on a <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> source. In accordance with the water environment features of the plain river network area, a <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> assessment system of water environment in the plain river network area was established in this paper, the design process for which could be divided into three step: (1) Control unit divided reasonably {{was chosen as the}} basic unit for water quality management. (2) On that basis, according to the characteristics of the plain river network area, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> indexes were selected. The index weight is calculated using entropy method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which could determine the risk grade of each control unit. (3) The <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> assessment method is coupled to the existing water environment management platform. The platform with a dynamic database can realize the dynamic calculation and visualization of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> grade. In this paper, the Zhejiang area of Taihu Basin was selected to be the research target as the typical plain river network area. Thirty-five control units were divided with regional water environment and control section. Taking the data in the year 2011 as example, the proposed <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> assessment method was used to identify the control units in different grades and the results demonstrated that the numbers of high-, medium-, low- and extremely low-risk control units are 13, 12, 5 and 5, respectively. It is necessary to give priority to the high-risk control unit. Therefore, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> assessment method based on the control unit provides an essential theoretical basis for reducing the probability of water pollution and reducing the degree of water pollution damage...|$|R

40|$|Background: Reliable {{estimates}} of cancer risk {{are critical for}} guiding management of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutation carriers. The aims {{of this study were}} to derive penetrance estimates for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and contralateral breast cancer in a prospective series of mutation carriers and to assess how these risks are modified by common breast cancer susceptibility alleles. Methods: Prospective cancer risks were estimated using a cohort of 978 BRCA 1 and 909 BRCA 2 carriers from the United Kingdom. Nine hundred eighty-eight women had no breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis at baseline, 1509 women were unaffected by ovarian cancer, and 651 had been diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>risks</b> were obtained using Kaplan–Meier estimates. Associations between cancer risk and covariables of interest were evaluated using Cox regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.

40|$|If the {{protection}} of man against mutagenic agents in general, and against those that cause aneuploidies in particular, {{is to have an}} increasingly rational basis with the passage of time, quantitative or at least semiquantitative assessments of risks are needed.

In the past, quantitative data relating to severity have been limited or nonexistent, but the data sources exist by which follow-up studies may be carried out to determine age-specific and <b>cumulative</b> <b>risks</b> of hospitalization and death, the durations of hospital stays, and the economic burden to society which these represent.

40|$|<b>Cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> is {{a salient}} {{construct}} addressed in family dynamics research. There have been multiple relationships established among <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk,</b> parenting, and child outcomes through previous research. The current study furthered {{this body of}} research by addressing the role of parenting distress within models predicting parenting behaviors within a context of <b>risk.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> <b>risk,</b> parenting, child behavior, and transactional relationships highlighted the relationships between an environment of risk and resulting parenting outcomes. It was predicted that parental distress will act as a mediator variable between the baseline <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> and later parenting behaviors. This hypothesis was tested {{using data from the}} national evaluation of Early Head Start federal program. Multiple regression analyses testing this mediation model were analyzed for three different parenting outcomes: supportiveness, intrusiveness, and parent-child interaction.

40|$|A {{key feature}} of <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> {{assessment}} (CRA) {{is the ability}} to estimate differential health risks from environmental exposures within populations. Identifying populations at increased risk from environmental exposures {{is the first step toward}} mitigating such risks as required by the fair treatment mandate of environmental justice. CRA methods remain under development except for a limited application in pesticide regulations. The goals of this research were to advance CRA methods and to test their application in a community case study. We compared <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> and health assessments for South and Southwest Philadelphia communities. The analysis found positive correlations between <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> and mortality measurements for total mortality in Whites and non-Whites when we conducted the risk assessment using a multi–end point toxicological database developed for this project. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> scores correlated positively with cause-specific mortality in non-Whites. Statistically significant increases in total and respiratory mortality rates were associated with incremental increases in the hazard ratio <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> scores, with ranges of 2 – 6 % for total and 8 – 23 % for respiratory. Regression analyses controlled for percent non-White population and per capita income, indicating that risk scores represent an environmental effect on health independent of race and income. This case study demonstrated the successful application of CRA at the community level. CRA adds a health dimension to pollutant concentrations to produce a more comprehensive understanding of environmental inequities that can inform decision making. CRA is a viable tool to identify high-risk areas and to guide surveillance, research, or interventions. Key words: community health, <b>cumulative</b> <b>risk</b> assessment, environmental justice.
