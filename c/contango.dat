50|$|A {{crude oil}} <b>contango</b> {{occurred}} again in January 2009, with arbitrageurs storing millions of barrels in tankers {{to profit from}} the <b>contango</b> (see oil-storage trade). But by the summer, that price curve had flattened considerably. The <b>contango</b> exhibited in Crude Oil in 2009 explains the discrepancy between the headline spot price increase (bottoming at $35 and topping $80 in the year) and the various tradeable instruments for Crude Oil (such as rolled contracts or longer-dated futures contracts) showing a much lower price increase. The USO ETF also failed to replicate Crude Oil's spot price performance.|$|E

While contrarian strategies do not work, the article identifies 13 profitable momentum strategies that generate 9. 38 % average return a year. A closer analysis of the constituents of the long-short portfolios reveals that the momentum strategies buy backwardated contracts and sell <b>contangoed</b> contracts. The correlation between the momentum returns and the returns of traditional asset classes is also found to be low, making the commodity-based relative-strength portfolios excellent candidates for inclusion in well-diversified portfolios...|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} of the Optimum Yield {{technology was}} {{to address the}} dynamic nature of commodity forward curves. Unstable forward curves has meant the traditional approach employed by commodity indices, namely rolling futures contracts on a predefined scheduled (e.g. monthly) has, in our view, become an inferior strategy for passive commodity index investing. The DBLCI-OY indices are designed to select the futures contacts that either maximises the positive roll yield in backwardated term structures or minimises the negative roll yield in <b>contangoed</b> markets {{from the list of}} tradeable futures that expire in the next 13 months.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the measurement of}} hedging efficiency. It is argued that conventional measures of the efficiency of risk management operations my be unreliable in commodities where the available hedge represents {{the value of the}} commodity for forward, rather than prompt, delivery. Considerable biases can arise when the time structure of prices is not considered, which tend to lead to overstatement of the efficiency of the hedging vehicle. As an alternative we propose the use of simulations of hedges. The use of simulations not only produces very different results to standard financial formulae, but also demonstrates the sensitivity of the effectiveness of hedging to the time structure of prices. This produces some direct inferences for optimal hedging behaviour. Our simulations consider how effective crude oil futures are for the hedging of various streams of tradeable crude oil. The futures contracts, used alone in a hedging strategy, are shown to perform unpredictably in the hedging of dated Brent, which is the direct price index for some 16 million barrels per day of crude oil trade, and whose influence, particularly in the Far East, is still expanding. We contend that the reason for this poor hedging performance is the non-randomness of the basis risk between futures and prompt crude oil. This basis tends to trend, and we consider hedging effectiveness in three regimes, <b>contangos</b> and both narrowing and widening backwardations. We find that the hedging effectiveness is highly dependent on the time structure regime. Because of the potential size and volatility of the basis, under some conditions using futures as a hedging instrument can produce more risk than unhedged positions. This also has implications for market structure, with the development of informal markets to help hedge the risk that can not be hedged by the use of the futures. The implication of our analysis is that the potential gains are considerable for futures market users who are unable, or unwilling, to access the subsidiary informal markets, should a futures contract whose value more closely proxies that of dated Brent be available...|$|R

50|$|A <b>contango</b> {{is normal}} for a {{non-perishable}} commodity {{that has a}} cost of carry. Such costs include warehousing fees and interest forgone on money tied up (or the time-value-of money, etc.), less income from leasing out the commodity if possible (e.g. gold). For perishable commodities, price differences between near and far delivery are not a <b>contango.</b> Different delivery dates are in effect entirely different commodities in this case, since fresh eggs today will not still be fresh in 6 months' time, 90-day treasury bills will have matured, etc.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Contango</b> is a {{situation}} where the futures price (or forward price) of a commodity is higher than the spot price. [...] In a <b>contango</b> situation, hedgers (commodity producers and commodity users) or arbitrageurs/speculators (non-commercial investors), are [...] "willing to pay more now for a commodity {{at some point in the}} future than the actual expected price of the commodity that future point. This may be due to people's desire to pay a premium to have the commodity in the future rather than paying the costs of storage and carry costs of buying the commodity today." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hicks [...] "reversed Keynes's theory by {{pointing}} out that there are situations where hedgers are net long. In this situation, called <b>contango,</b> speculators must be net short.

50|$|If {{there is}} a near-term shortage, the price {{comparison}} breaks down and <b>contango</b> may be reduced or perhaps even reverse altogether into a state called backwardation. In that state, near prices become higher than far (i.e., future) prices because consumers prefer to have the product {{sooner rather than later}} (see convenience yield), andbecause there are few holders who can make an arbitrage profit by selling the spot and buying back the future. A market that is steeply backwardated—i.e., one where {{there is a}} very steep premium for material available for immediate delivery—often indicates a perception of a current shortage in the underlying commodity. By the same token, a market that is deeply in <b>contango</b> may indicate a perception of a current supply surplus in the commodity.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{originated}} in mid-19th century England and {{is believed to}} be a corruption of [...] "continuation", [...] "continue" [...] or [...] "contingent". In the past on the London Stock Exchange, <b>contango</b> was a fee paid by a buyer to a seller when the buyer wished to defer settlement of the trade they had agreed. The charge was based on the interest forgone by the seller not being paid.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 and 2006 a {{perception}} of impending supply shortage allowed traders to take advantages of the <b>contango</b> in the crude oil market. Traders simultaneously bought oil and sold futures forward. This led to large numbers of tankers loaded with oil sitting idle in ports acting as floating warehouses. (see: Oil-storage trade) It was estimated that perhaps a $10-20 per barrel premium was added to spot price of oil {{as a result of}} this.|$|E
50|$|<b>Contango</b> is a {{potential}} trap for unwary investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) {{provide an opportunity for}} small investors to participate in commodity futures markets, which is tempting in periods of low interest rates. Between 2005 and 2010 the number of futures-based commodity ETFs rose from two to ninety-five, and the total assets rose from 3.9 to nearly 98 billion USD in the same period. Because the normal course of a futures contract in a market in <b>contango</b> is to decline in price, a fund composed of such contracts buys the contracts at the high price (going forward) and closes them out later at the usually lower spot price. The money raised from the low priced, closed out contracts will not buy the same number of new contracts going forward. Funds can and have lost money even in fairly stable markets. There are strategies to mitigate this problem, including allowing the ETF to create a stock of precious metals for the purpose of allowing investors to speculate on fluctuations in its value. But storage costs will be quite variable, and copper ingots require considerably more storage space, and thus carrying cost, than gold, and command lower prices in world markets: it is unclear how well a model that works for gold will work with other commodities. Industrial scale buyers of major commodities, particularly when compared to small retail investors, retain an advantage in futures markets. The raw material cost of the commodity {{is only one of many}} factors that influence their final costs and prices. <b>Contango</b> pricing strategies that catch small investors by surprise are intuitively obvious to the managers of a large firm, who must decide whether to take delivery of a product today, at today's spot price, and store it themselves, or pay more for a forward contract, and let someone else do the storage for them.|$|E
