40|$|Money is {{the blood}} of modern free-enterprise economies. Correspondently, the {{quantity}} and velocity of money circulated in such an economy would determine its health. Expressed differently, the levels of economic activities, production and money supply in an economy are interrelated. The central issue then is, does the quantity of money supply determine the levels of economic activities and production? Or, on the contraly, are economic activities and production the variables that actually determine the level of money supply in an economy? Indeed the endogeneity/exogeneity of money supply is still an unsettled issue. While nobody <b>can</b> still <b>say</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> whether the supply of money is endogenously or exogenously determined, this issue is crucial for a proper formulation of macroeconomic theory and policy. Since, as previously noted, the economic health of a countv would depend heavily on its money supply. Having said this, {{if we were to}} obtain some valuable insights into efective and efficient management of an economy, this issue needs to be examined and analyzed rigorously. In much of the mainstream macroeconomic literature money supply is assumed to be exogenously determined by the central bank. This view is put forward by a group of economists known as the Monetarists based on the argument that money supply equals the money multiplier times the monetaly base. Since the central bank can change this base, it can control the supply of money in the economy. On {{the other side of the}} debate, another group of economists known as Post Keynesian Economists maintain that money supply is endogeneity, in nature. Whereas, there are a number of different views of the concept of money supply endogeneity, the core argument of this school of monetary economic thought is that bank lending creates deposits and hence money supply. Given such opposing views on exogeneity/endogeneity of money supply, the central issue at this juncture is: does loan cause money supply or does money supply cause loan? Accordingly, our study will examine this issue by using cointegration test and vector error correction model developed by Johansen. The results of this study have enabled us to claim convincingly that lending is an essential (endogenous) determinant of money supply in Malaysia. Findings of the study clearly corroborates Horizontalist view of money supply endogeneity that in Malaysia, loan causes monetary aggregates (i. e.,M 0, M 1, M 2, and M 3) ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 20th century {{much of this}} came to be questioned. Some historians have been more {{sympathetic}} to James III, seeing him as a cultured man in the relatively crude atmosphere of the Scottish nobility at that time, and defended him against some criticisms. The leading Scottish historian Norman Macdougall published a revisionist biography of James III in which he argues that, {{far from being a}} weak king, he was actually something of a tyrant. Macdougall dismissed the [...] "favourites of low birth" [...] as the invention of chroniclers in the next century whose knowledge of the facts was poor. He argues that all we <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> is that James had some dealings with an architect or mason called Cochrane, and the rest is later invention. Macdougall found two records of a Thomas Cochrane; one reference suggests that Cochrane was an usher of the king's chamber door, and the other that a Thomas Cochrane had forfeited the lands of Cousland near Dalkeith. Cochrane of Cousland, Macdougall concludes, may have been the usher and met his end at Lauder Bridge. Macdougall also follows the development of the story in later writers and points particularly to William Drummond of Hawthornden's History of the 5 Jameses for setting the final elaboration of the story. Macdougall argues that Hawthornden increased the status of Cochrane to that of an architect in order to rescue the king's reputation.|$|E

5000|$|Mussolini for {{his part}} {{rejected}} the Hoare-Laval plan, saying he wanted to subject all of Ethiopia, not just half. Following the fiasco of the Hoare-Laval plan, the British government resumed its previous policy of imposing sanctions against Italy in a half-hearted way, which in turn imposed serious strains on relations with both Paris and especially Rome. Given the provocative Italian attitude, Britain wanted to begin staff talks with France for a possible war with Italy. On 13 December 1935, Neurath told the British ambassador Sir Eric Phipps that Berlin regarded any Anglo-French staff talks without Germany-even if directed only against Italy-as a violation of Locarno that would force Germany to remilitarize the Rhineland. Through Italo-German relations were quite unfriendly in 1935, Germany had been an outspoken supporter of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and offered Mussolini a benevolent neutrality. Under the banner of white supremacy and fascism, Hitler came out strongly for the Italian invasion, {{and he made a}} point of shipping the Italians various raw materials and weapons, which the League of Nations sanctions had forbidden Italy. Hitler's support for the Italian aggression won him much goodwill in Rome. By contrast, Laval's pro-Italian intrigues and his efforts to sabotage the British-led effort to impose sanctions on Italy created a lasting climate of distrust between the British and the French. In the fall of 1935, a serious economic crisis gripped Germany, with inflation rapidly rising, currency reserves collapsing, living standards falling, well over half of the German people living below the poverty line, and most damaging of all to the Nazi regime's popularity, there were alarming shortages of food. After experiencing an upsurge in 1933 and 1934, the German economy had fallen back into depression in 1935 mostly because the Nazi regime gave a priority to importing raw materials needed for rearmament over food imports (Germany had more people than it was capable of feeding) {{while at the same time}} refusing for reasons of prestige to consider devaluation of the Reichmark. It was common in the fall of 1935 for people to speak of the [...] "food crisis" [...] (Ernährungskrise) as queues at food shops become longer and longer. By January 1936, the Berlin police were reporting that [...] "a shockingly high percentage of the population in Berlin" [...] were [...] "directly negative towards the State and the Movement". The same report mentioned that in recent months there had been a huge increase in the number of pamphlets calling for the overthrow of the Nazi regime that had been issued by activists from the underground KPD. In such a climate, Hitler was looking for a quick and easy foreign policy triumph to distract attention from the economic crisis. Furthermore, in January 1936 in response to the Abyssinia Crisis, it was announced that the League of Nations was considering applying oil sanctions against Italy (which possessed no oil), a step that Mussolini had always said would lead to Italy going to war against any nation that voted at the League Council for oil sanctions. Given Mussolini's open threats to attack any nation that voted for oil sanctions together with strong pressure from British public for the British government to vote for oil sanctions, Britain had deployed the majority of its military to the Mediterranean, and thus far from Germany. As the news spread that Italian forces were committing widespread atrocities in Ethiopia, such as the massacres of civilians and the frequent use of chemical warfare against defenseless Ethiopian civilians, British public opinion started to press their government to do more with regards to sanctions against Italy. Such was the brutality of the Italian forces that between 1936-41 during anti-guerrilla operations to [...] "pacify" [...] Ethiopia that the Italians killed about 7% of Ethiopia's population. Though the British had decided not to go to war with Italy, it was very clear that Mussolini was enraged at Britain as the nation most responsible for the League of Nations sanctions imposed on Italy. In such a context, within Whitehall fear started to grow that Mussolini would commit a reckless [...] "mad dog act" [...] like trying to destroy the British Mediterranean Fleet as he had threatened to do several times, and hence deployed the majority of British military power to the Mediterranean to guard against a possible war with Italy. When the French Admiral Jean Decoux told the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ernle Chatfield that war with Italy was unlikely, Chatfield replied: [...] "With dictators you never can tell. No one <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> that Mr. Mussolini will not take some serious decisions someday".|$|E
