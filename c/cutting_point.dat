The main {{objective of the}} procedure is to group together messages whose contents have similar characteristics. Time discretization is apparently simpler, because only the <b>cutting</b> <b>points</b> between time slices must be indicated. However, also time discretization presents many options. First, there are often many ways of defining the <b>cutting</b> <b>points,</b> leading to different results. Second, after the <b>cutting</b> <b>points</b> have been defined there can still be different ways of distributing network structures into the slices. For example, {{if we want to}} discretize messages, we can place a message mi in a specific interval (ta,tb) either if the incoming edge e=(vj,mi,t) exists in the interval (ta,tb), if all the edges from/to mi exist in the interval, if {{at least one of the}} out-going edges e=(mi,vj,t) exist in the interval, etc. Finally, we use the term multiple discretization when both textual and time discretization are applied together to generate the different groups.|$|R

Yet you cannot {{suppose it}} is in reality easier {{to draw a line}} with a <b>cutting</b> <b>point,</b> not seeing the effect at all, or, if any effect, seeing a gleam of light instead of darkness, than to draw your black line at once on the white paper? You cannot really think[Y] that there is {{something}} complacent, sympathetic, and helpful in the nature of steel; so that while a pen-and-ink sketch may always be considered an achievement proving cleverness in the sketcher, a sketch on steel comes out by mere favor of the indulgent metal; or that the plate is woven like a piece of pattern silk, and the pattern is developed by pasteboard cards punched full of holes? Not so. Look close at this engraving, or take a smaller and simpler one, Turner's Mercury and Argus,--imagine it to be a drawing in pen and ink, and yourself required similarly to produce its parallel! True, the steel point has the one advantage of not blotting, but it has tenfold or twentyfold disadvantage, in that you cannot slur, nor efface, except in a very resolute and laborious way, nor play with it, nor even see what you are doing with it at the moment, far less the effect that is to be. You must feel what you are doing with it, and know precisely what you have got to do; how deep, how broad, how far apart your lines must be, etc. and etc., (a couple of lines of etceteras would not be enough to imply all you must know). But suppose the plate were only a pen drawing: take your pen--your finest--and just try to copy the leaves that entangle the head of Io, and her head itself; remembering always that the kind of work required here is mere child's play compared to that of fine figure engraving. Nevertheless, take a small magnifying glass to this--count the dots and lines that gradate the nostrils and the edges of the facial bone; notice how the light is left {{on the top of the}} head by the stopping, at its outline, of the coarse touches which form the shadows under the leaves; examine it well, and then--I humbly ask of you--try to do a piece of it yourself! You clever sketcher--you young lady or gentleman of genius--you eye-glassed dilettante--you current writer of criticism royally plural,--I beseech you,--do it yourself; do the merely etched outline yourself, if no more. Look you,--you hold your etching needle this way, as you would a pencil, nearly; and then,--you scratch with it! it is as easy as lying. Or if you think that too difficult, take an easier piece;--take either of the light sprays of foliage that rise against the fortress on the right, pass your lens over them--look how their fine outline is first drawn, leaf by leaf; then how the distant rock is put in between, with broken lines, mostly stopping before they touch the leaf-outline; and again, I pray you, do it yourself,--if not on that scale, on a larger. Go on into the hollows of the distant rock,--traverse its thickets,--number its towers;--count how many lines there are in a laurel bush--in an arch--in a casement; some hundred and fifty, or two hundred, deliberately drawn lines, you will find, in every square quarter of an inch;--say three thousand to the inch,--each, with skillful intent, put in its place! and then consider what the ordinary sketcher's work must appear, to the men who have been trained to this! ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Segmentation {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} components in time series data mining. One of the uses of the time series segmentation is trend analysis- to segment the time series into primitive trends like uptrend and downtrend. In this paper, a time series segmentation method based on a specialized binary tree representation scheme is proposed; this representation scheme is customized for financial time series to cater for its unique behaviors. The proposed segmentation method is based on the concept of data point importance and the location of the <b>cutting</b> <b>points</b> is already encoded in the representation scheme. Therefore, no additional effect is needed to determine the <b>cutting</b> <b>points.</b> One may find it particularly attractive in applications like stock data analysis.

40|$|Abstract. This is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} three papers {{concerned}} with the thermal characteristics during the grinding of natural rock materials with diamond abrasive tools.

This third part is concentrated on the evaluation of the effects of temperatures on the wear of diamond tools and the formation of a glossy granite surface. X-ray diffraction measurements made on the ground granite surfaces showed no evidence of any phase changes due to grinding, indicating that the temperatures reached at the disk-granite interface was unlikely a significant factor governing the formation of high gloss on a ground granite surface. Temperatures reached at individual <b>cutting</b> <b>points</b> might be an important factor for the fast wear of diamond grits and pull-outs of diamond grits from the bond matrix...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{time series}} {{analysis}} usually conducts by determining the series important points. These important points which are the peaks and the dips indicate the affecting of some important factors or events which are available both internal factors and external factors. The peak and the dip points of the series may appear frequently in multiresolution over time. However, to manipulate financial time series, researchers usually decrease this complexity of time series in their techniques. Consequently, transfonning the time series into another easily understanding representation is usually considered as an appropriate approach. In this paper, we propose a multiresolution important point retrieval method for financial time series representation. The idea of the method is based on finding the most important points in multiresolution. These retrieved important points are recorded in each resolution. The collected important points are used to construct the TS-binary search tree. From the TS-binary search tree, the application of time series segmentation is conducted. The experimental {{results show that the}} TS-binary search tree representation for financial time series exhibits different performance in different number of <b>cutting</b> <b>points,</b> however, in the empirical results, the number of <b>cutting</b> <b>points</b> which are larger than 12 points show the better results...|$|R

This research and development was undertaken as applied to circular and band saws used for machining of wood and wood-based composites in order for considerable improvement their service life {{through the application of}} hard duplex coatings to cutting edges. Circular/band saws are the most widely-used tools in wood/furniture industry for woodworking. Usually, sawing takes up to 60 % in general machine processing of wood. The circular (up to 1. 5 m in diameter) and band (approximately 8 m long and 0. 4 m with) saws are used for pre- sawing of logs.

5000|$|Another {{difference}} from the crosscut saw is that the edges are sharpened {{at right angles to}} the cutting plane, forming chisel-like cutting surfaces, whereas the crosscut saw is sharpened at an angle, so that each tooth has a knife-like <b>cutting</b> <b>point</b> in contact with the wood. This design keeps the saw from following grain lines, which could curve the path of the saw: by acting like a chisel, the saw can more easily cut across deviating grain lines, which is necessary if a straight cut is to be achieved.
