5|$|Gradually in {{the late}} 14th and early 15th century the Ottoman Empire {{defeated}} local Albanian principalities, forming the sanjak of Albania as an administrative division of the empire. As part of the Timar system the local feudal lords were largely replaced with Ottomans from Anatolia. The <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> (defter) of 1431–1432 indicates that about 75% to 80% of the timars were granted to Ottoman Muslim spahis (feudal cavalry), while the remainder and especially remote areas, which were not under full Ottoman control, were granted to Albanian spahis, both Christian and Muslim. The replacement of the existing nobility with the timar system led to conflicts, {{as a result of}} which many rural areas were not under complete Ottoman rule.|$|E

In the continuation, there is reconstruction of <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> documents, analyses of formation of <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> documents, used measuring tool and methods. The input data for the analysis were obtained at the Archive of the Republic of Slovenia and regional office of The surveying and mapping authority in Novo mesto.

As the wireless internet based Wibro communication is applied for this working processor, the mutual processing could be applied with wireless internet. As the software was developed for the <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> processor improvement, the geo-coding was improved and the working phases of field <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> work, and above all, various reasons for difference could be decreased...|$|R

25|$|The {{metric system}} was officially {{introduced}} in France in December 1799. In the 19th century, the metric system {{was adopted by}} almost all European countries: Portugal (1814); Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg (1820); Switzerland (1835); Spain (1850s); Italy (1861); Germany (1870, legally from 1 January 1872); and Austria-Hungary (1876, but the law was adopted in 1871). Thailand did not formally adopt the metric system until 1923, but the Royal Thai Survey Department used it for <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> as early as 1896.

25|$|In 1897, the <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> {{project was}} {{launched}} by the Gwangmu government, aiming at modernizing the landownership system. In order to apply Western surveying methods, American surveyors were hired. After the survey, a property title “Jigye”, showing the exact dimension of the land, {{were supposed to be}} issued by the authorities concerned. That reform was closely involved to the reform of land tax system, which was conducted under the leadership of Yi Yong-ik, who also carried out the monetary reforms in Korea. The project was interrupted due to the Russo-Japanese war in 1904–1905, after having finished about two-thirds of the whole land.|$|E

The rawk surveys organized the iqtaʿ system and the first rawk {{was carried out in}} 1298 under Sultan Lajin. A second and final rawk was completed in 1315 under Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad and influenced political and economic developments of the Mamluk Sultanate until its fall in the early 16th century.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the investigation of}} UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for use in <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying.</b> Within the scope of a pilot study UAVs were tested for capturing geodata and compared with conventional data acquisition methods for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying.</b> Two study sites were therefore surveyed with a tachymeter-GNSS combination {{as well as a}} UAV system. The workflows of both methods were investigated and the resulting data were compared with the requirements of Swiss <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying.</b> Concerning data acquisition and evaluation, the two systems are found to be comparable in terms of time expenditure, accuracy, and completeness. In conclusion, the UAV image orientation proved to be the limiting factor for the obtained accuracy due to the low- cost camera including camera calibration, image quality, and definition of the ground control points (natural or artificial). However, the required level of accuracy for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> was reached. The advantage of UAV systems lies in their high flexibility and efficiency in capturing the surface of an area from a low flight altitude. In addition, further information such as orthoimages, elevation models and 3 D objects can easily be gained from UAV images. Altogether, this project endorses the benefit of using UAVs in cadastral applications and the new opportunities they provide for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying...</b>|$|R
