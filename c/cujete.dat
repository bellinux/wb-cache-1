40|$|The use and {{dispersal}} of domesticated plants may reflect patterns of early human diffusion of technologies and lifestyles. Treegourd (Crescentia <b>cujete)</b> has fruits with ancient utilitarian and symbolic {{value in the}} Neotropics. We assessed diversity based on chloroplast (SNPs), nuclear (SSR) markers, and fruit shapes of cultivated treegourds and wild relatives across Amazonia and Mesoamerica {{in order to discuss}} hypothesis of dispersal routes and diversification of fruits along its distribution. The haplotype network showed three distinct groups: Crescentia amazonica, wild Mesoamerican C. <b>cujete,</b> and cultivated C. <b>cujete</b> from Brazilian Amazonia and Mexico. Mexico and Brazil shared two haplotypes, with slightly different distributions in Amazonia. The most divergent haplotype is well-represented in Eastern Amazonia. Nuclear differentiation between Mesoamerican wild and cultivated C. <b>cujete</b> is relatively low (FST = 0. 35), compared with Amazonian cultivated (FST = 0. 45 – 0. 61). Differentiation is also higher between wild C. amazonica and cultivated C. <b>cujete</b> (FST = 0. 57), but modest within cultivated C. <b>cujete</b> from Amazonia and Mexico (FST = 0. 04), with higher genetic similarity in northwestern Amazonia. Mexico and Amazonia showed similar chloroplast nucleotide diversity (4. 66 × 10 − 2 and 5. 31 × 10 − 2, respectively), although sample sizes are very different. Except in Northwestern and Eastern Amazonia, we found ample genetic homogeneity of cultivated C. <b>cujete</b> across Amazonia, but highest morphological diversity in the Northwest, with fruit shapes that are absent in Mexico. We conclude that treegourds introduced into the Amazon Basin and Mexico share a common ancestry with a currently unknown origin. The patterns of genetic diversity across Amazonia allow two hypotheses of the routes of introduction: a northwestern introduction into the Negro and Solimões Rivers, and an eastern introduction from the coastal Guianas into the Amazonas River. The dispersal into Amazonia followed previously proposed routes of human and plant migrations. The contrasting fruit shape diversity suggests different utilitarian demands and cultural preferences for treegourd fruits between Mexico and Amazonia...|$|E

Hence the present study was carried out to evaluate the antivenom activity of ethanolic extracts of Crescentia <b>cujete</b> fruit in experimental animals. The Crescentia <b>cujete</b> fruit was extracted using ethanol and tested for acute toxicity according to OECD 425 guidelines. The ethanolic extract of Crescentia <b>cujete</b> fruit at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg were screened for the antivenom activity by in-vivo and in-vitro neutralizing capacity of lethality and neutralization of haemorrhagic lesion. The fruit extract at dose levels of 200 and 400 mg/kg effectively inhibited Vipera russelli venom induced in-vitro lethality with 83. 33 % and 100 % survival rate against 2 LD 50 respectively. The survival rate remains 50 % and 83. 33 % with 200 and 400 mg/kg doses respectively against 3 LD 50. Whereas dose of 400 mg/kg significantly inhibit venom induced in-vivo lethality with 66 % and 50 % survival rate against 2 LD 50 and 3 LD 50 respectively. Haemorrhagic lesion was neutralizing at both dose levels with highly significant at 200 mg/kg dose. Hence the present findings suggest that ethanolic extract of Crescentia <b>cujete</b> fruit possesses significant neutralizing capacity of snake Vipera russelli venom which may be beneficial in the treatment of snake bite.

40|$|Crescentia <b>cujete</b> tree {{is widely}} and various used for wood, {{household}} materials, culinary and therapeutic purposes. Virtually {{all parts of}} this tree are useful across tropical and subtropical continents. Aim: this study covers the pharmacognostic standardization of the stem bark of C. <b>cujete</b> to ensure identity, quality control and purity of the plant drug material. The antimicrobial potential was also assayed to form a scientific basis for such claims by traditional therapists. Materials and Methods: This involved macroscopical studies via botanical examination techniques, anatomical sections of fresh samples of the stem bark, microscopic studies of powdered stem bark, with photomicrograps, and physicochemical (analytical) evaluation. Methanolic crude extract and various fractions were made and tested on clinical isolates of Bacillus subtitlis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger, using agar well (8 mm) diffusion. Results: the tree has pale to brown multiple trunks, smooth surface and brown nodules. Cut stem bark is cylindrical. Microscopy revealed calcium oxalate embedded in the cork, bundles of elongated fibres, sclerenchymatous and phloem parenchymatous cells. Alkaloids, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, resins, carbohydrates, proteins, and fatty oils were detected. Antimicrobial inhibition was observed in the reconstituted extract and serial dilution for MIC. This was concentration dependent and increased in the order: EF>MF>HF>MCE.

Here we analyze domesticated treegourd (Crescentia <b>cujete),</b> whose versatile fruits have technological, symbolic, and medicinal uses. A wild relative (C. amazonica) of the cultivated species grows spontaneously in Amazonian flooded forests. We demonstrated, using whole chloroplast sequences and nuclear microsatellites, that the two species are strongly differentiated. Nonetheless, they hybridize readily throughout Amazonia and the proportions of admixture correlate with fruit size variation of cultivated trees. New morphotypes arise from hybridization, which are recognized by people and named as local varieties. Small hybrid fruits are used to make the important symbolic rattle (maraca), suggesting that management of hybrid trees is an ancient human practice in Amazonia. Effective conservation of Amazonian agrobiodiversity needs to incorporate this interaction between wild and cultivated populations that is managed by smallholder families. Beyond treegourd, our study clearly shows that hybridization {{plays an important role in}} tree crop phenotypic diversification and that the integration of molecular analyses and farmers' {{perceptions of}} diversity help disentangle crop domestication history...|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} ethnoveterinary reports {{from around the}} world {{investigating}} plant usage in therapeutic protocols; however, there is no information regarding the ethnoveterinary practices in Brazilian Amazonia. The objective of this work was to register and document the ethnoveterinary knowledge of the inhabitants of the Island of Marajó, eastern Amazonia, Brazil. In the study, interviews were conducted with 50 individuals, with the application of semi-structured questionnaires that were quantitatively analyzed using descriptive statistic methods of frequency distribution. Use-value was calculated to determine the most important species. Samples of plants that were reported to have medicinal value were collected and identified by botanical classification. Fifty plants, distributed among 48 genera and 34 families, were indicated for 21 different medicinal uses. The family Asteraceae had the largest number of reported species; Carapa guianensis Aubl., Copaifera martii Hayne, Crescentia <b>cujete</b> L., Caesalpinia ferrea Mart., Chenopodium ambrosioides L., Jatropha curcas L. and Momordica charantia L. were species with highest use- value. The plant parts that were more commonly utilized for the preparation of ethnoveterinary medicines were the leaves (56 %), bark (18 %), roots (14 %), seeds (14 %) and fruit (8 %). With regard to usage, tea was reported as a usage method by 56 % of the informants; most preparations (90. 9 %) utilized only a single plant. In addition to medicinal plants, informants reported using products of animal and mineral origin. The present study contributed to the construction of an inventory of Marajó Island's ethnoveterinary plants, which might be the basis for future scientific validation studies.

As partes das plantas mais utilizadas para preparo dos medicamentos etnoveterinários foram folhas (56 %), cascas (18 %), raizes (14 %), sementes (14 %) e frutos (8 %). Quanto à forma de uso o chá foi citado por 56 % dos entrevistados e a maioria das preparações (90, 9 %) utiliza uma só planta. Além das plantas medicinais, os entrevistados relataram o uso de produtos de origem animal e mineral. Esse trabalho contribui para realização de um inventário das plantas utilizadas na etnoveterinária marajoara que pode servir de base de dados para futuros estudos de validação científica...|$|E
40|$|Grass monoculture, {{besides being}} unnatural to goat’s natural eating habits, {{exhibits}} low forage production {{during the dry}} season, with negative impacts on animal productivity. This research aimed to determine the productive advantages of silvopastoral system arrangements in goat production. A completely randomized design with repeated measurements through time was used. Six treatments were evaluated: kikuyina grass monoculture (Bothriochloa pertusa) and guinea grass monoculture (Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania) as control groups; guacimo (Guazuma ulmifolia) based silvopastoral arrangement; calabash (Crescentia <b>cujete)</b> based silvopastoral arrangement; lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala) based silvopastoral arrangement; and a mixed based silvopastoralarrangement (guacimo, calabash and leucaena). The information was processed with analysis of variance. The results showed increased forage production in silvopastoral arrangements vs. Bothriochloa pertusa monoculture. The greater increase in height (p < 0. 05) at 9 - 14 months of age, was obtained with the leucaena silvopastoral arrangement. All silvopastoral arrangements showed forage yield advantages compared to B. pertusa. The higher dry matter production of guinea grass is highlighted. Overall weight gain of the growing goats was low; nevertheless, a differential response between treatments was observed. Silvopastoral arrangements had the highest (p < 0. 05) weight gain (22. 5 to 33. 6 g/animal per day) relative to the guinea grass monoculture (13. 2 g/animal per day). The growing goats had higher percentages of estrus and pregnancy in the mixed system (66. 7 %) and those based on guacimo (66. 7 %) and on lead tree (55. 6 %) ...|$|E
40|$|URL] The phytotoxity {{of ethanol}} extracts, {{of the organic}} phase and major {{compound}} (cinnamic acid) obtained from the fruit pulp of Crescentia <b>cujete</b> L., were evaluated for their potential to inhibit seed germination, hypocotyl development and radicle development of the invasive weeds Senna obtusifolia (L.) Irwin & Barneby and Mimosa pudica Mill. The organic phase at a concentration of 0. 5 % inhibited 100 % seed germination of both weeds. Cinnamic acid obtained from the organic phase inhibited seed germination by 95 % for S. obtusifolia and 99 % for M. pudica at a concentration of 0. 1 %, with concentrations (%) inhibiting 50 % (IC 50) seed germination equal to 0. 063 % and 0. 037 %, respectively. For the seedling growth bioassays, the toxicity of the cinnamic acid was more efficient for the S. obtusifolia radicle (IC 50 equal to 0. 009 %), and for M. pudica the IC 50 values were 0. 097 % and 0. 117 % for the radicle and hypocotyl, respectively. This research reinforces the phytotoxic potential of cinnamic acid, verified initially in the organic phase (in ethyl acetate), which is rich in this phenylpropanoid. he rainiest months in the Amazon region. The increased BAP and GA 3 concentrations in the culture medium provided significant improvements in the material multiplication rates. In spite of the results obtained, the species shows peculiarities and limitations to in vitro cultivation that were identified and described in this paper...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} ethnoveterinary reports {{from around the}} world {{investigating}} plant usage in therapeutic protocols; however, there is no information regarding the ethnoveterinary practices in Brazilian Amazonia. The objective of this work was to register and document the ethnoveterinary knowledge of the inhabitants of the Island of Marajó, eastern Amazonia, Brazil. In the study, interviews were conducted with 50 individuals, with the application of semi-structured questionnaires that were quantitatively analyzed using descriptive statistic methods of frequency distribution. Use-value was calculated to determine the most important species. Samples of plants that were reported to have medicinal value were collected and identified by botanical classification. Fifty plants, distributed among 48 genera and 34 families, were indicated for 21 different medicinal uses. The family Asteraceae had the largest number of reported species; Carapa guianensis Aubl., Copaifera martii Hayne, Crescentia <b>cujete</b> L., Caesalpinia ferrea Mart., Chenopodium ambrosioides L., Jatropha curcas L. and Momordica charantia L. were species with highest use- value. The plant parts that were more commonly utilized for the preparation of ethnoveterinary medicines were the leaves (56 %), bark (18 %), roots (14 %), seeds (14 %) and fruit (8 %). With regard to usage, tea was reported as a usage method by 56 % of the informants; most preparations (90. 9 %) utilized only a single plant. In addition to medicinal plants, informants reported using products of animal and mineral origin. The present study contributed to the construction of an inventory of Marajó Island's ethnoveterinary plants, which might be the basis for future scientific validation studies...|$|E
