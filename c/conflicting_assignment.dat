Here we have purified p 32 after expression of its gene in Escherichia coli and assayed its ability to bind to various preproteins containing signal sequences for protein translocation into mitochondria, chloroplasts, or the endoplasmic reticulum. Our data suggest that p 32 contains a binding site specific for the signal sequence region of mitochondrial preproteins.

Here, we provide a sequence reference library based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I for a valid identification of 79 freshwater fish species from the Lower Paraná River. Neighbour-joining analysis based on K 2 P genetic distances formed non-overlapping clusters for almost all species with a ≥ 99 % bootstrap support each. Identification was successful for 97. 8 % of species as the minimum genetic distance to the nearest neighbour exceeded the maximum intraspecific distance in all these cases. A barcoding gap of 2. 5 % was apparent for the whole data set {{with the exception of}} four cases. Within-species distances ranged from 0. 00 % to 7. 59 %, while interspecific distances varied between 4. 06 % and 19. 98 %, without considering Odontesthes species with a minimum genetic distance of 0 %. Sequence library validation was performed by applying BOLDs BIN analysis tool, Poisson Tree Processes model and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, along with a reliable taxonomic assignment by experts.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a PhD research project using a mathematical programming approach {{to solve a}} home healthcare problem (HHC) as well as general workforce scheduling and routing problems (WSRPs). In general, the workforce scheduling and routing problem consists of producing a schedule for mobile workers to make visits at different locations in order to perform some tasks. In some cases, visits may have time-wise dependencies in which a visit must be made within a time period depending on the other visit. A home healthcare problem is a variant of workforce scheduling and routing problems, which consists in producing a daily schedule for nurses or care workers to visit patients at their home. The scheduler must select qualified workers to make visits and route them throughout the time horizon. We implement a mixed integer programming model to solve the HHC. The model is an adaptation of the WSRP from the literature. However, the MIP solver cannot solve a large-scale real-world problem defined in this model form because the problem requires large amounts of memory and computational time. To tackle the problem, we propose heuristic decomposition approaches which split a main problem into sub-problems heuristically and each sub-problem is solved to optimality by the MIP solver. The first decomposition approach is a geographical decomposition with conflict avoidance (GDCA). The algorithm avoids <b>conflicting</b> <b>assignments</b> by solving sub-problems in a sequence in which worker's availabilities are updated after a sub-problem is solved. The approach can find a feasible solution for every HHC problem instance tackled in this thesis. The second approach is a decomposition with conflict repair and we propose two variants: geographical decomposition with conflict repair (GDCR) and repeated decomposition and conflict repair (RDCR). The GDCR works {{in the same way}} as GDCA but instead of solving sub-problems in a given sequence, they are solved with no specific order and <b>conflicting</b> <b>assignments</b> are allowed. Later on, the <b>conflicting</b> <b>assignments</b> are resolved by a <b>conflicting</b> <b>assignments</b> repair process. The remaining unassigned visits are allocated by a heuristic assignment algorithm. The second variant, RDCR, tackles the unassigned visits by repeating the decomposition and conflict repair until no further improvement has been found. We also conduct an experiment to use different decomposition rules for RDCR. Based on computational experiments conducted in this thesis, the RDCR is found to be the best of the heuristic decomposition approaches. Therefore, the RDCR is extended to solve a WSRP with time-dependent activities constraints. The approach requires modification to accommodate the time-dependent activities constraints which means that two visits may have time-wise requirements such as synchronisation, time overlapped, etc. In addition, we propose a reformulated MIP model to solve the HHC problem. The new model is considered to be a compact model because it has significantly fewer constraints. The aim of the reformulation is to reduce the solver requirements for memory and computational time. The MIP solver can solve all the HHC instances formulated in a compact model. Most of solutions obtained with this approach are the best known solutions so far except for those the instances for which the optimal solution can be found using the full MIP model. Typically, this approach requires computational time below one hour per instance. This problem reformulation is so far the best approach to solve the HHC instances considered in this thesis. The heuristic decomposition and model reformulation proposed in this thesis can find solutions to the real-world home healthcare problem. The main achievement is the reduction of computational memory and computational time which are required by the optimisation solver. Our studies show the best way to control the use of solver memory is the heuristic decomposition approach, particularly the RDCR method. The RDCR method can find a solution for every instance used throughout this thesis and keep the memory usage within personal computer memory ranges. Also, the computational time required to solve an instance being less than 8 minutes, for which the solution gap to the optimal solution is on average 12...|$|R
40|$|In {{the musical}} {{repertory}} {{of the medieval}} Gregorian liturgy, office chants have more diversity among sources than mass chants. The diversity sometimes results in the <b>conflicting</b> modal <b>assignments</b> of given chants which {{have been one of}} the chief concerns of the theorists throughout medieval centuries. By finding the <b>conflicting</b> modal <b>assignments</b> in the office antiphons from Ash Wednesday to Pentecost through a comparison of seven German antiphoners, and also by consulting with contemporary theoretical treatises about the antiphons of problematic modal assignments, this study inspects the real circumstances of modal problems in the medieval practice. One of the causes of the <b>conflicting</b> modal <b>assignment</b> of antiphons is the change of criterion of modal decision. In the early middle ages, singers selected the psalm tone according to the melodic incipit of an antiphon, while later they decided the mode of every chant based on the finalis. The other cause of conflict is that medieval singers often transposed a melody either entirely or in part, in order to avoid a certain interval or a chromatic tone, or in order to ease excessively high or law notes for certain singers. These modal conflicts, even among the sources produced in rather closely located geographical places, along with the theoretical discussions on modal problems of such antiphons, can be regarded as evidence of the struggles of medieval musicians to systematize the vast repertory they inherited...|$|R

In this work, we employ the ontology of artistic concepts that includes visual (or atomic) concepts at the intermediate level and high-level concepts at the application level. Visual-level color and brushwork concepts are widely used by art historians to analyze paintings and serve as cues for annotating high-level concepts such as the artist names, painting styles and art periods for paintings. In this research we combine the color and brushwork concepts with low-level features and utilize the transductive inference framework to annotate high-level concepts to the image blocks. In order to resolve <b>conflicting</b> <b>assignments</b> of high-level concepts, we further employ the ontology-based concept disambiguation method and generate image-level annotations. This method performs global optimization of the block-level annotations using the linear constraints extracted from domain knowledge.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gene {{expression}} as {{governed by the}} interplay {{of the components of}} regulatory networks is indeed one of the most complex fundamental processes in biological systems. Although several methods have been published to unravel the hierarchical structure of regulatory networks, weaknesses such as the incorrect or inconsistent assignment of elements to their hierarchical levels, the incapability to cope with cyclic dependencies within the networks or the need for a manual curation to retrieve non-overlapping levels remain unsolved. METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: We developed HiNO as a significant improvement of the so-called breadth-first-search (BFS) method. While BFS is capable of determining the overall hierarchical structures from gene regulatory networks, it especially has problems solving feed-forward type of loops leading to conflicts within the level assignments. We resolved these problems by adding a recursive correction approach consisting of two steps. First each vertex is placed on the lowest level that this vertex and its regulating vertices are assigned to (downgrade procedure). Second, vertices are assigned to the next higher level (upgrade procedure) if they have successors with the same level assignment and have themselves no regulators. We evaluated HiNO by comparing it with the BFS method by applying them to the regulatory networks from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, respectively. The comparison shows clearly how <b>conflicts</b> in level <b>assignment</b> are resolved in HiNO in order to produce correct hierarchical structures even on the local levels in an automated fashion. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the resolution of <b>conflicting</b> <b>assignments</b> clearly improves the BFS-method. While we restricted our analysis to gene regulatory networks, our approach is suitable to deal with any directed hierarchical networks structure such as the interaction of microRNAs or the action of non-coding RNAs in general. Furthermore we provide a user-friendly web-interface for HiNO that enables the extraction of the hierarchical structure of any directed regulatory network.

40|$|Background: Phylogenetic {{networks}} are generalizations of phylogenetic trees, {{that are used}} to model evolutionary events in various contexts. Several different methods and criteria have been introduced for reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Maximum Parsimony is a character-based approach that infers a phylogenetic tree by minimizing the total number of evolutionary steps required to explain a given set of data assigned on the leaves. Exact solutions for optimizing parsimony scores on phylogenetic trees have been introduced in the past. Results: In this paper, we define the parsimony score on networks as the sum of the substitution costs along all the edges of the network; and show that certain well-known algorithms that calculate the optimum parsimony score on trees, such as Sankoff and Fitch algorithms extend naturally for networks, barring <b>conflicting</b> <b>assignments</b> at the reticulate vertices. We provide heuristics for finding the optimum parsimony scores on networks. Our algorithms can be applied for any cost matrix that may contain unequal substitution costs of transforming between different characters along different edges of the network. We analyzed this for experimental data on 10 leaves or fewer with at most 2 reticulations and found that for almost all networks, the bounds returned by the heuristics matched with the exhaustively determined optimum parsimony scores. Conclusion: The parsimony score we define here does not directly reflect the cost of the best tree in the networ...|$|R

A run-time system to support ELC is also defined and several implementations are discussed, {{one of which}} was done by Tom Seevers in 1989. Five programming constructs are introduced which permit explicit specification of sections of program code that may be done in parallel. These constructs are INCASE, FORCASE, FORALL, SIMULCASE and SIMULALL. Each construct has a number of caselimbs, which are the sections that may be executed in parallel. Caselimbs are scheduled for execution on one or more logical processors, called TMMs, or Task Management Modules. FORCASE and FORALL allow the caselimbs to be scheduled in any way, even sequentially, while SIMULCASE and SIMULALL require that the caselimbs execute at the same time. A memory management system is defied which detects multiple <b>conflicting</b> <b>assignments</b> to the same variable, called a data integrity error. Caselimbs in SIMULALL and SIMULCASE may communicate with each other while executing via message queues, which are first-in first-out buffered queues. A hierarchically structured system of message queues is formed when such message queues are declared inside caselimbs which contain parallel constructs. Such a system benefits from data hiding and program structuring. The translation from ELC source code to object code in a machine language called NQL, New Quadruple Language, is discussed. Sample programs in ELC are presented and programming techniques are discussed.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an asynchronous algorithm for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization problems (DCOPs). The proposed technique unifies asynchronous backtracking (ABT) and asynchronous distributed optimization (ADOPT) where valued nogoods enable more flexible reasoning and {{more opportunities for}} communication, leading to an important speed-up. While feedback can be sent in ADOPT by COST messages only to one predefined predecessor, our extension allows for sending such information to any relevant agent. The concept of valued nogood is an extension by Dago and Verfaille {{of the concept of}} classic nogood that associates the list of <b>conflicting</b> <b>assignments</b> with a cost and, optionally, with a set of references to culprit constraints. DCOPs have been shown to have very elegant distributed solutions, such as ADOPT, distributed asynchronous overlay (DisAO), or DPOP. These algorithms are typically tuned to minimize the longest causal chain of messages as a measure of how the algorithms will scale for systems with remote agents (with large latency in communication). ADOPT has the property of maintaining the initial distribution of the problem. To be efficient, ADOPT needs a preprocessing step consisting of computing a Depth-First Search (DFS) tree on the constraint graph. Valued nogoods allow for automatically detecting and exploiting the best DFS tree compatible with the current ordering. To exploit such DFS trees it is now sufficient to ensure that they exist. Also, the inference rules available for valued nogoods help to exploit schemes of communication where more feedback is sent to higher priority agents. Together they result in an order of magnitude improvement. 1...|$|R
