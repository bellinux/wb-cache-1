The general problem of <b>connection</b> admission <b>control</b> (CAC) and its formulation as a functional mapping are discussed, leading to applications of learning algorithms to CAC problems. In particular, {{the use of the}} class of feed-forward neural nets with back-propagation learning rule is considered, where various architecture alternatives are presented. As example a simple neural net structure and its use to <b>control</b> <b>connection</b> acceptance is discussed in detail. The neural net performance is compared with other <b>connection</b> admission <b>control</b> mechanisms like the peak bit rate, the equivalent bandwidth and the weighted variance methods. Numerical results for both cases, stationary load and non-stationary pulse-form overload patterns, illustrate {{the capability of}} neural nets to act as connection admission controller in ATM environments. 1 Introduction In b [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{resource allocation}} for elastic wireless applications that measure utility by target connection average throughput and achieved throughput. We construct {{a framework for}} <b>connection</b> access <b>control</b> and rate scheduling that supports this class of applications by maximizing long term average utility. We present a decomposition of the problem into <b>connection</b> access <b>control</b> and rate scheduling layers. The <b>connection</b> access <b>control</b> layer considers current commitments and decides whether to admit new sessions. For admitted users, the layer sets a target throughput to be achieved of the lifetime of the session. The rate scheduling layer adjusts the instantaneous rates of each connection {{on the basis of}} how well it is achieving each performance goal and on the relative strength of each connectionpsilas current channel. We illustrate how commonly used <b>connection</b> access <b>control</b> and rate scheduling techniques can be applied to design these two layers using an exchange of information regarding future target throughputs and achieved throughputs. Through numerical analysis, we show how wireless channel time diversity and multi-user diversity can be exploited to construct a rate scheduling algorithm that is superior to proportional fairness. Finally, this utility-based framework is compared to a method that does not use utility...|$|R
