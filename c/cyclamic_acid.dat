40|$|Eight new homo-and hetero-leptic bismuth(III) {{complexes}} and two new polynuclear bismuth(III) oxido clusters {{derived from}} acetosulfame (AceH) and <b>cyclamic</b> <b>acid</b> (CycH₂) have been synthesised and characterised. Complexes, [Ph 2 Bi(Ace) ] 1, [Bi(Ace) 3] 2, [PhBi(Ace) 2] 3, [Bi(CycH) ₃] 6, [Ph₂Bi(CycH) ] 7 and [PhBi(CycH) ₂] 8 were synthesised by treating BiPh 3 {{with the appropriate}} acid in 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 stoichiometric ratios under solvent-free or solvent-mediated conditions. Complex 4, [Bi(OH) (Ace) ₂], {{was obtained from the}} hydrolysis of 3. [Bi 2 (Cyc) 3] 9 was obtained from the reaction of <b>cyclamic</b> <b>acid</b> with (Bi(OtBu) 3) in a 3 : 2 ratio under inert conditions. The polynuclear bismuth oxido clusters, [Bi₅₀O₆₄(Ace) ₂₂(H₂O) ₁₀] 5 and [Bi₃₈O₄₅(CycH) ₂₄(H₂O) ₁₄] 10 were obtained using Bi 2 O 3 under sonication in water and their composition confirmed through elemental and thermogravimetric analyses. The DMSO soluble complexes, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9, were all assessed for their in-vitro activity against three strains of H. pylori (251, 26695 and B 128). All compounds gave an MIC value of 6. 25 μg/mL, indicating that bactericidal activity is insensitive to increased substitution by acetosulfamate or cyclamate at the Bi(III) centre...|$|E

40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method with evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous determination of multiple sweeteners, i. e., acesulfame-K, alitame, aspartame, <b>cyclamic</b> <b>acid,</b> dulcin, neotame, neohesperidine dihydrochalcone, saccharin and sucralose in carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks, canned or bottled fruits and yoghurt. The procedure involves an extraction of the nine sweeteners with a buffer solution, sample clean-up using solid-phase extraction cartridges followed by an HPLC-ELSD analysis. The trueness of the method was satisfactory with recoveries ranging from 93 to 109 % for concentration levels around the maximum usable dosages for authorised sweeteners and from 100 to 112 % for unauthorised compounds at concentration levels close to the limit of quantification (LOQs). Precision measures showed mean repeatability values of < 4 % (expressed as relative standard deviation) for highly concentrated samples and < 5 % at concentration levels close to the LOQs. Intermediate precision was in most cases < 8 %. The limits of detection (LODs) were below 15 µg g- 1 and the LOQs below 30 µg g- 1 in all three matrices. Only dulcin showed slightly higher values, i. e., LODs around 30 µg g- 1 and LOQs around 50 µg g- 1. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} 14 subjects, {{who had been}} {{identified}} from 261 volunteers in a 1 -week screen as being able to metabolize the sweetener cyclamate to cyclohexylamine (> 0. 2 % of a daily dose), and 31 nonconverters (< 0. 2 % metabolism) were given calcium cyclamate tablets (equivalent to 250 mg <b>cyclamic</b> <b>acid,</b> 3 times daily) {{for a period of}} 13 weeks. The metabolism of cyclamate to cyclohexylamine was determined using twice-weekly timed (3 h) urine collections during week 1 – 3 and 7 – 13. Urine specimens were collected on all other study days to investigate day-to-day fluctuations in cyclohexylamine excretion. Analyses of the twice weekly timed urine collections showed that subjects recruited as nonconverters essentially remained nonconverters. Of the converters, three showed consistently low metabolism, five showed erratic metabolism, five showed low metabolism initially, which increased during {{the latter part of the}} study, and one subject showed consistently high metabolism throughout the study. Analysis of the day-to-day urine specimens showed marked intrasubject variability. The plasma concentrations of cyclohexylamine measured on weeks 1 – 3 and 7 – 13 reflected the urine profiles. The highest individual long-term average steady-state excretion values based on the 3 -h urine collections and daily samples were 21 %, 23 %, 25 %, 29 %, 34 %, and 38 %. The maximum % metabolism detected in the high converters occasionally reached the value of 60 % reported in previous short-term studies, but this high activity was not maintained, and was followed by periods of lower metabolism. The results of this metabolism study support an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0 – 11 mg/kg body weight per day...|$|E
40|$|Artificial sweeteners, such as {{saccharin}} or <b>cyclamic</b> <b>acid</b> are synthetically manufactured sweetenings. Known {{for their}} low energetic value they serve especially diabetic and adipose patients as sugar substitutes. It has been {{hypothesized that the}} substitution of sugar with artificial sweeteners may induce a decrease of the blood glucose. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the reliability of this hypothesis by comparing the influence of regular table sugar and artificial sweeteners on the blood glucose concentration. In this pilot-study 16 patients were included suffering from adiposity, pre-diabetes and hypertension. In the sense of a cross-over design, three test trials were performed at intervals of several weeks. Each trial was followed by a test free interval. Within one test trial each patient consumed 150 ml test solution (water) that contained either 6 g of table sugar (“Kandisin”) with sweetener free serving as control group. Tests were performed within 1 hr after lunch to ensure conditions comparable to patients having a desert. Every participant had to determine their blood glucose concentration immediately before and 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after the intake of the test solution. For statistics an analysis of variance was performed. The data showed no significant changes in the blood glucose concentration. Neither the application of sugar (F 4; 60 = 1. 645; p =. 175) nor the consumption of an artificial sweetener (F 2. 068; 31. 023 = 1. 551; p >. 05) caused significant fluctuations in the blood sugar levels. Over a time frame of 60 minutes in the control group a significant decrease of the blood sugar concentration was found (F 2. 457; 36. 849 = 4. 005; p =. 020) as a physiological reaction during lunch digestion...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{explored}} the synthesis and characterisation of novel homo- and hetero-leptic mono-nuclear bismuth(III) complexes and bismuth(III) oxo(hydroxo) clusters derived from five different classes of ligands namely, thiocarboxylic acids (Chapter 2), sulfamates (Chapter 3), β-thioxoketones (Chapter 4), N, N-bis-sulfamides (Chapter 5. 1) and DNA bases (Chapter 5. 2). The medicinal {{relevance of the}} synthesised bismuth(III) complexes as antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and the anti-Leishmanial activity of both the free acids and the bismuth(III) complexes against Leishmania major (L. major) promastigotes were assessed (Chapter 6). The synthesis and the characterisation of four new thiocarboxylic acids and eleven different mono-, bis- and tris-substituted bismuth(III) thiocarboxylates was investigated in Chapter 2. The solid state structures of the bismuth(III) complexes, [Bi{SC(=O) C 6 H 5 } 3] B- 1, [PhBi{SC(=O) C 6 H 5 } 2] B- 2, [PhBi{SC(=O) C 6 H 5 } 2] 2 B- 2 -dimer and [PhBi{S(C=O) C 6 H 4 Br} 2] B- 9 were obtained. Next, the coordination chemistry of bismuth(III) sulfamate complexes was investigated. A variety of sulfamates such as saccharin, thiosaccharin, acetosulfame and <b>cyclamic</b> <b>acid</b> were applied and resulted {{in the formation of}} fourteen new homo- and hetero-leptic bismuth(III) complexes including, [Ph 2 Bi(sac) ] (sac-H=saccharin) B- 14, [Ph 2 Bi(tsac) ] (tsac-H=thiosaccharin) B- 17, [Bi(cyc-H) 3] (cyc-H 2 =cyclamic acid) B- 20 and [Ph 2 Bi(ace) ] (ace-H=acetosulfame) B- 24. The solid state structures of the bismuth(III) complexes, B- 14 and B- 17 were determined and discussed. Four new polynuclear bismuth(III) oxo(hydroxo) clusters of the sulfamates including, the largest homo-metallic bismuth(III) oxo-cluster, [Bi 50 O 64 (ace) 22 (H 2 O) 10] B- 29 were synthesised and the solid state structures of the clusters [Bi 6 O 4 (OH) 4 (NH 2 SO 3) 6] B- 28 and [Bi 4 O 2 (ace) 8 (H 2 O) 4]] B- 31 were revealed by X-ray crystallography. Synthesis and characterisation of nine different β-thioxoketones and their tris-substituted bismuth(III) derivatives was investigated in Chapter 4. Highlights include, [Bi{C 6 H 5 C(=O) CHC(=S) C 6 H 4 CF 3 } 3] B- 33, [Bi{C 5 H 4 NC(=O) CHC(=S) C 6 H 5 } 3] B- 36 and [Bi{C 6 H 5 C(=O) CHC(=S) C 10 H 7 } 3] B- 39. The solid state structure of B- 36 was determined by X-ray crystallography. Two classes of ligands namely, N, N-bis-sulfamides and DNA bases were selected to explore the chemistry of compounds containing Bi-N bonds. The N, N-bis-sulfamides were synthesised prior to the synthesis of their bismuth(III) complexes. Five new bismuth(III) complexes of N, N-bis-sulfamides including, [Bi 2 {(C 6 H 5 CH(CH 3) N) 2 SO 2 } 3] B- 41 and [Bi 2 {(OCH 3 C 6 H 4 CH 2 N) 2 SO 2 } 3] B- 44 were synthesised and characterised. The DNA bases, guanine and thymine produced the expected tris-substituted products, while adenine and cytosine gave the tetra-nuclear oxo(hydroxy) species [Bi 4 O 2 (adenine) 8. 12 H 2 O] B- 46 and [Bi 4 (OH) 4 (cytosine) 8. THF] B- 49. Chapter 6 explores the potential of bismuth(III) compounds as antibiotics against H. pylori and anti-Leishmanial drugs. The activity of the synthesised bismuth(III) complexes of thiocarboxylates, sulfamates and thioxoketones were assessed for their activity against three strains of H. pylori; 251, 26695 and B 128. The results were compared with the standard bismuth drugs. Most of the complexes showed to be highly active comparative to the commercial drugs, showing minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 6. 25 - 3. 125 µg/mL. The activity of the synthesised bismuth(III) complexes of thiocarboxylates, sulfamates, thioxoketones and their corresponding free acids were tested against L. major promastigotes and the results were compared with the activity of commercially available anti-Leishmanial drug Amphotericin B. Many of the free acids and the bismuth(III) complexes showed good anti-Leishmanial activity...|$|E
