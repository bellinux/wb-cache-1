40|$|We {{study the}} {{implications}} of a noncommutative geometry of the minisuperspace variables for the FRW universe with a conformally coupled scalar field. The investigation is carried out {{by means of a}} comparative study of the universe evolution in four different scenarios: classical commutative, classical noncommutative, quantum commutative, and quantum noncommutative, the last two employing the Bohmian formalism of quantum trajectories. The role of noncommutativity is discussed by drawing a parallel between its realizations in two possible frameworks for physical interpretation: the NC-frame, where it is manifest in the universe degrees of freedom, and in the <b>C-frame,</b> where it is manifest through theta-dependent terms in the Hamiltonian. As a result of our comparative analysis, we find that noncommutative geometry can remove singularities in the classical context for sufficiently large values of theta. Moreover, under special conditions, the classical noncommutative model can admit bouncing solutions characteristic of the commutative quantum FRW universe. In the quantum context, we find non-singular universe solutions containing bounces or being periodic in the quantum commutative model. When noncommutativity effects are turned on in the quantum scenario, they can introduce significant modifications that change the singular behavior of the universe solutions or that render them dynamical whenever they are static in the commutative case. The effects of noncommutativity are completely specified only when one of the frames for its realization is adopted as the physical one.

40|$|Abstract. Reducing {{exploitation}} {{energy consumption}} for any technical system {{is an effective}} way, which is in complete accordance {{with the concept of}} sustainable development. The presses, particularly the mechanical ones, are machine tools with a long-term exploitation. At these ones, the operating energy consumption, significant in value, decreases only if the rigidity of the structure of resistance increases, including that of the frame. Several analytical models, developed and studied by the authors, confirmed the hypothesis that a solution to increase the rigidity of a mechanical press with open frame is obtained by shortening it. Moreover, it occurs also a slight decrease in material consumption integrated into the frame, which is a favourable effect. There have been developed more new constructive solutions, characterized by minimal changes to the reference design solution, that of the press frame PAI 25. The new suggested constructive solutions are obtained as 3 D models, accomplished in Pro Engineer Wildfire 4, and the finite element analysis was made in Catia V 5 R 16.

40|$|Abstract. The {{air bending}} process {{is one of}} the most widely used process for the {{manufacturing}} of sheet metal bending parts made of thin as well as of thick sheet metal. Although the air bending process offers a very high production potential due to its great flexibility, it is associated with certain problems which can negatively influence the shape and dimensional accuracy of the bending parts. Examples for such negative influences are the springback of the material, the batch variations, or the deflections of the bending machine and tools. These differences have to be considered either in the determination of the process parameters or they have to be compensated later on in the manufacturing process itself. A well established approach to calculate process data for forming processes is the use of a process simulation. At the Institute of Forming Technology and Lightweight Construction (IUL) a simulation software called Sheet Metal Bending Simulation (SMBS) has been developed and successfully been tested for the field of sheet metal bending, based on semi-analytical approaches. Although it already provides very satisfactory results in general, disturbances such as material and batch variations as well as the deflections of <b>C-frame,</b> machine table, and press brake ram can still negatively affect the prediction of the punch displacement necessary to achieve a certain bend angle.

Compared to labor intensive hand layup prepreg technologies, Light RTM offers some substantial advantages by reducing infrastructure requirements such as hydraulic presses or autoclaves. Compared to Prepreg, Light RTM tooling creates two finished surfaces, which is an advantage during installation due to improved dimensional accuracy. The focus of this work was to develop means of achieving high fiber volume fraction structural frames using low cost tooling and a low volume manufacturing strategy. In this case a three piece Light RTM mold was developed using an internal mandrel. To achieve the strength requirements, a combination of crimped and non-crimped fabrics were selected for the reinforcing preform. This made it possible {{to reduce the number of}} flat patterns by more than 8 times, saving layup time compared to the prepreg counterpart. The processing parameters were optimized to reduce cycle time. Permeability, in-situ resin cure monitoring and coefficient of thermal expansion tests were used in the numerical simulations.
