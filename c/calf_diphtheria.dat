As the chief field biologist, Murie concluded that human development was causing overcrowding in the elk’s winter range. [...] Murie {{was one of the first}} to discover that these elk historically resided in the mountains and not solely in the plains thus contributing to overcrowding. [...] Although a National Elk Refuge existed in this region consisting of 4,500 acres, this refuge had some unexpected consequences. Due to supplemental feeding and a rougher browse, elk were developing bacterial lesions in their throat and mouth called necrotic stomatitis or <b>calf</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> [...] The squirrel-tail grass seeds found on the refuge contributed to the irritation of these lesions and the close proximity of elk allowed for the bacteria to spread easily. [...] Through these observations, Murie determined that protecting the elk’s habitat initially, would have been more beneficial than attempting to mitigate the problem later.|$|E

40|$|Bacillus necrophorus is an {{important}} organism in animal dis-ease since it produces severe septic processes in a num-ber of domestic animals. The organism is widely distributed and is responsible for considerable losses. It may invade almost any tissue and is associated with various necrotic foci, as in <b>calf</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> necrotic ulcers of the intestine in hog cholera, foot-rot of sheep and cattle, grease heel or necrotic scratches of horses, lip and leg ulceration of sheep, gangrenous dermatitis of horses, metastatic necrosis of liver and lungs of cattle and swine, necrotic stomatitis of calves, lambs and pigs. A few human cases of infection with a similar organism have been reported. These are referred to by Harris and Brown (1927) who isolated from cases of puerperal infection in women cultures closely resembling B. necrophorus and designated by them Act. pseudo-necrophorus. Because of the wide distribution of necrophorus bacilli {{and the fact that}} they produce disease in such a variety of animals it seemed worth while to find out as much as possible about strains from different sources. This work has been started with a group of 10 cultures isolated from cows, studies of which are reported in this paper. They include 7 strains isolated from liver ab-scesses, 1 from a spleen abscess, 1 from a lung, and the last from an abscess in the omentum. Isolations were made in two ways, either directly through cul-tures or by passage through a rabbit. If a stained preparation of the original material showed a predominance of necrophoru...|$|E
40|$|The {{educational}} program of agricultural extension has been {{sponsored by the}} Cherry County Extension Service. 359 families subscribed 1630. 40 {{for the support of}} the work in 1939. The commissioners provided office space valued at 180. 00. Other income provided 288. 58 making a total operating fund of 2, 103. 38. Expenditures for operating costs during the year were 180. 00 for office space and 1671. 29 for carrying on the program. Mr. Jake Stasch of Nenzel, Mr. A. J. Galloway of Kilgore, and Mr. O. J. Dau of Cody were appointed members of the finance committee. They directed the canvass for subscriptions {{with the help of the}} precinct solicitors. The program of work directed special emphasis to the Nebraska Pasture-Forage-Livestock program, to pasture improvement, to herdquality improvement and to livestock marketing. The 4 -H agricultural clubs specialized in herd quality. The home economics program for both 4 -H clubs and adult women gave attention to foods, clothing and home management. Demonstrational variety and type plats of wheat, oats and sorghums were planted in the county. Komar wheat yielded 17. 5 bushels per acre as compared to 16. 3 bushels of Ceres, and 14. 3 bushels of Reward. Dry weather, grasshoppers and wind destroyed the oats tests. Most of the sorghum plats were destroyed by hail and heavy rain in June. Leoti Red sorgo produced two and three-fourths ton of cured fodder per acre compared to 2. 4 tons of atlas, 2 tons of Cheyenne, and an estimated 3 / 4 ton of corn fodder. The acreage of grain sorghums was more than doubled this year and totaled 4, 274 acres. The forage sorghums increased from 11, 960 acres in 1938 to 13, 625 acres in 1939. In the early 19302 ̆ 7 s, the sandhills were carrying maximum numbers of livestock. The drouth has accumulated since 1930 to a total deficiency of 38 inches of rainfall. Cattlemen here had to cut down their herds and get more range in their ranching units. The range program, pasture improvement program of the county extension service and the pasture-forage-livestock program have made the ranchers conscious of the need for conserving grasslands. 429, 948 acres of Cherry County pastures were rested in 1939 in addition to those regularly left tor winter pasture. 195 additional wells were installed in 1938 and 242 more during 1939. The average acreage served by one well has been reduced from 1111 acres to 1028. Landscaping, yard beautification and garden information was given at the time of farm and home visits, by office interviews, by news items, and by a beautiful flower and vegetable exhibit at the county fair. 41 ranchers and farmers planted 19, 700 Clarke-McNary seedlings. Blueprints and bills of material service was given for the construction of a horse barn, a 2 -car garage, a grain elevator, 2 livestock feeders and a sale barn. Turkey growers were given monthly service bulletins. Feeding, management, and breed improvement information was extended to all growers whose name was available. Turkey production in the county was greatly increased. Quality improvement program for beef cattle was conducted by means of 4 -H clubs, cooperation with the breeders association and calf shows held in connection with association sales, at a special event in Mullen and at the county fair. Protein supplements and mineral supplements as a balance to the needs of range cattlemen was discussed at two series of community meetings and as a port of the pasture-forage-livestock program. Cottonseed cake and soybean cake have been proved to be more economical than other sources of proteins. Steamed bone meal, by furnishing a good source of phosphorus is an important mineral source. Control of calf scours, <b>calf</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> and the latest information concerning Bang 2 ̆ 7 s disease were the subjects of discussion at community meetings and during the progress of pasture-forage-livestock visits. Bot control and sleeping sickness control in horses was continued. The latter malady has been almost entirely eradicated during the 1939 year. With an A. C. P. depleting goal of 102, 976 acres for the county the summary of performance showed that 73, 464 acres were planted to depleting crops. 3, 096 acres of wheat were planted as compared to a wheat allotment of 3, 565. 429, 948 acres of range were deferred or rested between May 15 and October 1. 242 wells were installed. 76 ranchers and farmers cooperated with the Nebraska Pasture-Forage-Livestock program. 98 visits were made to 61 different ranches and farms. District finish-up clinics and recognition meetings were conducted at Valentine and at Mullen. 8 Cherry County ranchers were awarded recognition by the sponsoring business firm organizations at these district meetings. Two were awarded honorable mention at the Omaha state meet. The Land-Use committee assisted to coordinate the credit facilities of FSA, FCA, and the land bank. Thelr policies were outlined and discussed with representatives of the production credit association and the local banking agencies. Collections are reported much greater than new amounts loaned for the current year. FCA reports collection of total amount on their books tor the county as being more than 60 percent. A livestock brand directory With 1800 brands of herds maintained in the county was published as a 6 -page supplement to the 1938 Cherry County atlas. Cooperated with and assisted the various livestock agencies with promotion of livestock sales services. Sales from Cherry County members of the new feeder cattle association are estimated to exceed 39, 000 head. Added to the purebred sales, the valuation of livestock sold by members at organizations assisted is estimated to exceed 2, 000, 000. 00. 28 clubs enrolled 405 ladies tor the home demonstration program. Six lessons were demonstrated. A total of 148 regular members and 10 associate members enrolled for 172 4 -H club projects. 99 regular members, and 7 associate members completed their projects. 18 clubs were organized as follows: 5 beef cattle clubs completed 41 of 47 enrolled 1 colt club completed 7 of 7 enrolled 2 cooking clubs completed 15 of 24 enrolled 1 canning club completed 8 of 8 enrolled 5 clothing clubs completed 27 of 38 enrolled 2 home management clubs completed 5 of 11 enrolled 1 girls room club completed 7 of 11 enrolled 1 fix-it club completed 1 of 11 enrolled 88 persons used 26 tons of grasshopper bait for protecting crops to make an estimated saving of 16, 525. 00...|$|E
