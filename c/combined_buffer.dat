40|$|A {{promising}} new approach for studying cold ion-molecule chemical reactions {{is the combination}} of laser- or sympathetically-cooled trapped ions and slow-moving molecules from a cold molecule source, such as a quadrupole velocity selector or a Stark decelerator. Previous reaction studies using trapped atomic ions and slow molecules from a quadrupole velocity selector were able to reach average collision energies as low as 1 K. However, the guided molecules had an approximately room temperature rotational energy distribution, so the reactions studied were not truly cold. Thus, a new molecular source for producing translationally and rotationally cold molecules utilizing buffer gas cooling and quadrupole velocity selection was constructed by K. Twyman and characterized for use in cold reaction studies. This new source of cold molecules {{is referred to as}} the buffer gas guide. A new ion trap has been designed and built for use with the existing buffer gas guide. The new ion trap apparatus is compact and mechanically compatible with this new guide. It uses a linear Paul ion trap with cylindrical electrodes to trap ions. Two optical axes (one axial and one radial) enable efficient cooling of small ion crystals. A field-free time-of-flight tube and ion detection assembly are also incorporated into the apparatus. A new technique for determining the mass and quantity of trapped ions has also been developed, termed digital ion trap mass spectrometry. The new technique uses a digital RF waveform to trap ions before ejecting the ions radially from the trap using an ejection pulse applied to the trap electrodes. The ions are then detected after free flight along a time-of-flight tube. This technique was characterized by ejecting crystals of various sizes and compositions: Ca + only, Ca + /CaF +, Ca + /CaOH + /CaOD +, and Ca + /NH + 3 /NH + 4 /H 3 O +. A linear relationship between the number of ions ejected (determined by comparing experimental and simulated crystal images) and the integral of the time-of-flight peak was observed for Ca + and Ca + /CaF +. All mass peaks were resolved. Simulations of the trapped ions and their trajectories through the time-of-flight tube were also performed, and excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental mass resolution was observed.

Increasing core counts lead to high bandwidth demands and tight power and area constraints. One recent line of work examines bufferless deflection routing, which eliminates buffers in the NoC and instead handles contention by deflecting (misrouting) traffic. While bufferless NoC design has shown promising area and power reductions, and offers similar performance to conventional buffered designs for many workloads, such designs provide lower throughput than conventional, more complex, buffered routers at high network load. This degradation is a significant hurdle for widespread adoption of bufferless NoCs.
