5000|$|Seven is {{the fifth}} studio album by the Scottish Celtic rock band Wolfstone. After {{the release of the}} band's {{previous}} album The Half Tail in 1996, numerous members left the band, and due to poor management, the band [...] "split up" [...] in 1998 after the band's label Green Linnet Records released an unrelated side-project as the Wolfstone album This Strange Place in early 1998. However, still contractually obliged to record another album for Green Linnet Records, the remaining members of the band regrouped chose to write and record the required album with full attention, rather than make a [...] "half-hearted" [...] album. Bassist Wayne Mackenzie said [...] "we <b>could</b> have <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> through the motions and made a half-hearted attempt at an album, but we didn’t. The band and our fans mean far too much to us to do that." [...] Titling the album Seven after where the album sits in the band's canonical album sequence, the album style was described as a particularly rock-edged variation of Celtic rock, although it does feature some mellower tracks. The album contains a mix between songs and instrumentals and diverse subject matter.|$|R

5000|$|Nonetheless, {{the band}} had ambitions to {{continue}} as Wolfstone, and in 1998, the band realised that [...] "at some point {{they had to make}} ‘the big decision’, whether to continue or not," [...] but, before making that decision about their long-term future, from August 1998 the band still had to fulfill the last elements of their contract with Green Linnet Records, whose contract required another album from the band, with this album ultimately being Seven. The remaining members of the band chose to write and record the required album with full attention, rather than make a [...] "half-hearted" [...] album. MacKenzie explained: [...] "We <b>could</b> have <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> through the motions and made a half-hearted attempt at an album, but we didn’t.

The band themselves were pleased with the album, with Mackenzie saying [...] "as a band we were happy with Seven, it met our expectations of ourselves."

5000|$|As Palda (2013, page 132) writes [...] "In his 1974 and 1986 {{articles}} Sherwin Rosen {{asked what}} would happen if you were limited in how you could move about through characteristics space. Rosen pointed out that sometimes when buying a product with several underlying characteristics you <b>could</b> not <b>just</b> <b>go</b> out and span characteristics space by buying a bit of another product with the same characteristics but in different proportions. The reason was that sometimes when you buy something, you are selling something {{at the same time and}} are able to sell uniquely to onepurchaser. Recombining goods to balance characteristics to suit your tastes is not possible. Rosen called such exchanges tied-sales."Rosen showed that tied sales could lead to the segregation of people by their types. He argued that the worst effects of segregation could be palliated by a market that resolved supply and demand of complicated tied sales situations through a monetary payment he called an “equalizing difference”. This work led to many unexpected insights on the effects of government policy. For example, the minimum wage might not decrease employment, as economists commonly believed, but it might induce employers to provide less on-the-job training to employees. In addition to implications for policy, Rosen's analysis of choice in characteristics space with tied sales specified the conditions under which the parameters of demand and supply function parameters for the underlying characteristics of goods could be deduced from so-called hedonic regressions.|$|R

50|$|Sydney Dunn (36): Manuel is {{believed}} to have shot and killed a Newcastle taxi driver named Sydney Dunn, on 8 December 1957 while looking for work in Newcastle upon Tyne. Dunn's body was found on moorlands in Northumberland soon after, by which time Manuel had already returned to Lanarkshire. Manuel was never tried for this murder, as it took place in a different legal jurisdiction, but 17 days after he was hanged a coroner's jury found that he murdered Dunn, after a button found in Dunn's taxi was matched to one of his jackets. This verdict has been accepted in many accounts of the case, but some doubts have been expressed. There are a few indications that the murderer might have been a local person, or he might have come off an Irish boat train which had recently arrived at Newcastle station. Two witnesses who spoke to the killer picked out Manuel at an identity parade, but these identifications are not always decisive (see the Watt case above). One of these witnesses initially said that the apparent killer had a local accent, but when it was suggested to him that the killer might have come off the Irish boat train {{he said that he had}} an Irish accent, and Manuel had a Scottish accent. Manuel definitely did attend a job interview in Newcastle two days before this murder, but it is not clear that he hung around in the area; he <b>could</b> have <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> home to Scotland.|$|R
