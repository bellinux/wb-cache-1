40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} taxation on the location of foreign direct investment (FDI) and taxable income reported by multinational firms with {{particular attention to the}} regional dynamics of tax competition and the role <b>of</b> <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> Confidential affiliate-level data are used to compare the investment and income-reporting behavior of American-owned foreign affiliates across ownership forms and regions. Ten percent higher tax rates are associated with 5. 0 percent lower FDI, controlling for parent company and observable aspects of local economies, and 0. 9 percent lower returns on assets, controlling for parent company and level of FDI. Tax effects are particularly strong within Europe, where ten percent higher tax rates are associated with 7. 7 percent lower FDI and 1. 7 percent lower returns on assets. Indirectly owned foreign affiliates also exhibit strong tax effects, ten percent higher tax rates being associated with 12. 0 percent lower FDI and 1. 4 percent lower returns on assets. American firms finance a growing fraction of their foreign operations indirectly through <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> which now account for more than 30 percent of aggregate foreign assets and sales. Ownership chains are particularly concentrated among European affiliates. Since multinational firms from countries other than the United States face tax environments similar to those faced by indirectly owned affiliates of American companies, these results suggest a greater sensitivity of FDI to taxes for non-American firms. The results also suggest that European economic integration may have the effect of intensifying tax competition between European jurisdictions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} {{measures of}} {{flows and stocks}} of FDI view FDI as a financial flow and its accumulation as a stock, but most uses of FDI data require measures of employment, payrolls, capital inputs, and output from FDI. Judging by data for the United States, the flow and stock data provide rough approximations to country distributions of FDI sources and destinations, but are poor approximations to industry distributions of FDI and to changes over time in country and industry distributions. One important reason for the poor match between {{the two types of}} measures is that more and more of production is the output from intangible and financial assets, the location of which is determined by the firm itself, and not easily subject to outside verification. That development is combined with the increasing use of holding companies and <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> to reduce tax burdens on the firms without necessarily altering the physical location of inputs or production. These developments have drawn the attention of tax authorities and led to some proposals that would reduce firms' ability to manipulate the location of assets and profits. However, these maneuvers also lead to ambiguities in the meaning of economic measures, such as the balance of payments and national product. The effects on economic measurements, which may influence many types of economic policy, have been submerged in the concern for tax revenues. ...|$|R

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Macquarie University, 1992. Bibliography: leaves 380 - 389. Serials were an {{important}} element of commercial programming from the 1930 s to the 1960 s because they performed particular functions for stations and advertisers. Drama was expensive, however, so broadcasters had to organise cooperative production of recorded serials for distribution by networking, a process which continually challenged the Government regulations designed to prevent just that. The success of the broadcasters in popularising broadcast advertising provoked newspapers to involve themselves in broadcasting and stations to seek a reciprocal advantage through association with newspapers. The Government’s response was to restrict the formation <b>of</b> <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and/or control, but to permit the operation of cooperative networks which made country stations economic inclusions in sponsorship contracts. The demand for serials encouraged the formation of many independent production companies, but competition from cheap American transcriptions depressed their sales and prices. Moreover, the small size of the local market meant that many found it necessary to sell overseas to make a profit, so serials which had already been shaped to appeal to the mass audience in Australia, had to be further modified - 'internationalised' - to make them accessible to foreign mass audiences. This loss of Australian-ness, plus the circulation of American serials, led to a still-unresolved discussion about the nature of Australian 'culture', whether it should be protected, and if so, how best to do it. During the 1940 s and 1950 s, the radio serial industry was able to support a great many artists and technicians. The economics of the industry, however, were such that its viability depended on their accepting low fees and onerous working conditions. After 1956, wherever a television station began broadcasting, audiences lost interest in radio drama, and so too did advertisers. Sales of new serials began to fall off, and by 1960 the serial production industry was dead, and most of the artists unemployed. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (389 leaves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. RFID tags travel between partner {{sites in}} a supply chain. For privacy reasons, each partner owns the tags present at his site, i. e., {{the owner is}} the only entity able to {{authenticate}} his tags. When passing tags {{on to the next}} partner in the supply <b>chain,</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> the old partner is transferred to the new partner. In this paper, we propose RO-TIV, a protocol that allows secure ownership transfer against malicious owners. ROTIV offers as well issuer verification to prevent malicious partners from injecting fake tags not originally issued by some trusted party. As part <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> ROTIV provides a constant-time, privacypreserving authentication. ROTIV’s main idea is to combine an HMACbased authentication with public key encryption to achieve constant time authentication and issuer verification. To assure privacy, ROTIV implements key update techniques and tag state re-encryption techniques, performed on the reader. ROTIV is especially designed for lightweight tags which are only required to evaluate a hash function. ...|$|R

In this paper, we formally define the security model <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> transfer protocols and propose a secure ownership transfer protocol. In our scheme, current owner provides a new owner with the evidence of transfer and a proof of tag origin. Key management becomes easy in our system, since the one asymmetric verification key of the owner can be used to verify multiple tags that belong to the owner...|$|R
50|$|By the 1920s, {{about half}} of the Company's {{drilling}} was outside the continental United States. Robert Longyear (E.J.’s son) became president of the firm in 1924, preserving the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> family <b>ownership</b> and management that would continue for another 40 years. In 1929, Longyear sold almost US$1.5 million worth of drilling equipment to other drillers. The following year the company formed its first foreign subsidiary in Canada. The company also signed its first contract for work in Africa, sending equipment and a crew to provide drilling for copper ores. However, the stock market crash of October 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression reduced earnings to $79,000 in 1933. During the 1930s, Longyear took on a project drilling for core samples for the proposed Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In spite of the financial crisis, the 1930s saw improvements in diamond drilling technology, including the use of industrial-quality diamonds mined in Africa that were called “boarts.” In 1936, South Africa’s Anglo American Corporation formed Boart Products South Africa (Pty) Limited, which was later named Boart International. The new company developed the first mechanically-set diamond core bits, which were less expensive than the hand-set core bits that used more expensive Brazilian diamonds (carbonados).|$|R
50|$|However, proving {{ownership}} {{in the absence of}} the documents was an impossibility, and forgeries of crown grants were common and difficult to detect. Moreover, it was nearly impossible to determine if land was subject to common law encumbrances (i.e. mortgages). This led to the establishment in the 18th century of land registry systems, where a central office in each county was responsible for the filing of land deeds, mortgages, liens and other evidence of ownership, transfer or encumbrance. Under land registry, deeds and charges were not recognized unless they were filed, and persons who filed were given priority over previous transactions that had not been filed. Moreover, under statutes of limitation, in certain jurisdictions only documents that had been filed in the past 40 years had to be consulted to determine the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Real {{estate is}} one field where the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> title has {{considerable}} significance. Various registration systems, {{such as the}} Torrens title system, {{have been developed to}} track the <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> individual pieces of real property. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue title insurance based upon the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records. In other cases, the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> title is established by an abstract of title, sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney. In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> title, despite the fact that clear <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed. Widespread lack <b>of</b> clarity in <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration <b>of</b> changes <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> with local governments. [...] US states have objected and even sued over this practice.|$|R
50|$|The {{blockchain}} is {{a public}} ledger that records bitcoin transactions. A novel solution accomplishes this without any trusted central authority: maintenance of the blockchain is performed by a network of communicating nodes running bitcoin software. Transactions of the form payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this network using readily available software applications. Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. The blockchain is a distributed database - to achieve independent verification of the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> of any and every bitcoin amount, each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain. Approximately six times per hour, {{a new group of}} accepted transactions, a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes. This allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin amount has been spent, which is necessary in order to prevent double-spending in an environment without central oversight. Whereas a conventional ledger records the transfers of actual bills or promissory notes that exist apart from it, the blockchain is the only place that bitcoins can be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions.|$|E
50|$|Tax {{collection}} was also {{determined by the}} status of the land and the identity of the land owner. If the land owner {{was a member of the}} reaya class, he was expected to pay taxes. However, if the owner was a member of the askeri, then he was exempt from doing so. If the land in question was not included in an early administrative survey, which took place in 1616, it was considered haric, or too old to be taxed. If record of it existed before that time, it was considered kadim, universally taxable regardless of {{the status of the}} person who owned it. After these steps, land was further categorized into relative affluence on the administrative survey. These policies heavily influenced the way that taxes were disputed in court; parties would not debate the tax status of an individual, but rather the status of the land, and they would not debate over the current owner of the land, but of the owner at the time of the survey. Residents often won arguments over the taxable status of their property by demonstrating a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> that predated the register, demonstrating that the status of the land was askeri. Another method that residents could obtain tax exemptions through was to petition the central fiscal body for exemption. This would convert land once considered kadim, to become haric upon decree. Government officials recognized the implications of this, and attempted to restrict the number of these available by application.|$|E
50|$|Working {{together}} the DS consortium has expanded {{the resources of}} libraries to manage collections of rare materials by providing a digital cataloging standard for pre-modern manuscripts. A DS record includes extensive and granular descriptive metadata supported by high resolution digital images. Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts are best served by format-specific cataloging that is sensitive to their complexity as hand-made books and historical artifacts. They differ from modern manuscripts, such as letters or personal records, because although they are unique objects, they are usually not unique texts. They may be written, bound, and decorated by hand but most pre-modern manuscripts are books. The text of a fourteenth-century missal, for example, can be identified using an early twentieth-century printed {{version of the same}} text. Or several collections may own more than one manuscript of St. Augustine’s De Civitate Dei (The City of God). A DS search by title in fact retrieves fourteen copies of this work, all unique manuscripts dating from the 12th to the 15th centuries, owned by eight different libraries. The potential for relationships among manuscripts means that item-level, bibliographic cataloging rather than collection-based, archival cataloging best identifies and describes the content of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. But these works also have historical and artifactual significance, so catalog records for medieval and Renaissance manuscripts need to describe not only their contents but also the complete provenance (<b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership),</b> binding (which may be from a later period {{than the rest of the}} book), marks of ownership (such as coats-of-arms), physical condition, material support (usually parchment), foliation and construction of the book, layout of the text, attribution of script, date (often estimated), style and localization of decoration and painted illustration, and names, not just of authors, but craftsmen, scribes, artists and owners.|$|E

Chain for-profit nursing homes will have a cost advantage over independent for-profit homes only if there are firm-level (multiple-home) economies of scale. For the study population of Texas nursing homes in 1983, cost structures differed sufficiently across ownership types to warrant estimating separate cost functions by ownership type. The results indicate that, when other factors affecting cost are held constant, chain homes have lower average costs than independent homes at intermediate and high levels of output, but higher average costs at low and very high levels of output. The results highlight the importance of considering whether or not to pool data across ownership categories when estimating nursing home cost functions...|$|R
