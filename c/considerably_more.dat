5|$|A {{theodolite}} can be <b>considerably</b> <b>more</b> accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also <b>considerably</b> <b>more</b> {{difficult to}} use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E

These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was <b>considerably</b> <b>more</b> horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E

5|$|Conte di Cavour was {{the name}} ship of the three s built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1910s.
