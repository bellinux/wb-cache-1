40|$|Nomex {{honeycomb}} {{is used as}} the predominate {{core material}} in aerospace standard sandwich structure. To provide aerospace standard composite face sheets {{it is necessary to}} cure the sandwich structure in an autoclave at elevated pressure. The honeycomb material is capable of withstanding the forces experienced through its thickness, but the lateral forces applied by the elevated pressure cause a crushing effect on the cells of the material. To prevent this crushing a ‘core stabilisation’ technique is applied to the core, prior to the lay-up of the sandwich panel, which increases the rigidity of the material and protects the cells. The core stabilisation process is time consuming and therefore costly. The current work investigates the effect of <b>core</b> <b>crush</b> on the mechanical properties of sandwich beams, along with the success of eight core treatments to reduce <b>core</b> <b>crush.</b> Without stabilisation, the core crushed by almost 12 %, and had a large detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of the beam. However, by curing in a conventional oven at vacuum pressure crushing was prevented and similar mechanical properties to the fully stabilised core were achieved. Finally, the effect of <b>core</b> <b>crush</b> on actual sandwich components is investigated by loaded representative panels on a specialist rig capable of applying representative pressure loads and measuring the stress distribution using full-field thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Damage {{characteristics}} of composite-skinned honeycomb sandwich panels in bending are investigated with both hemispherical (HS) and flat-ended (FE) indenters. The {{thickness of the}} cross-ply skins varies from 8 to 16 plies, whereas {{the density of the}} 12. 7 -mm thick aluminum honeycomb core varies from 50 to 70 kg/m 3. Clamped panels with a 100 -mm testing area are loaded quasi-statically either in bending or on a rigid base. The effects of varying these parameters on damage mechanisms are examined through response curves as well as cross sections of selected specimens. Special emphasis is placed on their potential change induced by the variation of skin thickness and core density with a specific indenter. Damage mechanisms are identified as <b>core</b> <b>crush,</b> top-skin delamination, and fracture or shear-out. The threshold and ultimate loads as well as the initial slope increase significantly either on increase of skin thickness or change of the nose shape of indenter from a hemisphere to a flat-end. The increase in the post-initial-damage slope is small and can be attributed to membrane stretching of the damaged top skin. Increasing the core density affects substantially not only the threshold load, but also the initial slope associated with the FE indenter. Changing the nose shape of the indenter has an overriding effect on the nature of damage mechanisms. In particular, top-skin delaminations occur after <b>core</b> <b>crush.</b> The panel deflection contributes to 20 – 53 % sandwich deformation. The bottom skin in all the tests remains intact.

40|$|International audienceIn this chapter, an {{original}} method for modeling {{the behavior of}} sandwich structures during and after impact is proposed and validated. It {{is based on the}} demonstration that Nomex honeycomb behaves in a post-buckling mode very early and that compression forces are taken up by the corners or vertical edges of the honeycomb cells {{in the same way as}} they are in the stiffeners in aircraft structures. Thus it is possible to represent the honeycomb discretely by a grid of springs located at the six corners of hexagonal cells. This approach represents the phenomenon of indentation on honeycomb alone or on sandwiches very well. This approach provides an understanding of how the sandwich and the core behave under compression after impact. An original criterion based on a local <b>core</b> <b>crush</b> is tested and validated to compute the residual strength. To consider the bending response of sandwich structures, a multi-level approach is also proposed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{interaction}} of multiple damage mechanisms in composite sandwich beams subject to static and dynamic out-of-plane loading, due for instance to high velocity impact or water slamming. A sandwich beam continuously supported by a rigid plane is considered and the damage mechanisms for skin delamination and <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> are studied. Under quasi static loading conditions the core shields the stress field {{at the tip of}} delaminations in the skin from the applied load and induces local energy barriers to crack propagation. The constitutive and geometric parameters can be tailored to improve shielding and reduce damage growth in beams with elastic cores, for instance by increasing the stiffness of the core; however, <b>core</b> <b>crushing,</b> which reduces the shielding of the fracture parameters, can be favoured for properties that have been optimized in the elastic regime. The optimal design of the system must account for the interaction of the different mechanisms. Similar effects are observed under dynamic loading, where <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> increases the displacements in the skin and consequently the energy release rate during the loading phase. In the free oscillation phase that follows the application of a pulse load the skin-core interaction generates delamination openings that are not present under quasi-static loading and give rise to a mode I component of the energy release rate that can dominate crack propagation; energy dissipation due to <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> reduces this effect...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} flat-wise compression properties, strengthening mechanisms and failure modes of sandwich composite materials reinforced with orthogonal z-pins. The compression modulus of the sandwich composite increases rapidly with the volume content of z-pins due to their high longitudinal stiffness, however acoustic emission monitoring and X-ray computed tomography reveal that some z-pins are damaged during elastic loading. The compression stress to induce <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> is increased greatly by z-pinning (up to nearly 700 %), although {{a large percentage of}} the z-pins fail close to the elastic stress limit by longitudinal splitting and/or kinking.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reports on}} work toward {{developing}} a practical methodol-ogy for the predictive modeling {{of the performance}} of thermoplastic composite (TPC) sandwich structures under impact loading. Explicit finite element analysis methods, using LS-DYNA software, are described. Details of extensive materials characterization tests and material model parameter calibration for both the composite skin and polymer foam core are included. The simulations of deformation response, damage and failure of the sandwich structures is validated against experimental tests of the indentation and three-point bending of TPC sandwich beams. Good agreement between simulations and experiments has been achieved for indentation loading up to high degrees of <b>core</b> <b>crush.</b> The same is true for {{a significant part of the}} bending response including failure prediction. However, it has been necessary to introduce a principal strain fracture criterion to account for core shear and skin–core debonding failures at higher strains.

40|$|In {{this study}} a <b>core</b> <b>crush</b> {{criterion}} is proposed {{to determine the}} residual strength of impacted sandwich structures. The core of the sandwich is made of a Nomex Honeycomb core and the faces are laminated and remain thin. The mechanism of failure {{of this kind of}} structure under post-impact compressive loading is due to interaction between three mechanical behaviors: geometrical nonlinearity due to the skin’s neutral line off-set in the dent area, nonlinear response of the core and damages to the skins. For the type of sandwich analysed in this study, initially the core crushes at the apex of the damage. Using a finite element discrete modelling of the core previously proposed by the authors, the load corresponding to the crushing of the first cell can be computed and it gives the value of the residual strength for our criterion. Some geometric and material hypotheses are assumed in the damaged area mainly based on nondestructive inspection (NDI). The criterion is then applied to tests modelled by Lacy and Hwang [Lacy TE, Hwang Y. Numerical modelling of impact-damaged sandwich composites subjected to compression after impact loading. Compos Struct 2003; 61 : 115 – 128]. It is shown that the criterion allows a good prediction of the tests except in the case of very small dents. Several sensitivity studies on the assumptions were made and it is shown that using this approach, the criterion is robust...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact damage and post-impact {{compression}} properties of a foam core sandwich composite reinforced with through-thickness z-pins. Low-speed flat-wise compression tests {{performed on the}} sandwich composite revealed that z-pins improved the elastic modulus, crush strength and absorbed energy capacity (by 260 - 300 %). However, these property improvements do not necessarily translate into {{a reduction in the}} amount of damage suffered by the z-pinned sandwich composite under localised (point) impact loading. There was no reduction to the impact damage area or an improvement to the post-impact compression properties of the z-pinned sandwich composite at low-impact energies (when damage was confined to the impacted face skin). Z-pins were only marginally effective at reducing the impact damage when the impact energy was high enough to cause <b>core</b> <b>crushing.</b> Z-pins absorbed high-impact energy via splitting, microbuckling and fragmentation during <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> which reduced slightly the amount of impact damage to the sandwich composite.

40|$|Dynamic blast {{testing of}} armor {{components}} often requires explosives {{to generate the}} high pressure, wide area impulses. While explosives provide the most realistic loading conditions, they are difficult to replicate consistently and necessitate remote test facilities for safety. Non-explosive methodologies, such as gas guns and shock tubes, can produce high impulse dynamic events with higher repeatability and increased safety, but are often limited to smaller-sized targets. To impact wide area flexible armor panels with the blast characteristics of a close-in detonation, a non-explosive methodology was investigated using the U. C. San Diego Blast Simulator. The objective {{was to create a}} consistent, economical, and scalable methodology for comparing conventional steel and prototype sandwich panel performance with validation of damage modes and extent of damage using actual blast tests and finite element modeling. A tiled projectile array having spatially and temporally varying pressure pulses was developed to replicate the spherical loading profile of a close-in detonation. Using a high speed servo- hydraulic actuator, the projectile was launched at 23. 0 - 24. 6 m/s, equivalent to 7, 520 - 8, 460 Pa-s with less than 1. 9 % standard deviation over 43 tests. This was comparable to 1. 37 kg of C 4 at 305 mm standoff, which was also used to test five armor panels. Sandwich panel transmitted pressures, measured indirectly via transmission plate acceleration, showed up to 75 % reduction in maximum values compared to the steel armor panels, with up to 49 % weight savings. Deformation profiles of the non-explosive tested panels were similar in both shape and magnitude compared to the blast tested panels, but with more consistency and symmetry. Blast tested panels showed more extensive core crushing for the sandwich panels but no difference for steel. Finite element modeling predicted similar deformation profiles and transmission plate velocities and accelerations. The models showed higher <b>core</b> <b>crush</b> for the blast tested panels and stress concentrations that matched both sets of test results. The applied impulses for the non-explosive tests were also predicted to be higher than the blast tests.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} detrimental effect of elevated temperatures on local indentation failure of polymer foam cored sandwich structures with laminated glass fibre reinforced epoxy face sheets. A simple analytical model {{to predict the}} critical indentation failure load at elevated temperatures is presented and validated against experimental observations. For this purpose, a sandwich beam loaded in three-point bending with an induced through-thickness elevated temperature profile,was studied experimentally and by means of analytical and finite element models. In the experiment, the through-thickness temperature gradient was induced with an infrared lamp pointing on the top face sheet, while the local displacement and strain fields near the applied point load were recorded by digital image correlation. The analytical model proposed, which accounts for temperature degraded/reduced foam core properties superimposes the local response, approximated by the classical Winkler foundation model, and the global response, obtained by sandwich beam theory. The comparative study {{has shown that the}} critical load causing <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> failure reduces significantly with elevated temperatures by as much as 50 % at an elevated temperature of 90 °C. It is shown that the simple analytical model can predict the local deflections and core stresses of foam cored composite sandwich structures subjected to simultaneous localised mechanical loading and elevated temperatures. Thus, the analytical model {{can be used as a}} preliminary design tool to determine the critical <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> load at elevated temperatures...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The energy {{absorption}} of an aluminum foam sandwich structure and a conventional polymer foam sandwich structure is similar for impacts ranging from 5 to 25 J. The polymer foam-based samples exhibit localized {{damage in the}} form of skin fracture and <b>core</b> <b>crushing,</b> but with negligible permanent out-of-plane deformation. In contrast, the aluminum foam-based samples show little fracture but exhibit extensive out-of-plane deformation radiating from the impact point. This deformation suggests that the impact damage could be more easily detectable in the aluminum foam sandwich structure. Surface strains are lower in the aluminum foam sandwich samples during post-impact loading in a single cantilever beam test, suggesting improved damage tolerance...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of nano-structures, mostly intercalated form, on sandwich composites under impact loadings. To achieve such goal, a set of sandwich composites plates made of fiberglass/nano-modified epoxy face sheets and polystyrene foams was prepared. The polystyrene core was 25 mm thick and the face sheets were made of eight layers of woven fabric glass fibers and nano-modified epoxy (0. 8 mm of thickness). The epoxy system was made of bisphenol A resin and an amine hardener, i. e. RemLam M and HY 956, from Hunstman Inc. The fiber volume fraction used was around 65 %, while the nanoclay content varied from 0 wt % to 10 wt%. The nanoclay used in this research was organic modified montmorillonite produced by Southern Clay Inc. (Cloisite 30 B). Once the sandwich composites planes were prepared, they were submitted to low velocity impact tests using a drop weight tower. The energies applied ranged from 5 Joules to 75 Joules. Two sets of experiments were performed, i. e. high velocity + low mass and low velocity + high mass. Damage caused by the two groups of experiments and peak forces measured were dissimilar. The results show that the addition of 5 % on nanoclay with respect to the epoxy system weight leads to a more efficient energy absorption and a different failure modes. Two transition failure modes, from upper face sheet cracking + core indentation to upper face sheet tearing + <b>core</b> <b>crushing,</b> and upper face sheet tearing + <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> to lower face sheet and core debonding, appears to overshadow the nanoclay effect, as they seems to be infective in these two conditions.

Explosive charges of 0. 64 - 100 kg TNT equivalent were used during these studies. Procedures for monitoring the structural response of such materials during blast events have been devised. High-speed photography was employed during the air-blast loading of GFRP and CFRP sandwich panels, in conjunction with digital image correlation (DIC), to monitor the deformation of these structures under shock loading. Failure mechanisms have been revealed using DIC and confirmed in post-test sectioning. Strain gauges were used to monitor the structural response of similar sandwich materials and GFRP tubular laminates during underwater shocks. The effect of the supporting/backing medium (air or water) of the target facing the shock has been identified during these studies. Mechanisms of failure have been established such as <b>core</b> <b>crushing,</b> skin/core cracking, delamination and fibre breakage. Strain gauge data supported the mechanisms for such damage. A transition in behaviour was observed in the sandwich panels when subject to an underwater blast {{as opposed to an}} air-blast load. Damage mechanisms notably shifted from distributed core shear failure originating from regions of high shear in air blast to global <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> in underwater blast.

While the intact panels failed in region close to one loaded end, all the impact-damaged nomex panels failed around the mid-section region. Two thirds of the aluminium panels also failed in the mid-section region and one third failed in the loaded end region. The presence of the core played a unique role in in-plane compression with a substantial stabilizing support to the skins, which counteracted the deleterious effect of impact damage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous works [1] used {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} models to investigate the effects of barely visible impact damage (BVID) in sandwich structures.

The critical load is controlled by the depth and size of damage, both of which control the foundation support and the resistance to wrinkles forming. In this article a simplified, closed-form analytical model is developed to predict critical stresses through a complete range of damage sizes and depths. This model extends previous work [1] by finding an expression for the critical wrinkling wavelength in a closed-form solution. A further expression is developed to account for rotational support {{at the edge of the}} damage site, as the wrinkle approaches the critical wrinkling wavelength.

Two airfoils with fundamentally different damage scenarios were considered. The first damage scenario produced no visible signs of damage on the wing surface following eight impacts. A duplicate wing, subjected to a similar series of impacts, was investigated using flash thermography and subsequently autopsied. The flash thermography showed small, localized damage in the skin, but gave no information about core damage. The autopsy showed core/skin disbonding at both interfaces that varied with the number of impacts, <b>core</b> <b>crushing,</b> and a through the core shear crack. No clear changes to the static or dynamic wing response were observed for this scenario. The second damage scenario involved cracking of the wing skin. While damage quantification was not undertaken for this scenario, both static and dynamic changes in wing response were observed. An analytical model of the wing is presented which helps explain the observed behaviors of the two damage scenarios...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{critical}} buckling loads {{for various}} core densities and materials of honeycomb composite panels are experimentally and numerically investigated in this study. The surface plates of honeycomb composite panels are of polyester/glass fiber composite. Polyester resin-impregnated paper or aluminum {{is used as}} the honeycomb core material. Honeycomb panels with different cell sizes, but approximately the same volume, are produced {{and the effect of}} the honeycomb core density on the critical buckling load is investigated by compression tests. The critical buckling load of paper core panels is determined to be higher than that of aluminum core panels. It is seen that the buckling strength of the specimens increases by the increase of core density. As the critical buckling load exceeds a certain limit, regional core cell buckling and <b>core</b> <b>crushing</b> are seen in aluminum core panels. In paper core panels, regional cracks are seen, in addition to these failures. The study also calculates the numeric buckling loads of the panels using theANSYS finite element analysis program. The achieved experimental and numerical results are compared with each other and the results are provided in tables.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} low velocity impact damage on the post-impact residual strength and failure mechanisms of sandwich beams with Rohacell WF 51 foam core. The considered impact damage has a form of a sub-interface cavity surrounded by <b>crushed</b> <b>core</b> while the face sheet remains virtually undamaged. Part I of this study deals with experimental investigation of impact-damaged beams tested in transverse shear, bending and edgewise compression. It is shown that the <b>crushed</b> <b>core</b> and the bridging condition in the peripheral regions of the impact damage exert {{a significant effect on}} the post-impact critical loads and failure mechanisms. In this paper, parameterised finite element (FE) models of impact damage with implemented <b>crushed</b> <b>core</b> properties are developed for numerical analyses of post-impact failure. In the analysis of the shear case, a model for II bridging condition in the peripheral regions of impact damage is introduced. A point-stress criterion is applied for predictions of failure loads and crack kink angle. Geometrically non-linear FE analysis is employed for evaluation of critical loads for local buckling in the beams with impact damage. The FE analyses demonstrate good agreement with experimental results...|$|R
