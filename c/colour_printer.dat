5|$|Edmund Evans (23 February 1826 â€“ 21 August 1905) was a {{prominent}} English wood engraver and <b>colour</b> <b>printer</b> during the Victorian era. Evans specialized in full-colour printing, which, {{in part because of}} his work, became popular in the mid-19th century. He employed and collaborated with illustrators such as Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway and Richard Doyle to produce what are now considered to be classic children's books. Although little is known about his life, he wrote a short autobiography before his death in 1905 in which he described his life as a printer in Victorian London.|$|E
5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was complicated and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and used a hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour blocks for a single image. He {{went on to become the}} preeminent wood engraver and <b>colour</b> <b>printer</b> in Britain during the second half of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|When his {{apprenticeship}} {{ended in}} 1847, Evans, then 21, refused {{an offer of}} employment from Landells, deciding instead to go into business for himself as a wood-engraver and <b>colour</b> <b>printer.</b> In 1848 Evans engraved a title-page illustration, among other commissions, for the Illustrated London News. However, the Illustrated London News stopped employing him {{on the basis that}} his wood engraving was too fine for newspaper work. His final print for the Illustrated London News showed the four seasons, and was illustrated by Foster. In fact Foster received his first commission from the publisher Ingram, Cook, and Company to reproduce the four scenes in oil. In 1851, Ingram chose Evans to engrave three prints for Ida Pfeiffer's Travels in the Holy Land. He used three blocks for the work: the key-block, outlining the illustration, was printed in a dark-brown hue; the other two were in a buff colour and a grayish-blue colour. For the same firm, Evans completed an order for a book-cover using bright reds and blues on white paper. That year he received the first commission to print a book, written by Fanny Fern and illustrated by Foster. Evans had enough business to apprentice his two younger brothers, Wilfred and Herbert, and to buy a hand-press. Soon he moved his premises to Racquet Court, and bought three more hand-presses.|$|E

50|$|During {{his stay}} at Nafferton, Morris {{acquired}} {{a reputation for}} writing popular essays on natural history and in particular on birds. His first book was an arrangement of British birds and was published in 1834. About this time he formed a close working association with Benjamin Fawcett (1808-1893), a local printer. This relationship would last nearly 50 years and {{have a profound effect}} on British ornithology.

50|$|In 1877 Edmund Evans, who was {{a leading}} <b>colour</b> <b>printer</b> using {{coloured}} woodblocks, lost the services of Walter Crane as his children's book illustrator and asked Caldecott for illustrations for two Christmas books. The results were The House that Jack Built and The Diverting History of John Gilpin, published in 1878. They were an immediate success; {{so much so that}} Caldecott produced two more each year for Evans until he died. The stories and rhymes were all of Caldecott's choosing and in some cases were written or added to by himself. In another milieu Caldecott followed The Harz Mountains with illustrations for two books by Washington Irving, three for Juliana Ewing, another of Henry Blackburn's, one for Captain Frederick Marryat and for other authors. Among well known admirers of his work were Gauguin and Van Gogh.|$|E

5000|$|Orbis Pictus from 1658 by John Amos Comenius was the {{earliest}} illustrated book specifically for children. It {{is something of}} a children's encyclopedia and is illustrated by woodcuts. A Little Pretty Pocket-Book from 1744 by John Newbery was {{the earliest}} illustrated storybook marketed as pleasure reading in English. The German children's books Struwwelpeter (literally [...] "Shaggy-Peter") from 1845 by Heinrich Hoffmann, and Max and Moritz from 1865 by Wilhelm Busch, were among the earliest examples of modern picturebook design. Collections of Fairy tales from early nineteenth century, like those by the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen were sparsely illustrated, but beginning {{in the middle of the}} century, collections were published with images by illustrators like Gustave DorÃ©, Fedor Flinzer, George Cruikshank, Vilhelm Pedersen, Ivan Bilibin and John Bauer. Andrew Lang's twelve Fairy Books published between 1889 and 1910 were illustrated by among others Henry J. Ford and Lancelot Speed. Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, illustrated by John Tenniel in 1866 was one of the first highly successful entertainment books for children.Toy books were introduced in the latter half of the 19th century, small paper bound books with art dominating the text. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in color. The best of these were illustrated by the triumvirate of English illustrators Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, and Kate Greenaway whose association with <b>colour</b> <b>printer</b> and wood engraver Edmund Evans produced books of great quality. [...] In the late 19th and early 20th century a small number of American and British artists made their living illustrating children's books, like Rose O'Neill, Arthur Rackham, Cicely Mary Barker, Willy Pogany, Edmund Dulac, W. Heath Robinson, Howard Pyle, or Charles Robinson. Generally, these illustrated books had eight to twelve pages of illustrated pictures or plates accompanying a classic children's storybook.Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Peter Rabbit was published in 1902 to immediate success. Peter Rabbit was Potter's first of many The Tale of..., including The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin, The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, The Tale of Tom Kitten, and The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck, to name but a few which were published in the years leading up to 1910. Swedish author Elsa Beskow wrote and illustrated some 40 children's stories and picture books between 1897 - 1952.

30|$|While {{the more}} {{established}} processes of SLS and SLA received more attention, {{factors such as}} low cost and speed make ZCorporation 3 D Printing increasingly popular. Until recently it was mainly used for concept modelling rather than for manufacture of end-use products.

What sets 3 D colour printing apart from other RP colour technologies (Laminate Object Manufacturingâ„¢ (LOM) and SLS), is that the coloured ink is also the binder. 3 DPâ„¢ provides high-resolution (up to 600 Â Ã—Â  540 Â dpi) colour prints [67]. However the bonds between particles are {{not as strong as}} LOM or SLS manufactured parts where materials are heated to a molten state for bonding and strength of 3 DP parts are mainly dependant on infiltration method [66].|$|E
