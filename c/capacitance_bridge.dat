5000|$|Early {{commercial}} LCR bridges used {{a variety}} of techniques involving the matching or [...] "nulling" [...] of two signals derived from a single source. The first signal was generated by applying the test signal to the unknown and the second signal was generated by using a combination of known-value R and C standards. The signals were summed through a detector (normally a panel meter with or without some level of amplification). When zero current was noted by changing the value of the standards and looking for a [...] "null" [...] in the panel meter, it could be assumed that the current magnitude through the unknown was equal to that of the standard and that the phase was exactly the reverse (180 degrees apart). The combination of standards selected could be arranged to read out C and DF directly which was the precise value of the unknown.

The DRS will control the position of the spacecraft relative to a reference to an accuracy of one nanometer over time scales of several thousand seconds. To perform the control the spacecraft will use a new colloid thruster technology. The thrusters will operate over the range of 5 to 30 micro-Newtons with precision of 0. 1 micro-Newton. The thrust will be generated by using a high electric field to extract charged droplets of a conducting colloid fluid and accelerating them with a precisely adjustable voltage. The control position reference will be provided by the European LISA Technology Package, which will include two nearly free-floating test masses.

The dynamic control system will cover eighteen degrees of freedom, six for each of the test masses and six for the spacecraft.

The test mass acceleration must be minimized to maintain the acceleration of the enclosing drag-free spacecraft within the control authority of the micropropulsion system. Therefore, test mass acceleration must be predicted by accurate measurement of mass distribution, then offset by the placement of specially shaped balance masses near each test mass.

40|$|The small {{satellite}} 'Galileo Galilei' (GG) {{will test}} {{the universality of}} free fall and hence the weak equivalence principle which is the founding pillar of general relativity to 1 part in 10 (17). It will use proof masses whose atoms differ substantially from one another in their mass energy content, so as to maximize the chance of violation. GG will improve by four orders of magnitude the current best 'Eot-Wash' tests based on slowly rotating torsion balances, which {{have been able to}} reach their thermal noise level. In GG, the expected violation signal is a relative displacement between the proof masses of similar or equal to 0. 6 pm caused by a differential acceleration alpha(GG) similar or equal to 8 x 10 (- 17) ms(- 2) pointing to the center of mass of the Earth as the satellite orbits around it at nu(GG) similar or equal to 1. 7 x 10 (- 4) Hz. GG will fly an innovative acceleration sensor based on rapidly rotating macroscopic test masses weakly coupled in 2 D which up-converts the signal to nu(spin) similar or equal to 1 Hz, a value well above the frequency of natural oscillations of the masses relative to each other nu(d) = 1 /T-d similar or equal to 1 /(540 s). The sensor is unique in that it ensures high rotation frequency, low thermal noise and no attenuation of the signal strength (Pegna et al 2011 Phys. Rev. Lett. 107 200801). A readout based on a very low noise laser interferometry gauge developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (similar or equal to 1 pm Hz(- 1 / 2) at 1 Hz demonstrated) allows the short integration time to be fully exploited. A full scale sensor with the same degrees of freedom and the same dynamical features as the one to fly in GG has been setup on ground (GGG). The proof masses of GGG are affected by acceleration and tilt noise acting on the rotating shaft because of ball bearings and terrain microseismicity (both absent in space). Overall, by means of appropriate 2 D flexure joints, these noise sources have been reduced by a factor almost 10 (5) down to a differential acceleration between the proof masses of similar or equal to 7 x 10 (- 11) m s(- 2) (at 1. 7 x 10 (- 4) Hz up-converted by rotation to similar or equal to 0. 2 Hz). The corresponding noise in the relative displacements of the proof masses, read by co-rotating <b>capacitance</b> <b>bridges,</b> is similar or equal to 180 pm, which is 300 times larger than the target in space. GGG error budget shows that it can reach a differential acceleration sensitivity alpha(GGGgoal) similar or equal to 8 x 10 (- 16) m s(- 2), not limited by thermal noise. This value is only a factor 10 larger than what GG must reach in space to meet its target, and slightly smaller than the acceleration noise of the torsion balance. It can be achieved partly by means of weaker joints and an optimized mechanical design-so as to improve the attenuation factor-and partly by replacing the current ball bearings with much less noisy air bearings (also used in torsion balance tests) so as to reduce input noise.

Measurements on bridges one magnitude smaller later showed this difference to result from the bridge size. A very simple equivalent circuit was furthermore shown to characterize these small bridges. Analog computer calculations on this circuit will be compared to experimental results. At high temperatures a rounding of steps and supercurrent presumably due to noise is observed. A comparison with the theory of Ambegaokar and Halperin will be presented. At low temperatures a hysteresis develops. This may result from the <b>bridge</b> <b>capacitance</b> which also may give rise to subharmonic steps. However, the magnitude (1 pF) inferred from the hysteresis is too small to account for the subharmonic steps actually observed.

An upper limit to the sensitivity to 10 GHz radiation has been found in terms of NEP to 9 × 10 - 14 W/√Hz. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that mixing via the Josephson effect is possible.

It is suspected that this long range ordered antiferromagnetism {{plays an important}} role in high temperature superconductivity. MnCl 3 -phen is a one-dimensional chain that appeared to become a long range canted antiferromagnet below 22 K. However, experiments performed on MnCl 3 -phen to verify this were inconsistent with long range antiferromagnetic ordering. One hypothesis is that a structural transition causes this behavior at 22 K. The dielectric constant (ÿ) was monitored in order to view a structural transition in the MnCl 3 -phen. The sample was used as the dielectric of a capacitor, which was placed in a leg of a <b>capacitance</b> <b>bridge.</b> A lock-in amplifier made a null reading from the <b>capacitance</b> <b>bridge,</b> and any deviations from null resulting from a change in the dielectric constant were measured.

Particular attention is focused on the <b>capacitance</b> <b>bridge.</b> The sources of noise considered arise in the bridge circuit and the detector amplifier. Noise from the source oscillator, particularly {{in the case of a}} frequency sensitive bridge is also of consequence. A survey of preamplifier types suitable for use with a <b>capacitance</b> <b>bridge</b> is made to find the one contributing the least noise. These preamplifiers comprise untuned, tuned and parametric amplifiers. Theoretical consideration of a mechanically driven capacitor in a parametric up-converter amplifier indicates its usefulness as a low frequency amplifier. Investigations were made to determine the sources of noise in a vacuum tube preamplifier and relatively simple methods evolved for the determination of vacuum tube noise performance at low frequencies. The indicator displaying the bridge unbalance was considered in regard to its performance at small signal to noise ratios. A particular indicator is considered and the performance of the human operator in balancing a bridge using this unit is studied. For comparison an ideal detector comprising a phase sensitive detector followed by a resistance capacitance filter and perfect integrator is considered. A determination is made of the ultimate sensitivity of a bridge measuring system when using this type of indicator. The sources which contribute to the noise of the oscillator driving the bridge are discussed and a method for the reduction of the harmonic frequencies of the source at the output of a frequency sensitive bridge is described.

What is more interesting is that this differential capacitive sensor is only sensitive to one translational degree of freedom (DOF) movement, and immune to the vibration along the other two translational DOFs. In the experiment, we used a novel circuit based on an AC <b>capacitance</b> <b>bridge</b> to directly measure the differential capacitance value. The experimental result shows that this differential capacitive sensor has a sensitivity of 2 × 10 − 4 pF/μm with 0. 08 μm resolution. The measurement range of this differential capacitive sensor is 6 mm, and the linearity error are less than 0. 01 % over the whole absolute position measurement range...|$|E
