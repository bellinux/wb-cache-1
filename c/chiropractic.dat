5|$|Davenport {{public schools}} serve nearly 17,000 {{students}} in the communities of Davenport, Blue Grass, Buffalo, and Walcott. The Davenport Community School District is the second-largest school district in Iowa. Davenport has four public high schools: Central, West, Mid City and North and one private high school: Assumption. There are six public intermediate schools and 23 public elementary schools. Sudlow, one of the intermediate schools, was named after Phebe Sudlow, the first female public school superintendent in the United States. She was superintendent for Davenport schools from 1874 to 1878. The high schools {{are part of the}} Mississippi Athletic Conference for sports. The city has four colleges and universities: Palmer <b>Chiropractic</b> College, which is the first <b>chiropractic</b> school and the location of the first <b>chiropractic</b> adjustment in the world, Saint Ambrose University, Kaplan University, and Hamilton Technical College. Marycrest International University was a university in Davenport from 1939 to 2002, when it closed and became senior citizen housing.|$|E
5|$|Davenport was {{established}} in 1836 by Antoine LeClaire and named after his good friend Colonel George Davenport. The first settlers of Davenport were mostly Germans. After a county seat dilemma with neighboring town Rockingham in 1840, Davenport {{was established}} as the county seat of Scott County. Davenport was declared to be Iowa's first military headquarters just before the Civil War by Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood. In November 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home was opened in Davenport to take in children left orphaned by the Civil War. In 1895, the city hall was built, and in 1897, the first <b>chiropractic</b> school in the world, Palmer <b>Chiropractic</b> College was opened.|$|E
5|$|Taunton {{is within}} Somerset Primary Care Trust and {{is home to}} Musgrove Park Hospital, within Taunton and Somerset Foundation NHS Trust. This {{is one of two}} {{district}} hospitals within Somerset alongside Yeovil District Hospital. A Nuffield Hospital is also situated within the town, run privately by Nuffield Health. The town is also home to several doctor's surgeries as well as a family planning clinic, occupational health centre and <b>chiropractic</b> clinic.|$|E
5|$|Texas <b>Chiropractic</b> College in Pasadena, one of {{only two}} schools of chiropractics in Texas and one of a handful in the nation, {{provides}} training for students from around the state. Several community colleges serve communities in the area as well, including San Jacinto College, College of the Mainland, Lee College, and Houston Community College.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer {{suffers a}} back injury from the rodeo and sees a chiropractor, but does not follow his instructions. Later, Homer falls {{backwards}} onto a round garbage can at home and discovers that it solved his back problems. He makes a business out of his discovery, which proves {{to be a successful}} method of solving problems with pain, causing the <b>chiropractic</b> business decline until the chiropractors in town denounce the method and destroy the garbage can at the Simpsons' home.|$|E
5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, <b>chiropractic,</b> yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{management}} with non–medication based treatments is recommended. NSAIDs {{are recommended}} {{if these are}} not sufficiently effective. Normal activity should be continued {{as much as the}} pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful. A number of other options are available {{for those who do not}} improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis. No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies, but there is not enough evidence to recommend them confidently. The evidence for <b>chiropractic</b> care and spinal manipulation is mixed.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For <b>chiropractic</b> care or spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal manipulation based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|The {{local council}} {{operates}} a two-tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend {{one of the}} 26 primary schools in the borough before completing their education at secondary school. Bournemouth {{is one of the}} minority of local authorities in England still to maintain selective education, with two grammar schools (one for boys, one for girls) and ten secondary modern/comprehensive schools. There are also a small number of independent schools in the town, and a further education college. Bournemouth has two universities: Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth, both of which are located across the boundary in neighbouring Poole. They are also home to AECC University College (formally known as Anglo European College of <b>Chiropractic),</b> which is located on Parkwood Road in Bournemouth. In 2012, 60.7% of the borough's school leavers gained 5 GCSEs of grade C or above. This was slightly better than the national average of 59.4% and above the average for the rest of Dorset, with 58.8% of pupils from the local authority of Poole, and 54.1% from the remainder of the county, managing to do likewise.|$|E
25|$|Vertebral subluxation, a core {{concept of}} {{traditional}} <b>chiropractic,</b> remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and {{a debate about}} whether {{to keep it in}} the <b>chiropractic</b> paradigm has been ongoing for decades. In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based <b>chiropractic</b> (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, dogmatic beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight <b>chiropractic</b> still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based <b>chiropractic</b> suggests that a mechanistic view will allow <b>chiropractic</b> care to become integrated into the wider health care community. This is still a continuing source of debate within the <b>chiropractic</b> profession as well, with some schools of <b>chiropractic</b> still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based <b>chiropractic,</b> while others have moved towards an evidence-based <b>chiropractic</b> that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.|$|E
25|$|A related field, {{veterinary}} <b>chiropractic,</b> applies manual therapies {{to animals}} and is recognized in 40 US states, {{but is not}} recognized by the American <b>Chiropractic</b> Association as being <b>chiropractic.</b> It remains controversial within certain segments of the veterinary, and <b>chiropractic</b> profession.|$|E
25|$|Early {{opposition}} to water fluoridation included chiropractors, {{some of whom}} continue to oppose it as being incompatible with <b>chiropractic</b> philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several <b>chiropractic</b> organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health. In addition to traditional <b>chiropractic</b> {{opposition to}} water fluoridation and vaccination, chiropractors' attempts to establish a positive reputation for their public health role are also compromised by their reputation for recommending repetitive lifelong <b>chiropractic</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chiropractic</b> is an {{alternative}} medical practice whose main hypothesis is that mechanical disorders of the spine affect general health via the nervous system, and whose main treatment is spinal manipulation. A {{significant portion of the}} profession rejects vaccination, as traditional <b>chiropractic</b> philosophy equates vaccines to poison. Most <b>chiropractic</b> writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects, claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary, and in some cases suggesting that vaccination causes autism or that chiropractors should be the primary contact for treatment of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. <b>Chiropractic</b> treatment has not been shown to be effective for medical conditions other than back pain, and there is insufficient scientific evidence to make conclusions about <b>chiropractic</b> care for autism.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, {{most private}} health {{insurance}} funds cover <b>chiropractic</b> care, {{and the federal government}} funds <b>chiropractic</b> care when the patient is referred by a medical practitioner.|$|E
25|$|His {{influence}} {{over the next several}} years further divided the mixers, or those who mixed <b>chiropractic</b> with other cures, from the straights who practiced <b>chiropractic</b> by itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chiropractic</b> {{struggled}} with survival and identity during its formative years, including internal struggles between its leaders and colleges. <b>Chiropractic</b> {{is rooted in}} mystical concepts, leading to internal conflicts between straights and mixers which continue to this day. Objective Straight chiropractors, who are an offshoot of straights, only focus on the correction of <b>chiropractic</b> vertebral subluxations while traditional straights claim that <b>chiropractic</b> adjustments are a plausible treatment {{for a wide range}} of diseases. Reform chiropractors are an evidence-based offshoot of mixers who reject traditional Palmer philosophy and tend not to use alternative medicine methods. From 1984 to about 2008, some of them were organized as the National Association for <b>Chiropractic</b> Medicine, an organization which met strong opposition from the profession and finally ceased to exist.|$|E

25|$|Some chiropractors oppose {{vaccination}} {{and water}} fluoridation, which are common public health practices. Within the <b>chiropractic</b> community {{there are significant}} disagreements about vaccination, {{one of the most}} cost-effective public health interventions available. Most <b>chiropractic</b> writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects, claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary. Some chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but {{a significant portion of the}} profession rejects it, as original <b>chiropractic</b> philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that vaccines interfere with healing. The extent to which anti-vaccination views perpetuate the current <b>chiropractic</b> profession is uncertain. The American <b>Chiropractic</b> Association and the International Chiropractors Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease. The Canadian <b>Chiropractic</b> Association supports vaccination; a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% against, vaccinating themselves or their children.|$|E
25|$|Requirements vary between countries. In the U.S. chiropractors {{obtain a}} first {{professional}} {{degree in the}} field of <b>chiropractic.</b> <b>Chiropractic</b> education in the U.S. have been criticized for failing to meet generally accepted standards of evidence-based medicine. The curriculum content of North American <b>chiropractic</b> and medical colleges with regard to basic and clinical sciences has been more similar than not, both in the kinds of subjects offered and in the time assigned to each subject. Accredited <b>chiropractic</b> programs in the U.S. require that applicants have 90 semester hours of undergraduate education with a grade point average of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. Many programs require at least three years of undergraduate education, and more are requiring a bachelor's degree. Canada requires a minimum three years of undergraduate education for applicants, and at least 4200 instructional hours (or the equivalent) of full‐time <b>chiropractic</b> education for matriculation through an accredited <b>chiropractic</b> program. Graduates of the Canadian Memorial <b>Chiropractic</b> College (CMCC) are formally recognized to have at least 7–8 years of university level education. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines suggest three major full-time educational paths culminating in either a DC, DCM, BSc, or MSc degree. Besides the full-time paths, they also suggest a conversion program for people with other health care education and limited training programs for regions where no legislation governs <b>chiropractic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Research to test <b>chiropractic</b> {{theories}} {{began in}} 1935 with the B.J. Palmer Research Clinic at the Palmer College of <b>Chiropractic</b> in Davenport, Iowa. The clinic was organized into two divisions– a medical division and a <b>chiropractic</b> division. The medical division contained all the standard medical {{tests of the}} time and was used to establish a medical diagnosis of a patient's condition before the patient received treatment. The <b>chiropractic</b> division administered the treatment which included passive therapies, <b>chiropractic</b> adjustments and physical rehabilitation for the various conditions diagnosed. Research continued in the B.J. Palmer research clinic until B.J. Palmer's death in 1961 and the results and findings of these patient cases were the substance of B.J. Palmer's publishing over this 30 year time-period.|$|E
25|$|Chiropractors often {{argue that}} this {{education}} {{is as good as}} or better than medical physicians', but most <b>chiropractic</b> training is confined to classrooms with much time spent learning theory, adjustment, and marketing. The fourth year of <b>chiropractic</b> education persistently showed the highest stress levels. Every student, irrespective of year, experienced different ranges of stress when studying. The <b>chiropractic</b> leaders and colleges have had internal struggles. Rather than cooperation, there has been infighting between different factions. A number of actions were posturing due to the confidential nature of the <b>chiropractic</b> colleges in an attempt to enroll students.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., <b>chiropractic</b> {{schools are}} {{accredited}} through the Council on <b>Chiropractic</b> Education (CCE) while the General <b>Chiropractic</b> Council (GCC) is the statutory governmental body {{responsible for the}} regulation of <b>chiropractic</b> in the UK. The U.S. CCE requires a mixing curriculum, which means a straight-educated chiropractor may not be eligible for licensing in states requiring CCE accreditation. CCEs in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Europe have joined to form CCE-International (CCE-I) {{as a model of}} accreditation standards with the goal of having credentials portable internationally. Today, there are 18 accredited Doctor of <b>Chiropractic</b> programs in the U.S., 2 in Canada, 6 in Australasia, and 5 in Europe. All but one of the <b>chiropractic</b> colleges in the U.S. are privately funded, but in several other countries they are in government-sponsored universities and colleges. Of the two <b>chiropractic</b> colleges in Canada, one is publicly funded (UQTR) and one is privately funded (CMCC). In 2005, CMCC was granted the privilege of offering a professional health care degree under the Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, which sets the program within the hierarchy of education in Canada as comparable to that of other primary contact health care professions such as medicine, dentistry and optometry.|$|E

25|$|Utilization of <b>chiropractic</b> care is {{sensitive}} to the costs incurred by the co-payment by the patient. The use of <b>chiropractic</b> declined from 9.9% of U.S. adults in 1997 to 7.4% in 2002; this was the largest relative decrease among CAM professions, which overall had a stable use rate. As of 2007 7% of the U.S. population is being reached by <b>chiropractic.</b> Employment of U.S. chiropractors {{is expected to increase}} 14% between 2006 and 2016, faster than the average for all occupations.|$|E
25|$|There {{is no good}} {{evidence}} that <b>chiropractic</b> is effective {{for the treatment of}} any medical condition, except perhaps for certain kinds of back pain. Generally, the research carried out into the effectiveness of <b>chiropractic</b> has been of poor quality. Numerous controlled clinical studies of treatments used by chiropractors have been conducted, with conflicting results. Research published by chiropractors is distinctly biased. For reviews of SM for back pain <b>chiropractic</b> authors tend to have positive conclusions, while others did not show any effectiveness.|$|E

25|$|D.D. Palmer's {{student and}} son, B.J. Palmer, assumed {{control of the}} Palmer School in 1906, and {{promoted}} professionalism and formal training in <b>chiropractic,</b> expanding enrollment to a peak of above 1,000 students in the early 1920s. <b>Chiropractic</b> leaders of the time often invoked religious imagery, and B.J. seriously considered declaring <b>chiropractic</b> a religion, deciding against this partly to avoid confusion with Christian Science. B.J. also worked to overcome chiropractic's initial resistance {{to the use of}} medical technology, by accepting diagnostic technology such as spinal X-rays (which he called spinography) in 1910.|$|E
25|$|Mainstream {{health care}} and {{governmental}} {{organizations such as the}} World Health Organization consider <b>chiropractic</b> to be complementary and alternative medicine (CAM); and a 2008 study reported that 31% of surveyed chiropractors categorized <b>chiropractic</b> as CAM, 27% as integrated medicine, and 12% as mainstream medicine. Many chiropractors believe they are primary care providers, including US and UK chiropractors, but the length, breadth, and depth of <b>chiropractic</b> clinical training do not support the requirements to be considered primary care providers, so their role on primary care is limited and disputed.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the efforts of John Dwyer and the Friends of Science in Medicine, in August 2013, the {{chairman}} of the <b>Chiropractic</b> Board of Australia said it had removed some courses from its approved training schedule and would be randomly auditing practitioners to ensure they were not making unsubstantiated claims about the benefits of <b>chiropractic.</b>|$|E
