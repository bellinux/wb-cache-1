2500|$|Miller {{fired the}} gun until {{he ran out}} of ammunition, when he was ordered by Lieutenant Claude V. Ricketts, along with Lieutenant White and <b>Chief</b> <b>Signalman</b> A.A. Siewart, to help carry the captain up to the {{navigation}} bridge out of the thick oily smoke generated by the many fires on and around the ship. Bennion was only partially conscious at this point and died soon afterward. Japanese aircraft eventually dropped two armor-piercing bombs through the deck of the battleship and launched five [...] aircraft torpedoes into her port side. When the attack finally lessened, Miller helped move injured sailors through oil and water to the quarterdeck, thereby [...] "unquestionably saving the lives of {{a number of people who}} might otherwise have been lost." ...|$|E

She told me that all {{the men at the}} station, with one or two exceptions, were engaged in it, and showed me two of the missing bales of cloth--the cloth, you remember, sir, of which there was such a large quantity stolen four weeks ago, and for which the company has had to pay. I find that the <b>chief</b> <b>signalman,</b> Davis, is as bad as the rest. It was his wife that gave me the information in a moment of over-confidence." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since {{during the}} Second World War, the {{timetable}} could often not be met, a directory of “essential trains" [...] was published on 5 May 1941. This included {{at least six}} trains per day between Glan-Münchweiler and Altenglan and four trains per day between Homburg and Glan-Münchweiler each way. On 28 August 1944, the station was attacked by fighter-bombers. Between 28 September and 2 December 1944, there were further air raids. As a result, the signal box was destroyed and the <b>chief</b> <b>signalman</b> was killed. On 15 January 1945, there was another air raid on the station.|$|E

50|$|Between 1860 and 1865 {{the station}} was built on a large meadow in Kreuztal, which then had {{approximately}} 200 residents. The industrial Ferndorf valley, including the Müsen mining district, was of paramount importance. On 6 August 1861, when the last section of the Ruhr-Sieg line was opened, there was already restaurant facilities in the station building. The main station building was a three-storey building with gables facing Bahnhofstraße (“station street”). On the ground floor it had two waiting rooms with a bar area and two offices, one for the station master {{and the other for}} ticketing and baggage handling. Upstairs was accommodation for the station master and the <b>chief</b> <b>signalman.</b> With the opening of the Rothaar branch line to Hilchenbach in 1884 and its continuation to Erndtebrück and Marburg in 1888/89, an extension to the station complex was required. The station building was enlarged with an annex on the south side. This was followed by further renovations and additions.|$|E
