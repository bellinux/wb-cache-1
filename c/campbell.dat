5|$|<b>Campbell</b> was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to attend the game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at <b>Campbell</b> for attending, and he laid {{the blame for the}} riot on <b>Campbell.</b> A Montreal city councilor wanted <b>Campbell</b> arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling <b>Campbell</b> might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that <b>Campbell</b> may have felt that if he did not attend he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E

5|$|<b>Campbell</b> had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When <b>Campbell</b> started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder network topology using capacitors and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by <b>Campbell</b> were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by <b>Campbell</b> himself.|$|E
