Accordingly, assurance is an important complement to liability rules, restoration obligations, and other regulatory compliance requirements. The paper reviews the need for assurance, given the prevalence of abandoned environmental obligations, and assesses the implementation of assurance rules in the United States. From the standpoint of both legal effectiveness and economic efficiency, assurance rules can be improved.

The dataset covers 9276 deals announced and completed by 86 members of the Fortune 100 between 1990 and 2000. Our findings support explanations based on resources, transaction <b>costs,</b> <b>internalization,</b> organizational learning, social embeddedness, asymmetric information, and real options, and suggest that these theories are highly related and complementary.

40|$|External {{costs of}} {{transport}} represent {{the impact on}} society expressed in monetary units, {{as a result of}} transport activities, but not directly accounted for from activities managed by a road agency and/or by users of transport services. Road users require expensive infrastructure, and have various external costs, both in transport (congestion and accidents) and towards the rest of population (accidents, pollution, noise, environmental degradation). Analysis of the external costs of transport is usually, in the area of environmental economics, used to determine and analyze the benefits that are accomplished by investments in the protection and improvement of the environment in the transport area. Externalities are assessed so that they can be, to some extent, connected with assets invested in roads.

Agreement ends with attempts at operationalizing the elusive notion of sustainability. A contentious debate among "environmentalists" and "environmental economists" has brought about a confusing proliferation of indicators and policy advice on sustainable development.

It presents some results obtained from a detailed modeling of the Belgian multimodal freight transport network inserted within the overall trans-European network. It outlines the results of a simulation of the flows over the Belgian network in 1995 which allows to estimate some of the costs of several external effects of freight transports: the costs of pollution, congestion, accidents, noise and road damages.

When rms are bankrupted by an environmental accident, current laws often allow for the extension of liability to third parties with whom these rms contract, {{in the hope that}} this will lead to full internalization of social costs. In our model, rms can take both observable and unobservable care to reduce expected accident damages. We nd that extended liability indeed results in full <b>cost</b> <b>internalization,</b> but paradoxically does not result in rst-best levels of care. While the rm would like to commit to the rst-best level of unobservable care, it cannot, and it overcompensates by taking excess observable care. We also nd that, whereas without extended liability there is excess entry into the industry, introducing extended liability leads to excess exit. Furthermore, we show that direct regulation of observable care, when combined with extended liability, perversely further distorts rms ' incentives. However, when used alone, such regulation strictly dominates extended liability...|$|E

Carbon trade and conservation in the Global South have taken on various forms, and climate change mitigation efforts in light of continued rainforest deforestation are scrambling to establish effective approaches.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{discussed}} and most sophisticated versions of modern rule-consequentialism is Brad Hooker's concept. He blends not only consequentialist but also some intuitionist aspects into a seemingly coherent moral theory. Among many others, {{one of the main}} arguments he uses for a variety of purposes is the concept of <b>internalization</b> <b>costs</b> - psychological expenses connected with the acceptance of some code in moral agents (demands on memory, intelligence, inter-personal bonds, etc.). However, at the same time Hooker also insists on just one common moral domain for every moral agent. Therefore an overwhelming majority of everyone, everywhere and in each future generation should follow the same moral code. The main aim of this thesis is to show that this single-domain structure is highly implausible (if not impossible), when agents involved have relevant differences in <b>internalization</b> <b>costs</b> for some code. Firstly some main aspects of Hooker's theory will be sketched, and then two main series of objections against the single moral domain will be raised: hard-lock problems (technological or genetic differences in <b>internalization</b> <b>costs)</b> and soft-lock problems (external, learned or institutionalized differences). If Hooker wants to avoid these objections, many contingent and questionable amendments have to be invoked, which radically reduce the appeal of his initial concept. As a conclusion it is suggested that one does not really need the single-domain structure in almost any cases, and most of the objections to rule-consequentialism might be avoided without invoking such concept. It is then proposed that Hooker's theory might fared significantly better if multiple moral domains would be allowed. More so, the boundaries and size of these domains could be based on the rule-consequentialist grounds themselves, {{in order to avoid the}} feared relativization of moral code to individuals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{the concept of the}} Ecological Footprint can be {{developed}} by incorporating the six procedures listed below, to create a single indicator of just distribution of the limited natural resources, between and within generations, and become a benchmark for decision-making between alternatives of consumption, life-styles and economic policies. Using this new tool, {{it should be possible to}} label every commodity, service and natural resource with the share it claims of the Earth’s surface. This, in turn, can enable the integration of natural limits into the economy through the complete internalization of costs within market prices, while also reducing resource throughput fairly and quickly without an undue loss in GNP. The six procedures are as follows: First, operating within the boundaries of the sustainable local yields of the biologically productive soil and water areas, without any input of non-renewable resources, particularly fossil fuels; Second, taking spatial variations of this yield into account; Third, considering only sustainable CO 2 -sinks; Fourth, including every exploitation of nature, for instance all material flows; Fifth, taking care of intertemporal effects and depletion; and sixth, preserving the natural habitats necessary for the survival of biodiversity, bearing the species/area relationship in mind. ecological footprint; sustainability; local sustainable yields; Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP); depletion; <b>cost</b> <b>internalization...</b>|$|E

The present paper attempts toprovide some clarity by analysing the welfareand sectoral impact resulting from theintroduction of truck road pricing with respectto foreign trade. It is shown that this impactcan be separated into four effects: the pureterms of trade effect, the tax revenue effect,the transit tax revenue effect and the resourcegain effect (resources set free by a reductionin transport activity). A CGE simulation ofeach of these effects identifies theirquantitative implications. Out of the foureffects the pure terms of trade effect turnsout to dominate at both the sectoral andaggregate level. It triggers a trade-inducedwelfare loss. The tax revenue effect, and lessso the transit revenue effect, mitigate thisloss. For a full road transport costinternalization a trade-induced welfare loss isquantified for Austria at 1. 3 %.

40|$|This Article {{provides}} a financial economic theory of punitive damages. The core problem, as the Supreme Court acknowledged in Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, {{is not the}} systemic amount of punitive damages in the tort system; rather it is the risk of outlier outcomes. Low frequency, high severity awards are unpredictable, cause financial distress, and beget social cost. By focusing only on offsetting escaped liability, the standard law and economics theory fails {{to account for the}} core problem of variance. This Article {{provides a}} risk arbitrage analysis of the relationship between variance, litigation valuation, and optimal deterrence. Starting with settlement dynamics, it shows that punitive damages create problematic risk arbitrage opportunities, which systemically produce under- and overvaluation of cases. These effects yield inefficient pricing in the litigation system. Properly conceptualized and applied, punitive damages can mitigate risk arbitrage that skews actual results from the prescriptions of optimal liability and deterrence. The modern Supreme Court jurisprudence is flawed because it is overbroad. Single-digit multiplier caps underdeter defendants in most cases of ordinary liability because punitive damages do not sufficiently offset a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s risk arbitrage opportunity gained from a lower litigation risk exposure. When liability is catastrophic, however punitive damages overdeter defendants, even with a single-digit ratio limit, because they impart the severe economic cost of financial distress in addition to the monetary cost of the judgment. These additional economic costs must be credited toward the calculus of <b>cost</b> <b>internalization</b> and optimal deterrence.

40|$|The Swedish Parliament {{has decided}} that, {{in order to}} {{mitigate}} externalities in railway infrastructure, operators in the Swedish railway infrastructure shall pay charges based on short-run marginal social <b>costs.</b> <b>Internalization</b> of the social cost from noise is of particular interest, {{since it is the}} only environmental problem which people perceive as more troublesome today than they did in the early 1990 s. Inclusion of a noise component in rail infrastructure charges raises two problems: (i) the monetary evaluation of noise abatement, since noise is a non-marketed good, and (ii) the estimation of the effect on the noise level that one extra train will create. We are interested in the marginal noise, since infrastructure charges based on the short-run marginal cost principle should be based on the effect from the marginal train, not the noise level itself. We show in this study that, based on already obtained knowledge, it is possible to implement a noise component in the rail infrastructure charges. Those values that already today are used to estimate the social cost from noise exposure (which in Sweden are based on noise from road-traffic) in cost benefit analysis {{can also be used to}} calculate the marginal cost. We recommend, however, that further research is carried out in order to get more robust estimates and to get estimates based on railway traffic. We also show that the existing noise estimation models can easily be modified to estimate the marginal noise. Noise infrastructure charges give the operators incentives to reduce their noise emissions. We believe that this kind of charges can be used to reduce overall emission levels to an optimal social level, but that it is important that these charges are based on monetary estimates for rail-traffic and not road-traffic...|$|R

40|$|During the “Reform and Opening-up” years, tort {{disputes}} {{have become}} one of the main types of cases litigated in Chinese courts, and tort law has been playing a significant role in carving out the incentives of businesses and individuals in China. Since the formal legal rules on torts came into being in 1986, a large number of changes have occurred in the law of torts. The transformation of the rules, however, has eluded previous introductory works on Chinese tort law written in English. This paper is devoted to delineating these changes, which present the growth of a liability system moving predominantly in favor of tort victims. Unlike most existing English literature on Chinese tort law that survey primarily the major civil statutes, this paper places commensurate emphasis on the rules dealing with tort liabilities embedded in the administrative laws and regulations as well as the judicial interpretations. In addition, this paper also makes a rough assessment of the efficiency implications of the evolution of tort law in China. Given the exceptionally low point where the increment of victim protection in tort law started, the change of rules in China is, by and large, moving in the direction of <b>cost</b> <b>internalization</b> as required by efficiency. However, the potential improvement in efficiency is perhaps a byproduct of the development of tort law in China. The motivation behind the rule change {{is more likely to be}} loss redistribution rather than efficiency upgrade. In light of the policy-implementing orientation of the Chinese legal system and the collectivistic propensity rooted in the law of torts, political and institutional perspectives might bring us better insights into the driving force of change of law in China...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{choices are}} multi-dimensional and thus one needs a multidimensional {{methodology}} to identify best available techniques. Moreover, {{in the presence}} of environmental externalities generated by productive activities, ?best? available techniques should be best from Society's point of view, {{not only in terms of}} private interests. In this paper we develop a comprehensive modeling tool, based on methodologies appropriate to serve these two purposes, namely linear programming and internalization of external costs. We conclude that in this context there is in general not a single best available technique (BAT), but well a best combination of available techniques to be used (BCAT). We take a fictitious but plausible numerical example in the lime industry. For a hypothetical plant that has to meet a given demand, we build an original technical economic model within which two scenarios are considered: minimizing the private costs and minimizing the generalized costs (private costs plus external costs). In the first case, only the cheapest fuel is used in all kilns. But in the second case, where the environmental external costs are included, fuel switches occur and cleaner techniques are used. Extending the analysis to the choice of kilns, we find that the socially best combination of available techniques (S-BCAT) is not a fixed one : it varies as a function of the external costs. We therefore trace in a single diagram the whole profile of these best techniques as successive solutions of our linear programs. We conclude by stressing that external <b>cost</b> <b>internalization</b> does influence not only the choice of techniques, but also their appropriate use. Moreover, local environmental conditions play a major role in that choice and in determining that use...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{illustrate}} a new holistic modeling environment through a case study implementing a district heating system to supply four groups of users identified {{in the city of}} Tokyo. The holistic modeling environment, called DOME (Distributed Object-based Modeling Environment) is being applied by researchers in the Alliance for Global Sustainability (AGS) to develop a platform for assessing technologies and policies with the intent to reduce significantly CO 2 emissions in large cities. DOME is used as an information based collaboration platform for supporting the decentralized integration of models built independently under various application tools and operating systems. It provides system engineers with the ability to access experts’ models over the Internet through user-friendly interfaces. The interfaces provide clearly identified input and output variables to support a facilitated integration. The DOME environment also provides tools for analyzing the resultant integrated systems. In this district heating simulation, a GIS (geographic information system) based land-use database manager, implemented as an object in DOME, is used to obtain the total ground area, the total building floor area, and the number and type of buildings in a specified region of Tokyo. Using the land use database manager, four groups of users are established. The heat demands of the users are derived using specific heat consumption data for the types of buildings considered. Users are either connected to the district heating system through direct heat exchangers on the supply or return line, or through local heat pumps which adapt the temperature to the needs locally, allowing a lower network temperature. Two different options are considered for the district heat supply: 1) a heat pump based superstructure comprising a gas turbine and a gas engine as cogeneration units, as well as an auxiliary boiler for peak load, and 2) a gas turbine / steam turbine combined cycle based superstructure with various option like steam injection and/or CO 2 separation unit. Physical and costing models for the two alternative production unit superstructures and for the district heating system are connected with the GIS database using DOME.

The biomass resources are abundant in China, biomass energy development and utilization of China's current energy supply, especially in rural areas occupied an important position, research and development and efficient technology of biomass use, suitable for China's national conditions at this stage to reduce fossil fuel pollution, create huge economic and environmental benefits. in recent years, The straw-fired combustion power generation system is an efficient use of biomass energy technology. Denmark, Holland etc. all own mature stalk-based power generation technology, and all have already had the successful case example. The method of Life cycle assessment is adopted in the study. On the base of the level in 2001 of industrial and agricultural production in China, the statistics of the life cycle environmental emission of more than ten industrial and agricultural products are collected. The life cycle system boundary of 25 MW straw-fired power generation is established and discussed. Life cycle inventory and assessment include four phases: biomass collection, biomass transportation, equipment manufacture and biomass plant operation. After inventory, the environmental impact types are classified into Nonrenewable Resource Depletion, Renewable Resource Depletion, Global Warming, Ozone Depletion, Acidification, Photochemical Ozone Creation, Nutrification, Human Toxicity, Aquatic Ecotoxicity, Solid Waste and Dust. Then the potential of environmental impact are normalized and weighted, so the life cycle assessment result of biomass gasification power generation can be drawn. On the base of life cycle inventory of biomass gasification power generation, the environmental <b>cost</b> <b>internalization</b> consists of gas emission (including dust, SO 2, CO, NOx, CH 4, CO 2 and so on).

Through the life cycle environmental assessment of biomass, we can draw the conclusion that biomass direct combustion power generation system is friend-environmental power system, the influence of biomass transportation phase on the whole assessment system is small, but the plantation of energy crop should be brought to our attention. The efficiency is higher than the traditional family and slightly higher than biomass gasification power generation systems, But lower than the conventional thermal power efficiency. Improving technology to raise the utilization efficiency is the solution to the energy crisis. 生物质能源是仅次于煤炭、石油、天然气的第四大能源，占世界能源总消费量 14 ％，发展中国家生物质能源消费更是高达 38 %。随着人们对能源日益增长的需求和煤炭、石油等化石能源的迅速消耗，生物质能必将成为未来新能源与开展可再生能源战略的重要组成部分。中国生物质能源资源十分丰富，生物质能开发利用在我国现有能源供应中特别是在农村地区占有重要地位，研究开发高效利用生物质能的技术，适合现阶段我国国情，减少矿物燃料的污染，产生巨大的经济效益和环境效益。秸秆直燃发电系统是近年来我国能推广的一种高效利用生物质能源技术，丹麦、荷兰等国家都拥有比较成熟的秸秆发电技术，并且都已经有了成功案例。 本论文采用全生命周期评价方法（Life Cycle Assessment, LCA），在我国 2001 年工农业生产水平基础上，统计出我国十余种工、农业产品的生命周期环境排放。 对 25 MW生物质秸秆直燃发电系统进行了生命周期系统边界的划分和讨论，对生物质获取阶段、生物质运输阶段、设备制造阶段以及生物质电厂运行阶段这四个生命周期阶段进行了清单分析；全球变暖（Global Warming）、臭氧层损耗（Ozone Depletion）、酸化（Acidification）、光化学臭氧形成（Photochemical Ozone Creation）、水体富营养化（Nutrification）、人体毒性（Human Toxicity）、水生生态毒性（Aquatic Ecotoxicity）、固体废弃物（Solid Waste）、烟尘及灰尘（Dust）等八个环境影响类型进行分类，进行了环境影响分析；对各种环境影响类型进行正规化和加权，得出了生物质直燃发电系统生命周期环境评价。在生物质直燃发电系统生命周期清单分析基础上，将其中大气排放物，包括烟尘、SO 2 、 CO、NOX等几种排放物与生物质气化发电和常规电厂比较。同时对生物质秸秆直燃发电系统的能耗进行分析，从生命周期的角度，对其进行能源效率的评价，对综合利用生物质能进行了讨论。 根据数据将煤电、生物质秸秆直燃发电和生物质谷壳气化发电系统进行排放、能耗等方面的对比，找出几者之间的优劣。 通过本论文的分析，可以看出生物质直燃发电系统是一种环境友好型的发电系统，生物质运输阶段对整体环境影响意义不大，能源利用效率高于传统的家庭燃烧并略高于生物质气化发电系统，但与常规火电效率相比较低，改善技术，提高利用效率是进一步解决化石能源危机的方法之一...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{urbanization}} process {{all around the}} globe {{is likely to increase}} transport-related negative externalities e. g., congestion, air pollution, climate change etc. The situation is severe in rapidly expanding cities where the demand for motorized transport is increasing. This has increased the pressure on the policy makers to devise policies to tackle the problem. Derived from the {{urbanization process}}, this thesis considers following objectives. 1. Investigation of the policy measures in a simulation framework a) to abate the transport negative externalities while considering the inter-relationship between different externalities and b) to achieve the politically motivated goals. 2. Development of a computationally efficient model to simulated heterogeneous traffic conditions. With the first objectives, the idea is to investigate the policy measures in the context of industrialized nations; this is addressed {{in the first part of}} the thesis. In a simulation environment, marginal social cost pricing allows to correct for the inefficiencies due to exclusion of external costs from behavioral decision making process and to derive real-world policy recommendations. The first part investigates and compares the effect of congestion pricing on emissions levels and the effect of emission pricing on congestion levels while considering heterogeneity in the individual attributes and choice behavior. Derived from the inter-relationship between the two externalities, a joint internalization of vehicular congestion and emissions is proposed. It is applied to a real-world scenario of the Munich metropolitan area in Germany. It is found that the joint internalization moves the car transport system towards the optimum, measured by a strong decrease of congestion and emission costs. In this context, it has been shown for analytical models considering more than one externality, that the correlation between the externalities needs to be taken into account. Typically, in order to avoid overpricing, this is performed by introducing correction factors which capture the correlation effect. However, the correlation structure between, say, emission and congestion externalities changes for every congested facility over time of day. Additionally, the possible efficiency gains highly depend on the implicit price elasticity of demand, which again, depends on the availability of substitutes to car travel. For the Munich case study, it is shown that the iterative calculation of prices based on cost estimates from the literature allows to identify the amplitude of the correlation between the two externalities under consideration. Further, at the disaggregated level, the results show that pricing emissions moves individuals to shorter distance routes, whereas pricing congestion pushes towards longer distance routes. That is, despite the correlation between the two externalities, isolated pricing strategies influence route choice behavior by tendency into opposite directions. In real-world politics, policy setting often follows so-called ‘backcasting’ approaches where predefined goals are set, and policy measures are implemented to reach those goals. The first part also presents an parametric approach to identify the gap between toll levels derived from environmental damage <b>cost</b> <b>internalization</b> and toll levels to achieve the political goal of 20 % reduction in GHG emissions of transport sector until 2020 with respect to 1990 levels. For this purpose, the damage costs internalization is applied to the scenario of Munich metropolitan area again and shown that the desired reduction in CO 2 emissions is not reached. Further application of the parametric internalization approach with damage cost estimates from the literature yields toll levels that are by a factor of 5 too low in order to reach the predefined goal. When aiming at emission costs reductions of 20 %, the damage cost estimates are even by a factor of 10 too low. It is shown that the major contribution to the overall emission reduction stems from behavioral changes of (reverse) commuters rather than from urban travelers; under some circumstances, the latter even increase their CO 2 emission levels. An economic assessment indicates that a toll equivalent to 5 times of the toll from the damage <b>cost</b> <b>internalization</b> approach increases the system welfare 6 times. The second part treats the second objective mainly in the context of the industrializing nations where mixed traffic conditions prevail. In such conditions, it becomes necessary to develop a heterogeneous traffic flow model to include all vehicle classes while keeping the model equally computationally efficient. In this direction, the second part proposes a fast Spatial Queue Model (SQM) to produce realistic flow dynamics by introducing backward traveling holes for mixed traffic conditions. In the proposed approach, the space freed by a leaving vehicle on the downstream end of the link is not available immediately to the following vehicle, rather depends on the speed of backward traveling holes. This results in triangular Fundamental Diagrams (FDs) for traffic flow such that the slope of the left branch is approximately equal to the minimum of the vehicle speed and link speed whereas the slope of the right branch is approximately equal to the speed of the backward traveling holes. With the help of FDs from the simulation of several vehicle classes, it is demonstrated that as the maximum speed of the vehicle class decreases, the density at which the maximum flow is achieved, increases and the maximum flow decreases. In a similar direction, the second part also introduces the seepage link dynamics to the SQM. The seepage is predominately common on the urban streets of most of the industrializing nations. In this model, due to higher maneuverability and smaller size, smaller vehicles (e. g., bicycle, motorbike) move continuously across the gaps between the stationary or almost stationary vehicles and come in front of the queue to leave prior to other queued vehicles. The FDs from simulation of equal modal split of car and bicycle show that the flow characteristics of bicycle is marginally affected by the presence of cars but on the contrary, the flow characteristics of the car is significantly affected by the presence of bicycles. Further, it has been shown that in a traffic stream, seepage is more effective for faster seep mode (e. g., motorbike) than slower seep mode (e. g., bicycle). Finally, in the second part, a comparison of the computational performances from the simulations using various traffic and link dynamics of the queue model is presented. An additional data structure to maintain the backward traveling holes, increases the average simulation time marginally for all three sample sizes (1 %, 10 %, 100 %). However, the look up for seep mode on every link of the network is appeared to be resource intensive with respect to the other link dynamics of the queue model. The rate of increase in the average simulation time using the seepage link dynamics for different sample sizes is significantly higher than the rate of increase in the average simulation time of other link dynamics of the queue model. The third part integrates the two objectives and presents a real-world scenario of Patna, India with a goal of reduction in emissions externality towards sustainable transport. This part exhibits the steps for demand generation and calibration of the scenario. The urban demand is generated using the trip diaries whereas the external demand is generated using hourly trip counts. For the latter, Cadyts is extended to mixed traffic conditions. To include the diverse income effects in the behavioral decision making process of the individual, the individual income is included in the scoring function. The scenario is calibrated to evaluate the Alternative (mode) specific constants (ASCs) for different modes. The calibrated scenario is used for policy testing. Based on the traffic characteristics and composition, a bicycle superhighway is proposed along the existing railway line. An iterative process is proposed to identify the optimum locations of the connectors between bicycle superhighway and existing network. A whatif policy measure is considered in which motorbike is also allowed on the bicycle superhighway. Both policy measures increase the share of the bicycle significantly. To estimate the emissions for the two policy measures, the Emission Modeling Tool (EMT) is extended to mixed traffic conditions. It is shown that if only bicycle is allowed on the bicycle superhighway, significant reduction in emissions are observed in the inner city. However, as soon as the motorbike is also allowed on it, significant increase in the emissions are observed along the bicycle superhighway in the inner city of Patna which emphasizes the need of enforcements to stop motorbikes on the bicycle superhighway. With this, the third part demonstrates that significant reduction in emissions can be obtained in the situations where a pricing measure is difficult to implement. To summarize, this thesis focuses on the evaluation of policy measures in a simulation framework to extract the valuable information for the policy makers to tackle the problem of negative transport externality in the industrialized nations as well as industrializing nations. For the latter, this thesis also extends a computationally efficient traffic flow model to simulate the heterogeneous traffic conditions. Finally, with several case studies, the thesis shows the scope of devising policy recommendations based on the scenario specifications. Es ist anzunehmen, dass die aktuell stattfindende globale Urbanisierung negative externe Effekte des Verkehrssektors wie z. B. Stau, Luftverschmutzung sowie den Klimawandel verstärkt. Die Situation ist besonders schwerwiegend in aktuell stark wachsenden Städten, in denen auch die Verkehrsnachfrage steigt. Somit steigt der Druck auf politische Entscheidungsträger Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um den genannten Problemen entgegenzuwirken. Ausgehend von diesem Spannungsfeld, verfolgt die vorliegende Dissertation folgende Ziele: 1. 	Die Untersuchung von Maßnahmen in einem Simulationsmodell a) zur Verringerung der negativen externen Effekte unter Berücksichtigung der gegenseitigen Abhängigkeiten der verschiedenen externen Effekte sowie b) zum Erreichen politisch motivierter Ziele. 2. 	Entwicklung eines laufzeiteffizienten Modells zur Simulation heterogener Verkehrsbedingungen. In Bezug auf das erste Ziel, werden zunächst Maßnahmen im Kontext industrialisierter Länder untersucht; dies stellt den ersten Teil der Dissertation dar. Hierfür wird ein Simulationsmodell verwendet, in welchem eine Bepreisung auf Basis marginaler sozialer Kosten eine Korrektur der Ineffizienzen, die aufgrund der Nichtberücksichtigung von externen Kosten in Entscheidungsprozessen entstehen, ermöglicht und somit die Ableitung von Maßnahmenempfehlungen erlaubt. In diesem ersten Teil der Dissertation wird die Auswirkung von Staubepreisung auf Emissionen sowie die Auswirkung von Emissionsbepreisung auf Stau untersucht und verglichen, wobei die Heterogenität in den Attributen der Individuen sowie in deren Entscheidungsverhalten in Betracht gezogen wird. Auf Basis der beiderseitigen Abhängigkeit zwischen den genannten externen Effekten, wird eine gleichzeitige Internalisierung von Stau- und Emissionseffekten vorgeschlagen. Diese Maßnahme wird in einem realistischen Simulationsszenario für die Metropolregion München angewendet. Es kann gezeigt werden, dass die vorgeschlagene gleichzeitige Internalisierung das Verkehrssystem des motorisierten Individualverkehrs in Richtung des Systemoptimums bewegt, was durch einen starken Rückgang in Stau- und Emissionskosten charakterisiert ist. In diesem Zusammenhang wurde für analytische Modelle, die mehr als einen externen Effekt betrachten, gezeigt, dass die Korrelation zwischen den externen Effekten berücksichtigt werden muss. Um eine Überbepreisung zu vermeiden, werden typischerweise Korrekturfaktoren verwendet, die den Korrelationseffekt aufgreifen. Die Korrelationsstruktur zwischen Emissions- und Stauexternalitäten ändert sich jedoch für jede bestaute Infrastruktur im Laufe des Tages. Weiterhin hängen mögliche Effizienzgewinne stark von der impliziten Preiselastizität der Nachfrage ab, welche wiederum von der Verfügbarkeit von Alternativen zur Fortbewegung mit dem Auto abhängt. Für das München-Szenario wird gezeigt, dass die iterative Berechnung von Preisen auf Basis von Kostenschätzungen aus der Literatur eine Bestimmung des Ausmaßes der Korrelation der beiden berücksichtigten externen Effekte erlaubt. In einer disaggregierten Betrachtung zeigen die Ergebnisse weiterhin, dass eine Emissionsbepreisung die Verkehrsteilnehmer dazu veranlasst kürzere Routen zu wählen, während eine Staubepreisung zur Wahl längerer Routen bewegt. Dies bedeutet, dass trotz der Korrelation beider externer Effekte, isolierte Bepreisungsstrategien das Routenwahlverhalten tendenziell in gegensätzliche Richtungen beeinflussen. In realer Politik basiert die Festlegung von Maßnahmen häufig auf sogenannten Backcasting-Ansätzen, bei denen im Voraus Ziele definiert und Maßnahmen in Kraft gesetzt werden, um diese Ziele zu erreichen. Im ersten Teil der Dissertation wir ferner ein parametrischer Ansatz vorgestellt, mit dem der Unterschied zwischen der nötigen Mauthöhe zur Internalisierung der Umweltschadenskosten und der nötigen Mauthöhe zum Erreichen des politischen Ziels einer 20 -prozentigen Reduktion von Treibhausgasemissionen (GHG) des Verkehrssektors bis 2020 gegenüber dem Niveau von 1990 ermittelt werden kann. Zu diesem Zwecke wir die Internalisierung der Schadenskosten abermals auf das Szenario für die Metropolregion München angewendet. Es wird gezeigt, dass die gewünschte Reduktion der CO 2 -Emissionen nicht erreicht wird. Eine weitere Anwendung des parametrischen Internalisierungsansatzes mit Schadenskostenschätzungen aus der Literatur führt zu Mauthöhen, die um einen Faktor 5 zu niedrig sind, um das gesetzte Ziel zu erreichen. Um Reduktionen der Emissionskosten von 20 % zu erreichen, sind die Schadenskostenschätzungen sogar um einen Faktor 10 zu niedrig. Es wird gezeigt, dass der Hauptbeitrag zur Emissionsreduktion eher auf Verhaltensänderungen der Auspendler als auf jenen der innerstädtischen Verkehrsteilnehmer basiert; unter bestimmten Umständen erhöht sich sogar der CO 2 -Ausstoß der Letzteren. Eine ökonomische Untersuchung deutet darauf hin, dass eine Maut, die dem Fünffachen der Maut auf Basis der Schadenskosteninternalisierung entspricht zu einer sechsfachen Steigerung der Wohlfahrt im Gesamtsystem führt. Im zweiten Teil der Dissertation wird das zweite Ziel (Entwicklung eines laufzeiteffizienten Modells zur Simulation heterogener Verkehrsbedingungen) hauptsächlich im Kontext von Entwicklungsländern behandelt, in denen häufig heterogene Verkehrsverhältnisse vorherrschen. Diese Bedingungen erfordern die Entwicklung eines heterogenen Verkehrsflussmodells, um alle Fahrzeugklassen einschließen zu können, während die rechentechnische Effizienz des Modells erhalten bleibt. Daher wird im zweiten Teil der Dissertation ein schnelles Spatial Queue Model (SQM) vorgestellt, mit dem realistische Verkehrsflussdynamiken durch Berücksichtigung sich rückwärtsbewegender Lücken unter heterogenen Verkehrsbedingungen produziert werden. In diesem Ansatz steht der Raum, der frei wird, wenn sich ein Fahrzeug Richtung Ende der Netzwerkkante bewegt, nicht unmittelbar für nachfolgende Fahrzeuge zur Verfügung, sondern hängt vielmehr von der Geschwindigkeit der sich rückwärts bewegenden Lücken ab. Dies führt zu dreiecksförmigen Fundamentaldiagrammen Fundamentaldiagrammen (FDs) des Verkehrsflusses, sodass die Steigung des linken Asts näherungsweise gleich dem Minimum aus Fahrzeuggeschwindigkeit und Netzwerkkantengeschwindigkeit ist, während die Steigung des rechten Asts näherungsweise gleich der Geschwindigkeit der sich rückwärts bewegenden Lücke ist. Mit Hilfe der FDs der Simulation verschiedener Fahrzeugklassen wird gezeigt, dass mit abnehmender Höchstgeschwindigkeit der Fahrzeugklasse die Dichte, bei der der höchste Verkehrsfluss erreicht wird, steigt und der maximale Verkehrsfluss sinkt. Mit einem ähnlichen Ziel werden im zweiten Teil der Disseration ferner sog. Seepage Link Dynamics in das SQM integriert. Seepage (Durchschlängeln) ist ein typisches Phänomen auf urbanen Straßen in den meisten Entwicklungsländern. Seepage beschriebt das Phänomen, dass sich kleinere Fahrzeuge wie bspw. Fahrräder oder Motorräder aufgrund ihrer höheren Manövrierbarkeit und ihrer geringeren Größe kontinuierlich durch die Lücken zwischen stehenden oder fast stehenden anderen Fahrzeugen bewegen und somit zum Ende der Warteschlange vorrücken und diese vor den anderen Fahrzeugen verlassen. Die FDs von Simulationen mit gleichem Modal Split von Autos und Fahrrädern zeigen, dass die Flusseigenschaften der Fahrräder nur marginal durch das Vorhandensein von Autos beeinflusst werden, während die Flusseigenschaften von Autos signifikant durch das Vorhandensein von Fahrrädern beeinflusst werden. Weiterhin wurde für einen Verkehrsstrom gezeigt, dass Seepage effizienter für schnellere Verkehrsmittel wie z. B. Motorräder ist als für langsamere. Schließlich wird im zweiten Teil der Dissertation ein Vergleich der rechentechnischen Performanz aus verschiedenen Simulationen, in denen die unterschiedlichen Verkehrs- und Kantendynamiken des Queue-Modells verwendet werden, gezogen. Die zusätzliche Datenstruktur zur Behandlung der sich rückwärts bewegenden Lücken erhöht die durchschnittliche Simulationszeit nur marginal in allen drei verwendeten Simulationssamples (1 %, 10 %, 100 %). Die nötigen Zwischenspeicherung zur Berücksichtigung von sich durchschlängelnden Fahrzeugen auf den einzelnen Kanten (Seepage) hingegen stellt sich als ressourcenintensiv im Vergleich zu den sonstigen Kantendynamiken des Queue-Modells dar. Die Steigerungsrate der durchschnittlichen Simulationszeit bei Berücksichtigung von Seepage Link Dynamics ist signifikant höher als die Steigerungsraten der durchschnittlichen Simulationszeit der anderen Linkdynamiken des Queue-Modells. Im dritten Teil der Dissertation werden die beiden Ziele zusammengeführt und anhand eines realistischen Simulationsszenarios für Patna in Indien veranschaulicht mit dem Ziel externe Effekte durch Emissionen zu reduzieren und ein nachhaltiges Verkehrssystem zu erreichen. In diesem Teil der Dissertation werden die Schritte zur Generierung der Verkehrsnachfrage sowie zur Kalibrierung des Szenarios dargelegt. Die städtische Verkehrsnachfrage wird auf Basis von Reisetagebüchern erstellt, während der Pendlerverkehr auf Basis stündlicher Verkehrszählungen generiert wird. Für Zweiteres wird das Kalibrierungstool Calibration od dynamic traffic assignments (Cadyts) zur Berücksichtigung heterogener Verkehrsbedingungen angepasst. Um unterschiedliche Einkommenseffekte in den verhaltensbasierten Entscheidungsprozess der Verkehrsteilnehmer einzubeziehen, wird das individuelle Einkommen in die Bewertungsfunktion integriert. Das Szenario wird kalibriert, um die alternativenspezifische (verkehrsmittelspezifische) Konstante Alternative (mode) specific constants (ASCs) für verschiedenen Verkehrsmittel auszuwerten. Das kalibrierte Szenario wird zur Maßnahmenuntersuchung verwendet. Ausgehend von den Charakteristika des Verkehrsgeschehens und der Zusammensetzung der Verkehrsmittel, wird ein Fahrradschnellweg (Bicycle Superhighway) entlang einer existierenden Eisenbahnlinie vorgeschlagen. Ein iterativer Prozess wird verwendet, um die optimalen Orte für Verbindungen zwischen dem Fahrradschnellweg und der existierenden Infrastruktur zu bestimmen. Dies wird mit einem Alternativszenario, in dem auch Motorräder auf dem Fahrradschnellweg zugelassen sind, verglichen. Beide Maßnahmen tragen zu einer signifikanten Erhöhung des Fahrradanteils bei. Um die Emissionen unter beiden Maßnahmen abzuschätzen wird das Emission Modeling Tool (EMT) für heterogenen Verkehrsbedingungen erweitert. Es wird gezeigt, dass signifikante Reduktionen der Emissionen in der Innenstadt zu verzeichnen sind, falls Fahrräder als einziges Verkehrsmittel auf den Fahrradschnellwegen erlaubt sind. Sobald jedoch auch Motorräder auf dem Fahrradschnellweg zugelassen werden, ist ein signifikanter Anstieg der Emissionen entlang des Fahrradschnellwegen in der Innenstadt von Patna zu beobachten, was die Notwendigkeit solche Verkehrsmittel von Fahrradschnellwegen zu verbannen verdeutlicht. Hierdurch wird im dritten Teil der Dissertation gezeigt, dass signifikante Emissionsreduktionen auch unter Bedingungen, in denen die Umsetzung von Bepreisungsmaßnahmen schwierig ist, erreicht werden können. Zusammenfassend liegt der Schwerpunkt dieser Dissertation auf der Bewertung von Bepreisungsmaßnahmen mittels eines Simulationsmodells mit dem Ziel nützliche Informationen für Entscheidungsträger abzuleiten, die geeignet sind, um negativen externen Effekten des Verkehrs sowohl in Industrie- als auch Entwicklungsländern entgegenzuwirken. Für letztere wird in dieser Arbeit ein effizientes Verkehrsflussmodell zur Simulation heterogener Verkehrsbedingungen vorgestellt. Schließlich wird in mehreren Fallstudien das Spektrum möglicher Maßnahmen auf Basis verschiedener Szenarien gezeigt...|$|E

40|$|Research on the {{internationalization}} of retailing {{has focused}} on descriptive and empirical studies centring {{on issues such as}} motivations for retail internationalization and individual company experiences of the internationalization process. One particular aspect of the retail internationalization process that has remained relatively underresearched, and consequently under theorized, is market entry mode strategy. Furthermore, with a few notable exceptions, potentially interesting research from the economics of international production and corporate finance literatures has been virtually ignored in the international retailing domain. This paper represents an initial step in rectifying these deficiencies by exploring some of the issues associated with the economics-based internalization and agency theories, in the context of international retailers' market entry mode strategy.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of external pressures, internal motivations and their interplay, {{with the intention of}} identifying whether they drive substantive or instead symbolic implementation of ISO 14001. The context is one of economic crisis. We focus on Greece, where the economic crisis has weakened the country’s institutional environment, and analyse qualitatively new interview data from 45 ISO 14001 -certified firms. Our findings show that (a) weak external pressures can lead to a symbolic implementation of ISO 14001, as firms can defend their legitimacy without incurring the <b>costs</b> of <b>internalization</b> in the local market; (b) weak external pressures can lead to substantive implementation of ISO 14001 when firms have strong internal motivations seeking to strategically differentiate from competitors in international markets. Firms internalize ISO 14001 so as to restore their legitimacy and reputation in foreign markets and stimulate their competitiveness; and (c) strong internal motivations pave the way for companies to stimulate their competitiveness by enhancing their efficiency, as some companies might strengthen their position in the local market by implementing ISO 14001 substantively. The contribution of this paper to the literature on ISO 14001 internalization lies in refining existing theory on the importance of internal motivations for the substantive implementation of ISO 14001 in the context of economic crisis. Additionally, this paper extends current theory by challenging studies that dismiss the importance of external pressures. We argue that the intensity of external pressures influences the internalization of ISO 14001, but propose that this relationship might not be linear...|$|R
