Hyperpigmentation of the skin may be {{associated with the use of}} oral contraceptives, estrogen replacement therapy and pregnancy. In addition, chronic exposure to ultraviolet light may disrupt the structural and functional components of the skin, increase melanin production, and thicken the stratum corneum. 1 Long-term ultraviolet exposure may cause photodamage resulting in Þne lines, coarse wrinkles, roughness, laxity, pigmentary disorders, dryness, sallowness, epidermal atrophy or dermal elastosis. 2 In the past, pigmentary disorders were successfully treated with agents <b>containing</b> <b>hydroquinone,</b> a hydroxyphenolic chemical.

Mequinol leaves the skin looking extremely pale. However, tanning is still possible. It is important to notice that the skin will not go back to its original color after the none treatment of mequinol.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} and characterisation of photophysical, electrochemical and photochemical {{properties of}} rulhenium(II) polypyridyl <b>containing</b> <b>hydroquinone</b> triazole or pyrazole moieties are described. The characterisations described involve, HPLC, ^Hnmr, UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy, fluorimetry, electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry, laser flash photolysis, and resonance Raman spectroscopy. In the main chapter of this thesis {{the investigation of}} a series of Ru(II) complexes bound to pyridyltriazole ligands bridged to pendent electroactive phenol, hydroquinone and quinone moieties is described. A novel synthesis for oxidation of the <b>hydroquinone</b> <b>containing</b> complex is described, employing benzeneselininc acid which, in a one pot reaction under very mild conditions, the hydroquinone may be completely oxidised without concomitant oxidation of the quinone. None of the complexes described exhibit intramolecular electron transfer from any of the electroactive groups under neutral conditions. This was associated with endoergonic AG values for intramolecular electron transfer in these complexes under neutral conditions. At high pH however, intramolecular electron transfer was observed in all complexes containing the electroctive aryl groups. This was associated with intramolecular hole transfer from the Ru(III) * to the phenolate, semiquinone or anionic hydroquinone formed from these ligands at high pH. This electron transfer is ranges around 2 x 10 () s- 1 in neutral acetonitrile, it is therefore rather a slow transfer, however, the resulting charge separated state is stable over several microseconds. The electron transfer processes also persist at cryogenic temperatures, and outside the glass phase are largely temperature independent. These complexes were therefore described as simple abiotic models for photosynthesis, this is particularly the case for the <b>hydroquinone</b> <b>containing</b> complex, which also exhibits an electrochemically induced intramolecular proton transfer verified by electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical measurements. In the second part of this thesis the synthesis and characterisation of mononuclear and dinuclear 0,N coordinated Ru(II) complexes to hydroquinonepyrazole and phenolpyridyltriazole were described. The mononuclear complexes exhibit intense, broad range, visible absorbances, with Xmax tailing to 800 nm, they are photostable, luminescent and electroactive. Luminescence in complexes bound via 0,N are normally rare. The dinuclear 0,N coordinated complexes produced stable mixed valence states. These mixed valence states exhibit class II behaviour, i. e. weakly coupled, electronic communication between the metal centres. This interaction is particularly weak in the complex bridged by the phenolpyridyltriazole, which shows an intervalence transition of unusually high energy. Most interestingly, this complex, which is luminescent in the (II) -(II) state exhibits increased luminescence in the mixed valence state, whereby it appeared that the unoxidised N,N coordinated side of this complex became isolated from the Ru(III) 0,N side of the complex in the excited state. Finally, a novel synthesis for the deuteration of bipyridyl was described, this synthesis is a one pot, high yield reaction, that was considerably easier than that available in current literature. The properties of complexes containing deuterated bpy are described and the value of employing deuterat ion as a means of ascertaining the position of the LUMO was discussed...|$|R

Methods Thirty patients received three tubes of cream and were divided into two groups: group 1, one tube <b>containing</b> <b>hydroquinone</b> 4 % cream and one tube containing placebo to be applied to opposite sides of the face at night, and standardized sunscreen [sun protection factor (SPF) 25] for daily use; group 2, one tube containing skin whitening complex 5 % cream and one tube containing placebo to be applied to opposite sides of the face at night, and standardized sunscreen (SPF 25). All of the tubes had the same appearance and the creams had the same characteristics. the only person who knew what was being used by each patient on each side of the face was the pharmacist. A professional photographer took photographs before and after treatment, which lasted for 3 months. Clinical evaluation was performed by two independent observers and by the patients themselves. Statistical evaluation was by the chi-squared and kappa methods. Results Twenty-five patients completed the study, with an overall improvement of 72 % in comparison with placebo. Group 1 (hydroquinone and placebo) presented an improvement of 76. 9 % with 25 % side-effects, and group 2 (skin whitening complex and placebo) presented an improvement of 66. 7 % with 0 % side-effects. Conclusions Both depigmentation agents were useful in the treatment of melasma. the hydroquinone group presented more collateral effects than the skin whitening complex group. Considering that the patients showed Fitzpatrick skin types IV to VI and the study was conducted in the summer, skin whitening complex seems to be an excellent choice for the treatment of melasma.

Methods: The biotransformation efficiency of a Vigna radiata cell culture in addition to different concentrations of hydroquinone (6 - 20 mg/ 100 ml) was investigated after 24 hours in comparison to an Echinacea purpurea cell culture and {{attempts were made to}} increase the efficacy of the process by adding elicitors. Results: Arbutin was accumulated in cells and found in the media only in insignificant amounts. The arbutin content of the biomass extracts of V. radiata and E. purpurea was different, ranging from 0. 78 to 1. 89 % and 2. 00 to 3. 55 % of dry weight, respectively. V. radiata demonstrated a bioconversion efficiency of 55. 82 % after adding 8 mg/ 100 ml precursor, which was comparable with result of 69. 53 % for E. purpurea cells after adding 10 mg/ 100 ml hydroquinone (P> 0. 05). In both cultures, adding hydroquinone in two portions with a 24 -hour interval increased the biotransformation efficiency. Different concentrations of methyl jasmonate (25, 50, and 100 µM) and chitosan (50 and 100 µg/ml) as elicitors increased the bio-efficiency percentage of the V. radiata culture in comparison with the flask <b>containing</b> only <b>hydroquinone.</b> Conclusion: This is the first report of the biotransformation possibility of V. radiata cultures. It was observed the bioconversion capacity increased by adding hydroquinone in two portions, which was comparable to adding an elicitor...|$|R
40|$|Background: Topical {{corticosteroids}} (TC) {{are being}} misused widely {{on the face}} without a prescription from the dermatologist. Aim: To evaluate the misuse of TC-containing preparations on the face and the adverse effects due to its application. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire-based analysis was done among patients attending the dermatology outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital between March 2014 and March 2015. Patients with various facial dermatoses were asked about their current use of topical preparations and on further followup questioning, those who revealed the use of TCs (25 g or more) continuously or intermittently for a minimum duration of four weeks {{were included in the}} study and observed for local adverse effects. Results: A total of 410 patients were observed, 306 were females (74. 6 %) and 104 were males (25. 3 %). One hundred and seventy-eight patients (43. 4 %) used topical steroids alone, 124 (30. 2 %) used creams <b>containing</b> TC, <b>hydroquinone,</b> and tretinoin, 108 (26. 3 %) used creams containing a combination of TC, antibiotic, and/or antifungal. One hundred and seventy-six patients (42. 9 %) bought TC or TC containing creams over the counter on their own, without the prescription of a dermatologist, 35 (8. 5 %) were recommended TC by a beautician (beauty parlors), 82 (20 %) by their friends, family members, or neighbors, 75 (18. 2 %) by a non-dermatologist practitioner, and 42 (10. 2 %) by a dermatologist. Limitations: The sample size was small. Conclusion: Dispensing of TCs must be regulated in India; they should only be issued against a doctor's prescription...|$|R
40|$|The sensitivities of carthamin and safflor yellow B towards oxidants and {{antioxidants}} {{were compared}} in bufferized solutions at various given concentrations. The test chemicals affected variously on the pigment colourations: (1) externally charged 0 2 had less {{effect on the}} colour change of carthamin, (2) organe-yellow coloured safflor yellow B was bleached by the gas flush, (3) carthamin showed little or no affinitive property for H 2 0 2 at 0. 001 - 230 µM level, (4) safflor yellow B reacted positively with the oxidant and was changed readily to faint yellow unknown compounds, (5) double-faced responses {{could be found in}} carthamin solution with L-ascorbic acid or with D-isoascorbic acid, namely the former antioxidant intensified the colour of carthamin and the latter reduced the red colouration, (6) hydroquinone emphasized the red colour of carthamin in solution, (7) safflor yellow B shifted bathochromically in <b>hydroquinone</b> <b>containing</b> solution, however, it showed no shift in L-ascorbic acid and D-isoascorbic acid solutions. The data are discussed from the standpoint of oxidative dissimilation of the quinochalconoids in the floral tissues of dyer's saffron capitula...|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in the process was the removal of the antihalation backing with an {{alkaline}} solution and wash. The film was then developed using a developer <b>containing</b> phenidone and <b>hydroquinone,</b> which formed three superimposed negative images, one for each primary color. After the first developer was washed out, the film underwent re-exposure and redevelopment. Re-exposure fogged the silver halides that were not developed in the first developer. A color developer then developed the fogged image, and its exhaustion products reacted with a color coupler to form a dye in the color complementary to the layer's sensitivity. The red-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the base of the film with red light, then redeveloped forming cyan dye. The blue-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the emulsion side of the film with blue light, then redeveloped forming yellow dye. The green-sensitive layer was redeveloped with a developer that chemically fogged it and formed magenta dye. After color development, the metallic silver was converted to silver halide using a bleach solution. The film was then fixed, making these silver halides soluble and leaving only the final dye image. The final steps were to wash the film to remove residual chemicals which might cause deterioration of the dye image, then to dry, cut, and mount the film in slide frames.|$|R
40|$|Modified biphenols {{which contain}} 2, 2 $ sp prime$-disubstituents on the {{biphenyl}} groups and also <b>hydroquinones</b> <b>containing</b> multiple substituents were synthesized {{in order to}} prepare novel thermally stable polymers. The structure/properties relationship which were investigated using viscometry, DSC, TG/DTA, TMA, and GPC are discussed. The prepared polymers (polysulfones and poly(ether ketone) s) exhibit considerably enhanced glass transition temperatures and are soluble in common organic solvents due to the noncoplanar biphenyl rings which increase the disorder along the polymer backbone thereby reducing interchain interactions. The polyesters prepared show poor solubility and their Tg's and Tm's increase considerably over the unhindered polyester analogs due to the chain stiffness. Polyimides were prepared from the reaction of novel dianhydrides and m- and p-phenylene diamines. A series of bisanhydrides were prepared via the nitro-displacement reaction of hindered biphenols and N-methyl- 4 -nitrophthalimide. The polymers exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents and show high Tg's. Blends of polycarbonate and polyimides, prepared from m-phenylene diamine, show better miscibility compared to those of polyimides from p-phenylene diamine. The 2, 2 $ sp prime$-substituted biphenols which can be oxidized to bisphenoxydiradicals are applicable as oxidizing agents for diphenylmethanes and primary alcohols, and also undergo C-O coupling reactions with activated methylene groups. An additional modified biphenol was synthesized for REDOX polymers applications and the properties of these polymers are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Template-directed {{protocols}} {{provide a}} routine {{approach to the}} synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), in which the mechanical bonds are stabilized by {{a wide variety of}} weak interactions. In this paper, we describe a strategy for the preparation of neutral [2]catenanes with sliding interlocked electron-rich rings, starting from two degenerate donor-acceptor [2]catenanes, consisting of a tetracationic cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) cyclophane (CBPQT 4 +) and crown ethers <b>containing</b> either (i) <b>hydroquinone</b> (HQ) or (ii) 1, 5 -dioxynaphthalene (DNP) recognition units and carrying out four-electron reductions of the cyclophane components to their neutral forms. The donor-acceptor interactions between the CBPQT 4 + ring and both HQ and DNP units present in the crown ethers that stabilize the [2]catenanes are weakened upon reduction of the cyclophane components to their radical cationic states and are all but absent in their fully reduced states. Characterization in solution performed by UV-Vis, EPR and NMR spectroscopic probes reveals that changes in the redox properties of the [2]catenanes result in a substantial decrease of the energy barriers for the circumrotation and pirouetting motions of the interlocked rings, which glide freely through one another in the neutral states. The solid-state structures of the fully reduced catenanes reveal profound changes in the relative dispositions of the interlocked rings, with the glycol chains of the crown ethers residing in the cavities of the neutral CBPQT 0 rings. Quantum mechanical investigations of the energy levels associated with the four different oxidation states of the catenanes support this interpretation. Catenanes and rotaxanes with sliding rings are expected to display unique properties...|$|R
