Mandler was a pragmatist more than a visionary. His designs are very competent, {{but he had to}} work within the restrictions of the Leitz philosophy of lens manufacture. It seems that lenses for 35 mm photography were a bit boring for him, as they did not pose the challenge he wanted. This he found in the designs for the military and in the ELCAN lenses he could explore more exciting optical limits. (...) There are only a few letters by Mandler in the Leica archives and the contents give the impression of a passionate man, who feels slightly frustrated by the slow progress made by Leitz and the fast improvements made by the Japanese. He clearly saw that without fundamental changes Leica could not compete in the long run. But Leitz was in those days already living on borrowed money. His ELCAN designs were by nature less <b>cost</b> <b>oriented</b> and the knowledge gained here could be transferred to the photographic department. ... Mandler's study about the Double-Gauss designs is still the definitive analysis of the limits and potential of this class of lenses. The book was published in 1979 and represented {{the state of the art}} in optical design at that time. His achievement was the transfer of that theoretical framework to practical design. He did not develop really innovative designs, but his strong point was the exploration of existing limits and to find ways to implement the almost impossible." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{intricate}} {{pattern of}} chemical modifications on DNA and histones, the "histone code", {{is considered to}} be a key gene regulation factor. Multivalency is seen by many as an essential instrument to transmit the "encoded" information to the transcription machinery via multi-domain effector proteins and chromatin-associated complexes. However, as examples of multivalent histone engagement accumulate, an apparent contradiction is emerging. The isolated effector domains are notably weak binders, thus it is often asserted that the entropic <b>cost</b> of <b>orienting</b> multiple domains can be "prepaid" by a rigid tether. Meanwhile, evidence suggests that the tethers are largely disordered and offer little rigidity. Here we consider a mechanism to "prepay" the entropic <b>costs</b> of <b>orienting</b> the domains for binding, not through rigidity of the tether but through the careful spacing of the modifications on chromatin. An all-atom molecular dynamics study of the most fully characterized multivalent chromatin effector conforms to the conditions for an optimal free-energy payout, as predicted by the model discussed here.

Incidentally, Hearn had expressed interest some years earlier in moving Orient to Olympic Park and reducing its capacity to 25,000 seats, while West Ham would cut the capacity to 60,000 if their relocation went ahead. Tottenham Hotspur also pursued legal action over the decision and eventually the deal with West Ham collapsed due to legal pressure on 11 October 2011.

The evidence to date however has been mixed with some suggesting that environmental uncertainty (PEU) is the dominant driver of MAS attributes while other have suggested that the effects of PEU are indirect through their association with decentralisation. This paper re-examines these associations by examining the dimensionality of these global constructs and by introducing strategy in an attempt to more fully understand the effect of context on MAS. Our results show that while PEU and structure both affect MAS attributes (external, non-fmancial and ex ante characteristics) the pattern of associations is very different for firms that pursue product differentiation strategies than for those that pursue marketing and <b>cost</b> <b>oriented</b> strategies...|$|E

5000|$|In {{business}} economics cost breakdown analysis {{is a method}} of cost analysis, which itemizes {{the cost of a}} certain product or service into its various components, the so-called cost drivers. The cost breakdown analysis is a popular cost reduction strategy and a viable opportunity for businesses. [...] "Cost breakdown analysis is the process to build and understand the elements that compose the cost of a product or service. This technique is also referred to as Clean Sheet Costing, Open Book Costing ...Tear down analysis, Price Breakdown Analysis or Supplier Cost Analysis" [...] The price of a product or service is defined as cost plus profit, whereas cost can be broken down further into direct cost and indirect cost. As a business has virtually no influence on indirect cost, a <b>cost</b> reduction <b>oriented</b> <b>cost</b> breakdown analysis focuses rather on factors contributing to direct cost. The most common factors among direct cost are labor, raw materials and subcontracting. These are aspects of a business, over which it has direct control and which, in turn, enables the business to identify ways to save expenditure by the proper application of a cost breakdown analysis. Businesses can also combine this strategy with a value chain analysis, which allows price forecasts and hence, quicker responses to changes in the market.|$|R
