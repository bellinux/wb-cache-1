Among consequences of anticoagulant treatment: increased aortic wall stiffness, <b>coronary</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> ischemia, and even heart failure.

5000|$|Despite {{widespread}} analytical confirmation, some {{questioned whether}} or not this endogenous substance is ouabain. The arguments were based less upon rigorous analytical data but more on the fact that immunoassays are neither entirely specific nor reliable. Hence, it was suggested that some assays for endogenous ouabain detected other compounds or failed to detect ouabain at all. Additionally, it was suggested [...] that rhamnose, the L-sugar component of ouabain, could not be synthesized within the body despite published data to the contrary. Yet another argument against the existence of endogenous ouabain was the lack of effect of rostafuroxin (a first generation ouabain receptor antagonist) on blood pressure in an unselected population of hypertensive patients. However, in a follow on analysis, where hypertensive patients were {{selected on the basis of}} their genotype, rostafuroxin lowered blood pressure significantly in the target group with a quantitative effect comparable to that of an angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist. Further, there is mounting evidence from clinical studies that elevated circulating levels of endogenous ouabain, as measured by immunoassay, are associated with adverse outcomes in a variety of chronic cardiovascular and renal diseases. It may be noted also that work from experimental animal studies indicates that many of the adverse actions of EO likely involve angiotensinergic pathways in the central nervous system. [...] Accumulating evidence suggests also that EO is not simply a bystander entity (biomarker) but rather that elevated circulating levels of EO (with the exception of normal pregnancy and preeclampsia [...] ) appear to be a direct contributor to the adverse outcomes among the various patient populations mentioned above. This conclusion contrasts with the positive impression given in the medical uses of ouabain noted below. However, there may be a relatively straightforward explanation. With the exception of the CHF study, the most obvious difference is the absence of overt preexisting myocardial infarction or <b>coronary</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in the patients recruited in most all of the above noted clinical studies and its invariable presence in most of the patient populations mentioned below.|$|E

40|$|The {{details of}} 60 {{patients}} scheduled for emergency coronary artery surgery are presented. Forty-two patients {{were categorized as}} having "impending " infarctions and 18 were operated on within 4 hours of sustaining acute myocardial infarctions. The patients presented with different haemodynamic disturbances and the selection of anaesthetic drugs was modified accordingly. We have found that conventional anaes-thetic methods, conservatively applied, can be used safely in this group. The induction of anaesthesia {{and the increase in}} arterial oxygen tensions obtained by controlled ventilation produced an improvement in e. c. g. signs of ischaemia, and also reduced myocardial irritability. Circulatory complications were treated according to information obtained from simple monitoring techniques. The responsibility of the anaesthetist in postoperative care is emphasized and a regime of postoperative ventilatory management is described. Elective direct myocardial revascularization pro-cedures arc being performed in ever-increasing numbers, and these surgical techniques have been applied successfully in emergency situations (Favaloro, 1970; Favaloro et al., 1971).

40|$|Cardiac failure affects 1. 5 % of {{the adult}} {{population}} and is predominantly caused by myocardial dysfunction secondary to <b>coronary</b> vascular <b>insufficiency.</b> Current therapeutic strategies improve prognosis only modestly, as the primary cause [...] loss of normally functioning cardiac myocytes [...] is not being corrected. Adult cardiac myocytes are unable to divide and regenerate to any significant extent following injury. New cardiac myocytes are, however, created during embryogenesis from progenitor cells and then by cell division from existing cardiac myocytes. This process is intimately linked to the development of coronary vasculature from progenitors originating in the endothelium, the proepicardial organ and neural crest. In this review, we systematically evaluate approx. 90 mouse mutations that impair heart muscle growth during development. These studies provide genetic evidence for interactions between myocytes, endothelium and cells derived from the proepicardial organ and the neural crest that co-ordinate myocardial and coronary vascular development. Conditional knockout and transgenic rescue experiments indicate that Vegfa, Bmpr 1 a (ALK 3), Fgfr 1 / 2, Mapk 14 (p 38), Hand 1, Hand 2, Gata 4, Zfpm 2 (FOG 2), Srf and Txnrd 2 in cardiac myocytes, Rxra and Wt 1 in the proepicardial organ, EfnB 2, Tek, Mapk 7, Pten, Nf 1 and Casp 8 in the endothelium, and Bmpr 1 a and Pax 3 in neural crest cells are key molecules controlling myocardial development. Coupling of myocardial and coronary development is mediated by BMP (bone morphogenetic protein), FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) signalling, and also probably involves hypoxia.

Fourteen patients (33 %) in whom rest pain persisted after 48 hours underwent emergency coronary angiography, with 3 deaths; of the surviving 11 who had acute saphenous vein bypass grafting, 2 died at operation and 3 had perioperative myocardial infarctions. Seventeen patients (41 % 110) who initially improved required surgery within 6 months because of symptoms. Eleven patients (26 %) were not operated on. It is concluded that acute <b>coronary</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is best managed initially by intensive medical therapy but a high proportion will require surgery later because of disabling angina.

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} cardiac insufficiency on contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) complicated with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (MMRI). Methods　From Dec. 2008 to Oct. 2011, 2998 patients, with type 2 DM and concomitant chronic kidney diseases (CKD) from 53 hospitals in China, {{were enrolled in the}} present study. Out of them, 2533 patients showed normal cardiac function (NYHA= 1) and 465 patients suffered from cardiac insufficiency (NYHA> 1). The demographic characteristics, preoperative renal function and postoperative incidence of CIAKI in the two groups were monitored. Results　No significant difference was found between two groups (P> 0. 05) in preoperative baseline data (age, sex, high risk factors, etc.). The incidence of CIAKI was significantly higher in NYHA> 1 group than in NYHA= 1 group (4. 7 % vs 2. 8 %, P= 0. 03). During a 30 day follow-up, the incidence of all-cause mortality was not significantly different between two groups (P> 0. 05). Multiple factors analysis found that rosuvastatin was the protective agent for CIAKI, and acute <b>coronary</b> syndrome, cardiac <b>insufficiency,</b> anemia and renal insufficiency were the risk factors for CIAKI. Conclusion　For PCI, the risk of postoperative incidence of CIAKI is higher in patients with preoperative cardiac insufficiency than in those with normal cardiac function. The incidence of CIAKI may be reduced obviously by meticulous preoperative assessment of heart function in high-risk patients, giving effective treatment and performing PCI after cardiac function is improved.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} To assess the {{relationship}} between plaque volume evaluated by multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MDCT) and in-stent restenosis (ISR) after carotid artery stenting (CAS). Materials and methods From a retrospectively maintained database, data were collected for 52 patients with carotid artery stenosis treated with CAS between 2007 and 2012. We defined ISR of ≥ 50 % as a peak systolic velocity ≥ 200 cm/s on echo-duplex scan. Carotid plaques were subdivided into four components according to radiodensity in Hounsfield units (HU) as follows: 600 HU. Risk factors that influenced ISR were compared using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Results During a median follow-up period of 36 months, ISR of ≥ 50 % was detected in five patients (9. 6 %). In the univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, renal <b>insufficiency,</b> <b>coronary</b> artery disease, total plaque volume, and plaque volumes with radiodensities < 0 and ≥ 600 HU increased the risk for ISR (P < 0. 10). When the significant risk factors determined from the univariate analysis were subjected to a multivariate analysis, only the volumes of the plaque components with radiodensities < 0 HU independently predicted the development of ISR (hazard ratio: 1. 041; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 006 – 1. 078; P = 0. 021).

The literature review shows the history of discovery and identification of different types of natriuretic peptides and considers the matters of their biochemistry. It also details information on the synthesis, secretion, and clearance of these peptides, as well as their receptor apparatus in various organs and tissues. The physiology of the regulatory system is described, as applied to the cardiovascular, excretory, central nervous systems, and the neuroendocrine one. Special attention is given to the current publications on the control of B-type natriuretic peptides as biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction. The diagnostic and prognostic values of peptides are analyzed in chronic circulatory <b>insufficiency,</b> <b>coronary</b> heart disease, and other car-diological and non-cardiological diseases. The prognostic value of elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels in cardiac surgery is separately considered.

Still the evidence for commonly claimed predictors of post-AVR prognosis, in particular mortality, appears scant. This systematic review reports on the evidence for predictors of post-AVR mortality, and may be helpful in pre-surgical risk-stratification. In PubMed, we searched for original reports of post-AVR follow-up studies. We assessed the quality of study design and methods with a standardized checklist. Data of the reported predictors of mortality and outcomes were extracted. Twenty-eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies were considered of high quality. There is strong evidence {{that the risk of}} early mortality is increased by emergency surgery, while the risk of late mortality is increased with older age and preoperative atrial. fibrillation. There is moderate evidence that the risk of early mortality is increased by older age, aortic <b>insufficiency,</b> <b>coronary</b> artery disease, longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF), infective endocarditis, hypertension, mechanical valves, preoperative pacing, dialysis-dependent renal failure and valve size; and that the risk for late mortality is increased by emergency surgery and urgency of the operation. There is little evidence for high New York Heart Association class, concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and many other commonly claimed risk factors for post-AVR mortality. The reported evidence on predictors of post-AVR mortality wilt help for pre-surgical risk-stratification, i. e. to discern patients at high or Low risk for early and late post-AVR mortality. Future prognostic studies should take the evidence from this review into account and should focus on derivation of a predictive model for post-AVR survival.

40|$|Nach einer interventionellen Koronarangioplastie, insbesondere nach koronarer Stentimplantation, ist die Thrombozytenaktivität der behandelten Patienten erhöht. Die Patienten unterliegen aufgrund dieser gesteigerten Thrombozytenaktivität einem erhöhten Risiko für thrombotische Komplikationen im weiteren Verlauf. Dabei hat sich die duale antithrombozytäre Therapie, bestehend aus Clopidogrel und ASS, als effektiv in der Reduktion atherothrombotischer Komplikationen - insbesondere thrombotischen Stentverschlüssen - erwiesen und gilt heute als therapeutischer Goldstandard für Patienten nach einer Koronarintervention. Allerdings erleiden trotz dieser Therapie 6 - 9 % der mit einer koronaren Stent-implantation behandelten Patienten im längerfristigen Verlauf nach der Intervention ein erneutes kardiovaskuläres Ereignis. Jüngst wurde in mehreren Studien von einer hohen interindividuellen Variabilität in der Wirksamkeit von Clopidogrel berichtet. 5 - 30 % der Patienten sprechen nicht adäquat auf das Medikament an und werden als „Low-Responder“ bezeichnet. Diese Patienten haben ein erhöhtes Risiko für thrombotische Komplikationen. Deshalb ist es wichtig, diese Hochrisikopatienten zu identifi¬zieren. Eine Messung der residuellen Plättchenaktivität (RPA) ermöglicht es zwar, die Wirksamkeit der antithrombozytären Therapie festzustellen, ist aber in der klinischen Routine nur schwer durchführbar. Ein alternativ möglicher Ansatz ist die Etablierung eines Risikoscores, mit dessen Hilfe die Patienten, die mit einer hohen Wahrscheinlichkeit durch die konventionelle antithrombozytäre Therapie nicht ausreichend geschützt sind, identifiziert werden können. Ziel der hier vorliegenden Studie war die Entwicklung eines solchen Risikoscores: des PREDICT-Scores. In der Studie wurde eine unselektierte Kohorte von 1092 Patienten mit symptomatischer koronarer Herzkrankheit (KHK) und Stentimplantation untersucht. Die pharmakologische Wirksamkeit von Clopidogrel wurde mittels der ADP(20 µM) -induzierten Plättchenaggregation quantifiziert. Die Messung fand frühestens 6 Stunden nach Gabe der Clopidogrel-Initialdosis statt. In einer multiplen Regressionsanalyse waren folgende klinische Charakteristika statistisch signifikant mit dem Auftreten einer erhöhten thrombozytären Restaktivität trotz antithrombozytärer Therapie assoziiert: Alter > 65 Jahre, akutes Koronarsyndrom, Niereninsuffizienz mit einem Kreatinin-Wert > 1, 5 mg/dl, eingeschränkte linksventrikuläre Pumpfunktion (Auswurffraktion 65 y., acute <b>coronary</b> syndrome, renal <b>insufficiency</b> with a serum-creatinine level > 1, 5 mg/dl, reduced left-ventricular {{function}} (EF < 55 %) {{and diabetes}} mellitus. Depending {{on the level}} of significance in the univariate analysis each of these variables was weighted by the factors 1 – 3. Thus, a score with a range of 0 – 9 was developed. Three score-levels were generated (1 – 3, 4 – 6, 7 – 9). The study shows that the risk of an increased platelet activity comes along with higher score-levels (OR for patients with score-levels 7 – 9 compared with score-level 0 : 3, 3; 95 %-interval of confidence: 1, 8 – 6, 0). Additionally, incidence of unwanted cardiovascular events during the following 30 days comes along with the height of RPA (4, 8 % cardiovascular events in the 3 rd tertial vs. 2, 5 % in the 2 nd tertial vs. 1, 5 % in the 1 st tertial). The PREDICT-score helps to detect patients with an increased atherothrombotic risk by means of clinical factors that can easily be gained and therefore allows to intensify their antithrombotic therapy. In the future, the score should be tested within further clinical studies...|$|R
