40|$|This {{paper has}} two purposes. First, {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between daily price volatility and trading activity one year before and after a change in contract size by examining the results of <b>contract</b> <b>splits</b> in the Australian share price index futures and the U. K. FTSE- 100 futures contracts and a reverse <b>contract</b> <b>split</b> in the Australian Bank Bill Acceptance futures contract. Second, we evaluate the effect of the change in contract size {{on the use of the}} particular futures market. We find that after a contract size change, the change in total trading frequency has the power to explain the change in daily price volatility. Specifically, after a <b>contract</b> <b>split,</b> trading frequency increased, resulting in increased daily price volatility, and vice versa after a reverse <b>contract</b> <b>split.</b> Most of the average trade size variable has an immaterial impact on price volatility. However, decomposing the total trading frequency into four trade size classes, we find that the trading frequency for small and large trade size categories are highly significant in explaining changes in daily price volatility after the <b>contract</b> <b>splits.</b> Finally, we find the change in contract size for each futures market was successful because within three years following the change, the adjusted trading volume and open interest surpassed the levels prior to the change and have continued to increase thereafter. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|A <b>contract</b> <b>splits</b> the {{responsibilities}} between a component and its environment into {{a guarantee that}} expresses an intended property under {{the responsibility of the}} component, given that the environment fulfills the assumptions. Although current contract theories are limited to express contracts over interfaces of components, specifications that are not limited to interfaces are used in practice and are needed in order to properly express safety requirements. A framework is therefore presented, generalizing current contract theory to environment-centric contracts - contracts that are not limited to the interface of components. The framework includes revised definitions of properties of contracts, as well as theorems that specifies exact conditions for when the properties hold. Furthermore, constraints are introduced, limiting the ports over which an environment-centric contract is expressed where the constraints constitute necessary conditions for the guarantee of the contract to hold in an architecture.

40|$|A <b>contract</b> <b>splits</b> the {{responsibilities}} between a component and its environment into {{a guarantee that}} expresses an intended property under {{the responsibility of the}} component, given that the environment fulfills the assumptions. Building on recent works where contracts are proposed as a means to meet the challenges in the design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), a general contract framework is presented that supports the modelling of both individual components and architectures of CPS - at all levels of design, as well as the structuring and specification of requirements on the components using contracts. To facilitate the specification of requirements, constraints that restrict the portsover which a contract is expressed are introduced to serve as sanity checks that the component and the environment meet their respective responsibilities. Furthermore, a new graph, called a contract structure is introduced to support the structuring and tracing of requirements on a CPS using contracts. As a proof-of-concept, the framework is used to specify and structure safety requirements on an industrial system, as proposed by ISO 26262. QS 2015 ESPRESS...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInside the DIGIDOC project (ANR- 10 -CORD- 0020) -CONTenus et INTeractions (CONTINT), our {{approach}} {{was applied to}} several scenarios of classification of image streams which can cores ond to real cases in digitization projects. Most of the time, the processing of documents is considered as a well-defined task: the classes (also called concepts) are defined and known before the processing starts. But in real industrial workflows of document processes, it may frequently happen that the concepts can change during the time. In a context of document stream processing, the information and content included in the digitized pages can evolve over the {{time as well as}} the judgment of the user on {{what he wants to do}} with the resulting classification. The goal of this application is to create a module of learning, for a steam-based document images classification (especially dedicated to a digitization process with a huge volume of data), that adapts different situations for intelligent scanning tasks: adding, extending, <b>contracting,</b> <b>splitting,</b> or merging the classes in on an online mode of streaming data processing...|$|R
40|$|Organizations {{increasingly}} {{split off}} parts and start cooperating with those parts, {{for instance in}} Shared Service Centers or by using in- or outsourcing. What is the right spot and way for finding the organization split? And on what subjects should organizations agree to cooperate effectively across the organization split? To find managerial handles for this problem, we applied action research to four large real-life case-studies in which ontology and architecture were used. This resulted in an instrument for supporting organization splitting, allying and post-merger integration, consisting of (1) organization construction rules, (2) algorithms for calculating a plausible organization splitting proposal, (3) a method for finding subjects for <b>contracting</b> <b>split</b> organizations, and (4) a real-life tested combination of all this in a way of working with (5) a known Return On Modeling Effort (ROME).

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major {{political}} offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government <b>contracts</b> <b>split</b> commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an important class of derivative contracts written on multiple assets which are traded {{on a wide}} range of financial markets. More specifically, we are interested in developing novel methods for pricing financial derivatives using approximation theoretic methods which are not well-known to the financial engineering community. The problem of pricing of such <b>contracts</b> <b>splits</b> into two parts. First, we need to approximate the respective density function which depends on the adapted jump-diffusion model. Second, we need to construct a sequence of approximation formulas for the price. These two parts are connected with the problem of optimal approximation of infinitely differentiable, analytic or entire functions on noncompact domains. We develop new methods of recovery of density functions using sk-splines (in particular, radial basis functions), Wiener spaces and complex exponents with frequencies from special domains. The respective lower bounds obtained show that the methods developed have almost optimal rate of convergence in the sense of n-widths. On the basis of results obtained we develop a new theory of pricing of basket options under Lévy processess. In particular, we introduce and study a class of stochastic systems to model multidimensional return process, construct a sequence of approximation formulas for the price and establish the respective rates of convergence...|$|R
