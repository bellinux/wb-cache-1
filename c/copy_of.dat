30|$|From Figure  9, {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> all {{algorithms}} is increasing {{with the passage}} of time, but for Epidemic algorithm, its <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> message spread the fastest, presenting exponential growth. For Spray and Wait algorithm and Spray and Focus algorithm, they have the limit for the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> message in the network. With the number <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> message growing to a certain stage, the value will be a constant. For DTSNS routing protocol, its number <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> message is controlled by the delay constraints to self adapt to have the smallest number <b>of</b> <b>copies.</b> More <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> message consume more network resource seriously. This is because the <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> message take up the node cache and need a large amount of energy and network bandwidth at the forwarding process. For DTSN which has limited network resource, the overhead is unbearable. So, though Epidemic algorithm has good performance, it is rarely used in practical application.|$|R
