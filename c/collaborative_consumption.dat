But, it has regained a new impetus through information technologies, especially Web 2.0, mobile technology and social media. <b>Collaborative</b> <b>consumption</b> stands in sharp contrast with the notion of conventional consumption.

Sharing traditionally owned objects such as cars has certainly affected the consumer-­‐possessions relationship. This paper shows the role of design in both identity and brand community building, in the context of carsharing. The carsharing system Autolib in Paris is the research field of this paper. Data from the interviews is analysed through a grounded theory method. Consistent, homogenous and peculiar car design helps a personal appropriation of a shared car by its users. In addition some design elements contribute to brand community development, mostly by creating shared rituals...|$|R

Using a metatheory approach, this paper illustrates the developed framework that explores these two major Internet-supported consumption modes (utility-based non-ownership and redistributed ownership) manifest in an apparel context using real industry examples, and then explore the implications of each consumption mode and business model for the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with the product, peers, and organizations involved in these sharing schemes. This exploration highlights key factors that should be scrutinized for evaluating the potential sustainability of <b>collaborative</b> clothing <b>consumption.</b> These factors and related attributes relevant to each relationship are identified via a systematic content analysis of the literature. Finally, this paper will conclude with a series of research propositions for future research, which beg investigation...|$|R

Story-telling combines semantic knowledge and episodic knowledge by explicit problem solving strategies. In order to facilitate entrepreneurial knowledge sharing authoring environments based on multimedia repositories as well as advanced story players are needed.

30|$|Consumers who are empowered, {{networked}} {{and engaged}} in digital environments create, share, and demand a smart experience which capitalizes on their social structure, relationships, and knowledge. Smart consumers engage in digital environments not only for information seeking and sharing but also for receiving a sense of belongingness, finding connections and building social networks (Andrews, 2002; Zhang and Hiltz, 2003). Recently, social shopping {{was identified as a}} new model of e-commerce (Lee and Lee, 2012) based on this <b>collaborative</b> virtual <b>consumption</b> phenomenon. With an expanded number of social media sites and increased social-media adoption, global social commerce revenue is projected to be 20 billion U.S. dollars in 2014 and grow to 30 billion U.S. dollars by 2015 (Statista.com, 2014). Social commerce interface is enabled by smart technologies such as GPS, interactive tools, and in-store technology along with applications such as pinning, personalized searching apps, and mobile wallet. In 2013, the annual growth rate of subscribers compared to 2012 was estimated to be 44 % for smartphones and 125 % for tablets (ABI Research, 2013).

40|$|More TV! – Support {{for local}} and <b>collaborative</b> {{production}} and <b>consumption</b> of mobile TV New mobile phones come with basic video editing facilities. Given a constantly evolving technology, {{it is possible}} to envision new mobile devices with more elaborated video editing applications. We suggest that mobile video editing could be informed by collaborative professional TV-production functionalities. It would then allow functionalities supporting collaborative recording of various camera angles and real time editing. It would enable production of content covering distributed events and situations, and almost synchronous production and consumption. We argue that such applications would be useful e. g. for sport spectators who struggle with experiencing distributed events such as car rally racing or bicycle racing. Already, mobile technologies are massively used to capture and share multimedia content of both video and photography during such events, which indicates an interest for new applications in the area. Furthermore, new applications would provide more support to an emerging form of community life where people interact both on the internet, and also meet physically, like in more traditional social life. 1...|$|R

However, the role of values has been little considered in relation to the development and diffusion of grassroots innovations. We develop a conceptual model of how citizens' values are mobilised by grassroots innovations, drawing on the value theory of Schwartz et al. (2012) and the theory of collective enactment of values of Chen et al. (2013). Using the results of a large scale survey of free reuse groups (e. g.

We show that while the majority of free reuse group participants do hold significantly stronger self-transcendence (i. e. pro-social) values than the wider UK population, they also hold other values in common with that population and a minority actually place less emphasis on self-transcendence values. We conclude that diffusion of this particular grassroots innovation is unlikely to be simply value limited and that structural features may be more significant...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} social {{reading and writing}} {{platform}} Wattpad as a site of <b>collaborative</b> production and <b>consumption.</b> I consider Wattpad as a community of readers and writers engaging {{in a process of}} creative dialogue and collaborative production of a shared commons and also as a transactional marketplace in which these readers and writers engage in the creation and circulation of value and exchange of services. I then go on to examine the various ways in which Wattpad, as both community and marketplace, articulates with the world of traditional publishing and the wider field of commerce: providing a launch pad for fledgling writers, an audience development opportunity for established writers and a marketing service for brands. Having considered these aspects, I argue that Wattpad’s fan community represents an emerging economic force and model within publishing. Furthermore, drawing on the work of Berlant and Arvidsson, I consider the extent to which this community might have the potential to function as a ‘productive consumer public’ and to exercise social and political as well as economic influence...|$|R
40|$|In <b>Collaborative</b> Media: Production, <b>Consumption</b> and Design Interventions, Jonas Löwgren and Bo Reimer seek {{to expose}} the {{inadequacy}} of terms such as ‘digital media’, ‘social media’ and ‘new media’. These terms do not, according to the authors, capture the qualities or characteristics of everyday media practices. This is so particularly given the recent technological developments in new media that have allowed users not only to consume but also to produce and even design media. To denote a new cultural form that has emerged, they propose instead the term ‘collaborative media’, a term they believe better reflects the action-oriented component of media and, perhaps more precisely, the recent practices made possible by new media – that is, ‘collaborative, mediated practice’ (p. 15). The authors’ proposal draws on several schools of thought. These include cultural theory, which is mined specifically for conceptions of mass communication processes (those of Stuart Hall), and actor–network theory, which is brought in for its proposal to consider both humans and nonhumans {{in the analysis of}} social action (referencing the work of Bruno Latour).
