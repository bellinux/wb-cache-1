40|$|International audienceOnline <b>configurators</b> are {{basically}} everywhere. From physical goods (cars, clothes) to services (cloud solutions, insurances, etc.) such <b>configurators</b> have pervaded {{many areas of}} everyday life, {{in order to provide}} the customers products tailored to their needs. Being sometimes the only interfaces between product suppliers and consumers, much care has been devoted to the HCI aspects of <b>configurators,</b> aiming at offering an enjoyable buying experience. However, at the backend, the management of numerous and complex configuration options results from ad-hoc process rather than a systematic variability-aware engineering approach. We present our experience in analysing web <b>configurators</b> and formalising configuration options in terms of feature models or product configuration matrices. We also consider behavioural issues and perspectives on their architectural design...|$|R

Product and process <b>configurators,</b> commonly used in mass customization processes, have to be adjusted according to ETO product and process requirements for their successful application in an ETO environment. In this paper the organizational requirements for a successful adaption of <b>configurators</b> to ETO processes are identified and structured. A Business Process Matrix capable of categorizing the implications of using product and process <b>configurators</b> in an ETO environment is developed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceProduct {{comparators}} and <b>configurators</b> aim {{to assist}} customers {{in choosing a}} product that meets their expectations. While comparators present {{similarities and differences between}} competing products, <b>configurators</b> propose an assisted environment to gradually choose and customize products. The two systems have pros and cons and are inherently different. But both share the same variability information background and operate over a set of (possible) products, typically represented through product comparison matrices (PCMs). A key issue is that current PCMs have no clear semantics, making their analysis and transformations imprecise and hard. In this paper, we sketch a research plan for generating dedicated comparators or <b>configurators</b> from PCMs. The core of our vision is the use of formal variability models to encode PCMs and enables a further exploitation by developers of comparators or <b>configurators.</b> We elaborate on five research questions and describe the expected outputs of the research...|$|R
