5000|$|<b>Cohort</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{a subset}} of {{behavioral}} analytics that takes the data from a given dataset (e.g. an eCommerce platform, web application, or online game) and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span. <b>Cohort</b> <b>analysis</b> allows a company to “see patterns clearly across the life-cycle of a customer (or user), rather than slicing across all customers blindly without accounting for the natural cycle that a customer undergoes.” [...] By seeing these patterns of time, a company can adapt and tailor its service to those specific cohorts. While <b>cohort</b> <b>analysis</b> is sometimes associated with a cohort study, they are different {{and should not be}} viewed as one and the same. <b>Cohort</b> <b>analysis</b> is specifically the analysis of cohorts in regards to big data and business analytics, while in cohort study, data is broken down into similar groups.|$|E

40|$|Utilizing {{data from}} the 1967 - 2009 years of the March Current Population Surveys, we examine two {{important}} resources for children’s well-being: time and money. We document trends in parental employment, {{from the perspective of}} children, and show what underlies these trends. We find that increases in family work hours mainly reflect movements into jobs by parents who, in prior decades, would have remained at home. This increase in market work has raised incomes for children in the typical two-parent family but not for those in lone-parent households. Time use data from 1975 and 2003 - 2008 reveal that working parents spend less time engaged in primary childcare than their counterparts without jobs but more than employed peers in previous <b>cohorts.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of 2004 work schedule data suggests that non-daytime work provides an alternative method of coordinating employment schedules for some dual-earner families. ...|$|R

With these two cohorts determined, and the analysis run, the gaming company would be presented with a visual representation of the data specific to the two cohorts. It could then see that a slight lag in load times has been translating into a significant loss of revenue from advanced gamers, while new sign-ups have not even noticed the lag.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of firstly, {{a study of}} the local genetic dynamics occurring in a native population of Eucalyptus globulus, and secondly, an examination of genetic diversity within the Australian E. globulus breeding population. Fine scale spatial genetic structure within a continuous E. globulus forest on the Tinderbox Hills, Tasmania, was examined by genotyping mature trees (n = 168) and juveniles (n = 110) in a 140 m diameter sample site, using microsatellite markers. Spatial genetic autocorrelation revealed a significant decline in genetic similarity with distance between individuals, with the mature cohort displaying greater spatial genetic structure than the juvenile <b>cohort.</b> High-resolution <b>analysis,</b> using a combination of Bayesian clustering, ordination and spatial interpolation, revealed a complex pattern of genetic groups superimposed upon each other.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{the effect of}} military training, veteran status, and military experience on the post-service earnings growth rates of veterans. The National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men, years 1971 to 1981, {{was used as the}} source of data. Two similar earnings growth rate models were estimated: The first used veteran status as an explanatory variable, and the second equation substituted changes in military experience for veteran status. Veterans were found to have higher earnings growth rates compared with their non-veteran cohorts. Results of the effects on earnings growth rates from both increases in military experience and general types of transferable military training were insignificant and thus were inconclusive. Blacks suffered economic disadvantages, as their earnings growth rates were less than their non black <b>cohorts.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of a disaggregated sample consisting only of blacks indicated that black veterans no longer receive significant economic advantages over black nonveterans. The earnings growth differences between black veterans and black non-veterans were not significant. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

However, there are few predictive-modeling studies on resting state, and processing pipelines all vary. Here, we systematically study resting state functional-connectivity (FC) -based prediction across three different <b>cohorts.</b> <b>Analysis</b> pipelines consist of four steps: Delineation of brain regions of interest (ROIs), ROI-level rs-fMRI time series signal extraction, FC estimation and linear model classification analysis of FC features. For each step, we explore various methodological choices: ROI set selection, FC metrics, and linear classifiers to compare and evaluate the dominant strategies {{for the sake of}} prediction accuracy. We achieve good prediction results on the three different targets. With regard to pipeline selection, we obtain consistent results in two pipeline steps –FC metrics and linear classifiers– that are vital in the diagnosis of rs-fMRI based disease biomarkers. Regarding brain ROIs selection, we observe that the effects of different diseases are best characterized by different strategies: Schizophrenia discrimination is best performed in dataset-specific ROIs, which is not clearly the case for other pathologies. Overall, we outline some dominant strategies, in spite of the specificity of each brain disease in term of FC pattern disruption...|$|R
