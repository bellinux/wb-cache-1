ECTunes' system {{connects to the}} car, and reads speed and acceleration, shutting down when the car reaches <b>Cross-over</b> <b>speed</b> as set by existing regulation as well as regulation under development such as Quiet Road Transport Vehicles (QRTV), {{at which point the}} tires and wind are making noise of their own.

The calculations are done in the random phase approximation (RPA) limit using the powerful non-chiral bosonization technique (NCBT) which is nothing but the resummation of the most singular parts of the RPA terms of the Green function expanded out in powers of the forward scattering between fermions with the source of inhomogeneities treated exactly. The force acting on the heavy particle(s) is studied as a function of its terminal velocity, both in the linear and non-linear regime. Linear mobility (which is valid for impurities moving much slower than a certain <b>cross-over</b> <b>speed)</b> has a power-law temperature dependence whose exponent has a closed algebraic expression in terms of the various parameters in the problem. This expression interpolates between the ballistic regime of no-coupling with the fermions and the no-tunneling regime. When the speed of the impurity is much larger than this <b>cross-over</b> <b>speed,</b> the applied force depends nonlinearly on the speed and this too is a power-law with a closely related exponent. The case of two mobile impurities is also studied whose mobility exhibits peculiar resonances when their mutual separation is appropriately chosen. Comment: 8 pages, 7 Figure...|$|E
