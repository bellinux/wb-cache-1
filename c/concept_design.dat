5|$|Saadiyat Island's Cultural District {{plans to}} house the largest single cluster of {{world-class}} cultural assets. In addition to the Louvre Abu Dhabi these are intended to include: Zayed National Museum, to be designed by United Kingdom-based architectural company Foster and Partners {{under the direction of}} Lord Norman Foster; the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi contemporary arts museum – the world's largest Guggenheim and the only museum to be located in the Middle East; a performing arts centre designed by Zaha Hadid; a maritime museum with <b>concept</b> <b>design</b> by Tadao Ando and a number of arts pavilions.|$|E
5|$|Still unfinished, {{the vehicle}} was entered in an SPL {{competition}} in 1997 {{at which a}} complaint was lodged against the computer control of the DC motor. Instead of using the controller, two leads were touched together {{in the hope that}} the motor speed was set correctly. The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162dB. The <b>Concept</b> <b>Design</b> 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the June 8 agreement, D.C. United was {{required}} to submit a <b>concept</b> <b>design</b> for the stadium to the city by September 1, 2015. The District of Columbia faced a deadline for September 30, 2015, to use eminent domain to acquire the Akridge land, which forces the club to commit to building a stadium before the city finished purchasing land. On September 30, the District of Columbia filed for eminent domain for the Akridge parcel.|$|E

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{developed}} a method/computer tool to assist (student) engineering designers in generating <b>concept</b> <b>designs.</b> The method {{is based on the}} chaining of physical laws and complementary basic schemata (BS). The tool generates chains which serve as an aid in the development of <b>concept</b> <b>designs.</b> In this paper, the authors compare <b>concept</b> <b>designs</b> generated by a control group (which used functional structure and morphological matrix) with those from an experimental group that used computer-generated chains. The experimental group was found to have generated a greater number of different solutions than the control group; the generation of different solutions indicates a high level of variety and a better chance to find potentially innovative solutions. The established difference in the number of different solutions is statistically significant and the results indicate that the BS facilitate greater variety of <b>concept</b> <b>designs...</b>|$|R

5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as the design team {{wanted to create a}} world that felt {{believable}} for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early <b>concept</b> <b>design</b> was found to be too extreme. As a result, the design team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The design team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The design team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The design team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far Cry and Crysis. As the design team felt that Far Cry and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed.|$|E
5|$|Maverick Hunter was in {{development}} by Armature Studio and {{was to be}} published by Capcom for the Mega Man X series. The collaboration was established by Keiji Inafune, who had previously worked on the Mega Man series as an artist and producer. He had since rose in the ranks at Capcom to become a producer. The goal was to attract a new audience to the Mega Man series. Its development would have been overseen by former Capcom producer Ben Judd. The redesign for the Mega Man character was to be done by Adi Granov (the concept artist responsible for the Iron Man redesign found in the 2008 film of the same name). An initial <b>concept</b> <b>design</b> showed X with a red glowing 'X' on his face.|$|E

25|$|Cessna had {{announced}} its intentions {{to study the}} feasibility of developing and producing an LSA on 6 June 2006. The <b>concept</b> <b>design</b> was unveiled on 24 July 2006 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh as the Cessna LSA (also {{referred to as the}} Cessna Sport), via a marketing study of the feasibility of producing an aircraft compliant with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's new Light-Sport Aircraft category.|$|E

25|$|From 1978 {{until his}} death, Chapman was {{involved}} with the American tycoon, John DeLorean, in his development of a stainless steel sports car, {{to be built in}} a factory in Northern Ireland which was majority-funded by the British government. The original <b>concept</b> <b>design</b> was for a mid-engine sports car, however difficulty in securing the original Wankel engine rights and design complications led to the rear-engine mount design.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Crupi, Pradhan and Tozer {{described}} a proof of <b>concept</b> <b>design</b> to create neural synaptic memory circuits using organic ion-based memristors. The synapse circuit demonstrated long-term potentiation for learning {{as well as}} inactivity based forgetting. Using a grid of circuits, a pattern of light was stored and later recalled. This mimics {{the behavior of the}} V1 neurons in the primary visual cortex that act as spatiotemporal filters that process visual signals such as edges and moving lines.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{development}} {{began on}} the XU30 platform under chief engineer Yukihiro Okane. Design work was started under Makoto Oshima and would continue into 2000 when a <b>concept</b> <b>design</b> by Hiroshi Suzuki was approved. By early 2001, the final production design was green-lighted by the executive board, with the first prototypes being tested in 2002. Design patents were filed on 1 April 2002 under No. 794 at the Japanese Patent Office and on 21 April 2003 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.|$|E

Instead of 78lb (35.5kg) of fuel, it has 277 pounds (126kg) of LiPo cells, however the water cooled electric motor weighs 11kg; {{much less than the}} gasoline engine. It has a useful load of 380lb, whereas a Cessna 152 has between 350-480lb useful load.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of his owner Mr. Wing, the mogwai Gizmo becomes the guinea pig of {{scientists}} at Clamp Enterprises, a state-of-the-art office building in Manhattan, run by eccentric billionaire Daniel Clamp. At the mercy of the chief researcher Dr. Catheter, Gizmo is rescued by his friend Billy Peltzer and his fiancée Kate, both of whom work for the company. Clamp befriends Billy upon being impressed by his skills in <b>concept</b> <b>design,</b> also sparking the interest of Billy's superior Marla Bloodstone. Gizmo is left in the office, where water spills on his head and spawns four new mogwai (George, Lenny, Mohawk and Daffy) who then lock Gizmo in the vents. They eat after midnight, turning into gremlins.|$|E
25|$|Winnipeg's main airport {{terminal}} {{was designed by}} Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects and Stantec.

The terminal was constructed in two phases, with construction beginning in 2007 and ending on October 30, 2011 when it was officially opened to the public. Prior to the opening of the current main terminal building, a multi-level access road and four-level, 1,559 stall parkade were both opened in November 2006.
