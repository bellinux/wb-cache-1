In February 1970, Kamanin {{estimated}} first Almaz (Chelomei) or DOS-7K (Mishin) {{to be ready}} in summer 1971, at best. Selection of cosmonauts for the first orbital station, again, became a tug of war between Mishin and Kamanin, while the Air Force continued recruitment of new military pilots like Vladimir Dzhanibekov. 19 May - 19 June, Kamanin conducted the usual flight preparation and flight <b>control</b> <b>sequence</b> of Soyuz 9; health problems of cosmonauts returning from an 18-day mission caused a major redesign of future flight programs and another clash with Mishin (Mishin insisted on 30-days flights, Kamanin set {{for no more than}} 24 days).|$|E

50|$|Initiation: the {{construction}} of the polymerase complex on the promoter.Pol III is unusual (compared to Pol II) by requiring no <b>control</b> <b>sequences</b> upstream of the gene, instead normally relying on internal <b>control</b> <b>sequences</b> - sequences within the transcribed section of the gene (although upstream sequences are occasionally seen, e.g. U6 snRNA gene has an upstream TATA box as seen in Pol II Promoters).|$|R
5000|$|However, {{most of the}} {{sequences}} {{are more}} than two characters and start with the characters [...] and [...] (left bracket / 0x5B). On 8-bit-capable systems {{there is a single}} character 155 / 0x9B / 0233 as well, still the [...] two-character sequence is more often used than the single-character alternative (for details see C0 and C1 control codes). This sequence is called CSI for <b>Control</b> <b>Sequence</b> Introducer (or <b>Control</b> <b>Sequence</b> Initiator). The final character of these sequences is in the range ASCII 64 to 126 ( [...] to [...] / hex 0x40 to 0x7E). Sequences that begin with the escape character are named escape sequences. Sequences beginning with the CSI are named control sequences. A sequence may be both an escape sequence and a <b>control</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
