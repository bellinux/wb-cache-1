5000|$|Butler {{was also}} known for his {{involvement}} in the civil rights movement. As a 35-year-old city attorney in 1955, Butler became the first vice president of the Compton NAACP. According to unofficial Compton NAACP historian Maxcy Filer, [...] "The City Council even asked Jim Butler, 'What <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> this NAACP?' Jim said, 'You accept it .... In fact, here's my membership card.' They all kind of kept quiet for about five minutes." [...] In retaliation for Butler's involvement with the NAACP, the City Council attempted a recall effort, which narrowly failed. Butler remained involved with the Compton NAACP until 1958, when moved to the Hancock Park neighborhood, to a home originally built for Bernard Baruch. Butler lived in the home until he died in 2005.|$|E
