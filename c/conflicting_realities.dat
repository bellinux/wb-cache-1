Emma asks why he does not simply reach out to her, but he says that he is not cruel enough to destroy Grace's reality and inflict on her the same awareness he has. He explains that it is hard enough to live in a land where you do not belong, but knowing it, holding <b>conflicting</b> <b>realities</b> in your head will drive anybody mad. He wants to take her home to the world where he and Grace once lived {{so that they can be}} together and she can remember who he is. Emma tells him that she knows what it is like to be separated from a child and tells him that it feels like going crazy. He tells her that he is not crazy. Emma says that if he is right, Mary Margaret is her mother and states that she would like to believe that more than anything in the world. She agrees to try and believe in magic and make his hat work. However, when his back is turned, she hits him with the telescope and frees Mary Margaret. Jefferson catches up to Emma and attacks her. While they are fighting, Emma notices a scar around his neck. Mary Margaret hits him with a croquet mallet and kicks him out the window. When Mary Margaret and Emma look down, only the hat Emma made remains.Emma finds her car and her keys outside. Mary Margaret expects to be taken back to prison, but Emma allows her to decide. When Mary Margaret does not understand, Emma explains that Mary Margaret is the only family Emma has and says that it would be better to face the trial together rather than alone.

The theoretical basis of the study involves the concept of personal professional growth with the emphasis on the students’ self-determination in the conflict situations. The research methodology combines the diagnostics of professional self-determination and socio-metric methods.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} true 'systemic' {{epistemology}} should reveal multiple perspectives, <b>conflicting</b> <b>realities</b> {{and various other}} contexts due to its inherent pluralistic nature. Therefore, generalization in systems research occurs not across one linear conceptual framework but across the variety of nonlinear, conflicting, dialectal 'realities'.

The paper presents the hallmarks of a systemic epistemology. Using an example {{the nature of a}} systems epistemology is demonstrated and explained.

40|$|This article explores {{narratives}} that university students in Germany and Japan tell about World War II.

However, {{little is known about}} how far these official versions of history are reproduced or challenged by university students. Working with data collected through an online survey, our findings address this question by making two arguments: first, the depth of World War II knowledge and the variety of knowledge sources students were exposed to affect whether students engage in a reflective or non-reflective characterization of their home countries’ role. This appears to be primarily influenced by the national knowledge environment students find themselves in. Second, while students surveyed tended to reproduce official narratives, both Japanese and German students also displayed critical engagement with World War II history teaching and knowledge in their countries...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding how Electronic Patient Record systems (EPRs) are being problematised and enacted in NHS acute hospital Trusts following {{the dismantling of the}} National Programme for IT (NPfIT). The term EPR is widely used but has no uniform definition and has been applied {{to a wide range of}} systems. In policy, EPRs have often been envisaged as integrated, large-scale systems capable of transforming how healthcare is delivered. However, in practice such systems have proved difficult to achieve and many of the EPRs to be found in hospitals are much smaller standalone specialist departmental systems. Working with Actor-Network Theory (ANT), this thesis takes a sociotechnical approach in which differences in EPRs are understood as matters of ontology (variations in their enactment by multiple heterogeneous actors producing multiple, sometimes <b>conflicting,</b> <b>realities)</b> rather than matters of epistemology (differences in the interpretation of a single underlying reality) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis enlarges {{upon the}} theme of post-communist nostalgia in {{contemporary}} Romania, and analyzes {{the effects of a}} former socialist dictatorship as depicted in two of Dan Lungu's novels. The books "I am a Communist Biddy!" and "Hen's Heaven.

Thus, nostalgia can only be regarded as the result of two <b>conflicting</b> <b>realities.</b> Romanian writer Dan Lungu proves to have a lot to offer for those interested in social realism and should be granted more attention as the scholarship that addresses the issue of a melancholic post-communist society could still benefit from more extensive research...|$|E
40|$|Community energy {{projects}} are attracting increasing attention as {{potential sources of}} innovation to support sustainable energy transitions. Research into ‘grassroots innovations’ like community energy often recognises the difficulties they face in simply surviving let alone in growing or seeding wider change. Strategic niche management theory is potentially helpful here as it highlights the important roles played by ‘intermediary actors’ in consolidating, growing and diffusing novel innovations. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of intermediary work in the UK community energy sector. New empirical evidence was gathered through interviews with 15 community energy intermediaries and a content analysis of 113 intermediary-produced case studies about community energy projects. Analysis finds intermediaries adopting {{a variety of methods}} to try and diffuse generic lessons about context-specific projects, but that trying to coordinate support for local projects that exist amidst very different social and political circumstances is challenging. This is exacerbated by the challenges of building a coherent institutional infrastructure for a sector where aims and approaches diverge, and where underlying resources are uncertain and inconsistent. Applications of relatively simple, growth-oriented approaches like strategic niche management to grassroots innovations need to be reformulated to better recognise their diverse and <b>conflicted</b> <b>realities</b> on the ground.

40|$|The {{economic}} dimension of conflicts has enjoyed increasing attention in research {{dealing with the}} dynamics of contemporary conflict. The nexus between natural resources, economics and conflict has played a defining role {{in a number of}} Africa’s most intractable conflicts during the 1990 s and early 2000 s. The underlying assumption {{of this study is that}} the {{economic dimension}} of conflict can be hugely informative in terms of an understanding as to why peace agreements fail and in that sense can contribute to the resolution of conflicts if taken into account during the formulation of peace agreements. This study explores the ways in which conflict theory has dealt with the conflict-economics nexus, analyzing the extent to which theory illuminates the <b>conflict</b> <b>reality</b> in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) during the period August 1998 to August 2004. It determines to what degree peace agreements in the DRC have taken the economic dimension and insights gained from the academic exploration of this topic into account during the negotiation and formulation of these agreements. In conclusion the study proposes a number of recommendations in terms of the peace process in the DRC with possible wider application for other peace agreements.

40|$|Women’s {{magazines}} are often filled with beauty tips, romantic advice, and weight-loss tricks to look {{better in a}} bikini. This stereotypical women’s magazine rhetoric is familiar, but what does all of this {{mean in terms of}} a feministic perspective? This thesis aims to conduct a qualitative, case-study analysis of the Norwegian women’s magazine Stella from a feministic perspective, examining the question of how women and femininity are portrayed in the magazine, analyzed against the backdrop of Naomi Wolf’s book The Beauty Myth (2002) – a book that has been highly influential {{in the development of the}} third-wave feminism movement. In this way, my examination places focus on the portrayal of women in this medium rather than on readers’ reception of its content, and seeks to determine to what degree the content of Stella does or does not promote and uphold the beauty myth ideals. My study finds that Stella’s editorial content does not promote the ideals of the beauty myth, and that in many cases, this editorial content even works to fight against such ideals. There is, however, a contradiction found in the juxtaposition of Stella’s editorial content and Stella’s advertisements, which do reflect the beauty myth’s ideals. Thus, this works to show a positive example of feministic portrayals within this medium, but also serves to illustrate the <b>conflicted</b> <b>reality</b> that women’s magazines today face...|$|R

40|$|This article employs event-history {{analysis}} of couple-level data from two {{waves of the}} Na-tional Survey of Families and Households {{to examine the effects}} of spouses ’ perceptions of shared time and marital quality and stability on subsequent odds of marital dissolution. Of central importance in the analysis is the role that gender plays, because empirical evidence documents significant gender variation in spouses ’ expectations, perceptions, and experi-ence of marriage. When husbands provide the more negative evaluations of marital quality, the couple are more likely to dissolve their marriage; but when more concrete, proximate measures of marital stability are considered, wives ’ more negative reports are better predic-tors of subsequent divorce. The analysis provides a contribution to divorce research by mod-eling the effects of couple-level, social-psychological dynamics and by highlighting the im-portance of recognizing the multiple, often <b>conflicting</b> <b>realities</b> of the emotional content of marriage...|$|E
