6000|$|... [60] I {{am always}} afraid {{to use this}} word [...] "Composition;" [...] it is so [...] utterly misused in the general parlance {{respecting}} art. Nothing is [...] more common than to hear divisions of art into [...] "form, composition, [...] and color," [...] or [...] "light and shade and composition," [...] or [...] "sentiment and [...] composition," [...] or it matters not what else and composition; the [...] speakers in each case attaching a perfectly different meaning to the [...] word, generally an indistinct one, and always a wrong one. [...] Composition is, in plain English, [...] "putting together," [...] and it means [...] the putting together of lines, of forms, of colors, of shades, or of [...] ideas. Painters <b>compose</b> <b>in</b> color, <b>compose</b> <b>in</b> thought, <b>compose</b> <b>in</b> [...] form, and <b>compose</b> <b>in</b> effect: the word being of use merely in order [...] to express a scientific, disciplined, and inventive arrangement of [...] any of these, instead of a merely natural or accidental one.|$|R
