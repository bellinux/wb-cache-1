500|$|At {{the tower}} a {{temporary}} eyebolt was screwed into the [...] capsule, and a <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> {{was used to}} lower the capsule into the gadget. As the capsule entered {{the hole in the}} uranium tamper, it stuck. Robert Bacher realized that the heat from the plutonium core had caused the capsule to expand, while the explosives assembly with the tamper had cooled during the night in the desert. By leaving the capsule in contact with the tamper, the temperatures equalized and in a few minutes the capsule had slipped completely into the tamper. The eyebolt was then removed from the capsule and replaced with a threaded uranium plug, a boron disk was placed on top of the capsule, an aluminum plug was screwed into the hole in the pusher, and the two remaining high explosive lenses were installed. Finally, the upper Dural polar cap was bolted into place. Assembly was completed at about 16:45 on July 13.|$|E
50|$|For a given {{rated load}} wire rope is lighter in weight {{per unit length}} but overall length {{is limited by the}} drum {{diameter}} that the cable must be wound onto. The lift chain of a <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> is far larger than the liftwheel over which chain may function. Therefore, a high-performance <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> may be of significantly smaller physical size than a wire rope hoist rated at the same working load.|$|E

50|$|A rigger is {{a person}} who specializes in the lifting and moving of {{extremely}} large or heavy objects, often with the assistance of a crane or derrick or <b>chain</b> <b>hoists.</b>|$|R
50|$|Steam shovels {{became more}} {{popular in the}} latter half of the nineteenth century. Originally {{configured}} with <b>chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> the advent of steel cable in the 1870s allowed for easier rigging to the winches.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> more {{commonly}} referred to as chain motors, are {{the most common form of}} point hoist, especially with touring musical shows (e.g., rock-and-roll shows), but are relatively slow. Chain motors can be mounted at the grid to hoist a load from above, or mounted at the load to [...] "climb" [...] towards the grid.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2013 Konecranes got {{the famous}} Red Dot award, [...] "Product design 2013", {{for the design}} quality of Konecranes’ multibranded {{electric}} <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> series launched a year before. The winning product series included identities for the Konecranes brand and its brands like Verlinde, SWF, R&M, and STAHL CraneSystems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{unloaded}} {{wire rope}} of small hand-powered hoists often exhibits a snarled [...] "set", making {{the use of}} a <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> in this application less frustrating, but heavier. In addition, if the wire in a wire hoist fails, it can whip and cause injury, while a chain will simply break.|$|E
50|$|Common small {{portable}} hoists are of {{two main}} types, the <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> or chain block and the wire rope or cable type. Chain hoists {{may have a}} lever to actuate the hoist or have a loop of operating chain that one pulls through the block (known traditionally as a chain fall) which then activates the block {{to take up the}} main lifting chain.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} other {{strategies}} {{to design a}} motion profile, e.g. minimizing {{the square of the}} jerk for a given transition time, to be selected according to the varying applications in machines, people movers, <b>chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> automotive industries, robot design, and many more. For a sinusoidal-shaped acceleration profile, with sinusoidal-shaped speed and bounded jerk also, see above.|$|R

The business area offers products like industrial cranes, wire rope and <b>chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> crane components, workstation lifting systems, manual hoists, and medium to heavy forklifts.|$|R
50|$|Riggers attach {{loads of}} {{equipment}} to cranes or structures using shackles, cables, chains, clamps or straps, employing pulleys, winches, lifts or <b>chain</b> <b>hoists</b> (aka <b>chain</b> motors). Quick load calculations {{are necessary for}} each load and engineering principles are always in play. Riggers use various suspension techniques to get their load around obstacles on a construction site or loading dock or event site to the desired location and height.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} welded steel tubing with duralumin formers, and a semi-monocoque duralumin nose section. The wings were stressed-skin metal structure on the inboard panels and fabric-covered wood beams and duralumin ribs on the outboard panels. The fuselage had {{room for two}} crew and up to ten passengers. Large doors and a roof-mounted <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> were fitted {{for use in the}} cargo role.|$|E
50|$|The M125 succeeded the Mack NO as a {{heavy cargo}} {{transport}} vehicle; it {{also served as}} a prime mover towing the 155‑mm gun and 8‑in. howitzer. The chassis was designated M121. It had a 14 ft steel cargo body with folding troop seats, bows and canvas cover. A single front-mounted Gar Wood DSA716 45,000 lb capacity winch was fitted, and a <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> at rear for handling ammunition.|$|E

50|$|Point hoists using {{wire rope}} (GAC) are common, and steel band point hoists are also used. While {{generally}} {{more expensive than}} <b>chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> wire rope and steel band point hoists can operate at relatively high speeds. Wire rope spot line winches may be configured to pay {{out to the side}} (horizontally), for use in conjunction with a loft block, so that the position of the relatively heavy winch can be static and only the loft block need be spotted above the pick point.|$|R
5|$|Working for Clair Brothers, Jackson toured with Elvis Presley, mixing {{monitors}} while independent engineer Bill Porter mixed {{front of}} house (FOH) for the audience. Clair Brothers supplied all the audio gear; Jackson designed a powerful stage monitor system for Presley's show. To make {{more room for}} audience seating, he also used a sound reinforcement system that was not mounted on scaffolding but hung with steel chain above the audience from overhead beams, using <b>chain</b> <b>hoists</b> rigged upside down to raise the loudspeakers from the floor—a now-common method used by licensed riggers.

50|$|Workstation {{gantry cranes}} {{are used to}} lift and {{transport}} smaller items around a working area in a factory or machine shop. Some workstation gantry cranes are equipped with an enclosed track, while others use an I-beam, or other extruded shapes, for the running surface. Most workstation gantry cranes are intended to be stationary when loaded, and mobile when unloaded. Workstation Gantry Cranes can be outfitted with either a wire rope hoist or a lower capacity <b>chain</b> <b>hoist.</b>|$|E
50|$|The grid deck, {{gridiron}} deck, or grid, is a permeable {{working surface}} {{present at the}} top of many fly lofts that is used to support and provide access to many of a rigging system's components. Though originally constructed of wood, down-facing three-inch steel channels with three-inch gaps became the prevalent grid decking in the 20th century. Today, large-opening heavy-duty steel bar grating is most common in new theatres. The grid deck surface is usually rated to support live loads as well as all anticipated dead-hung equipment and hemp and motorized (e.g., <b>chain</b> <b>hoist)</b> spot rigging. Its permeability facilitates the mounting of equipment and the passing of lift lines and electrical cables. Spot rigging is not feasible without a grid.|$|E
50|$|King Sigismund granted land {{ownership}} and rights erecting the castle to dubded Polish Crown Hetman, Jan Tarnowski. Concurrently {{in the valley}} of Seret river a levee and dam with a bridge crossing were constructed, resulting in the stream pooling, thus filling a new lake. Out from the north the castle and the city was protected by the Rudka river harboring a boggy holm, while on the southern side would be Bavorovsky pond which vanished in a later time. A narrow, dry strip of land factually being a moat banked by a mound with inside masonry reinforced with an oak stockade would set the castle ground apart. Rectangular-shaped towers housing embrasures stood tall on the outer fringes. The entrance was permitted from the east via stone gatehouse secured with a <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> drawbridge.|$|E

50|$|Many theatres {{also use}} Edison plugs, {{which are the}} {{standard}} connector used in homes and businesses in North America, because of their availability {{and the ability to}} connect household fixtures to a theatrical control system. Twist-lock connectors are used in many theatres because of their locking feature, which will not allow fixtures to become accidentally disconnected. Connectors used to power lighting fixtures must be rated at 20 amperes or higher, depending on local electrical codes. Temporary high-power distribution wiring often employs camlock connectors to connect dimming equipment, power distribution units, controllers for motorized <b>chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> and other high-power equipment to a company switch, generator, or other tie-in point.|$|R

5000|$|The coaster {{cars were}} built by National Amusement Devices, in their popular Century Flyer style. The coaster's highest point was 65 ft and boasted a 2400 ft track length. One of the coaster's most unusual {{features}} {{was that it}} was built {{on the edge of a}} valley. Most roller coasters of the day were towed up to the highest point by a chain and as the energy and momentum of the coaster was expended, the hills got smaller towards the end. The Gorge/Comet was different in that it left the station at ground level and [...] "fell" [...] into the valley, so the first drop was actually the 2nd biggest drop. The coaster went down the valley, turned around and went up a <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> to the opposite side of the valley. It then turned around and dropped into the valley for the coaster's biggest dip and came back up the hill to return into the back of the station.|$|E
50|$|Fite {{constructed}} a huge A-frame out of 30 ft timbers and raised {{it over the}} monolith, then used a <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> to lift the stone and suspend it over the hole. Still working stone by stone, he filled in the hole and built up a pedestal, topped by a three-quarter ton capstone.The monolith had previously been made ready by trimming its base, so that its center of gravity was exactly perpendicular to the capstone. This entailed a calculation of extreme precision, one that was worked out by Fite and his neighbor Berthel Wrolsen, a local man who was a self-taught engineering genius and an unofficial consultant to Fite on many structural issues over the years. The calculations were especially difficult in that {{the top of the}} monolith is not only wider than the base, but also asymmetrical. Lowered into place, the monolith was to be held there entirely by its own weight and balance. Fite and Wrolsen’s calculations, and Fite’s execution, proved to be correct. The monolith remains standing after nearly half a century’s exposure to all kinds of weather.|$|E
5000|$|Some people {{argue that}} {{elevators}} began as simple rope or <b>chain</b> <b>hoists</b> (see Traction elevators below). An elevator {{is essentially a}} platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a [...] "cage", [...] "carriage" [...] or [...] "car") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a [...] "hoistway". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a [...] "traction" [...] elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved pulley, commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a counterweight. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.|$|R
5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on <b>chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|R
50|$|Some {{mechanical}} {{linear actuators}} only pull, such as <b>hoists,</b> <b>chain</b> drive and belt drives. Others only push (such as a cam actuator). Pneumatic and hydraulic cylinders, or lead screws {{can be designed}} to generate force in both directions.|$|R
50|$|Addition took 285 microseconds and {{multiplication}} 20 milliseconds, making arithmetic operations {{much faster}} than the Harvard Mark I. Data {{that had to be}} retrieved quickly was held in electronic circuits; the remainder was stored in relays and as holes in three continuous card-stock tapes that filled another wall. A <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> was needed to lift the heavy reels of paper into place. The machine read instructions or data from 30 paper tape readers connected to three punches, and another a table look-up unit consisted of another 36 paper tape readers. A punched card reader was used to load data, and results were produced on punched cards or high-speed printers. The 19-digit word was stored on the card stock tape or registers in binary coded decimal, resulting in 76 bits, with two extra bits for indicating positive or negative sign and parity, while the two side rows were used for sprockets. The familiar 80 columns of IBM punched card technology were recorded sideways as one column of the tape.|$|E
50|$|The basic hoist has two {{important}} characteristics to define it: Lifting medium and power type. The lifting medium is either wire rope, {{wrapped around a}} drum, or load-chain, raised by a pulley with a special profile to engage the chain. The power can be provided by different means. Common means are hydraulics, electrical and air driven motors. Both the wire rope hoist and <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> have been in common use since the 1800s, however mass production of an electric hoist did not start until the early 1900s and was first adapted by Germany. A hoist can be built as one integral-package unit, designed for cost-effective purchasing and moderate use, {{or it can be}} built as a built-up custom unit, designed for durability and performance. The built-up hoist will be much more expensive, but will also be easier to repair and more durable. Package units were once regarded as being designed for light to moderate usage, but since the 60s this has changed. Built-up units are designed for heavy to severe service, but over the years that market has decreased in size since the advent of the more durable packaged hoist. A machine shop or fabricating shop will use an integral-package hoist, while a Steel Mill or NASA would use a built-up unit to meet durability, performance, and repairability requirements. NASA has also seen a change in the use of package hoists. The NASA Astronaut training pool, for example, utilizes cranes with packaged hoists.|$|E
50|$|The Laogai Research Foundation publishes an {{annually}} updated Laogai Handbook, which lists {{all known}} information about Laogai activities in China including individual camps' location, size, known inmates, manufactured products, and other statistics. The Foundation also researches American companies' ties to Laogai camps; in 1992, LRF documented Columbus McKinnon <b>Chain</b> <b>Hoist</b> Company's {{extensive use of}} Laogai products, a finding which the company's president eventually confirmed while testifying before Congress. In February 2010, the Foundation released a research report proving that China was actively advertising Laogai products and services online, including on Chinese government-sponsored sites, {{despite the fact that}} exporting Laogai products is illegal under Chinese law. Importing Laogai products is illegal in the United States, Germany, and Italy. Another recent project of the foundation includes Laogai: The Machinery of Repression in China, a full-length book detailing the history of the Laogai in China, which was edited by LRF Director Nicole Kempton and published in 2009 by Umbrage Editions. Other works have been published in Chinese. In addition, the LRF maintains two active blogs, one in English and one in Chinese, and Kempton maintains her own blog at The Huffington Post. In 2008, the LRF opened the Laogai Museum at the foundation's headquarters in Washington. The Dalai Lama made a notable visit to the Museum in 2009 as part of a meeting with Wu and Kempton. In April 2011, the LRF celebrated the grand opening of its fully renovated Laogai Museum at its new location in Dupont Circle.|$|E
