50|$|As {{far back}} as the 3rd century BC, Eratosthenes had {{correctly}} computed the circumference of the Earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two different locations: Alexandria and Syene (modern-day Aswan). Eratosthenes's results were confirmed by a comparison of stellar observations at Alexandria and Rhodes, carried out by Posidonius in the 1st century BC. These measurements were widely known among scholars, but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed had led, in <b>Columbus's</b> <b>day,</b> to some debate about the exact size of the Earth.|$|R
5|$|Loggers felled {{massive amounts}} of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because natural {{regeneration}} could not {{keep pace with the}} rate of logging. In 1962, the <b>Columbus</b> <b>Day</b> Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about five percent of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that become}} extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system, {{they can still}} retain winds of hurricane or gale force. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel became extratropical over North Carolina as a strong Category 3 storm. The <b>Columbus</b> <b>Day</b> Storm of 1962, which evolved from the remains of Typhoon Freda, caused heavy damage in Oregon and Washington, with widespread damage equivalent to at least a Category 3. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma began to lose tropical characteristics while still sporting Category 3-force winds (and became fully extratropical as a Category 1 storm).|$|E
5|$|Churchill {{has been}} a leader of Colorado AIM's annual protests in Denver against the <b>Columbus</b> <b>Day</b> holiday and its {{associated}} parade. Colorado AIM's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community, the main supporters of the parade. As early as 2004, Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional, arguing that the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution provides Native Americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays, overriding the First Amendment rights of non-Native Americans.|$|E

5|$|Logging resumed in 1912 in {{the north}} part of the canyon, where The Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam donkey engine {{operated}} near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the <b>Columbus</b> <b>Day</b> Storm blew down many remaining trees.|$|E
5|$|Washington Park is {{the site}} of many festivals, concerts, and special occasions. The Tulip Festival held every year since 1949 in Washington Park is {{highlighted}} by the blossoming of 200,000 tulips throughout the park. The African-American tradition of Pinksterfest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest and since 1998 the Tulip Fest has also included the Mother of the Year award. The Latin Festival and the <b>Columbus</b> <b>Day</b> Parade and Italian Festival are some of the ethnic festivals held every year in the park. The city, the Albany Police Athletic League, and Hannaford supermarkets sponsor the Capital Holiday Lights every winter, with 125 displays through the park. Proceeds benefit juvenile crime prevention programs.|$|E

Additional training exercises followed {{through the end of}} the year, interrupted only by visits to New York City and to Stamford, Connecticut, for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration and <b>Columbus</b> <b>Day,</b> respectively. In late December, she was back in New York City. Vermont then steamed south to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which she reached on 12 January 1910. Two months of exercises there followed before gunnery training off the Virginia Capes. The ship was back in Boston on 29 April for repairs that lasted until mid-July. After returning to service, she took on a contingent of Naval Militia at Boston for a cruise to Provincetown from 22 to 31 July.|$|E

25|$|Francis Bellamy and Upham had {{lined up}} the National Education Association {{to support the}} Youth's Companion as a sponsor of the <b>Columbus</b> <b>Day</b> {{observance}} and the use in that observance of the American flag. By June 29, 1892, Bellamy and Upham had arranged for Congress and President Benjamin Harrison to announce a proclamation making the public school flag ceremony {{the center of the}} <b>Columbus</b> <b>Day</b> celebrations. This arrangement was formalized when Harrison issued Presidential Proclamation 335. Subsequently, the Pledge was first used in public schools on October 12, 1892, during <b>Columbus</b> <b>Day</b> observances organized to coincide {{with the opening of the}} World's Columbian Exposition (the Chicago World's Fair), Illinois.|$|E
