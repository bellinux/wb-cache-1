40|$|Few {{investigations}} {{have been made}} to discuss the influence of water on the yields and <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> isotopic <b>ratios</b> of gas hydrocarbons generated from oil cracking although water occurs in oil reservoirs. In this study, a pyrolysis experiment for a crude oil under hydrous and anhydrous conditions in a gold tube confined system was performed at T = 370 °C, P = 21 MPa and times from 1 to 7 days. It is found that water has an obvious inhibition on the gas yields generated from oil cracking and a pronounced influence on the <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> isotopic fractionations of the cracking gas. Compared with the anhydrous pyrolysis, the hydrous pyrolysis has a smaller C_(1 - 5) alkane yields and lighter <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> isotopic <b>ratios</b> of the C_(1 - 3) hydrocarbons within maturity levels investigated. The differences in their C_(1 - 5) alkane yields reach 3 - 12 ml/g, in their δ^(13) CH_ 4, δ^(13) C_ 2 H_ 6 and δ^(13) C_ 3 H_ 8 values reach 1. 0 - 2. 7 ‰, 0. 2 - 0. 8 ‰ and 0. 2 - 0. 3 ‰, respectively, and in their δDCH_ 4, δDC_ 2 H_ 6, δDC_ 3 H_ 8 values reach 5 - 16 ‰, 22 - 80 ‰ and 4 - 13 ‰, respectively. Moreover, the hydrous pyrolysis experiment formed a greater amount of H_ 2 and alkenes and a smaller amount of CO_ 2 than the anhydrous pyrolysis experiment did. The differences of H_ 2, ethene, propene and CO_ 2 between the two experiment conditions are 0. 44 - 2. 12 ml/g, 0. 03 - 0. 05 ml/g, 0. 20 - 0. 34 ml/g and 0. 08 - 0. 98 ml/g, respectively. These results indicate that these differences in <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> isotopic <b>ratios</b> of generated gases between the hydrous and anhydrous experiments is possibly because water affects the free radical reactions of oil cracking and inhibits the combination between alkyl and hydrogen to form alkane to some extent, rather than due to the isotopic exchange reactions between water and some pyrolysates as usually believed for kerogen hydrous pyrolysis...|$|R

Seven oils, those of corn, groundnut, palm, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and the micro-algae species Chlorella protothecoides were tested, with all of the fuels heated to 60 °C, at constant injection timing and constant ignition timing at a constant engine speed of 1200 rpm. All of the vegetable oils exhibited a duration of ignition delay within ± 0. 6 CAD of that displayed by a reference fossil diesel, but displayed much reduced rates of peak heat release rate. The duration of ignition delay was found to increase with an increasing <b>carbon</b> to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> of the vegetable oils, implicating the fatty acid alkyl chain as the primary driver of low temperature reactivity. Peak heat release rates decreased with decreasing vegetable oil viscosity, suggesting a significant degree of fuel cylinder wall and piston bowl impingement.

40|$|Sulfonation of {{polymers}} is {{of great}} importance for the packaging industry mainly due to {{its effect on the}} alteration of surface functionality of polymer films. In this study we customized liquid phase sulfonation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) swelling the polymer by using a combination of polar and nonpolar solvents. Swollen polymer was treated with sulfuric acid of varying concentrations with continuous mixing for in-depth sulfonation of the polymer. Presence of cyclohexane and ethanol, as polar and nonpolar reagents, not only kept the batch under isothermal conditions but also homogenously influenced in-depth functionalization of LDPE. The durability of the sulfonated polymer was determined by grinding the test samples 30 days after the reaction. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy indicated presence of functional group moieties, which is also supported by increase of 5 % and 1. 35 % in density and sulfur contents of the polymer, respectively.

40|$|AbstractBecause of {{increasing}} environmental and energy security concerns, a detailed understanding of {{energy efficiency and}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the petroleum refining industry is critical for fair and equitable energy and environmental policies. To date, this has proved challenging {{due in part to}} the complex nature and variability within refineries. In an effort to simplify energy and emissions refinery analysis, we delineated LP modeling results from 60 large refineries from the US and EU into broad categories based on crude density (API gravity) and heavy product (HP) yields. Product-specific efficiencies and process fuel shares derived from this study were incorporated in Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET life-cycle model, along with regional upstream GHG intensities of crude, natural gas and electricity specific to the US and EU regions. The modeling results suggest that refineries that process relatively heavier crude inputs and have lower yields of HPs generally have lower energy efficiencies and higher GHG emissions than refineries that run lighter crudes with lower yields of HPs. The former types of refineries tend to utilize energy-intensive units which are significant consumers of utilities (heat and electricity) and hydrogen. Among the three groups of refineries studied, the major difference in the energy intensities is due to the amount of purchased natural gas for utilities and hydrogen, while the sum of refinery feed inputs are generally constant. These results highlight the GHG emissions cost a refiner pays to process deep into the barrel to produce more of the desirable fuels with low <b>carbon</b> to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|R

The major downfalls of this engine are the carbon dioxide emissions and the depletion of fossil fuels using fossil diesel, the energy security issues of using foreign fossil fuels in general, and finally the difficulty to meet future emission standards for soot, smoke, nitrogen oxides, carbon oxide and unburned hydrocarbons for the combustion of the fuel injected in liquid state and the lack of maturity the lean after treatment system.

The forming of coke is in this respect the most common cause for deactivation. The research that has been done here has tried to give some insight into the mechanism of cokeforming with the help of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (F) 'IR). For this purpose a cobalt catalyst on an alumina carrier was used. The influence of the reaction time, the <b>carbon</b> monoxide to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> and the temperature on the rate and amount of coke formed was determined. A cell was developed that could be heated up to 500 °C and could simultaneously be used in FTIR-spectroscopy in situ research. This enabled the determination of spectra at certain time intervals. In this way the development of the characteristic bands could be followed. Two other methods were used to support the transmission spectra : Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy and the burning of the coke from the catalyst. The latter was done to determine the amount of coke that had formed on the catalyst surface during the run. The amount of coke decreased with an increase of the <b>hydrogen</b> to carbonmonoxide <b>ratio</b> in the feed. Temperature also had a marked influence on coke formation: It decreased at higher temperatures. As expected the amount of coke increased with reaction time.

40|$|From all fossil fuels, {{natural gas}} {{has the lowest}} <b>carbon</b> to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ratio,</b> which enables Gas Turbines (GTs) running on natural gas to produce {{electricity}} with the lowest CO 2 emissions per produced kWh. These lower emissions have pushed power production towards natural gas. However, {{if we want to}} move towards a carbon clean power production, the carbon in the exhaust must be captured. This leads to a major challenge since the low CO 2 concentration in the exhaust of a GT makes carbon capture much more expensive compared to coal fired power production. The CO 2 concentration can be increased by performing Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). However, EGR on GT cycles negatively affects the efficiency. Using the concept of Humid Air Turbine (HAT), we investigate whether the efficiency losses can be compensated by introducing water in the cycle. This paper presents this novel approach by showing the impact of EGR on a flexible humidified micro Gas Turbine (mGT). It is based on results of simulations performed in Aspen® using the Turbec T 100 mGT as reference case. Both the dry and wet operation of the Turbec T 100 were simulated and validated with experimental results. For improved carbon capture, EGR was simulated in both the dry and the humidified mGT cycle. Simulation results indicate that EGR has no effect on the thermodynamic performance of the mGT and its components (compressor, turbine and recuperator), however efficiency is reduced significantly (up to 3. 8 % relative at nominal power output) because of additional losses to the fan blower installed to ensure the EGR. Additionally, the cycle performance strongly depends on the degree of cooling of the EGR stream before injection in the compressor inlet. Nevertheless, the simulation results also reveal that mGT humidification increases the total cycle efficiency, entirely compensating the EGR induced losses. Humidifying the mGT with EGR even leads to a higher electric efficiency than the standard mGT cycle, unlocking the idea of carbon capture in mGTs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Historic {{interest}} in benzene {{arose from the}} uncertainty over its structure and reactivity. It was well established {{that it had a}} <b>carbon</b> to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1:1 which suggested the presence of double or triple bond carbon-to-carbon bonds, yet such unsaturated compounds typically undergo addition reactions, which benzene does not. Numerous potential structures were proposed, including by Claus, Dewar, Ladenburg, Armstrong, and Thiele. [...] The most influential proposal was that of Kekulé who in 1865 suggested a cyclic structure of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds [...] Kekulé based his argument on the now well-known observations of arene substitution patterns, namely that there are always only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene and three isomers of every disubstituted derivative. [...] Critics noted that Kekulé's proposal implied that there should be two distinguishable isomers for an ortho-substitution (a 1,2-disubstituion) depending on whether a single or double bond joined these two carbons. Kekulé suggested in reply that benzene had two complementary structures and that these forms rapidly interconverted, which would also explain the lack of addition reactions (as the valency of each carbon atom is not that expected of a double bond). Though this interconversion is incorrect —in fact, they are both resonance contributors to the actual structure (which is closest to Thiele's structure)— the geometry and structure proposed by Kekulé are correct. Benzene is the prototypical example of an aromatic compound, a hitherto unknown class of compounds, and its synthesis was the first example of aromatization, the process and chemical reactions whereby an aromatic system is formed. The new understanding of benzene and all aromatic compounds was so important for both pure and applied chemistry that in 1890 the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekulé's honor, celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper; its 150th anniversary was also marked. [...] The cyclic nature of benzene was confirmed crystallographically by Kathleen Lonsdale in 1929.|$|R
