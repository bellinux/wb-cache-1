50|$|After the European Commission {{approved}} {{the acquisition of}} EMI by Universal Music Group on September 21, 2012, restructuring and rebranding of several EMI labels under Universal Music followed in September 28, 2012 as the merger was approved. In January 15, 2013, Universal Music Japan president Kazuhiko Koike took over as CEO of EMI Music Japan, effectively controlling both companies until its integration into Universal Music Japan as a sublabel in April 1, 2013 as EMI Records Japan. Koike, meanwhile, has stated that the merger had a bad effect {{in terms of its}} international repertoire and employment. Artists from the former company will still continue releasing material under Universal Music but still maintaining the catalog code TOCT. As of October 2013, the TOCT catalogue is no longer in use and is replaced by TYCT (for the original EMI Records artists) and UPCH (for Nayutawave Records artists absorbed by EMI). On February 2014, Universal Music Japan did a large-scale sub-label reorganization, with more than half of EMI Records Japan artists transferred to Nayutawave Records, renaming the latter as EMI Records. The remainder of the roster were moved to another sub-label, called EMI R. By June 2014, the EMI artists that were transferred to Nayutawave to form the EMI Records unit began using the UPCH <b>catalogue</b> <b>code.</b> On April 14, 2014, Universal Music Japan announced that EMI R and sublabels Universal International and Delicious Deli Records will be having their joint partnership by forming Virgin Music, with Universal International's EMI label distribution be merged later on.

40|$|The paper {{highlights}} the importance of cataloguing as the basic prerequisite for all information retrieval processes, and therefore its relevance as a core in LIS curriculum. The developments in ICT have brought in sea changes in the universe of information resources as well as in customer requirements. This changed situation has caused only a redefinition of the functions and format of the catalogue and not made it redundant. Formulation of FRBR as a conceptual model for bibliographical databases is a landmark in this context. The FRBR in fact is a manifestation of the theoretical frame that Ranganathan had proposed for the universe of documents. The recent attempts to incorporate Classification Numbers to enable browsing resources in the web and the approach of FRBR aiming at retrieval of the different manifestations and expressions of a work during a search, necessitate a coextensive Class Number as a key attribute for every work as an access point. Such an approach would necessitate training students of librarianship on the modus operandi of a Classified Catalogue.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{was to investigate the}} effectiveness of stabilization/solidification method as a possible treatment technology for refinery oily sludge. The oily sludge produced by petroleum refineries is classified as a solid hazardous waste, according to the European Waste <b>Catalogue</b> (<b>code</b> 05 01 03). The production of such waste is continuous, because of the important role of petroleum and its derivatives in every day life, such as in industrial and human-related activities. The oily sludge production in Greece in 1998 was 35, 000 ton, while in Europe in the same year was 448, 000 ton. Refinery oily sludge is a complicated and heterogeneous solid mixture, which contains several hazardous constituents. The mixture consists of an organic fraction mainly hydrocarbons (e. g., alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons) and of an inorganic fraction, which contains heavy metals, silicates and N, O, S-bearing compounds. The short or long-term SUMMARY x waste disposal on soil causes significant environmental problems. The most important problem is the potential release of hazardous substances to soil due to rainfall, and possible contamination of groundwater and surface water. The most common treatment technologies for remediation of contaminated soils by oily sludge and for treatment of the oily sludge itself are incineration, vitrification, biological treatment (e. g. landfarming) and stabilization/solidification (S/S). In the USA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) has introduced incineration followed by S/S as the best demonstrated available treatment technology for tank bottoms (leaded) and API separator sludge from petroleum refining industry (coded as K 052 and K 051, respectively). The combination of these two technologies, incineration followed by S/S, was investigated in the present work. Vitrification is a successful treatment technology for some solid hazardous waste management, especially for waste containing high organic content, but the high energy consumption, the initial investment cost or the non-existing infrastructure, as in Greece, makes the usage and selection of this technology unlikely. The biological treatment of oily sludge is a successful treatment technology for the biodegradation of the organic load but the non-biodegradated inorganic constituents, such as heavy metals, remain and must be treated. An effective and economically feasible alternative treatment technology for the treatment of oily sludge is stabilization/solidification. ...|$|E
