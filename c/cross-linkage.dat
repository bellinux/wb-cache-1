2500|$|Amoxicillin {{attaches}} to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It also is a bactericidal compound.

50|$|Elastomers {{are usually}} {{thermosets}} (requiring vulcanization) {{but may also}} be thermoplastic (see thermoplastic elastomer). The long polymer chains cross-link during curing, i.e., vulcanizing. The molecular structure of elastomers can be imagined as a 'spaghetti and meatball' structure, with the meatballs signifying cross-links. The elasticity {{is derived from the}} ability of the long chains to reconfigure themselves to distribute an applied stress. The covalent <b>cross-linkages</b> ensure that the elastomer will return to its original configuration when the stress is removed. As a result of this extreme flexibility, elastomers can reversibly extend from 5-700%, depending on the specific material. Without the <b>cross-linkages</b> or with short, uneasily reconfigured chains, the applied stress would result in a permanent deformation.|$|R

50|$|Croscarmellose is made {{by first}} soaking crude {{cellulose}} in sodium hydroxide, and then reacting the cellulose with sodium monochloroacetate to form sodium carboxymethylcellulose. Excess sodium monochloroacetate slowly hydrolyzes to glycolic acid and the glycolic acid catalyzes the <b>cross-linkage</b> to form croscarmellose sodium.Chemically, croscarmellose sodium is the sodium salt of a cross-linked, partly O-(carboxymethylated) cellulose.|$|E
50|$|Since phalloidin is {{exploited}} {{for its ability}} to bind and stabilize actin polymers but cells cannot readily uptake it, scientists have found phalloidin derivatives to be more useful in research. Essentially, it follows typical small peptide synthesis, using hydroxyl-proline. The major difficulty in synthesis is the formation of the tryptathionine bond (cysteine - tryptophan <b>cross-linkage).</b>|$|E
50|$|Under normal circumstances, {{peptidoglycan}} precursors {{signal a}} reorganisation of the {{bacterial cell wall}} and, as a consequence, trigger the activation of autolytic cell wall hydrolases. Inhibition of <b>cross-linkage</b> by β-lactams causes a build-up of peptidoglycan precursors, which triggers the digestion of existing peptidoglycan by autolytic hydrolases without the production of new peptidoglycan. As a result, the bactericidal action of β-lactam antibiotics is further enhanced.|$|E

40|$|Wool is {{remarkable}} among textile materials {{in that it}} possesses high extensibility {{and the ability to}} return to its original length or shape after being stretched or distorted. These properties are of advantage in such products as clothing, blankets, and carpets. It is shown that a number of the important physical properties {{as well as some of}} the chemical properties of wool are dependent upon a unique molecular structure, provided by the presence of disulfide or cystine <b>cross-linkages</b> between the main molecular chains of the fiber. As a result, wool fibers possess a three-dimensional molecular net-work while most other textile fibers are composed of bundles of chain-like molecules, arranged more or less parallel to the axes of the fibers.

50|$|Model studies {{indicate}} that PG2 (but not specific antigens or IgE <b>cross-linkage)</b> stimulates mouse and human mast cells to release histamine by an EP3-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, EP3-deficient mice fail to develop increased capillary permeability and tissue swelling in response to EP3 receptor agonists and the metabolic precursor to PGE2, arachidonic acid. It is suggested, based on these and other less direct studies, that PGE2-EP3 signaling {{may be responsible for}} the skin swelling and edema provoked by topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid photodynamic therapy, contact with chemical irritants, infection with pathogens, and various skin disorders in humans.|$|E
50|$|Like other {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics, meticillin acts by inhibiting {{the synthesis}} of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits <b>cross-linkage</b> between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains {{that make up a}} major component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. It does this by binding to and competitively inhibiting the transpeptidase enzyme (also known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)). These PBPs crosslink glycopeptides (D-alanyl-alanine), forming the peptidoglycan cell wall. Meticillin and other β-lactam antibiotics are structural analogs of D-alanyl-alanine, and the transpeptidase enzymes that bind to them are sometimes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).|$|E
50|$|Dialkylating agents {{can react}} with two {{different}} 7-N-guanine residues, and, {{if these are}} in different strands of DNA, the result is <b>cross-linkage</b> of the DNA strands, which prevents uncoiling of the DNA double helix. If the two guanine residues {{are in the same}} strand, the result is called limpet attachment of the drug molecule to the DNA. Busulfan {{is an example of a}} dialkylating agent: it is the methanesulfonate diester of 1,4-butanediol. Methanesulfonate can be eliminated as a leaving group. Both ends of the molecule can be attacked by DNA bases, producing a butylene crosslink between two different bases.|$|E
50|$|Fox has {{likened the}} amino acid {{globules}} to cells, and proposed it bridged the macromolecule to cell transition.

50|$|The pro-alpha2(XI) chain {{combines}} with pro-alpha1(XI) and pro-alpha1(II)collagen chains {{to form a}} procollagen molecule. These triple-stranded, ropelike procollagen molecules must {{be processed}} by enzymes in the cell. Once processed, these procollagen molecules leave the cell and arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that cross-link {{to one another in}} the spaces around cells. The <b>cross-linkages</b> result in the formation of very strong mature type XI collagen fibers.|$|R
5000|$|Cefoxitin is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic which binds penicillin binding proteins, or transpeptidases. By binding to PBPs, cefoxitin {{prevents the}} PBPs from forming the <b>cross-linkages</b> between the peptidoglycan layers {{that make up}} the bacterial cell wall, thereby interefering with cell wall synthesis. It is a strong beta-lactamase inducer, as are certain other antibiotics (such as imipenem). However, cefoxitin is a better substrate than imipenem for beta-lactamases.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to varying}} degrees of <b>cross-linkage</b> in a gel network, {{different}} gels display different visocoelastic properties. A material containing viscoelastic properties undergoes both viscous and elastic changes when a deformation occurs. Viscosity {{can be thought of}} as a time dependent process of a material deforming to a more relaxed state while elasticity is an instantaneous process. The viscoelastic properties of gels mean that they undergo time dependent structural changes in response to a physical deformation. Two techniques for measuring viscoelasticity are broadband viscoelastic spectroscopy (BVS) and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). In both techniques, a damping mechanism is resolved with both differing frequency and time in order to determine the viscoelastic properties of the material.|$|E

5000|$|The publisher’s {{other major}} {{objective}} is {{the promotion of}} important cultural and literary texts from other world cultures, {{such as those of}} Asian, African or Latin American origin.

Repressed humanist efforts should be made visible as well as delayed impulses of the enlightenment. Contemporary authors, who have dedicated themselves to cross-cultural communication, or who are prepared to follow new directions, should also be able to express themselves. During a time of globalisation and international <b>cross-linkage,</b> the Kitab-Verlag seeks to establish contacts with non-German publishers and publishes texts in other languages, which, according to the publisher, should be available worldwide.

30|$|The binding {{preferences}} of hHAsα 2, 6 and hHAsα 2, 6 * (hSHAα 2, 6 * and hLHAα 2, 6 *) toward horse and swine erythrocytes were investigated. Horse erythrocytes contain mainly α 2, 3 -linked sialic acid side chains on surface glycoproteins and swine erythrocytes contain both α 2, 3 - and α 2, 6 -linked sialic acid side chains on their surface glycoproteins (Ito et al. 1997). hHAsα 2, 6 * {{was shown to}} form <b>cross-linkages</b> with the horse erythrocytes (Fig.  3 c; Additional file 1 : Figure S 1) {{and in the case}} of the swine erythrocytes, both hHAsα 2, 6 and hHAsα 2, 6 * formed <b>cross-linkages</b> (Fig.  3 d; Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). Overall, hHAsα 2, 6 were therefore shown to recognize rabbit and swine erythrocytes, while hHAsα 2, 6 * was shown to recognize chicken, horse, and swine erythrocytes. These recognition specificities are consistent with the distribution of sialic acid side chains on the respective surface glycoproteins (Ito et al. 1997; Medeiros et al. 2001).|$|R

The collagens of the valve were completely solubilized {{by using a}} method consisting of guanidinium chloride extraction, limited pepsin digestions and CNBr cleavage of the residue. The normal valves contained 74 % type I, 24 % type III and 2 % type V collagen. The type I and type III collagens had similar solubility patterns, although only type I collagen was detected in the guanidinium chloride extract. Type V collagen was only detected in the first pepsin extract. The type I and III collagens had higher contents of hydroxylysine than did the same collagens from age-matched dermis. The two-dimensional electrophoretic 'maps' of CNBr-cleavage peptides showed low recoveries of the C-terminal alpha 1 (I) CB 6 and alpha 1 (III) CB 9 peptides, which are involved in forming intermolecular <b>cross-linkages.</b> Most of the reducible <b>cross-linkages</b> were present in large-Mr peptide complexes, and these complexes were shown by labelling with 125 I to include the tyrosine-containing alpha 1 (I) CB 6 peptide. The myxomatous valves contained 67 % type I, 31 % type III and 2 % type V collagens. There was {{a significant increase in}} the concentration of each type of collagen, which consisted of a 9 % increase of type I collagen, a 53 % increase of type III collagen and a 25 % increase of type V collagen. The contents of hydroxylysine in type I and III collagens and the electrophoretic 'maps' of the CNBr-cleavage peptides involved in <b>cross-linkages</b> did not differ significantly from the results obtained from the normal valves.

50|$|Further {{investigation}} and evaluation showed that unmodified cell-free haemoglobin had limitations, such as: an oxygen affinity {{that was too}} high for effective tissue oxygenation; a half-life within the intravascular space that was too short to be clinically useful; and a tendency to undergo dissociation in dimers with resultant renal tubular damage and toxicity. Early studies conducted in experimental animals showed that infusion of free haemoglobin caused also substantial increase in oncotic pressure because of its hyperosmolarity, coagulopathy, and hypertension. The general problem was that solutions of acellular haemoglobin were not as effective at oxygenation as {{packed red blood cells}} because of their high affinity for oxygen. Red blood cells have adapted to release oxygen at an oxygen half-saturation pressure of haemoglobin (P-50) of approximately 26.5 mm Hg, {{as a result of the}} allosteric effects of red bloods cell 2,3-disphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), which shifts the oxyhaemoglobin curve to the right. Without 2,3-DPG, stroma-free haemoglobin has a P-50 of 12-14 mm Hg, not allowing for the adequate release of oxygen to the tissues. This sides effects have been attributed to dissociation of a2b2 tetramer to ab dimers (short intravascular half-life, high oxygen affinity, nephrotoxicity), contamination with RBC stroma and affinity of Hb for nitric oxide (abdominal pain, vasoconstrictive crises). To overcome this problems several types of Hb modification methods (purification, <b>cross-linkage,</b> polymerisation) were developed in the last few decades.|$|E

40|$|Bovine dermis {{was exposed}} {{outdoors}} in the Antarctic in 2013 {{to study the}} skin damage caused by short-wavelength ultraviolet light under the ozone hole. Collagen was extracted from the exposed dermis with pepsin. The amount of solubilized collagen in the exposed dermis was only 20 %– 40 % of that in dermis shielded from ultraviolet light. The dermis was most difficult to extract when exposed in summer, and then when exposed in spring. Differential scanning calorimetry {{was used to determine}} the melting endothermic behavior of the dermal tissue. The peak temperature was highest for the dermis exposed in summer. The exposed dermis was degraded with cyanogen bromide to determine whether cross-linking had occurred. Cross-linked peptides were detected in the dermis exposed in summer or spring, but the dermis exposed in autumn did not differ markedly from the light-shielded dermis. These data show that <b>cross-linkages</b> were readily formed in the collagen molecule chains in dermis exposed to ultraviolet light in summer, when solar elevation is highest and the period of sunshine is longest. A comparison of the dermis exposed in spring and that exposed in autumn showed that <b>cross-linkages</b> were formed more readily by ultraviolet light in spring, when the ozone hole occurred. オゾンホール発生時の短波長紫外線による皮膚へのダメージを調べるため、南極にて牛の真皮の屋外曝露を行った。曝露後の真皮に対してコラーゲンのペプシンを抽出したところ、曝露した真皮は紫外線を遮光していたものに比べてコラーゲンが 20 ～ 40 ％程度しか可溶化されなかった。特に夏季に曝露したものが最も抽出されにくく、次いで春季に曝露したものが抽出されにくかった。さらに、臭化シアン分解によって架橋の有無を調べたところ、秋季に曝露したサンプルでは遮光サンプルと顕著な差は見られなかったが、夏季および春季に曝露したサンプルでは紫外線によって架橋したペプチドが検出された。以上のことから、太陽高度が最も高くて日照時間が長い夏季の紫外線を浴びた真皮は、コラーゲン分子鎖に架橋を生じさせやすいことがわかった。また、春季と秋季の曝露を比較すると、オゾンホール発生時である春季の方が紫外線によって架橋を生じさせやすいことも判明した...|$|R

In this study we have observed that cells pre-cultured in IL- 3 produce 10 - 100 times more cytokine after receptor <b>cross-linkage</b> in comparison with IL- 4 pre-cultured cells. Although several hematopoietin receptors, including those for IL- 3, IL- 4 and EPO, do not contain tyrosine kinase domains, their occupancy with ligand causes tyrosine phosphorylation of specific cellular substrates. Therefore, the contribution of tyrosine kinase activation {{to the ability of}} an IL- 3 dependent mast cell line, CFTL- 15, to produce cytokines was analyzed. The CFTL- 15 cells were transfected with growth factor receptors containing ligand-inducible tyrosine kinase domains (EGFR and PDGFR, and CSF-IR) or with the EPOR. All of the transfectants were able to proliferate in response to IL- 3 or to their respective growth factor and to produce IL- 3 in response to IgE receptor <b>cross-linkage.</b> Stimulation of the EGFR and PDGFR transfectants with their respective ligands resulted in the production of IL- 3, IL- 6, and GM-CSF.
