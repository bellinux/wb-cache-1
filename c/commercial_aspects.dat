5|$|British {{businessman}} Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham {{during most}} of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the <b>commercial</b> <b>aspects</b> of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the 1992 season, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the 2010 Formula One season using the Brabham name.|$|E

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] is a satire on {{political}} correctness and religious sensitivity, particularly in its {{portrayal of the}} characters organizing [...] "The Happy, Non-Offensive, Non-Denominational Christmas Play" [...] to avoid offending anyone of any religious backgrounds.

500|$|Like cult films themselves, {{magazines}} and websites dedicated to cult films revel in their self-conscious offensiveness. [...] They maintain {{a sense of}} exclusivity by offending mainstream audiences with misogyny, gore, and racism. [...] Obsessive trivia {{can be used to}} bore mainstream audiences while building up subcultural capital. [...] Specialist stores on the fringes of society (or websites which prominently partner with hardcore pornographic sites) can be used to reinforce the outsider nature of cult film fandom, especially when they use erotic or gory imagery. [...] By assuming a preexisting knowledge of trivia, non-fans can be excluded. [...] Previous articles and controversies can also be alluded to without explanation. [...] Casual readers and non-fans will thus be left out of discussions and debates, as they lack enough information to meaningfully contribute. [...] When fans like a cult film for the wrong reasons, such as casting or characters aimed at mainstream appeal, they may be ridiculed. [...] Thus, fandom can keep the mainstream at bay while defining themselves in terms of the [...] "Other", a philosophical construct divergent from social norms. [...] <b>Commercial</b> <b>aspects</b> of fandom (such as magazines or books) can also be defined in terms of [...] "otherness" [...] and thus valid to consume: consumers purchasing independent or niche publications are discerning consumers, but the mainstream is denigrated. [...] Irony or self-deprecating humor can also be used. [...] In online communities, different subcultures attracted to transgressive films can clash over values and criteria for subcultural capital. [...] Even within subcultures, fans who break subcultural scripts, such as denying the affectivity of a disturbing film, will be ridiculed for their lack of authenticity.|$|E

500|$|Mathijs and Sexton {{state that}} genre is an {{important}} part of cult films; cult films will often mix, mock, or exaggerate the tropes associated with traditional genres. [...] Science fiction, fantasy, and horror are known for their large and dedicated cult followings; as science fiction films become more popular, fans emphasize non-mainstream and less <b>commercial</b> <b>aspects</b> of it. B films, which are often conflated with exploitation, are as important to cult films as exploitation. [...] Teodor Reljic of Malta Today states that cult B films are a realistic goal for Malta's burgeoning film industry. [...] Genre films, B films that strictly adhere to genre limitations, can appeal to cult film fans: given their transgressive excesses, horror films are likely to become to cult films; films like Galaxy Quest (1999) highlight the importance of cult followings and fandom to science fiction; and authentic martial arts skills in Hong Kong action films can drive them to become cult favorites. [...] Cult musicals can range from the traditional, such as Singin' in the Rain (1952), which appeal to cult audiences through nostalgia, camp, and spectacle, to the more non-traditional, such as Cry-Baby (1990), which parodies musicals, and Rocky Horror, which uses a rock soundtrack. [...] Romantic fairy tale The Princess Bride (1987) failed to attract audiences in its original release, as the studio did not know how to market it. [...] The freedom and excitement associated with cars can be an important part of drawing cult film fans to genre films, and they can signify action and danger with more ambiguity than a gun. [...] Ad Week writes that cult B films, when released on home video, market themselves and need only enough advertising to raise curiosity or nostalgia.|$|E
500|$|The trio {{became so}} excited {{with the concept}} they came up with, they decided to do initial {{development}} on their own instead of pitching it to someone else. The Wachowskis wrote three hour-long spec scripts, and together with Straczynski attempted to shop them around, such as at Warner Bros. and HBO, but when they saw that nobody could understand the concept they decided to shelve it. A few years later, when they felt that the landscape of television had become friendlier towards more experimental concepts, they decided to pitch it a second time. On October 2, 2012, Variety first reported {{the existence of the}} show, by writing that the Wachowskis, with the help of Straczynski's Studio JMS and Georgeville Television, would be shopping Sense8 around Los Angeles the week to follow. If the series was picked up, the sisters and Straczynski would be sharing showrunner duties. Additionally, the Wachowskis were planning to direct a few episodes of the show if their schedule permitted it. According to Straczynski, the first meeting with potential buyers was with Netflix. The Wachowskis and Straczynski talked to them about subjects such as gender, identity, secrecy and privacy. According to Lana they pitched shooting on location all over the globe to which Netflix responded favorably, which was in contrast to the [...] "clearly impossible" [...] response they had received by other outlets during their earlier abortive attempt. They also told Netflix they were only interested if they had the freedom to [...] "do anything", like [...] "crazy psychic orgies with all sorts of different bodies" [...] and [...] "live births even" [...] to which Netflix also responded positively. After the end of the meeting, despite it having seemingly gone well, they worried they had made a mistake because they had not pitched any action or otherwise <b>commercial</b> <b>aspects.</b> By noon, and before they had the chance to pitch it to other outlets, such as HBO, Netflix called them to preemptively offer to buy and produce the first season. Netflix announced that they had ordered a 10-episode first season for the series on March 27, 2013. Later, during filming, because of the density of the scripts and the extended length of the first cut of the first episode, the showrunners and Netflix came to an agreement to extend the season to 12 episodes. The Wachowskis and Straczynski's production company that was set up to run the show was named Unpronounceable Productions. The name was suggested by Straczynski, as a joke that references the difficulty of pronouncing the showrunners' long last names.|$|E
