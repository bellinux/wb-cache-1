50|$|Tires {{are complex}} {{composite}} structures made {{of many different}} components that are assembled on a drum and cured in a mold. As a result, there are many conditions that result in RFV. These include variations in: tread extrusion thickness and symmetry, tread splice, body ply splices, inner liner splice, bead symmetry, turn-up symmetry, building drum alignment, transfer ring alignment, <b>curing</b> <b>press</b> bead seating, shaping bladder alignment and control, mold runout, and mold alignment. All of these factors can lead to variations in the material distribution and thickness that are modelled as spring length. The various tire components also are made from different materials, each of which exhibit variation in their elastic properties. These variations are influenced by rubber viscoelastic properties, mixing dispersion and uniformity, and cure heat history, among other things.|$|E
50|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{applying}} pressure to the green tire in a mold in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the green tire is automatically transferred onto the lower mold bead seat, a rubber bladder is inserted into the green tire, and the mold closes while the bladder inflates. As the mold closes and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the green tire flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger tires cure in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the mold. The tire may be placed on a PCI, or post-cure inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic <b>curing</b> <b>press</b> types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.|$|E

40|$|Fluorinated {{copolymers}} {{are well}} known for their large range of applications. These applications can be improved by grafting or crosslinking of several agents. The mechanism of crosslinking of hexamethylene diamine and 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 6 -hexanediamine is well known and occurs in four different steps. To elaborate a film of commercially available poly(VDF-co-HFP) copolymer crosslinked by 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 6 -hexanediamine, a step of <b>press</b> <b>cure</b> under air is necessary. Temperature, time and pressure were optimised by regarding the solubility of the <b>press</b> <b>cured</b> films, the mechanical properties, the swelling rate in methyl ethyl ketone, and the degradation of the films. The best temperature, time and pressure for <b>press</b> <b>cure</b> were 150 C, from 15 to 30 min, and 20 bars, respectively. Other properties of crosslinked poly(VDFco- HFP) copolymers containing 10 mol. % and 20 mol. % of HFP were characterized. First, all films were insoluble in concentrated HCl. Secondly, swelling rates of different amounts of diamine crosslinked copolymers were measured in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate and in methyl ethyl ketone; it was proved that the higher the molar percentage of diamine, the higher the crosslinking density, so the lower the swelling rate. Concerning thermal properties, glass transition temperature mainly increased when the amount of diamine increased. Thermal stability measurements showed a higher decomposition temperature when the percentage of diamine was very low (5 mol. %). Finally, mechanical properties were measured by dynamic mechanical analysis; the storage tensile modulus (E 0) of a diamine crosslinked Kynar copolymer versus temperature exhibited a high drop because Kynar was a highly amorphous copolymer. Moreover, the higher the amount of diamine, the higher the rubbery modulus...|$|R

2500|$|The {{goal of the}} {{missions}} was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, {{was the most important}} industry of any mission. Barley, maize, and wheat were the principal crops grown at San Juan Capistrano; cattle, horses, mules, sheep, and goats were all raised by the hundreds as well. In 1790, the Mission's herd included 7,000 sheep and goats, 2,500 cattle, and 200 mules and horses. Olives were grown, <b>cured,</b> and <b>pressed</b> under large stone wheels to extract their oil, both for use at the Mission and to trade for other goods. Grapes were also grown and fermented into wine for sacramental use and again, for trading. The specific variety, called the Criolla or [...] "Mission grape", was first planted at the Mission in 1779; in 1783, the first wine produced in Alta California emerged from San Juan Capistrano's winery. Until about 1850, Mission grapes represented the entirety of viticulture in the state. Cereal grains were dried and ground by stone into flour. The Mission's kitchens and bakeries prepared and served thousands of meals each day. Candles, soap, grease, and ointments were all made from tallow (rendered animal fat) in large vats located just outside the west wing. Also situated in this general area were vats for dyeing wool and tanning leather, and primitive looms for weavings. Large bodegas (warehouses) provided long-term storage for preserved foodstuffs and other treated materials.|$|R

30|$|Two-millimeter thick 2014 -T 6 {{aluminum}} alloy sheets were cold rolled {{to reduce their}} thickness to acceptable level {{that was followed by}} their suitable heat treatment to restore the T 6 state of the {{aluminum alloy}}. Prepregs were manually prepared and stored in controlled environment prior to use. At the time of laminate fabrication, an assembly of three aluminum alloy sheets alternately reinforced with two prepregs was loaded in a hydraulic press preheated to 90 °C. A pressure of 10  bar was gradually applied over the assembly. The temperature was raised to 160 °C, and the assembly was cured at that temperature for 3  h. After <b>curing,</b> the <b>press</b> was cooled to room temperature followed by the release of pressure. The laminate assembly was taken out from the press and visually inspected for defects. The thickness data of all the laminates were recorded. The achieved/measured dimensional range of the laminate was as follows: tal = 0.35 to 0.58  mm, d = 2.2 to 2.9  mm, l = 200 to 202  mm, and w = 50.35 to 51.35  mm. Deviations from the desired values provided in the ‘Glare details’ section, especially in laminate thickness, were attributed to (i) difficulty in maintaining precise control over thickness of aluminum alloy sheets during rolling, (ii) manual application of resin over fiber cloth during the preparation of prepregs, and (iii) effect of high temperature and bonding pressure on the dimensions of the material layers during curing of the laminate. The dimensional difference between the laminates however has not been included in the computations at Appendix 1 that are based on standard dimensions.|$|R

6000|$|Thus Hume, first {{denies the}} {{existence}} of such evidence, given in such circumstances as he demands, and then he produces an example of that very kind of evidence. Having done this, he abandons (as Mr. Wallace observes) his original assertion that the evidence does not exist, and takes refuge in alleging 'the absolute impossibility' of the events which the evidence supports. Thus Hume poses as a perfect judge of the possible, in a kind of omniscience. He takes his stand on the uniformity of all experience that is not hostile to his idea of the possible, and dismisses all testimony to other experience, even when it reaches his standard of evidence. He is remote indeed from Virchow's position 'that what we call the laws of nature must vary according to our frequent new experiences.'[3] In his note, Hume buttresses and confirms his evidence for the Jansenist miracles. They have even a martyr, M. Montgeron, who wrote an account of the events, and, says Hume lightly, 'is now said to be somewhere in a dungeon on account of his book.' 'Many of the miracles of the Abbé Paris were proved immediately by witnesses before the Bishop's court at Paris, under the eye of Cardinal Noailles....' 'His successor was an enemy to the Jansenists, yet twenty-two <b>curés</b> of Paris ... <b>pressed</b> him to examine these miracles ... But he wisely forbore.' Hume adds his testimony to the character of these curés. Thus it is wisdom, according to Hume, to dismiss the most public and well-attested 'miracles' without examination.

40|$|International audienceFluoropolymers are {{well-known}} for their good properties {{in terms of}} chemical, thermal and electrical stabilities, inertness to acids, bases, solvents and oils, and high resistance to ageing and oxidation. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is useful as a homopolymer endowed with interesting characteristics. It contains a high crystallinity rate, but is base sensitive. In addition, VDF can be co- or terpolymerized with several fluorinated monomers, rendering them suitable as elastomers and various examples of synthesis of VDF-copolymers are also presented. This review also focusses on binary and tertiary systems containing VDF. Several curing systems for these VDFcontaining copolymers have been investigated, especially diamines and their derivatives, aromatic polyhydroxy compounds, peroxides with coagents, such as triallylisocyanurate, radiations, and thiol-ene systems. The best vulcanizate properties are obtained by a two-step process. First, the material is <b>press</b> <b>cured</b> at different times and temperatures, then, it is post cured in air or under nitrogen at higher temperature and time, and under atmospheric pressure. Poly(VDF-co-HFP) copolymers can react with primary, secondary or tertiary monoamines, but they are mainly crosslinked by diamines such as hexamethylene diamine (HMDA), their carbamates (HMDA-C), and derivatives. A mechanism of crosslinking is identified by Infrared and 19 F NMR spectroscopies, and was evidenced to proceed in three main steps. First, a VDF unit undergoes a dehydrofluorination {{in the presence of}} the diamine, then the Michael addition occurs onto the double bonds to form crosslinking, while HF is eliminated from crosslinks in the presence of HF scavengers. The crosslinking mechanism with bisphenols takes place also in three main steps (dehydrofluorination, then substitution of a fluorine atom by a bisphenol, and elimination of HF) ...|$|R
