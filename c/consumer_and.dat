5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the <b>consumer,</b> <b>and</b> the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E

Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. The unemployment rate in Dhaka was 23% in 2013.

5|$|On 10 January 1985, the C5 was {{unveiled}} at a glitzy launch event but it received {{a less than}} enthusiastic reception from the British media. Its sales prospects were blighted by poor reviews and safety concerns expressed by <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> motoring organisations. The vehicle's limitations – a short range, a maximum speed of only , a battery that ran down quickly {{and a lack of}} weatherproofing – made it impractical for most people's needs. It was marketed as an alternative to cars and bicycles, but ended up appealing to neither group of owners, and it was not available in shops until several months after its launch. Within three months of the launch, production had been slashed by 90%. Sales never picked up despite Sinclair's optimistic forecasts and production ceased entirely by August 1985. Out of 14,000 C5s made, only 5,000 were sold before its manufacturer, Sinclair Vehicles, went into receivership.|$|E

40|$|The {{mandatory}} use {{of routine}} outcome measurement (ROM) {{has been introduced}} into all public sector mental health services in Australia over the past 6 years. Qualitative processes were used to engage <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> carers in suggesting how the measures {{can be used in}} clinical practice. The project involved an audit by survey, followed by a range of interactive workshops designed to elicit the views of <b>consumers,</b> carers <b>and</b> clinicians, as well as to involve all parties in dialogue about ROM. In addition, there was engagement of <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> carers in the training of clinicians in the clinical use of ROM, and in the production of promotional materials aimed at informing <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> carers about ROM. When <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> carers have had an opportunity to be involved in ROM they have found it a useful experience, and those who had not been involved can see the potential. <b>Consumers</b> <b>and</b> carers indicated that they believe the greatest opportunity arising from the suite of measures is the use of the consumer self-assessment measure the Behaviour and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS- 32). <br /...|$|R

5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, <b>consumer,</b> <b>and</b> senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the economists}} in the Eisenhower {{administration}} became frustrated with Diem's refusal to devaluate the piaster once the Republic of Vietnam {{had become a}} stable nation. Diem refused to make the CIP exchange rate equivalent to the free market exchange rate for the two currencies. Although the fixed exchange rate meant that Americans were heavily funding the South Vietnamese economy and that the importing firms could obtain more goods for their money, the rate also meant that South Vietnam goods would not be economically competitive on the export market. Diem was reluctant to cut the currency rate, arguing that it would diminish the value of US aid to South Vietnam and undermine the urban middle class support for his regime as they would resent {{the loss of their}} cheap <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> luxury goods. In 1963, the US Ambassador Frederick Nolting and his economic advisers exhorted Diem to spend more of the CIP funds on rural development in an attempt to shore up peasant support in the face of increasing communist pressure, but were rebuffed.|$|E
