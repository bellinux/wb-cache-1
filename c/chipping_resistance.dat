40|$|Tool steels are {{required}} to show high hardness and fracture toughness, as well as good wear resistance. Furthermore, other properties such as chipping and contact fatigue resistance are also essential {{in order to improve}} the life-time of the tool. The goal of this thesis is to analyze the chipping and contact fatigue resistance of several steels and try to evaluate the correlation between these two properties. On the one hand, the performance of different ausferritic or carbide-free bainitic steels as tool steels have been studied, by taking a high-silicon steel and subjecting it to two austempering treatments, to evaluate their properties next. On the other hand, several quenched & tempered commercial tool steel have been evaluated, produced either by conventional metallurgy, powder metallurgy or electro slag remelting. The microstructure and microhardness of all the steels have been studied first, and standing contact fatigue tests have been performed next. Finally, with the obtained results, the relation between the <b>chipping</b> <b>resistance</b> and contact fatigue resistance has been evaluated. Among the commercial tool steels Calmax, Vanadis 4 Extra and Caldie show much better standing contact fatigue resistance than AISI D 2. Ausferritic steels have also shown good resistance, comparable to the Calmax or, in some cases, even better. Regarding the microhardness, ausferritc steels are not as hard as the commercial tool steels, but the values are not much lower than Calmax or AISI D 2 for example. Finally, Caldie, the steel with the highest standing contact fatigue resistance shows, according to the provider, the best <b>chipping</b> <b>resistance.</b> The presented work has brought some insight to the evaluation of tool steels. Standing contact fatigue tests can be used to obtain useful information and the results indicate {{that there might be a}} relation between the SCF resistance and the chipping-resistance. Moreover, it has been determined that ausferritic steels show properties similar to some commercial tool steels, and therefore, it would be possible to use them in some tool applications in the near future.

40|$|Purpose: A polymer {{infiltrated}} ceramic network (PICN) and a resin nano ceramic (RNC) restorative {{materials for}} Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications recently became commercially available. Little independent evidence regarding their mechanical properties exists to facilitate material selection process. The {{purpose of this}} study was to measure the edge <b>chipping</b> <b>resistance</b> and flexural strength of the novel PICN and RNC materials and compare it to two commonly used feldspathic ceramic (FC) and leucite reinforced glass-ceramic (LRGC) CAD/CAM materials that share the same indications. Materials and Methods: For the edge chipping test, 20 specimens/group were tested. Square prism specimens 10 10 2 mm were sectioned from the commercially available CAD/CAM blocks, polished and adhesively attached on a 4 mm thick resin bed fabricated in a custom holder. A 120 degree sharp conical indenter was mounted on a universal testing machine and the specimens edge was positioned in distances varying from 0. 1 mm to 0. 7 mm horizontally from the indenter tip. Two edge chipping tests were performed per sample at a crosshead speed of 0. 1 mm/min and the critical force at which a chip spalled off the edge was recorded. One-way ANOVA determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). For the flexural strength test, 22 specimens/group were tested. Beam specimens 18 4 1. 2 mm were sectioned from the commercially available CAD/CAM blocks and polished. A 3 -point flexure test was performed on a universal testing machine with a test fixture support span of 15 mm and the crosshead speed set at 0. 5 mm/min. Weibull statistics determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). Flexural modulus and work of fracture were also measured and one-way ANOVA determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). Results: Regarding edge <b>chipping</b> <b>resistance,</b> one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences with the materials ranking RNC 3 ̆eLRGC=FC 3 ̆ePICN (P=. 05). Regarding flexural strength, Weibull statistics revealed significant differences with the materials ranking RNC=LRGC 3 ̆ePICN 3 ̆eFC (P=. 05). Regarding flexural modulus one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences between the 4 materials, which ranked RNC LRGC=PICN 3 ̆eFC (P=. 05). Conclusions: The RNC material demonstrated superior results for all the mechanical properties tested compared to the other 3 materials.

30|$|An {{unconventional}} {{method for}} determining the fracture resistance of brittle materials is discussed. This method employs a conical indenter to chip the rectangular edge of the specimen. Particular features of the method are the use of small specimens and {{the evaluation of the}} resistance of materials to the nucleation, initiation and propagation of a crack. It is shown that this method is somewhat similar to the Hertzian fracture method and to the way that early man selected stones to make tools and weapons. Measured data of the fracture resistance of ceramics is presented. It is confirmed that if a ceramic material is similar to the model material of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), then those fracture resistance values are directly proportional to the critical stress intensity factors (baseline). For elastic and inelastic ceramics, R-lines characterizing the fracture resistance to crack growth are plotted. It is shown that proportionality lines (edge <b>chipping</b> <b>resistance</b> versus critical stress intensity factor) may be straight lines for ceramics with similar structure (such as Y-TZP and Mg-PSZ). The effect of rounding of the conical indenter tip (10 - 800 μm) on chip scar shape is indicated. Other aspects in the fracture behavior of ceramics during edge chipping are also analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed. Further studies in this mechanico-physical research area are suggested.|$|E

40|$|Cemented carbide {{is today}} the most {{frequently}} used drawing die material in steel wire drawing applications. This is mainly due to the possibility to obtain a broad combination of hardness and toughness thus meeting the requirements concerning strength, crack resistance and wear resistance set by the wire drawing process. However, the increasing cost of cemented carbide in combination with the possibility to increase the wear resistance of steel through the deposition of wear resistant CVD and PVD coatings have enhanced the interest to replace cemented carbide drawing dies with CVD and PVD coated steel wire drawing dies. In the present study, the possibility to replace cemented carbide wire drawing dies with CVD and PVD coated steel drawing dies have been investigated by tribological characterisation, i. e. pin-on-disc and scratch testing, in combination with post-test observations of the tribo surfaces using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and 3 D surface profilometry. Based on the results obtained, CVD and PVD coatings aimed to provide improved tribological performance of steel wire drawing dies should display a smooth surface topography, a high wear resistance, a high fracture toughness (i. e. a high cracking and <b>chipping</b> <b>resistance)</b> and intrinsic low friction properties in contact with the wire material. Also, the steel substrate used must display a sufficient load carrying capacity and resistance to thermal softening.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the microstructural characterisation of wear resistant Al 2 O 3 and Ti(C,N) coatings produced by chemical vapour deposition on cemented carbide cutting tools. The investigation focuses on the effect of deposition conditions on the microstructure and the microstructural evolution of the coatings during heat-treatments and metal cutting. New characterisation techniques and their application to these materials are evaluated. Transmission electron microscopy was used extensively throughout the work and imaging, electron diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron energy-loss spectroscopy and energy-filtering were utilised. The growth rate of. kappa. -Al 2 O 3 can be increased with proper deposition pressures in combination with H 2 S catalysis,without resulting in drastic changes in microstructure. A limiting factor is homogeneous gas phase nucleation at higher pressures,which leads to inhomogeneous coating thicknesses. High H 2 S concentrations are unsuitable for growth of. kappa. -Al 2 O 3 at low temperatures,as this stimulates the nucleation and growth of. gamma. -Al 2 O 3. Tools coated with moderate temperature chemical vapour deposited Ti(C,N) are successful in metal cutting due to low reduction in tool toughness after coating and improved edge <b>chipping</b> <b>resistance.</b> The twinned columnar microstructures of the coatings result from slow kinetics and low desorption rates of reaction products from selected crystal surfaces. The introduction of CO in the process leads to grain refinement, which yields a high surface smoothness and low friction coefficient. Heat-treatment of. kappa. -Al 2 O 3 coatings results in more fine-grained. alfa. -Al 2 O 3 coatings than is generally produced by chemical vapour deposition. These transformed coatings feature increased porosity, which is due to the volume decrease at the phase transformation. When. kappa. -Al 2 O 3 coated tools are used in turning, a transformation to. alfa. -Al 2 O 3 may occur. This transformed. alfa. -Al 2 O 3 has a smaller grain size than heat-treated coatings and shows no porosity, which is due to the high temperature and pressure at the transformation. Rake face wear of. kappa. -Al 2 O 3 coated tools occurs mainly as plastic deformation of transformed. alfa. -Al 2 O 3, while flank face wear occurs as abrasive wear of. kappa. -Al 2 O 3. The increased machinability of Ca-treated Al-killed steels is mainly an effect of softer and less abrasive inclusions, while adhering inclusion layers play only a minor role in reducing tool wear. The layers consist of high melting point phases of the inclusion population in the workpiece material. No evidence of reactions between inclusion layers and Al 2 O 3 coatings could be found. In addition to the use for quantitative microanalysis of light elements, the power of electron energy-loss spectroscopy in determinations of structural and electronic properties has been shown in this work...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this communication, {{we propose}} {{to present the}} very recent {{research}} works we carried-out on design methodologies for secure chips by improving their resistance against two major types of attacks: differential power analysis (DPA) and differential fault analysis (DFA). The circuit technology investigated to improve the resistance in terms of DPA and DFA is asynchronous logic. The strength of the proposed methodologies is to jointly harden the circuits with respect to both types of attacks. Moreover, the hardening techniques apply at design time and the benefits are verified by simulation before fabrication. The presentation first introduces {{the basic principles of}} asynchronous logic, highlighting the differences with the synchronous logic especially in terms of information leakage sources. We show why asynchronous logic is likely to enable us to improve <b>chip</b> <b>resistance</b> against DPA and DFA. The second part of the talk is devoted to DPA. We show how we theoretically model the source of leakage enabling DPA-based attacks to occur. This theoretical model of leakage is the criterion we are optimising in order to improve the <b>chip</b> <b>resistance.</b> Asynchronous logic is an efficient mean to reach this goal. The third part of the presentation is focused on DFA. Our approach is aimed at theoretically modelling the origin of the leakage and at building the defence accordingly. Therefore, we define a sensitivity criterion of the circuit which quantifies the probability for every cell of the circuit to propagate a fault. Computing this criterion enables us to identify the most sensitive parts of the circuits that must be protected, and also helps to specify protection strategies at design time. In a concluding part, we report on the design flow of DPA and DFA resistant circuits and on the results obtained with prototype chips. We finally draw some conclusion and introduce some prospective works...|$|R
