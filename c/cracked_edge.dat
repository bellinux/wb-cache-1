40|$|When {{subjected}} to shear loading of sufficiently high rate, many materials do not fail by cracks, but by adiabatic shear bands. Work is reported on investigations {{for determining the}} dependence of the impact shear fracture toughness {{as a function of}} loading rate, in particular in the regime of failure mode transition from cracks to adiabatic shear bands. For achieving high rate shear loading, edge cracked specimens are asymmetrically impacted at the <b>cracked</b> <b>edge</b> by a projectile accelerated by an air gun to velocities up to 100 m/s. The resulting mode-II stress intensity factors and the times of onset of failure are determined by a specially developed strain gauge measuring technique. Results on shear fracture toughnesses with increasing loading rate are reported for two structural materials, a 1 % chromium steel and a high strength aluminum alloy. Whereas decreasing fracture toughnesses are observed with increasing loading rate when failure occurs by tensile cracks, the fracture toughness increases with loading rate when failure occurs by adiabatic shear bands...|$|E

40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>cracks</b> {{affect the}} quality of rolled strip and the {{efficiency}} of production. The objective {{of this study is to}} improve our understanding of the evolution of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> in cold rolling of thin strip. Experimental research and mechanics analysis were developed to investigate the effects of rolling parameters and initial microstructures on the evolution of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> during rolling. Low carbon steel was prepared for experiments on a Hille 100 experimental rolling mill to examine the characteristics of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> during cold rolling. The characteristics of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> were evaluated by specific instruments, such as the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and surface profile-meters. An Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) technique was also used to analyse the features of rolled strips with <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> The results obtained from the experiments show that rolling parameters such as thickness reduction, rolling speed and lubrication have significant effects on the initiation and propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> A crack on the break area produced by a worn trimmed edge is much larger than that on the cut area, and the surface quality of the break area affects the growth of the crack. The crack increases with the ratio of edge drop, which indicates that the edge drop has a significant effect on <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> When the total reduction in thickness exceeds 85 % (for this experiment, the thickness is about 0. 15 mm), the crack increases significantly and the reduction distribution also has a significant effect on the <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> AFM and SEM observations have confirmed that the <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> originate from the porosity and the grooves of rougher surface. Rougher strip surface increases the concentration of stress and acts as a source of <b>crack</b> initiation during <b>edge</b> <b>cracking.</b> The initial microstructure of the rolled strip affects the initiation and propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>cracking</b> was found to be sensitive to the size of the grain in the microstructure. The grain boundary is a barrier for <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> initiation. A finer grain structure can increase the range of threshold stress intensity and also decrease the probability of crack initiation. A coarse microstructure resists crack propagation better due to blunted <b>crack</b> tip. Sheared <b>edges</b> and lubrication can delay the initiation and propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> TEM shows that there are high density dislocations around the tip of <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> and the inhomogeneous structure in a non-cracked area is a potential crack propagation direction. The stress intensity factor (SIF) solution to <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> has been investigated. The effective range of the stress intensity factor is of importance in defining crack growth rate. The efficiency and reliability of SIF analytical modelling has been demonstrated and the weight function was also applied in <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> analysis. Three dimensional finite element method (FEM) was proposed to simulate the propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> in cold rolling of thin strip. The increasing pressure around the edge of the strip accelerates the propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> More reduction causes more inhomogeneous deformation between the centre and the edge of rolled strip, which extends the <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> significantly. Light pass reduction and lubrication to reduce the propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> are recommended. The simulation provided further important information for improving the edge quality of rolled strip. The optimum condition to eliminate <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> has been discussed and the proposed method for predicting <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> can be utilised to make defect free products from rolling processes. It is recommended that using more lubrication could clarify how rolling conditions affect the evolution of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> The influence of the diameter of work rolls should be investigated, together with the testing of a wide range of materials including various chemical compositions and other steels. Further research about the effect of surface roughness and oxidation on <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> and the Crystal Plastic (CP) application in the analysis of the influence mechanism of microstructure on crack formation is also recommended...|$|R

The current study was focused on the last stages of fracture, the necking, and crack propagation. Tensile specimens were examined by in situ scanning electron microscope equipped with a tensile module and electron backscatter diffraction. It was demonstrated that the fracture evolution consists of scanty diffuse necking followed by pronounced localized necking, in which the deformation band spread through the width of the specimen in two combined mechanisms—shearing and dimpling. The microstructural changes inside the deformation band adjacent to <b>crack</b> <b>edge</b> were compared to those in the uniform deformation zone.

40|$|Summary. We {{consider}} spontaneous cracks {{spreading out}} areally over a fault plane in an infinite medium as a realistic earthquake source model. The boun-dary integral equation technique described in Das {{is used to}} determine the displacements and stresses everywhere on the crack plane.

In the purely in-plane direc-tion of rupture propagation, we find the terminal rupture velocity V & to be given by VhIR < a or V;IR < OSa, depending on the yield strength. We also find that crack propagation in the purely antiplane direction does not influ-ence crack propagation in the purely in-plane direction and vice versa.
