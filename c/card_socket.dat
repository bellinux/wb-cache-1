25|$|There {{are also}} hardware-level differences. Some chips combine MOSI and MISO {{into a single}} data line (SI/SO); this is {{sometimes}} called 'three-wire' signaling (in contrast to normal 'four-wire' SPI). Another variation of SPI removes the chip select line, managing protocol state machine entry/exit using other methods. Anyone needing an external connector for SPI defines their own: UEXT, JTAG connector, Secure Digital <b>card</b> <b>socket,</b> etc. Signal levels depend entirely on the chips involved.|$|E

50|$|Four {{types of}} GSC cards were produced: the GIO cards {{fit into the}} larger of the two IO <b>card</b> <b>sockets</b> in the 712 workstation. Several were produced, {{including}} a second RS-232 serial port, a serial/10BaseT combo, a second graphics card and a Token Ring card.|$|R
5000|$|Mobility Radeon - A {{series of}} power-optimized {{versions}} of Radeon graphics chips {{for use in}} laptops. They introduced innovations such as modularized RAM chips, DVD (MPEG2) acceleration, notebook GPU <b>card</b> <b>sockets,</b> and [...] "PowerPlay" [...] power management technology. AMD recently announced DirectX 11-compatible versions of its mobile processors.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, a {{group of}} hobbyists at the 68k Mac Liberation Army forums {{produced}} an expansion <b>card</b> with <b>sockets</b> for an FPU and a bootable, rewriteable ROM.|$|R

5000|$|The Amiga 1000, A500, and A500+ have {{a mirror}} image of a single Zorro slot as their main {{expansion}} port - a [...] "male" [...] card edge rather than a [...] "female" [...] <b>card</b> edge <b>socket,</b> with left-handed pin configuration. The prototype expansion box for the A1000 was the basis for the initial Amiga 2000A model design.|$|R
50|$|For security, WaveLAN used a 16-bit NWID (NetWork ID) field, which yielded 65,536 {{potential}} combinations; {{the radio}} {{portion of the}} device could receive radio traffic tagged with another NWID, but the controller would discard the traffic. DES encryption (56-bit) was an option {{in some of the}} ISA and MCA cards and all of the WavePoint access points. The full-length ISA and MCA <b>cards</b> had a <b>socket</b> for an encryption chip, the half-length 915 MHz ISA cards had solder pads for a socket which was never added, and the 2.4 GHz half-length ISA cards had the chip soldered directly to the board.|$|R
50|$|Before the 16-bit ATA/IDE {{interface}}, {{there was}} an 8-bit XT-IDE (also known as XTA) interface for hard disks. It {{was not nearly as}} popular as ATA has become, and XT-IDE hardware is now fairly hard to find. Some XT-IDE adapters were available as 8-bit ISA <b>cards,</b> and XTA <b>sockets</b> were also present on the motherboards of Amstrad's later XT clones as well as a short-lived line of Philips units. The XTA pinout was very similar to ATA, but only eight data lines and two address lines were used, and the physical device registers had completely different meanings. A few hard drives (such as the Seagate ST351A/X) could support either type of interface, selected with a jumper.|$|R

50|$|The SIM card {{is located}} under the battery {{which can be}} {{accessed}} by removing the back panel of the device. The microSDHC <b>card</b> <b>socket</b> is also located under the back cover (but not under the battery). No tool is necessary to remove the back panel.|$|E
50|$|Solid Logic Technology (SLT) was IBM's {{method for}} {{packaging}} electronic circuitry introduced in 1964 with the IBM System/360 series and related machines. IBM chose to design custom hybrid circuits using discrete, flip chip-mounted, glass-encapsulated transistors and diodes, with silk screened resistors on a ceramic substrate, forming an SLT module. The circuits were either encapsulated in plastic or {{covered with a}} metal lid. Several of these SLT modules (20 in {{the image on the}} right) were then mounted on a small multi-layer printed circuit board to make an SLT card. Each SLT <b>card</b> had a <b>socket</b> on one edge that plugged into pins on the computer's backplane (the exact reverse of how most other companies' modules were mounted).|$|R
50|$|Its {{screen was}} 80 {{character}} columns by eight rows, and not backlit, but this let the NC100 run {{for up to}} 20 hours on four standard AA cell batteries. There was an RS232 serial port, a parallel port for connecting a printer, and a PC <b>card</b> <b>socket,</b> by means of which the computer's memory could be expanded up to 1 MB.|$|E
50|$|The Nokia N900 has 32 GB eMMC and 256 MB NAND {{non-removable}} storage. Additional {{storage is}} available via a hot swappable microSDHC <b>card</b> <b>socket,</b> which is claimed to support up to 64 GB of additional storage. However, the SDHC specification supports cards {{only up to}} 32 GB in size, and some difficulty has been reported {{with the use of}} 64 GB SDXC cards. Sandisk claims that SDXC cards are not compatible with the N900.|$|E

5000|$|The Latitude D8x0 {{series is}} the 15.4" [...] {{corporate}} model; unlike the D600 and D610, all feature a widescreen form factor. All are two spindle designs, with a [...] "D-bay" [...] modular bay which can interchange optical drives,a floppy module, a second hard drive, or a second battery. All models have a smart <b>card</b> <b>socket,</b> PCMCIA socket, and 9-pin serial port, a [...] "D-dock" [...] port for docking station or port replicator, {{and have an}} internal socket for an 802.11 wireless card.|$|E
50|$|The Cromemco Z-2 {{computer}} was a Z80-based microcomputer {{system that was}} introduced in 1977. The original Z-2 in kit form included a ZPU-K Z80 CPU card, S-100 bus motherboard, all-metal rack-mount chassis and dust case, <b>card</b> <b>socket</b> and card guide; the assembled form included {{a complete set of}} sockets and card guides, and a cooling fan. The Z-2 series was capable of supporting up to 21 S-100 boards and could be configured with any of the boards supplied by Cromemco.|$|E
5000|$|The Latitude D6x0 {{series is}} the 14"/14.1" [...] {{corporate}} model. It aims to combine heavy-duty power with reasonable portability, and differs primarily from D8x0 series in screen size.

All models have a smart <b>card</b> <b>socket,</b> PCMCIA socket, and 9-pin serial port, a [...] "D-dock" [...] port for docking station or port replicator, {{and have an}} internal socket for an 802.11 wireless card.|$|E
40|$|The NCN 4557 is a dual {{interface}} {{analog circuit}} designed {{to translate the}} voltages between SIM, SAM or Smart Cards and a microcontroller (or similar control device). It integrates two LDOs for power conversion and three level shifters per channel allowing the management of two independent chip cards. The device fulfills the ISO 7816 and EMV smart card interface requirements {{as well as the}} GSM and 3 G mobile standard. Due to a builtâˆ’in sequencer, the device enables automatic activation and deactivation. Through the ENABLE pin a low current shutdown mode can be activated extending the battery life. The card power supply voltage (1. 8 V or 3. 0 V) and the <b>card</b> <b>socket</b> A or B are selected using two dedicated pins (SEL 0 & SEL 1). ...|$|E
40|$|Project's primary {{objective}} was to create ventialtion control unit, which synchronizes its time through radio signal. Delivering power into fans is based on dew points calculated from data obtained {{on both sides of}} circumferential wall. The most important parts of this unit are microcontroller MC 9 S 08 DZ 60, sensor SHT 11 and DCF 77 receiver. There is SD <b>card</b> <b>socket</b> on the inner printed circuit board for data recording purposes. I am working with the card on file system layer. The control unit uses USB socked as well to be able to communicate with PC. I have decomposed firmware of control unit into small modules at the start of development. Those modules are: MCU to MCU communication, USB communication, measuring temperature and relative humidity using SHT 11 and extracting time information from DCF 77 signal, all written in C. After these modules were tested, i have put them together. I have also written a PC application in Java. It is used to communicate with control unit and to process recorded data. Benefits of the control unit cannot be evaluated without long-term observation...|$|E
