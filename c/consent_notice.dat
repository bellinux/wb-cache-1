40|$|Objectives – To {{survey and}} {{ascertain}} {{the level of}} confidence academic librarians demonstrate with regard to performing and consuming research, {{as well as to}} gather information in order to plan a curriculum that would offer professional continuing education programming for librarians interested in enhancing their research skills. Design – Web-based survey of academic librarians on their level of confidence with regard to performing and consuming research. Setting – Various email lists with academic librarians as subscribers. Subjects – 918 self-selected academic librarians who subscribe to email lists. Methods – The authors chose to gather a convenience sample of academic librarians by sending a survey via various email lists. A link to an informed <b>consent</b> <b>notice</b> was sent via the request for participation and then linked to the survey. The survey consisted of 19 questions and gathered information regarding four areas: current research practices, self-evaluation of confidence in research practice, research courses in which the participants participated either during their library and information studies (LIS) programs or through other means, and demographic information and information related to support provided by the librarians’ home institutions. The authors adapted their survey from other previously published surveys, and it was pre-tested for its effectiveness and reviewed by the Institutional Review Board. Question 10 included a confidence scale from 1 - 5 with 1 being “Not at All Confident” and 5 being “Very Confident. ” The confidence scale was used to capture respondents’ self-perceptions of their research design expertise. Various statistical tests were performed. Main Results – The authors received 918 responses to their call for participation, with 809 completing the full survey; incomplete responses were not excluded. Results indicate {{that the vast majority of}} academic librarians are focused on staying current with regard to the literature, and there is the assumption or expectation that they will do this as part of their job duties. While nearly 78 % of librarians view the table of contents of journals, fewer librarians regularly read the full content, as time is a determining factor with regard to consumption of the literature. The results show that 62 % of academic librarians have undertaken some type of research since graduating with an LIS degree, but they do not necessarily publish or disseminate their results; only 77 % of those who had done research had presented at conferences, published in a journal, or presented at their institution in an informal setting. A confidence scale was used to determine the level of confidence in performing certain research tasks, and while respondents recorded the highest level of confidence in conducting a literature review, the lowest levels of confidence were noted for the ability to design a project to test their questions and to analyze research data. Respondents were fairly confident on average with regard to turning their topics into questions, gathering data, reporting results in a written format, reporting results verbally, and identifying appropriate places to disseminate results. The authors chose to analyze two variables with regard to their question on confidence (Average Confidence and Conduct Research), as they predicted that whether librarians conduct research after completing their LIS studies was dependent upon their confidence in performing evidence-based research. After running a logistic regression analysis in SPSS, the authors found that confidence may be a predictor for research performance. With regard to training in research methods, only 26 % of respondents felt that their LIS training provided them with the background to perform research tasks. The authors analyzed the data in this instance and found that there is no statistically significant relationship between the belief that LIS training prepared them and the likelihood of performing research. The demographic section of the survey provided the authors with information regarding research support from institutions, and asked librarians if they are tenure track/promotion, promotion only, or not eligible for tenure and promotion. The results showed that 45 % were eligible for tenure, 28 % achieved tenure, 48 % had been through the tenure process, and 40 % had other degrees in addition to their LIS qualification. Conclusion – By surveying a sample of academic librarians, the authors were hoping to gather information about their confidence level, training level, and current practices with regard to research. The data was collected as a way to inform the authors as to how they could best design a curriculum for continuing education in research practice. The survey results show that academic librarians are confident with regard to consumption of the literature and developing research questions, but less confident with regard to gathering and analyzing data. The proposed curriculum would provide training on conducting research, and the authors’ eventual goal is to offer an “Institute for Research Design in Librarianship” that would help librarians, especially those who are required to do research for tenure and promotion purposes, to perform the more difficult aspects of research such as design and analysis. Librarians would complete the course and be able to return to their home institutions with the capability to perform all steps in the research process...|$|E

40|$|To be able {{to provide}} data {{collecting}} services to customers, service provides are required by law to design privacy policies and present their content to users as privacy notices that informs the user on privacy consequences and demonstrate that an explicit informed consent of the user has been collected before processing of the data. However, despite the increase in data collection by services and hence increase of privacy impact, yet privacy notices do not implement proper mechanisms that can assure that data subjects are well informed and their consent are provided with comprehension. The root of this problem is the fact that typically only theoretical description of what consent is and what it involves is offered by existing literature but no “practical” design guides are available for decision makers and practitioners on how to effectively integrate a targeted consent level in privacy notices. This thesis work addresses the need for explicit integration of <b>consent</b> in privacy <b>notice</b> designs by presenting the Extended Privacy Notice Design Space (XPNDS) construct that guides on explicitly incorporating different levels of <b>consent</b> in privacy <b>notices.</b> This thesis uses theories of eye movement in reading and technical references from computer vision for comprehension and attention determination to prove the feasibility of integrating higher level of consent in the design space that may guide to assured informed consent. The construct can be used by managers to communicate, practitioners to design, and regulators to analyze informed consent incorporation in privacy notice designs. Unlike most works available in the literature on consent which only provide theoretical opinion of what informed consent is, this work cast the conceptual consent guidelines in to a practical privacy notice design space to provide an XPNDS that guides to the practicality of achieving assured informed <b>consent</b> in privacy <b>notices.</b> It is the hope of the author that the XPNDS will be useful to both practitioners and academicians in incorporating informed <b>consent</b> in privacy <b>notice</b> designs to an assured level.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{purpose of}} this report is to obtain Council’s {{authority}} to enter into five-year lease agreements with the thirteen (13) media tenants for space {{on the main floor}} of City Hall, known as the Press Gallery, for a term commencing January 1, 2009 and expiring on December 31, 2013. This report also provides a report-back on requested amendments to the current leases in order to attain “full cost recovery”, as directed by Council. RECOMMENDATIONS The Chief Corporate Officer recommends that: 1. Lease agreements with each of the current and future (if changed during the term) City Hall media tenants on the terms and conditions as set out in Appendix “A ” of this report, together with such other terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the Chief Corporate Officer and in a form approved by the City Solicitor. 2.

40|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{this thesis}} is the rule, previously contained in section 18 (4) (d) of the Child Care Act 74 of 1983, {{in terms of}} which a mother could surrender her child {{born out of wedlock}} for adoption without the consent of its father. This section was struck down as unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court in Fraser v Children's Court, Pretoria North and others 1997 (2) SA 261 (CC), {{on the grounds that it}} violated an unmarried father’s constitutional rights to equality and non-discrimination. In the light of this judgment, this thesis seeks to articulate the constitutional parameters within which section 18 (4) (d) must be amended. The requirements of Fraser are identified and discussed. Regard is also had to other constitutional rights upon which Fraser might have been decided; in particular, an unmarried father’s right to procedural fairness, and his child’s right to family or parental care. Case law from the United States, Canada, Ireland and the European Court of Human Rights is also discussed. The end product of this examination is an exposition of the various constitutional rights which vest in the father of a child born out of wedlock. A separate exposition is given of the distinct rights which vest in all children in the adoption process. The latter set of rights is drawn both from the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 96 of 1996, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The thesis then proceeds to examine the Adoption Matters Amendment Act 56 of 1998, which was enacted in response to Fraser. The <b>consent</b> and <b>notice</b> provisions of adoption statutes in the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland and England are also examined, and compared to the provisions of the Adoption Matters Amendment Act. The object, here, is two-fold: first, to consider the practical value of this Act; and second, to consider whether it satisfies the constitutional requirements identified earlier in this thesis. The thesis concludes with suggestions for the improvement of this Act...|$|R
40|$|The stated {{objectives}} {{of parental involvement}} laws are to protect {{the health and well-being}} of minors and to encourage dialogue between parents and adolescents about pregnancy options. Yet decades of studies urge that parental involvement laws do not meet these purposes. Adding to this research, a new ethnography of professionals who implement parental involvement statutes seeks to demonstrate how <b>notice</b> and <b>consent</b> laws and the judicial bypass work in practice. Over the last two years, a non-profit organization, the National Partnership for Women 2 ̆ 6 Families, interviewed 155 lawyers, advocates, judges, health care providers, and court clerks who assist minors in every state with parental <b>notice</b> or <b>consent</b> laws and judicial bypass petitions. The National Partnership 2 ̆ 7 s final report makes clear that a significant population of minors cannot consult their parents for logistical or personal reasons, and, for that cohort, the judicial bypass is not a meaningful alternative. In only a few places can the judicial bypass system be described as a functional process in which most minors, from any part of a state, can seek a bypass without significant delay, cost, or embarrassment. This Article explains why typical proposals for reform [...] to revise statutory language, to change public perceptions of the 2 ̆ 2 good parent 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 bad teen, 2 ̆ 2 or to challenge aspects of <b>consent</b> or <b>notice</b> laws in court [...] have limited potential. I argue that those interested in easing the burden that parental involvement laws impose on young women might intervene at the level of informal decision-making. Insights from new governance scholarship show how influencing local relationships among gatekeepers of services can help overcome obstacles to reform. Generally, new governance is a method of law reform that 2 ̆ 2 responds to critiques of rights-based, state-centered, top-down litigative and regulatory strategies by turning toward experimental, flexible, collaborative public-private partnerships and by locating lawyers as problem solvers rather than as traditional advocates. 2 ̆ 2 The problem-solving method of new governance provides an approach that can address the complex web of state oversight, parental control, social stigma, and the discretion of individuallegal actors. I temper my suggestion that new governance could play a role in reform with an assessment of its risks and limitations. My purpose is not to suggest that new governance is a seamless fit for parental involvement laws or provides a clear, unproblematic path for change. My intent, rather, is to advance the current conversation among those interested in increasing minors 2 ̆ 7 access to reproductive health care services and improving the operation of parental involvement laws...|$|R

40|$|The html 5 {{specifications}} for device APIs specify browser support for static images and video, {{and discuss the}} possibility {{of support for the}} capture of sound [1]. Such data acquisition {{has the potential to be}} highly privacy invasive. An accompanying Device API Privacy Requirements draft proposes various privacy protections, including that defining APIs be naturally privacy respecting, and empowering users so that they can express privacy preferences [3]. This document emphasizes the fair information practices of <b>notice,</b> <b>consent,</b> control, but all these protections are focused on the user’s privacy. This misses a large aspect of the problem. Unlike the capture of content by a digital camera or a cellphone — both of which are likely to be visible — the capture of video and/or sound content by a browser running on the user’s desktop can be passive. The device sits and records. While the privacy protections embodied in the Device API Privacy Requirements may ensure that the device’s owner has actively assented to recording, others in recording range will not necessarily have done so. Neither the html 5 device API nor the accompanying privacy requirements address this concern. User notice is simply inadequate in this situation. Indeed, by seeking to surreptitiously record others within range without their notice, the user may be the problem. Changing technology requires changing privacy practices, and replacing the taking of photographs with recording video and sound means an adjustment of privacy protections is in order. In particular, privacy protections need to be far more dynamic than the “user notice and consent” model currently being proposed in the Device API Privacy Requirements. I propose that html 5 device APIs include a “MUST ” requirement that video or sound recording be accompanied by automatic flash or beeping occurring every fifteen seconds. Such light and/or noise will be disruptive to any within recording range, but that is exactly the point. Those who are being recorded should be made aware that recording is occurring.

40|$|Informational {{privacy is}} the ability to {{determine}} for yourself when and how others may collect and use your information. Adequate informational privacy requires a sufficiently broad ability to give or withhold free and informed consent to proposed uses. Notice and Choice (sometimes also called “notice and consent”) is the current paradigm for <b>consent</b> online. The <b>Notice</b> is a presentation of terms, typically in a privacy policy or terms of use agreement. The Choice is an action signifying acceptance of the terms, typically clicking on an “I agree” button, or simply using the website. Recent reports by the Federal Trade Commission explicitly endorse the Notice and Choice approach (and provide guidelines for its implementation). When the Notice contains information about data collection and use, the argument for Notice and Choice rests on two claims. First: a fully adequate implementation of the paradigm would ensure that website visitors can give free and informed consent to data collection and use practices. Second: the combined effect of all the individual decisions is an acceptable overall tradeoff between privacy and the benefits of collecting and using consumers’ data. There are (we contend) decisive critiques of both claims. So why do policy makers and privacy advocates continue to endorse Notice and Choice? Most likely, they see no need to seek an alternative. We find the critique of Notice and Choice conclusive, but our assessment is far from widely shared—and understandably so. Criticisms of Notice and Choice are scattered over several articles and books. No one has unified them and answered the obvious counterarguments. We do so. Making the critique plain, however, is not enough to ensure that policy makers turn to a viable alternative. The critiques are entirely negative; they do not offer any alternative to Notice and Choice. We offer an alternative: informational norms. When appropriate informational norms govern online data collection and use, they both ensure that visitors give free and informed consent to those practices, and yield an acceptable overall tradeoff between protecting privacy and the benefits of processing information. A fundamental difficulty is the lack of norms. Rapid advances in information processing technology have fueled new business models, and the rapid development has outpaced the slow evolution of norms. Notice and Choice cannot be pressed into service to remedy this lack. It is necessary to develop new norms...|$|R

In the aftermath of the ChoicePoint debacle and other major information security breaches, both of us have been asked by Congressional legislative staffers, state legislative policymakers, journalists, academics, and others about what specifically should be done to better regulate information privacy. In response to these questions, we believe that it is imperative to have a discussion of concrete legislative solutions to privacy problems. What appears below is our attempt at such an endeavor. Privacy experts have long suggested that information collection be consistent with Fair Information Practices. This Model Regime incorporates many of those practices and applies them specifically to the context of commercial data brokers such as ChoicePoint. We hope that this will provide useful guidance to legislators and policymakers in crafting laws and regulations. We also intend this to be a work-in-progress in which we collaborate with others. We have welcomed input from other academics, policymakers, journalists, and experts {{as well as from the}} industries and businesses that will be subject to the regulations we propose. We have incorporated criticisms and constructive suggestions, and we will continue to update this Model Regime to include the comments we find most helpful and illuminating. <b>Notice,</b> <b>Consent,</b> Control, and Access 1.
