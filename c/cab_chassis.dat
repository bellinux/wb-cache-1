2500|$|The Melbourne Motor Omnibus Co Ltd was {{the first}} motor bus {{operator}} in Melbourne. The business was formed to introduce motor buses in Melbourne. The business commenced operations with the importing of a Daimler CC bus from England {{where it would be}} put to exhaustive tests under local conditions. The bus would hold 20 persons inside and 14 to 16 on the upper deck. The bus was to be imported as a complete vehicle, with the idea being that in future buses would be imported in <b>cab</b> <b>chassis</b> configuration with local Australian coach builders able to make the bus body following the example from the test vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, {{using the}} Australia Only {{civilian}} 4BD1 powered 110 as a basis, JRA developed a military {{version of the}} 4BD1 110 model for competitive trials against vehicles supplied by Chrysler JEEP, Mercedes and Toyota conducted by the Australian Army Testing Establishment. [...] Land Rover was the successful candidate and the Australian Army ordered several thousand 110 Land Rovers in various configurations made to this specification, called the Land Rover Perentie, {{some of which were}} 6x6 drive. Six wheel drive Perenties were fitted with a turbocharged 3.9L Isuzu diesel engine (4BD1-T), while the 4x4 versions were powered by the naturally aspirated variant (4BD1). The Australian Army vehicles were assembled at the Jaguar Rover Australia (JRA) facility at Moorebank, NSW, from locally made components and other components from the UK and Japan. Between 1981 and 1990, the Isuzu 4BD1 engine was the only diesel option available for Land Rover in Australia. [...] All 110 <b>cab</b> <b>chassis</b> Defenders sold in Australia during this time had a wheelbase of 120 inches in order to accommodate an 8ft x 6ft tray. A small number of 6x6 <b>cab</b> <b>chassis</b> Defenders were also made by JRA during this time.While the Land Rover has been in use in the Australian military from 1959, as a consumer product from the 1970s, it fell out of favour as a 4x4 work vehicle while offerings from Toyota and Nissan increased in popularity. [...] Mid-2009, Land Rover expanded the model range to include 110 and 130 cab-chassis, panel van and HCPU versions, and late in the year announced the re-introduction of the 90 4x4 model for sale from early 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The Holden Kingswood {{is at the}} 'everymans' {{level of}} the {{full-size}} car range that was manufactured in Australia by Holden, {{from the beginning of}} the HK series in 1968 through to the conclusion of the WB series in 1984. Prior to 1968, the full-size Holden range of family cars comprised the Holden Standard the Holden Special and Holden Premier models. Initially, the HK range of models included the basic Holden Belmont (replacing the Standard), the Kingswood (replacing the Special), and the luxury-oriented Holden Premier, all of which were manufactured in a choice of sedan and station wagon bodies. Commercial variants were offered in three types: coup√© utility, panel van, and later from 1971, a heavy-duty Holden One Tonner <b>cab</b> <b>chassis.</b> The utility (ute) version was originally marketed in both Belmont and Kingswood configurations. However, after the Belmont name was deleted from commercials at the end of HQ in late 1974, the base model commercials were sold only with the [...] "Holden" [...] badge (the Belmont name continued on sedan and wagon variants until the end of the HX series).|$|E
