40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine what, if any, differential effect various commonly used <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>preparations</b> had on the numbers and specific functions of lymphocyte subpopulations when these agents were administered in equivalent pharmacological dosages. Normal volunteers received a single dose of either 320 mg of hydrocortisone intravenously, 80 mg of prednisone orally, or 12 mg of dexamethasone orally. There was a marked lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia maximal 4 - 6 hr following administration of all three <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>preparations</b> with almost identical kinetics and degree of fall in total cell numbers as well as proportions of thymus-derived and bone marrow-derived lymphocytes. Hydrocortisone and prednisone caused only a slight suppression of phytohaemagglutiinin (PHA) induced lymphocyte blastogensis which could be reversed at supra-optimal concentrations of PHA. On the contrary, dexamethasone administration casued a marked suppression of PHA responses which was not reversed by supra-optimal PHA stimulation. In addition, hydrocortisone and prednisone administration did not suppress non-specific PHA-induced cellular cytotoxcity, while dexamethasone caused a marked suppression (P less than 0. 001) of cytotoxicity. These studies show that although equivalent anti-inflammatory doses of these three <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>preparations</b> cause almost identical suppression of the numbers of circulating lymphocyte populations, they have a differential effect of the numbers of circulating lymphocyte populations, they have a differential effect on a certain in vitro functional correlates of cell-mediated immunity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Carboxymethylcellulose is a {{carbohydrate}} {{widely used}} as additive in tablets, cosmetics, some injectable hormone formulations, food (as E 466) and as active principle in hydrocolloid dressings.

40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the recent report by Lyders andMorris 1 of their case of spinal cord infarction following lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection. We would like to highlight {{the fact that not}} all <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>preparations</b> are associated with the same risk of embolization. 2 There are 4 types of <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>preparations</b> com-monly administered in clinical practice: methylprednisolone acetate (MPA), triamcinolone acetonide, betamethasone acetate, and dexa-methasone sodium phosphate (DSP). The first 3 of these corticoste-roid preparations are insoluble microcrystalline suspensions with varying potential to aggregate into larger particulates. Individual crys-tal sizes can range from 20 to 150 m, which compares with an aver-age red blood cell size of 7. 5 m. DSP, on the other hand, is com-pletely soluble and clear of particulates at high-magnification microscopy. A recently published in vivo animal study has compared the effects on the central nervous system (CNS) of the intra-arterial passage of insoluble MPA versus soluble DSP. 3 This demonstrated that all ani-mals that receivedMPAhad serious neurologic sequelae and required ventilatory support. None of the animals that received an intra-arte-rial injection of soluble DSP had noticeable deficits. On the basis of the current best evidence in the literature (case reports, animal experimentation, and in vitro microscopy), we sug-gest no longer performing transforaminal injections (cervical, tho-racic, or lumbar) with insoluble <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>preparations.</b> 2 We suggest using only DSP for these procedures. We believe this reduces, if not removes, the risk of CNS embolization during the procedure. The only potential negative aspect of using DSP is the lack of data on the long-term efficacy of DSP compared with insoluble corticoste-roids. A recent publication suggests there is {{no significant difference in the}} short term. 4 References 1. LydersEM,Morris PP.

40|$|The {{prescribing}} of unlicensed and {{off label}} medicines to children {{has become an}} area of concern due to risks of toxicity and side effects or suboptimal therapy.   Current efforts to reduce this practice have so far concentrated on encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to conduct paediatric clinical trails where appropriate {{to increase the number}} of medicines licensed for paediatric use in the future.   This work investigated off label prescribing, homeopathic prescribing and the co-prescribing of corticosteroid preparations in primary care in order to highlight other target areas for improving paediatric prescribing. Results: At least 1 off label prescription was issued to 17715 (26. 1 %) children.   Prescribing outside the recommended dose was the most common from of off label prescribing with prescribing trends and GP responses to the questionnaire indicating that this may be inadvertent due to the wide variation in dose related age bandings for paediatric medicines.   Homeopathic medicines were most commonly prescribed to infants (1. 1 %) with self-limiting conditions.   GPs with a favourable opinion were found to influence the opinions of their partners. The co-prescribing of inhaled and nasal corticosteroids was common particularly in adolescents with the majority receiving a high total steroid burden. Conclusions: Off label prescribing in primary care could be reduced by standardising dose related age bandings for medicines based on major childhood physiological and developmental stages. Increased training in homeopathy and the presence of an interested partner may facilitate communication and ensure children receive optimal therapy. For children chronically prescribed more than one <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>preparation</b> consideration should be given to the total daily steroid burden to minimise potential adverse effects on growth and development.

Material and methods. In experiment on seven adult individuals of rabbits of breed the Chinchilla (fourteen eyes) eye drops Kombinil — Duo, containing in quality of the main substance ciprofloxacin (3 mg / ml) and dexamethasone (1 mg / ml) are tested. Determination of concentration of the main substances of studied preparations in moisture of the eye camera carried out a method of a highly effective liquid chromatography (VEZhH) in combination with mass and spectrometer detecting (MS) on the liquid Shimadzu LC- 20 AB chromatograph with the mass and selective detector Shimadzu LCMS- 2010 EV (ESI). Results and conclusion. The maximum concentration of ciprofloxacin in moisture of the forward camera of rabbits eye made 0, 25 mkg / ml, and minimum — 0, 06 mkg / ml, average concentration — 0, 13 ± 0, 06 mkg / ml. The anti-inflammatory component presented by dexamethasone in a studied eye form, is defined in the range from 0, 14  to 0, 63 mkg / ml. Average concentration of dexamethasone equaled 0, 24 ± 0, 12 mkg / ml.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{document}} {{and evaluate the}} outcome of side to side comparisons of different corticosteroids in determining the most effective topical treatment for individuals admitted to hospital for control of atopic dermatitis.  METHODS—Retrospective case note study of 82 admissions (66 children) to a children's hospital for treatment of atopic dermatitis between 1 June 1993 and 31 October 1995. Different topical corticosteroid ointments were applied to {{the two sides of}} the body.

Incorporation of an antimicrobial agent did not appear to increase the efficacy of a preparation.  CONCLUSIONS—The management of atopic dermatitis is bedevilled by considerable spontaneous fluctuations in severity, leading to uncertainty as to whether a new treatment is beneficial; a coincidental flare up of the skin lesions may be wrongly attributed to a particular treatment, which is then discarded. Comparing different topical treatments simultaneously on opposite sides of the body is a feasible and rational way to determine the optimum treatment for an individual with atopic dermatitis. ...|$|R

The cutaneous lesions tend to appear early in life. Although urticaria pigmentosa {{has been reported in}} 12 pairs of twins and one set of triplets, the majority of affected individuals have no familial association. Most patients with systemic mastocytosis have skin lesions; however, an occasional patient will have systemic disease with no other skin features than flushing. In lesional cutaneous sites and in non-lesional skin, there is {{an increase in the number}} of mast cells. Electron microscopy shows quantitative differences between lesional skin mast cells from patients with and without systemic disease. The mast cells from adult patients with systemic disease have a larger mean cytoplasmic area, nuclear size, and granule diameter. The granules contain predominantly grating/lattice structures. The cutaneous mast cells contain tryptase and chymase. They retain their functional reactivities to relevant secretory stimuli, such as C 3 a, morphine sulfate, and calcium ionophore A 23187. Lesional skin contains histamine, leukotriene B 4, prostaglandin D 2, 5 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, platelet-activating factor, and heparin. Treatment of the cutaneous manifestations includes the use of H 1 and H 2 antihistamines, oral disodium cromoglycate, psoralens plus ultraviolet A photochemotherapy, and potent topical <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>preparations...</b>|$|R
