Fruit processing, manufactory of compotes, manufactory of metal packaging products, corrosion of cans, chemical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in food, its potential toxicity, {{possibilities for the}} determination <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in food and characterization of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry are described in theoretical part. In experimental part, ICP-OES technique was firstly optimized and then 28 different compotes purchased at common stores were analysed. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> was determined only in fruit juice due to the easier sample preparation, even though quantity <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in the solid part and in the juice can differ. However, the difference is not too big. Measured concentrations <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> were compared with the maximum permissible level <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in canned food determined by European legislation. None of them exceed the 200 mg/kg level. When processing the results, {{it was found that}} the coating of the can has a significant influence on the content <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in canned fruits.

After the mixture cooled, the tin oxide crystallises as what has been mentioned above, therefore generates the so-called white tin-opacified glazes.

Biscuit tin manufacture was a small but prestigious part of the vast industry <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> plate production, which saw a huge increase in demand in the 19th century was directly related to the growing industrialisation of food production, by increasingly sophisticated methods of preservation and the requirements made by changing methods of distribution.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{no record}} <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> mining in Domesday Book, {{possibly}} because the rights were Crown property.

5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the use <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> oxide, it is mainly viewed as a slip layer between the glaze and ceramic body.
