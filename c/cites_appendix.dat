5|$|All {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} except the cockatiel {{are protected by}} the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts import and export of wild-caught parrots to special licensed purposes. Five cockatoo species (including all subspecies)—the Tanimbar corella (Cacatua goffiniana), red-vented cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia), Moluccan cockatoo (Cacatua moluccensis), yellow-crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea) and palm cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus)—are protected on the <b>CITES</b> <b>Appendix</b> I list.

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} {{is threatened by}} the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Moreover, the unusual four-horned skull and the horns have been a popular target for trophy hunters. In India, the species is protected under Schedule I the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the Nepalese population is listed in <b>CITES</b> <b>Appendix</b> III. The {{four-horned antelope}} is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Cameroon is {{the only}} nation with a {{national}} law protecting this species. This law prohibits killing the rockfowl, though it can be captured with a proper permit. International trading of the grey-necked rockfowl is governed under <b>CITES</b> <b>Appendix</b> I, meaning that legal trading of this species is only authorized in extraordinary circumstances. In 2006 BirdLife International drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species. This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|N. menagensis {{is listed}} in <b>CITES</b> <b>Appendix</b> I, which {{prevents}} international commercial trade; it is also protected by Indonesian law. The species is often confused with other slow lorises in animal rescue centers, as it is not well-covered in field guides. The species occurs {{in a number of}} protected areas throughout its range, including some fragmented forests. Threats to the species include the illegal local exotic pet trade and habitat loss due to burning and conversion to palm oil plantations. Additionally, uncontrolled release of pets in some areas is also a threat to the species.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) {{lists the}} serval as least concern; {{the animal is}} also {{included}} in <b>CITES</b> <b>Appendix</b> II. A major threat {{to the survival of}} the serval include the degradation of wetlands and grasslands. Trade of serval skins, though on the decline, still occurs in countries such as Benin and Senegal. In western Africa, the serval has significance in traditional medicine. Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their animals, though servals generally do not prey upon livestock.|$|E
5|$|These species {{live in a}} {{wide variety}} of habitats, ranging from dry {{deciduous}} forests to rainforests, and run quadrupedally across branches. Their diet consists primarily of tree gum and other exudates, though they may obtain some of their protein and nitrogen by hunting small arthropods later at night. Three of the four species are endangered and the other is listed as vulnerable. Their populations are in decline due to habitat destruction. Like all lemurs, they are protected against commercial trade under <b>CITES</b> <b>Appendix</b> I.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of <b>CITES</b> <b>Appendix</b> I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law enforcement {{is involved in the}} trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of slow lorises for medicinal purposes. The wife of another law enforcement official from the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia {{is one of the most}} notable sellers of slow loris parts.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{of giant}} mouse lemurs include the Madagascar buzzard, Madagascar owl, fossa, and the narrow-striped mongoose. Giant mouse lemurs {{reproduce}} once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day gestation. Babies are initially {{left in the}} nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild {{is thought to be}} five to six years. Both species are listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under <b>CITES</b> <b>Appendix</b> I, which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The Duke Lemur Center coordinated the captive breeding of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to <b>CITES</b> <b>Appendix</b> I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok. Numerous illegal trade routes for each species were also documented prior to the 2007 CITES vote over Appendix I coverage in the Notification to Parties publication.|$|E
