25|$|The vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) band (100–200nm) can {{be generated}} by non-linear 4 wave mixing in gases by sum or difference frequency mixing of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers. The generation is generally done in gasses (e.g. krypton, hydrogen which are two-photon resonant near 193nm) or metal vapors (e.g. magnesium). By making one of the lasers tunable, the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified. However, resonances also generate wavelength dispersion, and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the 4 wave mixing. Difference frequency mixing (lambda1 + lambda2 − lambda3) has an advantage over sum frequency mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning. In particular, difference frequency mixing two photons of an ArF (193nm) excimer laser with a tunable visible or near IR laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable VUV covering from 100nm to 200nm. Practically, the lack of suitable gas/vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride <b>cut-off</b> <b>wavelength</b> limit the tuning range to longer than about 110nm.

40|$|Clouds are {{affected}} by aspects of climate change and are a major influencing factor on the pre-vitamin D 3 effective solar UV (UVD 3) exposures that humans receive. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the influence of clouds on the short <b>wavelength</b> <b>cut-off</b> of the spectral UVD 3 irradiances, on the maximum of the UVD 3 spectral irradiances and on the magnitude of the UVD 3 irradiances. The spectral pre-vitamin D 3 effective solar UV irradiances on a horizontal plane were calculated by weighting the spectral UV measured every five minutes by a spectroradiometer with the action spectrum for the synthesis of pre-vitamin D 3. The short <b>wavelength</b> <b>cut-off</b> was defined as the wavelength at which the UVD 3 irradiances were 0. 1 % of the maximum biologically damaging irradiance for that scan. Due to the higher relative effectiveness of the action spectrum at the shorter UV wavelengths, any variations will influence the UVD 3 exposures and consequently has public health implications. The short <b>wavelength</b> <b>cut-off,</b> the magnitude of the irradiances and the maximum of the UVD 3 spectral irradiances were investigated for a range of solar zenith angles for cloud free cases and cloudy cases. The results show that clouds do not influence the short <b>wavelength</b> <b>cut-off</b> or the <b>wavelength</b> at which the maximum spectral UVD 3 irradiance occurs. However, cloud cover higher than 5. 5 octa reduces the amount of biologically effective UV for pre-vitamin D 3 production.
