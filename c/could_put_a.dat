For a few seasons, prior to Fuller Pilch's departure for Kent about 1835, Norfolk <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> fairly strong eleven into the field. Their only major county opponent, however, was Sheffield Cricket Club (playing as Yorkshire) and the five games they played in 1833, 1834 (twice), 1835 and 1836 are important.|$|E

25|$|While we {{have not}} shown the Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a white box and a dark box, neither one containing a circle. However we <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant takes no arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a unary operation.|$|E
25|$|David Mirvish's father, Ed Mirvish, was {{proprietor}} of Honest Ed's, a landmark discount retailer established in Toronto in 1948. In 1952, he purchased {{a house on}} Markham Street to expand backwards, using original tactics to thwart the area's residential zoning. In 1959, the ward's alderman was displeased by traffic jams near the store, and persuaded City Council to adopt a 1960 report urging the store to build a parking lot. The neighbourhood, which had originally supported {{the construction of a}} parking lot, now opposed rezoning to allow it under a new alderman. Mirvish <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> lot behind the Victorian houses, but could not tear them down.|$|E
25|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} held on 7 June, the AKP gained 40.87% of the vote and 258 seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi, TBMM). Though it still remains the biggest party in Turkey, the AKP lost its status as the majority party {{and the power to}} form a single-party government. Until then it had held this majority without interruption for 13 years since it had come to power in 2002. Also, in this election, the AKP was pushing to gain 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly so that it <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> series of constitutional changes to a referendum, one of them was to switch Turkey from the current parliamentary government to an American-style executive presidency government. This pursuit met with a series of oppositions and criticism from the opposition parties and their supporters, fearing the measure would give more unchecked power to the current President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has been drawing fierce criticisms both from home and abroad for his active role in the election, abandoning the traditional presidential role of maintaining a more neutral and impartial position in elections by his predecessors in the office. The result of the Kurdish issues-centred Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey), HDP, breaking through the 10% threshold to achieve 13.12% out of the total votes cast and gaining 80 seats in the Grand National Assembly in this election successfully derailed the AKP from maintaining its hold of power as the majority party and a single-party government as well as enacting a referendum necessary to change the constitution. The AKP is now forced to form a coalition government in negotiation with other parties.|$|E

500|$|Angelo {{was forced}} to help Nicole {{give birth to a}} baby boy, George, and she handed him over to Marilyn {{immediately}} as agreed. She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was alone with him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] Nicole was unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby. Of the breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> big strain on their relationship." [...] After the incident, Nicole is asked by Marylin, {{to stay away from the}} baby. James defended Nicole stating: [...] "I think it's hard to not bond, but this is Marilyn's baby, and Nicole is so young and wants very much to give Marilyn and Sid this gift." ...|$|E

Charles responded by {{pointing}} at a horse in a field by Ninian Park and telling Scoular [...] "you <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> number eight shirt on him and he would run all day – but he wouldn't score a fucking hat-trick for you!" [...] Scoular responded to this outburst by telling Charles that he had played his last game for Cardiff and could look for a new club.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first team}} to play {{baseball}} under modern rules was long {{believed to be the}} New York Knickerbockers. The club was founded on September 23, 1845, as a social club for the upper middle classes of New York City, and was strictly amateur until it disbanded. The club's by-laws committee, which included William R. Wheaton and William H. Tucker, formulated the Knickerbocker Rules, which in large part dealt with organizational matters but which also laid out rules for playing the game. [...] One of the significant rules prohibited soaking or plugging the runner; under older rules, a fielder <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> runner out by hitting the runner with the thrown ball, similarly to the common schoolyard game of kickball. The Knickerbocker Rules required fielders to tag or force the runner, as is done today, and avoided a lot of the arguments and fistfights that resulted from the earlier practice. A recently discovered newspaper interview with Wheaton indicates that the rules he and Tucker wrote for the Knickerbockers in most respects duplicated the rules he had written for the Gotham Club in 1837; the Knickerbockers were founded as a breakaway group of former Gothams.|$|E
2500|$|On July 29, 2007, Ichiro {{collected}} his 1,500th U.S. hit, {{the third}} fastest {{to reach the}} MLB milestone behind Al Simmons and George Sisler. Ichiro had 213 hits in 2008, his eighth straight 200-hit season. This tied the 107-year-old record set by Wee Willie Keeler. Typically, Ichiro was among baseball's leaders in reaching base on an error (14 times in 2008, {{more than any other}} batter in the AL), and in infield hits (his 56 were the most in the majors). Ichiro has amassed more than 450 infield hits in his U.S. career. Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge told the New York Times, [...] "I wish you <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> camera at third base to see how he hits the ball and see the way it deceives you. You can call some guys’ infield hits cheap, but not his. He has amazing technique." [...] In May 2008, Ichiro stole two bases, giving him a career total of 292, surpassing the previous Seattle Mariners team record of 290 set by second baseman Julio Cruz. Cruz, who now does Spanish-language broadcasts of Mariners games, was watching from the broadcast booth as Ichiro broke his record.|$|E
2500|$|Jason Francia, {{the son of}} {{a former}} Neverland maid, was the only alleged prior victim to testify. [...] Francia {{described}} three times he had been playing with Jackson: they were tickling each other, and Jackson ended up tickling Francia's [...] "little private region" [...] outside of his clothes for a few minutes each time, with Francia laughing all the while. Francia testified that the third time, Jackson had reached up the leg of Francia's shorts and touched his testicles. Francia claimed he needed five years of therapy because of the ordeal. [...] He received settlement money from Jackson, and testified that he thought he deserved even more. [...] Francia also admitted that he and his mother had sold stories of his alleged inappropriate tickling to the tabloids. When Jason Francia originally talked to the police after the 1993 allegations, he told them he had never been touched inappropriately. [...] He made that claim only after extensive police questioning in which they repeatedly called Jackson a [...] "molester" [...] and told Jason that Macaulay Culkin was being molested right then and Jason <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> stop to it if he confessed. Francia also testified that Jackson gave him money after each tickling incident, mirroring something Francia said in his original police interview: that Jackson would give him money each time he finished reading a book or got an 'A'.|$|E
