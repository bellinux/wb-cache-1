25|$|A {{ruptured}} AAA is {{a clinical}} diagnosis involving {{the presence of}} the triad of abdominal pain, shock, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. If these conditions are present, indicating AAA rupture, no further <b>clinical</b> <b>investigations</b> are needed before surgery.|$|E
25|$|Because of his <b>clinical</b> <b>investigations</b> {{into the}} anemia caused by {{hookworm}} infestation, Ashford {{was inspired to}} organize and conduct a parasite treatment campaign. It cured approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population) and reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, some {{small-scale}} <b>clinical</b> <b>investigations</b> of lovastatin, a polyketide-derived {{natural product}} isolated from Aspergillus terreus, in very high-risk patients were undertaken, in which dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed, {{with very few}} adverse effects. After the additional animal safety studies with lovastatin revealed no toxicity of the type thought {{to be associated with}} compactin, clinical studies continued.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the {{analysis}} of saliva should be performed, as it constitutes the environment of taste receptors, including transport of tastes to the receptor and protection of the taste receptor. Typical <b>clinical</b> <b>investigations</b> involve sialometry and sialochemistry. Studies have shown that electron micrographs of taste receptors obtained from saliva samples indicate pathological changes in the taste buds of patients with dysgeusia and other gustatory disorders.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, surgery of the tetraplegic {{upper limb}} {{experienced}} a revival after Moberg’s <b>clinical</b> <b>investigations.</b> His main contributions were (1) to restore elbow extension through {{transfer of the}} posterior deltoid to triceps (the initial procedure); and (2) to reconstruct a key pinch. Moberg’s idea of posterior deltoid transfer to restore elbow extension has been used extensively by many surgeons, such as Bryan and DeBenedetti.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, {{understanding}} of the tenodesis effect (See Tenodesis grasp) inﬂuenced the development of surgical techniques such as the static ﬂexor tenodesis. These procedures provided the basic functions of grasp and pinch. Tendon transfers were developed to accomplish both digital release and gripping functions in two surgical stages. The originators of these procedures were Lipscomb et al. , Zancolli, House et al. House et al. contributed important <b>clinical</b> <b>investigations</b> while showing the value of different surgical procedures.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, Adrian and Matthew noticed {{potential}} {{changes of}} the occipital EEG can be observed under stimulation of light. Ciganek developed the first nomenclature for occipital EEG components in 1961. During that same year, Hirsch and colleagues recorded a visual evoked potential (VEP) on the occipital lobe (externally and internally), and they discovered amplitudes recorded along the calcarine fissure were the largest. In 1965, Spehlmann used a checkerboard stimulation to describe human VEPs. An attempt to localize structures in the primary visual pathway was completed by Szikla and colleagues. Halliday and colleagues completed the first <b>clinical</b> <b>investigations</b> using VEP by recording delayed VEPs in a patient with retrobulbar neuritis in 1972. A wide variety of extensive research to improve procedures and theories has been conducted from the 1970s to today and the method has also been described in animals.|$|E

2500|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} overcoming hypoxia including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks, hyperthermia therapy (heat therapy which dilates blood vessels to the tumor site), blood substitutes that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs such as misonidazole and metronidazole, and hypoxic cytotoxins (tissue poisons), such as tirapazamine.

2500|$|The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is an open-access, {{integrated}} ontology for {{the description}} of biological and <b>clinical</b> <b>investigations.</b> [...] OBI provides {{a model for the}} design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the materials used, the data generated and the type of analysis performed on it. [...] The project is being developed as part of the OBO Foundry and as such adheres to all the principles therein such as orthogonal coverage (i.e. clear delineation from other foundry member ontologies) and the use of a common formal language. [...] In OBI the common formal language used is the Web Ontology Language (OWL). [...] As of March 2008, a pre-release version of the ontology was made available at the project's SVN repository.|$|E
