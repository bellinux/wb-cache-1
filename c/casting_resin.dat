Acrylic glass can be molded into a variety of forms, and corporations will often create custom promotional items shaped like their products. They are manufactured by pouring acrylic <b>casting</b> <b>resin</b> into a mold. Embedments are acrylic trophies that have an item embedded into the resin. Many materials can be placed in an embedment - paper, metal, acetate sheets, etc. This creates the effect of an item floating within the acrylic statue.|$|E

40|$|Imagemaking is a {{universal}} impulse experienced by all human cultures. In the continual pursuit to create compelling and engaging forms, efforts to permit images to interact in dynamic ways in extended space {{have been the subject}} of considerable exploration. The often sought-after goal is to break the surface of the paper without sacrificing the essence of the image. My current research is the investigation of Smooth-On 300 series Semi-Rigid Urethane <b>Casting</b> <b>Resin</b> and its interaction with various laser jet inks on diverse paper or paper analogous mediums. Purely on accident, it was discovered that one could easily transfer printed images onto the <b>casting</b> <b>resin</b> if it was poured directly on the print. This has allowed for a method of image manipulation in a manner that has yet to be thoroughly explored. Several experimental pours and projects have been completed to test the limits and potentiality of this new media.
