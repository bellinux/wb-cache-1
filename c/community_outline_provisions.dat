30|$|Let us now {{consider}} a fourth alternative motivation for community detection, {{focusing on the}} processes that {{take place on the}} network. All notions of <b>community</b> <b>outlined</b> above are effectively structural {{in the sense that they}} are mainly concerned with the composition of the graph itself or its representation as an adjacency matrix, respectively. However, in many cases one of the main goals of applying tools from network science is to understand the behavior of a system. While the topology of a system puts constraints on the dynamics that can take place on the network, the network topology alone cannot explain the system behavior. Whence, instead of finding a coarse grained description of the adjacency matrix, we might be interested in finding a coarse grained description of the dynamics acting on top of the network.|$|R
