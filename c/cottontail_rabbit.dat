There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.|$|E
5|$|Mammals include white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, Virginia opossum, gray fox, red fox, {{and eastern}} <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Other mammals include: nutria, fox squirrel, gray squirrel, flying squirrel, chipmunk, brown bat, and weasel. Birds include {{cardinals}} (the state bird), barred owls, Carolina chickadees, red-tailed hawks, ospreys, brown pelicans, quail, seagulls, bald eagles, and wild turkeys.

Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish.

40|$|Francisella tularensis is {{a highly}} virulent {{bacterium}} {{that is capable of}} causing severe disease (tularemia) {{in a wide range of}} species. This organism is characterized into two distinct subspecies: tularensis (type A) and holarctica (type B) which vary in several crucial ways, with some type A strains having been found to be considerably more virulent in humans and laboratory animals. <b>Cottontail</b> <b>rabbits</b> have been widely implicated as a reservoir species for this subspecies; however, experimental inoculation in our laboratory revealed type A organisms to be highly virulent, resulting in 100 % mortality following challenge with 50 - 100 organisms. Inoculation of <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbits</b> with the same number of organisms from type B strains of bacteria was found to be rarely lethal and to result in a robust humoral immune response. The objective of this study was to characterize the protection afforded by a prior challenge with type B strains against a later inoculation with a type A strain in North American <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbits</b> (Sylvilagus spp). Previous infection with a type B strain of organism was found to lengthen survival time and in some cases prevent death following inoculation with a type A 2 strain of F. tularensis. In contrast, inoculation of a type A 1 b strain was uniformly lethal in <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbits</b> irrespective of a prior type B inoculation. These findings provide important insight about the role <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbits</b> may play in environmental maintenance and transmission of this organism...|$|R

25|$|The larger megafauna {{which once}} {{inhabited}} the High Alleghenies—elk, bison, mountain lion—were all exterminated during the 19th century.

Naturalist John James Audubon reported that by 1851 a few eastern elk (Cervus canadensis canadiensis) could still be found in the Alleghany Mountains but that by then they were virtually gone from the remainder of their range. Mammals in the Allegheny region today include whitetail deer, chipmunk, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, opossum, weasel, field mouse, flying squirrel, <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbit,</b> gray foxes, red foxes, gray squirrels, red squirrels and a cave bat. Bobcat, snowshoe hare, wild boar and black bear and coyote are also found in the forests and parks of the Alleghenies. Mink and beaver are much less often seen.|$|E

500|$|Some animals, {{previously}} {{present in}} abundance, have disappeared, or the populations declined, through habitat loss. By 1912, after the forests had been clearcut, Quehanna {{was covered by}} [...] "vast expanses of brush, created when the root systems of cut-off trees sprouted up through the discarded tops and limbs of the logged forest". Once the forest fires were controlled, this brush offered habitat for many game species. By the early 1940s, the CCC had thinned brush in many areas, and the forest had matured. Shade from the canopy decreased brush in the understory. By the early 21st century, many of the trees in Quehanna were 80 to 100 years old, and the maturation of the forests led to the disappearance of species like bobwhite quail, ring-necked pheasant, and snowshoe hare; white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, black squirrel, and <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbit</b> all became less common. Efforts by the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association (MCSA) to reintroduce bobwhite quail, ring-necked pheasant, and snowshoe hare have been unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Susan Stranahan's Susquehanna: River of Dreams {{reports that}} before Curtiss-Wright {{took over the}} area in 1955, Quehanna was {{considered}} [...] "some of the best hunting land in the state". No hunting or fishing were initially allowed on the leased land, but by July 1959 fishing on Mosquito Creek was allowed again, as was limited hunting to help control the deer. In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright. As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allowed hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, bobwhite quail, <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbit,</b> coyote, elk, house sparrow, raccoon, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock. The Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association has sponsored an annual coyote hunt each winter hunt since 1992.

40|$|Our {{attention}} was recently called to a disease occurring in wild <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbits</b> in northwestern Iowa. I Rabbits shot there by bunters {{were said to}} have numerous born-like protuberances on the skin over various parts of their bodies. The animals were referred to popularly as "horned " or "warty " rabbits. Warts from a naturally occurring case of the disease in Iowa were obtained and sent to the laboratory in sterile 50 per cent glycerol. These glycerolated warts furnished us our original material for investigation. A little later, in a shipment of a dozen wild <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbits</b> from southern Kansas, three were found to be affected with the same wart-like disease.
