The window line has a slight upward incline and the roof features Volkswagen’s trademark curves and the <b>concise</b> <b>styling</b> of the C-pillar provides aspects {{that are actually}} reminiscent of a coupe. At the rear, the large horizontally divided rear lights and sculptured panels complete a design that is classically Volkswagen.|$|R

60|$|At {{least as}} late as the Norman conquest the Wantsum {{remained}} a navigable channel, and the usual route to London by sea was in at Sandwich and out at Northmouth. It was thus that King Harold's fleet sailed on its plundering expedition round the coast of Kent (a small unexplained incident of the early English type, only to be understood by the analogies of later Scotch history), and thus too, that many other expeditions are described in the <b>concise</b> <b>style</b> of our unsophisticated early historians. But from the eleventh century onward we hear little of the Wantsum as a navigable channel; it has dwindled down almost entirely to Sandwich Haven, 'the most famous of English ports,' says the writer of the life of Emma of Normandy, about 1050. Sandwich is indeed the oldest of the Cinque Ports, succeeding in this matter to the honours of Rutupiæ, and all through the middle ages it remained the great harbour for continental traffic. Edward III. sailed thence for France or Flanders, and {{as late as}} 1446 it is still spoken of by a foreign ambassador as the resort of ships from all quarters of Europe.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} web-based distance education places high demand on distance educators to format web pages to facilitate learning. However, limited guidelines exist regarding appropriate writing styles for web-based distance education. This {{study investigated the}} effect of four different writing styles on reader’s mental representation of hypertext. Participants studied hypertext written in one of four web-writing <b>styles</b> (e. g., <b>concise,</b> scannable, objective, and combined) and were then administered a cued association task intended to measure their mental representations of the hypertext. It is hypothesized that the scannable and combined styles will bias readers to scan rather than elaborately read, which may result in less dense mental representations (as identified through Pathfinder analysis) relative to the objective and <b>concise</b> writing <b>styles.</b> Further, the use of more descriptors in the objective writing style will lead to better integration of ideas and more dense mental representations than the <b>concise</b> writing <b>style...</b>|$|R

The Masora is <b>concise</b> in <b>style</b> with a profusion of abbreviations, requiring a considerable amount of knowledge for their full understanding. It was quite natural that a later generation of scribes would no longer understand the notes of the Masoretes and consider them unimportant; by the late medieval period they were reduced to mere ornamentation of the manuscripts. It was Jacob ben Chayyim who restored clarity and order to them.|$|R

40|$|AbstractModal Kleene algebras are Kleene algebras {{enriched by}} forward and {{backward}} box and diamond operators. We formalise the symmetries of these operators as Galois connections, complementarities and dualities. We study their properties in the associated operator algebras and show that the axioms of relation algebra are theorems at the operator level. Modal Kleene algebras provide a unifying semantics for various program calculi and enhance efficient cross-theory reasoning in this class, often in a very <b>concise</b> pointfree <b>style.</b> This claim is supported by novel algebraic soundness and completeness proofs for Hoare logic and by connecting this formalism with an algebraic decision procedure...|$|R

Imperative programs are fast because they are designed close to {{the architecture of the}} widespread computers, but they don’t match the structure of signal processing very well. In contrast to that, functional programming and especially lazy evaluation perfectly models many common operations on signals. Haskell is a statically typed, lazy functional programming language which allow for a very elegant and <b>concise</b> programming <b>style.</b> We want to sketch how to process signals, how to improve safety by the use of physical units, and how to compose music using this language. 1...|$|R
60|$|In {{literature}} {{the change}} is no less marked. From the Elizabethan drama playwrights turned to coarse, evil scenes, which presently disgusted the people and were driven from the stage. From romance, writers turned to realism; from Italian influence with its exuberance of imagination they turned to France, and learned to repress the emotions, to follow the head rather than the heart, and to write in a clear, <b>concise,</b> formal <b>style,</b> according to set rules. Poets turned from the noble blank verse of Shakespeare and Milton, from the variety and melody which had characterized English poetry since Chaucer's day, to the monotonous heroic couplet with its mechanical perfection.|$|R

The <b>concise</b> <b>style</b> of this form of interview encourages participants to be more direct with their statements. Unlike traditional interviews, a Twitterview allows the public to join in on the conversation and become participants themselves.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{structured}} recursive programming discipline, which favors {{the use of}} fold operations in place of general recursion, to abstract data types. The key idea is to represent an ADT by two parts, a constructor and a destructor,which are essentially functions to/from a common representation. Then a fold can work on an ADT by applying parameter functions to values that are delivered by the ADT's own destructor. Fold operations that use as a parameter the constructor of another ADT, called ADT transformers, {{play an important role}} and o er a <b>concise</b> programming <b>style.</b> We present some laws for ADT folds and transformers and show their use in program optimization and verification...|$|R
