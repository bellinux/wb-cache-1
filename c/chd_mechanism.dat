To overcome this shortcoming, the energy aware scheme of SHEAR utilizes those nodes having higher energy levels and avoids those having lower energy levels, such that the overall energy consumption along a data forwarding path is minimized.

3000|$|However, we may {{identify}} {{a number of}} shortcomings in the SHPER (Kandris et al. 2009) protocol. Firstly, the path selection scheme in SHPER takes into account only the maximum residual energy metric and ignores the total energy consumed along data forwarding paths. This may lead to extremely long routes and subsequently to increased energy consumption, as shall be detailed in [...] "Cluster setup phase". Secondly, just as in TEEN (Manjeshwar and Agrawal 2001), SHPER uses threshold based sensing and, as such, is unsuitable for applications that need periodic reports because nodes may not communicate if thresholds are not reached. Thirdly, SHPER follows an indeterminate random procedure to create {{the upper and lower}} levels of the sensor field.

In the case of heat transfer by flames produced by pure oxygen or oxygen enriched air combustion, a mechanism called thermochemical heat release (TCHR) can {{be held responsible for}} up to 60 % of the total heat transfer rate. In these very hot flames chemical equilibrium is reached before full conversion into products is achieved. TCHR is the result of recombination reactions in the thermal boundary layer. In this paper a method is described for the numerical calculation of the effect of TCHR which can be applied to model TCHR for fuels of an almost arbitrarily complex composition. In this method the flame chemistry is decoupled from the chemistry in the thermal boundary layer. An equilibrium calculation is used to determine the chemical composition after the flame.

It is shown under which conditions this method can be applied, the effect of strain rate is studied, and the method is demonstrated by calculating a TCHR multiplication factor for a number of different fuels. A polynomial fit for the TCHR-factor is presented as function of C/H-ratio, equivalence ratio, equivalent temperature of a reference mixture and stagnation plane temperature. The fit gives accurate results for the TCHR contribution to the total heat transfer for most fuels. Finally, the importance of hydrogen recombination chemistry on the TCHR is indicated...|$|R

The aryl moiety of the ions corresponds to a benzene group, a naphthalene group, a phenanthrene group, a biphenyl group, and a terphenyl group, respectively, each substituted by a CH 3 OCH 2 side-chain as remote from the acyl substituent as possible. The characteristic reactions of the metastable ions, studied by mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry, are the elimination of methanol, the formation of CH 3 OCH+ 2 ions, {{and the elimination of}} an ester RCOOCH 3 (R = H and <b>CH</b> 3).

Compared with the nonfunctionalized analogues [CmPy][NTf 2], the viscosities of [E(n) PA [NTf 2] are lower and obviously decrease with the increasing number of ether oxygen atoms. The presence of ether groups on the cation has weak impacts on CO 2 solubility of the ILs, but it contributes to a much lower CH 4 solubility, which leads to the great increase of CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity using [E(n) PA][NTf 2]. Moreover, CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity in all investigated ILs greatly decreases with the increasing temperature due to the weaker temperature dependence of CH 4 solubility. In addition, the thermodynamic properties including the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of CO 2 and CH 4 in these ILs were also obtained, and the CO 2 and <b>CH</b> 4 dissolution <b>mechanisms</b> were further analyzed.

The absence of local leads coupled with the extremely short atmospheric lifetime of CH 2 I 2 indicates that production occurred in the surface of the sea-ice/overlying snowpack over the bay.

Conversely, Pd(0. 3) Ce(2) -HMOR presents modest activity for NO oxidation, compared to Pd(0. 3) Ce(2) -HBEA, but exhibits mild activity for NOx CH 4 -SCR reaction. Characterisation by H 2 -TPR, DRS UV-Vis, TEM/EDS and FTIR-CO allowed the identification of palladium stabilised as Pd 2 + ions in exchange positions in both monometallic and bimetallic MOR based catalysts, whereas, in BEA catalysts, it is presented as PdO clusters. Cerium is stabilised in Pd(0. 3) Ce(2) -HMOR as small CeO 2 particles, whereas, in Pd(0. 3) Ce(2) -HBEA, it is present as large clusters. Catalysts were also tested in dual bed configuration, in which Pd(0. 3) Ce(2) -HBEA was placed as first layer and Pd(0. 3) Ce(2) -HMOR as second layer in the catalytic bed. The catalytic performance was significantly improved (higher NOx conversion into N 2 and higher CH 4 selectivity to SCR reaction), when compared to the catalytic performance of each catalyst individually, suggesting the existence of a synergic effect. This synergy is explained by the complementary roles that each catalyst play in HC-SCR mechanism...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith a 100 -year {{global warming}} {{potential}} of 25 times of that of CO 2, methane (CH 4) is the second-most important greenhouse gas of dominantly biological origin. The stimulating effect from elevated CO 2 on CH 4 emissions from anaerobic ecosystems is well known 1. However, in aerobic grassland ecosystems where the ground water table does not approach the surface, ascending CH 4 produced at greater depths can be oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria in the top soil, so that the soil acts as a net methane sink. At the Giessen-FACE site, greenhouse gas emissions have been continuously measured 1 - 3 times per week with large (1 m diameter) closed chambers in triplicate per plot, since 1998 under elevated (eCO 2, + 20 %) and ambient (aCO 2) conditions (n= 3 plots), i. e. through more than 17 years. During the entire time series of gas flux measurements, periods of point-source CH 4 emissions were repeatedly observed during late-summer or autumn. The emission events were spatially very heterogeneous and usually continued over weeks occurring repeatedly through the 17 years of study. We suggest that within the chambers the peaks were micro-site specific events while the surrounding soil concomitantly consumed <b>CH</b> 4. Three <b>mechanisms</b> are discussed as possible explanations for the episodic CH 4 peaks: 1) soil cracks, forming during the late summer period, may allow the ascendance of CH 4 from deeper saturated layers; 2) the seasonal occurrence of Scarabaeidae larvae which are known point-source CH 4 emitters 2,and 3) seasonally enhanced fungal decomposition activity by saprotrophic fungi, aerobically emitting CH 4 while decomposing biomass. We evaluate three different approaches, based on different mechanistic explanations for the CH 4 emission events, to assess the overall effect of long-term CO 2 enrichment on the CH 4 exchange in the temperate grassland ecosystem...|$|R

Two versions of the model were used, with different levels of chemical complexity, to explore the role of hydrocarbons upon free-radical budgets under very clean conditions. The "detailed" model was constrained to measurements of CO, CH 4 and 17 NMHCs, while the "simple" model contained only the CO and <b>CH</b> 4 oxidation <b>mechanisms,</b> together with inorganic chemistry. The OH and HO 2 (HO x) concentrations predicted by the two models agreed to within 5 – 10 %. The model results were compared with the HO x concentrations measured by the FAGE (Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion) technique during four days of clean Southern Ocean marine boundary layer (MBL) air. The models overestimated OH concentrations by about 10 % on two days and about 20 % on the other two days. HO 2 concentrations were measured during two of these days and the models overestimated the measured concentrations by about 40 %. Better agreement with measured HO 2 was observed by using data from several MBL aerosol measurements to estimate the aerosol surface area and by increasing the HO 2 uptake coefficient to unity. This reduced the modelled HO 2 overestimate by ~ 40 %, with little effect on OH, because of the poor HO 2 to OH conversion at the low ambient NO x concentrations. Local sensitivity analysis and Morris One-At-A-Time analysis were performed on the "simple" model, and showed the importance of reliable measurements of j(O 1 D) and [HCHO] and of the kinetic parameters that determine the efficiency of O(1 D) to OH and HCHO to HO 2 conversion. A 2 σ standard deviation of 30 – 40 % for OH and 25 – 30 % for HO 2 was estimated for the model calculations using a Monte Carlo technique coupled with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) ...|$|R
