5|$|Plantard then {{enlisted the}} aid of author Gérard de Sède {{to write a book}} based on his {{unpublished}} manuscript and forged parchments, alleging that Saunière had discovered a link to a hidden treasure. The 1967 book L'or de Rennes, ou La vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château ("The Gold of Rennes, or The Strange Life of Bérenger Saunière, Priest of Rennes-le-Château"), which was later published in paperback under the title Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Château ("The Accursed Treasure of Rennes-le-Château") in 1968, became a popular read in France. It included copies of the found parchments (the originals were, of course, never produced), though it did not provide the decoded hidden texts contained within them. One of the Latin texts in the parchments was <b>copied</b> <b>from</b> the Novum Testamentum, an attempted restoration of the Vulgate by John Wordsworth and Henry White. The other text was <b>copied</b> <b>from</b> the Codex Bezae. Based on the wording used, the versions of the Latin texts found in the parchments can be shown to have been <b>copied</b> <b>from</b> books first published in 1889 and 1895, which is problematic considering that de Sède's book was trying to make a case that these documents were centuries old.|$|E
5|$|Stela H {{dates to}} 751, {{during the reign}} of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Its glyphs are {{arranged}} in a rare mat pattern, <b>copied</b> <b>from</b> Copán.

The hieroglyphic inscriptions on Stela H are badly damaged.|$|E

Centrally located Antananarivo is the nation's political capital today, and Ambohimanga to its northeast is regarded as the spiritual capital.|$|E

The main body of the bridge was painted in dark green, with the spandrels decorated in gilding.

5|$|Some bootlegs {{consist of}} private or {{professional}} studio recordings distributed without the artist's involvement, including demos, works-in-progress or discarded material. These {{might be made}} from private recordings {{not meant to be}} widely shared, or from master recordings stolen or <b>copied</b> <b>from</b> an artist's home, a recording studio or the offices of a record label, or they may be <b>copied</b> <b>from</b> promotional material issued to music publishers or radio stations, but not for commercial release. A theme of early rock bootlegs was to copy deleted records, such as old singles and B-sides, onto a single LP, as a cheaper alternative to obtaining all the original recordings. Strictly speaking, these were unlicensed recordings, but because the work required to clear all the copyrights and publishing of every track for an official release was considered to be prohibitively expensive, the bootlegs became popular. Some bootlegs, however, did lead to official releases. The Who's Zoo bootleg, collecting early singles of The Who, inspired the official album Odds And Sods, which beat the bootleggers by issuing unreleased material, while various compilations of mid-1960s bands inspired the Nuggets series of albums.|$|E
