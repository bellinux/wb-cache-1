5|$|In the 1990s, after Per Bak Jensen {{had joined}} the {{teaching}} staff at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, {{it was clear that}} photography had been accepted as an art form. As evidence, in October 2004, for the very first time, a number of the Academy's students and graduates presented their photographs at an exhibition in Copenhagen's Galleri Asbæk under the <b>common</b> <b>title</b> ”Eye of the Beholder – et blik på portrættet”.|$|E
5|$|Teaching {{members of}} the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, {{although}} the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. There is no <b>common</b> <b>title</b> for the heads of colleges: the titles used include Warden, Provost, Principal, President, Rector, Master and Dean.|$|E
5|$|Due to the BBC's 1970s junking policy, 97 episodes {{from the}} 1960s are missing, {{with the result}} that 26 serials are incomplete, {{although}} all of these still exist as audio recordings, and some have been reconstructed. In the first two seasons and most of the third, each episode of a serial had an individual title; no serial had an overall on-screen title until The Savages. The serial titles given below are the most <b>common</b> <b>title</b> for the serials as a whole, used in sources such as the Doctor Who Reference Guide and the BBC's classic episode guide, and are generally those used for commercial release. The practice of individually titled episodes resurfaced with the show's 2005 revival, when Doctor Whos serial nature was abandoned in favour of an episodic format.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 2001, After Forever {{appeared}} as rising stars on the dynamic scene of Dutch metal, which included bands like The Gathering, Within Temptation, Gorefest and Ayreon. Their second album Decipher (2001) had received very positive reviews and their name was {{well known in the}} underground scene of the Netherlands. Critics were impressed by the remarkable musicianship of the young members of the band and in particular by Floor Jansen’s vocals, both in studio and in live performances. In contrast with these premises for a bright future, the relationships within the band were not so idyllic. Soon after the release of Decipher, After Forever faced a strong creative contrast between founding member and guitarist Mark Jansen {{and the rest of the}} band. Mark Jansen had been the main composer of the band together with Sander Gommans and his love for movie soundtracks and classical music had had a strong influence on the musical style of After Forever’s first two albums, Prison of Desire (2000) and Decipher. Moreover, his interest for religious and moral themes had characterized his lyrics for many songs, often collected under a <b>common</b> <b>title</b> (e.g. The Embrace That Smothers and My Pledge of Allegiance). In the next album, Mark Jansen meant to further explore complex interactions between classical instruments, choruses in Latin and death metal elements, while Gommans and the others preferred a more direct and aggressive approach to music, retaining some elements that made the sound of the band recognizable, but expanding it in new and different directions. These musical differences led to Mark Jansen leaving the band, in what he felt as an actual dismissal.|$|E
25|$|Ad ecclesiam is {{explained}} by its <b>common</b> <b>title,</b> Contra avaritiam. It strongly commends meritorious almsgiving to the church.

25|$|Immortal is {{the eighth}} album to be {{released}} by Sony and Motown/Universal since Michael Jackson's death on June 25, 2009.

25|$|Which title {{should be}} used is a subject that has {{generated}} controversy amongst fans of the series. Fan researchers such as David J. Howe argue that since 100,000 BC {{was used by the}} production team at the time of transmission, it is the most accurate title. However, the BBC markets the story as An Unearthly Child. Consequently, this became the most <b>common</b> <b>title</b> used for the story.|$|E
25|$|According to Alain Daniélou and Kenneth Hurry, the Rashtrakuta and Reddy dynasties may {{both have}} been descended from the earlier dynasty of the Rashtrikas. This common origin {{is by no means}} certain: there is {{evidence}} suggesting that the Rashtrakuta line came from the Yadavas in northern India and also that they may simply have held a <b>common</b> <b>title.</b> Either of these alternate theories might undermine the claim to a connection between them and the Reddys.|$|E
25|$|Also in {{liaison with}} the Zaragoza group Larramendi {{published}} {{a series of}} booklets under the <b>common</b> <b>title</b> En la Avanzada. Crítica política. Cuestiones vascas. Cinematógrafo (1911) exploited the revolution v. counterrevolution antinomy; touching upon the Basque subject, it defended provincial fueros but lambasted separatists. Catecismo á los ateos. ¿Qué son las escuelas laicas? Romanones, ¡á la barra! (1913) re-prnted earlier pamphlets and went on with new onslaught on secular education, based on outdated illusions of Rousseau. Finally, ¡Viva el Rey! Psicología social y literaria (1914) tackled major issues like monarchy, strikes, self-government and labor organization, though it also discussed literature. Apart from publications he did not neglect attending public meetings, delivering addresses across Spain at gatherings flavored with Carlism or social-Catholicism.|$|E
50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} to mention, {{that the first}} three titles Imy-ra-shemaw, Imy-ra-wpwt and Heqa-sepawt are <b>common</b> <b>titles</b> for officials of Lower Egypt. Thus, Netjeraperef held office in northern territories.|$|R

500|$|Rado and Ragni {{were unhappy}} with the film, feeling that Forman portrayed the hippies as [...] "oddballs" [...] and [...] "some sort of aberration" [...] without any {{connection}} to the peace movement, failing to {{capture the essence of}} the original stage production. [...] They stated: [...] "Any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original Biltmore version, other than some of the songs, the names of the characters, and a <b>common</b> <b>title,</b> eludes us." [...] In their view, the screen version of Hair has not yet been produced.|$|E
500|$|Regiments {{were often}} rewarded for meritorious service by the grant of an honorific title. The most sought-after was the prestigious c.R. (civium Romanorum = [...] "of Roman citizens") title. In the latter case, all the {{regiment}}'s {{members at the}} time, but not their successors, would be granted Roman citizenship. But the regiment would retain the c.R. title in perpetuity. Another <b>common</b> <b>title</b> was the gens name of the emperor making the award (or founding the regiment) e.g. Ulpia: the gens name of Trajan (Marcus Ulpius Traianus r.98–117). Other titles {{were similar to those}} given to the legions e.g. pia fidelis (p.f. = [...] "dutiful and loyal").|$|E

500|$|The story arcs {{introduced}} in Resident Evil 2 continue in drama albums and later game releases. Kyoko Sagiyama, Junichi Miyashita, Yasuyuki Suzuki, Noboru Sugimura, Hirohisa Soda and Kishiko Miyagi– screenwriters employed by Capcom's former scenario subsidiary Flagship– created two radio dramas titled Chiisana Tōbōsha Sherry (lit. [...] "The Little Runaway Sherry") and Ikiteita Onna Spy Ada (lit. [...] "The Female Spy Ada Lives"). The dramas were broadcast on Radio Osaka in early 1999, and later released by publisher Suleputer as two separate CDs with the <b>common</b> <b>title</b> Biohazard 2 Drama Album. Chiisana Tōbōsha Sherry begins {{shortly after the}} events of the game. Sherry is separated from Claire while fleeing from Umbrella soldiers sent to kill all witnesses of the viral outbreak. Raccoon City is burned down by the U.S. Government and Umbrella in an attempt to cover up the disaster. Sherry seeks refuge in the neighboring town of Stone Ville, and later escapes to Canada {{with the help of a}} girl named Meg, who vows to help her reunite with Claire.|$|E
500|$|The Warped Ones was {{originally}} released in Japan by the Nikkatsu Company on September 3, 1960. The film {{was successful in}} Japan, although not {{so much so that}} Tamio Kawachi was ever elevated to major star status and after his [...] "Bad Boy" [...] period he was mainly relegated to second lead and supporting parts. In July 1961, Arthur Davis' newly formed, American, foreign film distribution company Kanji Pictures announced it had acquired ten Nikkatsu films for North and South American markets and parts of Europe. The films included The Warped Ones, Shohei Imamura's Pigs and Battleships (1961) and Kon Ichikawa's The Burmese Harp (1956) and were to be distributed by Kanji or sold to other distribution companies. An English-dubbed version of The Warped Ones was then released in the United States on December 18, 1963, by Radley Metzger's sexploitation-centric Audubon Films, initially as The Weird Lovemakers, then The Warped Ones became the more <b>common</b> <b>title.</b> It was marketed as an American film, and misleadingly implied to contain sexually explicit material, in order to appeal to a wider audience.|$|E
500|$|Bannon {{followed}} Odd Girl Out with I Am a Woman (In Love With a Woman — Must Society Reject Me?) in 1959. I Am a Woman (the {{working and}} <b>common</b> <b>title)</b> featured Laura after her affair with Beth, as {{she finds herself}} in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and becomes his best friend. Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character {{that proved to be}} her most popular of the series, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly butch lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly [...] tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her, Bannon instead created her. She remembered, [...] "I put Beebo together just as I wanted her, in my heart and mind... She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams." [...] The resolution to I Am a Woman completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.|$|E
