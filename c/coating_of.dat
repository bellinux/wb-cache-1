5|$|Zinc is most {{commonly}} used as an anti-corrosion agent, and galvanization (<b>coating</b> <b>of</b> iron or steel) is the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893 thousand tonnes of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.|$|E
5|$|A {{similarly}} {{enormous number}} of lac bugs are {{needed to make a}} kilogram of shellac, a brush-on colourant and wood finish. Additional uses of this traditional product include the waxing of citrus fruits to extend their shelf-life, and the <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> pills to moisture-proof them, provide slow-release or mask the taste of bitter ingredients.|$|E
5|$|After the {{industrial}} scale production of cadmium started in the 1930s and 1940s, the major application of cadmium was the <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> iron and steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the cadmium in the United States was used for plating. In 1956, 24% of the cadmium in the United States was used for a second application in red, orange and yellow pigments from sulfides and selenides of cadmium.|$|E

5|$|Argon {{may be used}} as {{the carrier}} gas in gas {{chromatography}} and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in ICP spectroscopy. Argon is preferred for the sputter <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Argon gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, the Parliamentary {{authorities}} undertook a three-week conservation project to repair and restore the statue. It consisted of removing accumulated dirt and an old <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> black wax, repatinating the bronze surface to return it to its original colour and treating it with a clear wax as protection from pollution and the elements. The bas reliefs on the pedestal were also cleaned and treated, as was the pedestal itself.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In {{moist air}} or moist argon, the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides. If the metal is exposed long enough to {{a limited amount of}} water vapor, a powdery surface <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2.|$|E

5|$|With over 400 active volcanos, Io is {{the most}} geologically active object in the Solar System. Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, {{some of which are}} taller than Earth's Mount Everest. Unlike most {{satellites}} in the outer Solar System (which have a thick <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> ice), Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core.|$|E
5|$|Actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and {{moisture}} in air forming a white <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> actinium oxide that impedes further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} oxidation state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E

5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E

5|$|In various recipes, other substitutions and {{additions}} are suggested. The Hairy Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as {{an alternative}} to Caerphilly and propose that it should be served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese {{as an alternative}} ingredient. Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for the <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> the sausage.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are used}} as, or in, coloring agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|Organic {{apples are}} {{commonly}} {{produced in the}} United States. Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe. The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has {{been approved by the}} EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.|$|E
