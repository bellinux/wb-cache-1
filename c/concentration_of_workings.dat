5000|$|An {{extensive}} area of shallow workings extends {{for approximately}} 1 km {{along the western}} fringes of the gazetted township site from the southwest corner to the battery area in the north. This heavily worked area stretches about 130m to the east {{in the direction of}} the station track (McDonald Street). The area is typified by numerous shallow pits and ditches, mullock dumps, machinery, and other metal remains. The most visible feature within this extensive worked area is a 6m high mullock dump found in close association to a concentrated group of shallow workings and machinery parts. This <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>workings</b> has a diameter of about 50m and includes a broken piece of machinery inscribed with [...] "This end toward the pump" [...] and an almost intact vertical boiler complete with fire door and valve handle.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the importance of path dependence effects in impeding the diffusion of high throughput mechanized mining systems in the British coal industry. It demonstrates that the industry had become ‘locked in ’ to low throughput underground haulage technology, on account of institutional interrelatedness between Britain’s traditional practice of extensive in-seam mining and its unique system of fragmented, privately owned mineral royalties. Fragmented royalties prevented the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>workings</b> and introduction of high throughput main haulage systems that underpinned the rapid productivity growth of European producers. Meanwhile, technical interrelatedness between the haulage systems taking coal to the pit shaft and operations further ‘upstream ’ created bottlenecks which both slowed the overall rate of mechanization and limited the productivity gains from the mechanization that did occur...|$|E

The study purpose is the engineering-geological substantiation of stability prediction methods of underground and opencast <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> Kuang-Nin coal basin in Vietnam. The deforming processes of opencast colliery edges and of collapses <b>of</b> underground <b>workings</b> {{have been studied}} in detail. The optimum methods of stability prediction <b>of</b> <b>workings</b> have been determined. The two-stage technique for the qualitative-quantitative choice of optimum methods of stability prediction <b>of</b> <b>workings</b> has been proposed. The stability prediction <b>of</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> Kuang-Nin coal basin has been presented. The engineering methods of stability prediction <b>of</b> <b>workings</b> at the coal mining on the Kuang-Nin deposit in the Vietnam have been developed. The method of stability prediction <b>of</b> underground <b>workings</b> and <b>of</b> opencast collieries at the assessment of engineering-geological conditions at the Kuang-Nin coal basin in the Vietnam has been introduced.

Knowledge of stress fields facilitates projection and successful realization <b>of</b> <b>workings</b> (e. g. stability check <b>of</b> <b>workings,</b> behaviour <b>of</b> proposed supports, spatiotemporal situation <b>of</b> <b>workings).</b> Within the scope of sedimentary deposit of Karvina subbasin were used data from structure-tectonic analysis and from measures in situ by overcoring and hydrofrac methods for determination of natural stress state and its orientation. This report deals with contemporary recognition of stress fields {{in the eastern part of}} Karvina subbasin. There are also disscussed problems of long working line depending on orientation and size of horizontal stress in this report. Last but not least there is described new knowledge about geological-tectonic structure of Karvina subbasin...|$|R

40|$|Case {{studies of}} Grodziec and Siersza mines in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin confirm that mine water accumulating in and {{overflowing}} from abandoned coal mines {{is subject to}} a “first flush” phenomenon. The accumulated products of sulphide oxidation are dissolved in the rising mine water and flushed out at concentrations several times those observed during mine operation. Following the first overflow, sulphate concentration and hydrogen ion activity decay exponentially. In the case <b>of</b> <b>workings</b> in Siersza, decay constants of − 0. 003 to − 0. 005 day− 1 are observed, corresponding to flushing times of 480 to 820 days, some 10 – 20 times the period required for the workings to flood. Quantities of leachable sulphur in the abandoned <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> 0. 02 – 0. 03 % are adequate to explain the observed <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> sulphate in the first flush, and this figure is tentatively supported by laboratory analyses...|$|R
