5000|$|His and Carolyn Napoli's {{observations}} of pigment gene [...] "cosuppression" [...] in Petunia flowers {{are examples of}} post transcriptional gene silencing that predated the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) {{and contributed to the}} current understanding of the commonality of RNA-mediated gene silencing in eukaryotes. Their initial observations were made while working at the U.S. biotech company DNA Plant Technology and form part of the basis of a number of U.S. patents on gene regulation and crop manipulation. The significance of the discovery of <b>cosuppression</b> was described by NOVA scienceNOW in 2005. Jorgensen's primary focus on the problem of <b>cosuppression</b> in petunia has been on the epigenetic aspects of the phenomenon and the relationship between <b>cosuppression</b> (RNAi) and epigenetics. Together with William Lucas at UC Davis and others he proposed the existence of an RNA Information Superhighway in plants by which information is transmitted throughout the plant via RNA molecules which influence gene expression and epigenetic state Jorgensen was awarded the 2007 Martin Gibbs Medal by the American Society of Plant Biologists [...] "for his pioneering work leading to the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi)."

40|$|Functional {{silencing}} of chromosomal loci can {{be induced}} by transgenes (<b>cosuppression)</b> or by introduction of double-stranded RNA (RNAi). Here, we demonstrate the generality of and define rules for a transgene-mediated <b>cosuppression</b> {{phenomenon in the}} Caenorhabditis elegans germ line. Functional repression is not a consequence of persistent physical association between transgenes and endogenous genes or of mutations in affected genes. The <b>cosuppression</b> mechanism likely involves an RNA mediator that defines its target specificity, reminiscent of RNAi. <b>Cosuppression</b> is strongly abrogated in rde- 2 and mut- 7 mutants, but is not blocked in an rde- 1 mutant, indicating that <b>cosuppression</b> and RNAi have overlapping but distinct genetic requirements...|$|E
40|$|By {{comparing}} {{the effects of}} strong and weak promoters that drive sense chalcone synthase (Chs) transgenes in large populations of independently transformed plants, we show here that a strong transgene promoter is required for high-frequency <b>cosuppression</b> of Chs genes and for production of {{the full range of}} <b>cosuppression</b> phenotypes. In addition, sense Chs transgenes driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter possessing a single copy of the upstream activator region (UAR) were found to produce a significantly lower degree of <b>cosuppression</b> than they did when the transgene promoter possessed two or four copies of the UAR. It has been shown elsewhere that 35 S promoter strength increases with increasing UAR copy number. Frameshift mutations producing early nonsense codons in the Chs transgene were found to reduce the frequency and the degree of <b>cosuppression.</b> These results suggest that promoter strength and transcript stability determine the degree of <b>cosuppression,</b> supporting the hypothesis that sense <b>cosuppression</b> is a response to the accumulation of transcripts at high concentrations. This conclusion was shown to apply to single-copy transgenes but not necessarily to inversely repeated transgenes. The results presented here also have significance for efficient engineering of <b>cosuppression</b> phenotypes for use in research and agriculture...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cosuppression,</b> the {{silencing}} of dispersed homologous genes {{triggered by}} high copy number, may have evolved in eukaryotic organisms to control molecular parasites such as viruses and transposons. Ty 1 retrotransposons are dispersed gene repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where no <b>cosuppression</b> {{has been previously}} observed. Ty 1 elements are seemingly expressed undeterred to a level as high as 10 % of total mRNA. Using Ty 1 –URA 3 reporters and negative selection with 5 -fluoroorotic acid, it is shown that Ty 1 genes can undergo transcriptional <b>cosuppression</b> that is independent of DNA methylation and polycomb-mediated repression. Expression of Ty 1 -related genes was shown to be {{in one of two}} states, the coexpressed state with all Ty 1 -related genes transcribed or the cosuppressed state with all Ty 1 -related genes shut off, without uncoordinated or mosaic expression in any individual cell. Rapid switches between the two states were observed. A high copy number of Ty 1 elements was shown to be required for the initiation of Ty 1 homology-dependent gene silencing, implying that Ty 1 gene expression is under negative feedback control. Ty 1 transcriptional repressors facilitated the onset of Ty 1 <b>cosuppression,</b> and the native Ty 1 promoters were required for Ty 1 <b>cosuppression,</b> indicating that Ty 1 <b>cosuppression</b> occurs at the transcriptional level...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cosuppression</b> {{results in}} the {{degradation}} of RNA from host genes and homologous transgenes after transcription in the nucleus. By using grafting experiments, we have shown previously that a systemic signal mediates the propagation of <b>cosuppression</b> of Nia host genes and 35 S-Nia 2 transgenes from silenced 35 S-Nia 2 transgenic stocks to nonsilenced 35 S-Nia 2 transgenic scions but not to wild-type scions. Here, we examined the requirements for triggering and maintenance of <b>cosuppression</b> in various types of scions. Grafting-induced silencing occurred in 35 S-Nia 2 transgenic lines over-accumulating Nia mRNA whether {{they are able to}} spontaneously trigger <b>cosuppression</b> or not and in 35 S-Nia 2 transgene-free plants over-accumulating host Nia mRNA caused by metabolic derepression. When grafting-induced silenced scions were removed from the silenced stocks and regrafted onto wild-type plants, silencing was not maintained in the 35 S-Nia 2 transgene-free plants and in the 35 S-Nia 2 transgenic lines that are not able to trigger <b>cosuppression</b> spontaneously. Conversely, silencing was maintained in the 35 S-Nia 2 transgenic lines that are able to trigger <b>cosuppression</b> spontaneously. Our results indicate that the presence of a 35 S-Nia 2 transgene is dispensable for the RNA degradation step of posttranscriptional silencing when host Nia mRNA over-accumulate above the level of wild-type plants. They also suggest that grafting-induced RNA degradation does not result in the production of the systemic silencing signal required for spontaneous triggering and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Introduction of a {{transgene}} that transcribes RNA homologous to an endogenous gene in {{the plant}} genome can induce silencing of both genes, a phenomenon termed <b>cosuppression.</b> <b>Cosuppression</b> was first discovered in transgenic petunia plants transformed with the CHS-A gene encoding chalcone synthase, in which nonpigmented sectors in flowers or completely white flowers are produced. Some of the flower-color patterns observed in transgenic petunias having CHS-A <b>cosuppression</b> resemble those in existing nontransgenic varieties. Although the mechanism by which white sectors are generated in nontransgenic petunia {{is known to be}} due to RNA silencing of the CHS-A gene as in <b>cosuppression,</b> whether the same trigger(s) and/or pattern of RNA degradation are involved in these phenomena has not been known. Here, we addressed this question using deep-sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of small RNAs. Results: We analyzed short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced in nonpigmented sectors of petal tissues in transgenic petunia plants that have CHS-A <b>cosuppression</b> and a nontransgenic petunia variety Red Star, that has naturally occurring CHS-A RNA silencing. In both silencing systems, 21 -nt and 22 -nt siRNAs were the most and the second-most abundant size classes, respectively. CHS-A siRNA production was confined to exon 2, indicating that RNA degradation through the RNA silencing pathway occurred in this exon. Common siRNAs were detected in <b>cosuppression</b> and naturally occurring RNA silencing, and their ranks {{based on the number of}} siRNAs in these plants were correlated with each other. Noticeably, highly abundant siRNAs were common in these systems. Phased siRNAs were detected in multiple phases at multiple sites, and some of the ends of the regions that produced phased siRNAs were conserved. Conclusions: The features of siRNA production found to be common to <b>cosuppression</b> and naturally occurring silencing of the CHS-A gene indicate mechanistic similarities between these silencing systems especially in the biosynthetic processes of siRNAs including cleavage of CHS-A transcripts and subsequent production of secondary siRNAs in exon 2. The data also suggest that these events occurred at multiple sites, which can be a feature of these silencing phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Using tobacco {{nitrate reductase}} <b>cosuppression</b> {{as a model}} system of post-transcriptional gene silencing, we {{analyzed}} the influence of DNA and RNA dosages both together and independently. For this purpose, zero, one, two, or four active or transcriptionally silenced copies of a cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S-Nia 2 transgene were combined by transformation and subsequent crosses with zero, one, two, three, or four active, disrupted, or transcriptionally repressed copies of the wild-type host Nia genes. The analysis of the corresponding transgenic lines revealed that (1) the percentage of isogenic plants that are affected by <b>cosuppression</b> depends directly upon the relative dosage of both host gene and transgene; (2) transcriptional silencing of the 35 S-Nia transgene impedes cosuppression; and (3) the absence of host gene transcription reduces the frequency of <b>cosuppression</b> or delays its triggering. Taken together, {{these results indicate that}} transgene DNA per se is not sufficient to trigger post-transcriptional <b>cosuppression</b> of nitrate reductase host genes and transgenes. The requirement for a transcriptionally active state is discussed with respect to both the RNA dosage and the DNA-DNA pairing hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cosuppression</b> is a {{classical}} form of eukaryotic post-transcriptional gene silencing. It was first reported in transgenic petunia, where a sense transgene meant to overexpress the host Chalcone Synthase-A (CHS-A) gene caused {{the degradation of}} the homologous transcripts {{and the loss of}} flower pigmentation. In this work, we used deep sequencing technology to characterize in detail the small RNA population generated from the CHS-A sequence in cosuppressed transgenic petunia. Unexpectedly, two distinct small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were found to vastly predominate. Our demonstration that they guide prominent cleavage events in CHS-A mRNA provides compelling and previously lacking evidence of a causative association between induction of individual siRNAs and an example of <b>cosuppression.</b> The preferential accumulation of these siRNAs provides new insights about sense <b>cosuppression</b> that may apply to other natural and engineered RNA silencing events...|$|E
40|$|Persistent {{infection}} of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica with the prototypic hypovirus CHVI- 713 results in attenuation of fungal virulence (hypo-virulence) and reduced accumulation of the GTP-binding (G) protein a subunit CPG- 1. Transgenic <b>cosuppression</b> of CPG- 1 accumulation {{in the absence of}} virus infection also confers hypovirulence. We now report the use of mRNA differential display to examine the extent to which virus infection alters fungal gene transcript accumulation and to assess the degree to which modification of CPG- 1 signal transduction contributes to this alteration. More than 400 PCR products were identified that either increased (296 products) or decreased (127 products) in abundance as a result of virus infection. Significantly, 65 % of these products exhibited similar changes as a result of CPG- 1 <b>cosuppression</b> in the absence of virus infection. We also report that both virus infection and CPG- 1 <b>cosuppression</b> elevate cAMP levels 3 - to 5 -fold. Additionally, it was possible to mimic the effect of virus infection and CPG- 1 <b>cosuppression</b> on transcript accumulation for representative fungal genes by drug-induced elevation of cAMP levels. These results strengthen and extend previous indications that hypovirus infection causes a significant and persistent alteration of fungal gene expression/transcript accumulation. They further show that this alteration is primarily mediated through modification of the CPG- 1 signaling pathway and suggest that, similar to mammalian Gi alpha subunits, CPG- 1 functions as a negative modulator of adenylyl cyclase. Finally, these results suggest a role for G-protein-regulated cAMP accumulation in hypovirus-mediated alteration of fungal gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Argonaute- 1 (Ago- 1) plays {{a crucial}} role in gene {{regulation}} and genome stability via biogenesis of small non-coding RNAs. Two “Argonaute” family genes, piwi and Ago- 2 in Drosophila are involved in multiple silencing mechanisms in the nucleus, transgene <b>cosuppression,</b> long-distant chromosome interaction, nuclear organization and heterochromatin formation. To investigate whether Ago- 1 also plays a similar role, we have generated a series of Ago- 1 mutations by excising P element, inserted in the Ago- 1 promoter (Ago- 1 k 08121). AGO- 1 protein is distributed uniformly in the nucleus and cytosol in early embryos but accumulated predominantly in the cytoplasm during the gastrulation stage. Repeat induced silencing produced by the mini-white (mw) array and transcriptional <b>cosuppression</b> of non-homologous transgenes Adh-w/w-Adh was disrupted by Ago- 1 mutation. These effects of Ago- 1 are distict from its role in microRNA processing because Dicer- 1, a critical enzyme for miRNA biogenesis, has no role on the above silencing. Reduction of AGO- 1 protein dislodged the POLYCOMB, EZ (enhancer of zeste) and H 3 me 3 K 27 binding at the cosuppressed Adh-w transgene insertion sites suggesting its role in Polycomb dependent <b>cosuppression.</b> An overall reduction of methylated histone H 3 me 2 K 9 and H 3 me 3 K 27 from the polytene nuclei precisely from the mw promoters was also found that leads to concomitant changes in the chromatin structure. These results suggest a prominent role of Ago- 1 in chromatin organization and transgene silencing and demonstrate a critical link between transcriptional transgene <b>cosuppression,</b> heterochromatin formation and chromatin organization. We propose Drosophila Ago- 1 as a multifunctional RNAi component that interconnects at least two unrelated events, chromatin organization in the nucleus and microRNA processing in the cytoplasm, which may be extended to the other systems...|$|E

PBL from rabbits displaying the nominal b 4 specificity, {{as well as the}} latent b 5 and b 6 either on the cell surface or in the serum or both, were treated with pronase to remove surface latent and nominal allotypes and cultured in serum-free medium to regenerate the nominal and latent markers. Rosette formation using the mixed anti-globulin assay demonstrated that the nominal b 4 and latent b 5 and b 6 specificities were displayed in the same cell.

In vitro suppression of nominal surface b 4 with anti-b 4 antibodies resulted in the <b>cosuppression</b> of the latent b 5 and b 6. In contrast, in vitro suppression of latent b 5 and b 6 with anti-b 5 and anti-b 6 antibodies, respectively, did not cause the <b>cosuppression</b> of the nominal b 4 allotype. <b>Cosuppression</b> of latent and nominal markers in the same cell confirms that the biosynthetic machinery for latent and nominal allotypes lies within the same cell...|$|E
40|$|Homology-dependent gene silencing, a {{phenomenon}} described as <b>cosuppression</b> in plants, depends on siRNAs. We {{provide evidence that}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is missing the RNAi machinery, protein coding gene <b>cosuppression</b> exists. Indeed, introduction of an additional copy of PHO 84 on a plasmid or within the genome results in the cosilencing of both the transgene and the endogenous gene. This repression is transcriptional and position-independent and requires trans-acting antisense RNAs. Antisense RNAs induce transcriptional gene silencing both in cis and in trans, and the two pathways differ by the implication of the Hda 1 / 2 / 3 complex. We also show that trans-silencing {{is influenced by the}} Set 1 histone methyltransferase, which promotes antisense RNA production. Finally we show that although antisense-mediated cis-silencing occurs in other genes, trans-silencing so far depends on features specific to PHO 84. All together our data highlight the importance of noncoding RNAs in mediating RNAi-independent transcriptional gene silencing...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 We have {{developed}} crown-gall resistant transgenic plants capable of suppressing Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA oncogenes. Crown gall tumors result from overproduction of auxin and cytokinin in plant cells transformed by A. tumefaciens. High phytohormone levels result from expression of two auxin biosynthetic genes, tryptophan monooxygenase (iaaM) and indole acetamide hydrolase (iaaH), and isopentenyl transferase (ipt), which mediates cytokinin synthesis. Inactivation of ipt and {{either one of}} the two auxin biosynthesis genes prevents crown gall formation. To suppress T-DNA oncogene expression, we created transgenic tobacco that produce the corresponding untranslatable sense-strand RNAs. This phenomenon, called <b>cosuppression,</b> frequently blocks expression of transgenes in plants. Often, expression of an untranslatable sense-strand transgene elicits sequence-specific destruction of both the mutant mRNA and the corresponding wild-type mRNA. Here we show that <b>cosuppression</b> can block expression of A. tumefaciens T-DNA oncogenes, resulting in plants that are resistant to gall induction by certain strains of A. tumefaciens...|$|E
40|$|In one of {{the first}} {{described}} examples of RNA silenc-ing there was coordinate suppression (<b>cosuppression)</b> of a transgene and an endogenous gene. Petunia plants with a flower pigment transgene (chalcone synthase [CS]) had white flowers because the transgene and the endogenous gene were silenced (Napoli et al. 1990; van der Krol et al. 1990). There was no reduction in the transcription of the endogenous gene and it seemed likely that an RNA turnover mechanism was specifically targeted at CS RNA (van Blokland et al. 1994). In this and in other cosup-pression systems, the target RNA had a nucleotide se-quence that was identical to the transgene. When these findings were first described, it was not understood how such <b>cosuppression</b> could have such sequence specificity. However, based on discoveries in animal and plant sys-tems, it is now apparent that <b>cosuppression</b> is an RNA si-lencing process (Baulcombe 2004) in which RNA and DNA sequences are targeted specifically depending on the nucleotide sequence. The defining feature of RNA silencing is the involve-ment of long double-stranded (ds) RNA, which is pro-cessed by an RNAse III-type enzyme (Dicer) into short (21 – 25 -nucleotide) interfering (si) RNAs that initially ex-ist in a ds form with two nucleotide overhangs at the 3 ´ ends. These short RNAs are separated into a single-stranded (ss) form that guides effector complexes of si-lencing to a target RNA by Watson–Crick base pairing. Proteins of the Argonaute class are key components of these effector complexes. They bind siRNAs (Song et al...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSmall interfering RNAs (siRNAs) {{are a key}} {{component}} of RNA silencing, including <b>cosuppression.</b> Here, we show an example in which siRNA does not serve in the downregulation of target genes. A tobacco endoplasmic reticulum ω- 3 fatty acid desaturase (NtFAD 3) catalyzes the formation of α-linolenate (18 : 3). Introduction of the NtFAD 3 gene into tobacco plants caused strong reduction of 18 : 3 content in leaf tissues, which is associated with the production of the NtFAD 3 siRNAs. However, this silencing effect was lacking in the root tissues. Both the introduced NtFAD 3 and endogenous NtFAD 3 genes were expressed successfully, and the roots showed increased 18 : 3 phenotype. Surprisingly, the NtFAD 3 siRNAs were produced even in the root tissues. Expression of a hairpin double-stranded RNA against the NtFAD 3 gene caused efficient reduction of 18 : 3 content in root tissues. Therefore, <b>cosuppression</b> of the NtFAD 3 gene in tobacco appears to include an as yet unidentified developmental stage and tissue-specific mechanism of regulation of siRNA function...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} activity of functional I retrotransposons (I factors) introduced into Drosophila devoid of such elements can be repressed by transgenes containing an internal fragment of the I factor itself and that this repressing effect presents the characteristic features of homology-dependent gene silencing or <b>cosuppression.</b> Here we show that the same transgenes can induce silencing of a nonhomologous reporter gene containing as the sole I-factor sequence its 100 -bp promoter fragment. Silencing of the nonhomologous reporter gene shows strong similarities to I-factor cosuppression: It does not require any translation product from the regulating transgenes, sense and antisense constructs are equally potent, and the silencing effect is only maternally transmitted and fully reversible. A search for genomic I-like sequences containing domains with similarities to those of both the regulating and the reporter transgenes led to the identification of four such elements, which therefore could act as intermediates-or relays-in the <b>cosuppression</b> machinery. These results strongly suggest that ancestral transposition-defective I-related elements, which are naturally present in the Drosophila genome, may participate per se in the natural conditions of I-factor silencing...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} a mutant of Arabidopsis with {{a severely}} reduced level of cab 140 RNA. This mutant, named lct for {{low level of}} cab 140 transcript, was obtained during a selection for phytochrome signal transduction mutants. The selection was based on reduced expression of the tumor morphology shoots gene (tms 2), an introduced counter-selectable marker {{under the control of}} the cab 140 promoter. Expression of the introduced cab 140 ::tms 2 gene was also greatly reduced in lct, but surprisingly, expression of other phytochrome-regulated genes was not comparably affected. Furthermore, the lct phenotype could not be separated genetically from the T-DNA insert; thus, we suggest that this phenotype was caused by <b>cosuppression</b> of the introduced construct and the endogenous cab 140 gene, and that the mutation causing the <b>cosuppression</b> was located on the T-DNA insert. In vitro nuclear transcription experiments demonstrated that the suppression was occurring at the level of transcription.

A transgenic Arabidopsis line showing post-transcriptional silencing of a 35 S-uidA transgene and uidA-specific methylation was mutagenized using ethyl methanesulfonate. Six independent plants were isolated in which uidA mRNA accumulation and beta-glucuronidase activity were increased up to 3500 -fold, whereas the transcription rate of the 35 S-uidA transgene was increased only up to threefold. These plants each carried a recessive monogenic mutation {{that is responsible for}} the release of silencing. These mutations defined two genetic loci, called sgs 1 and sgs 2 (for suppressor of {{gene silencing}}). Transgene methylation was distinctly modified in sgs 1 and sgs 2 mutants. However, methylation of centromeric repeats was not affected, indicating that sgs mutants differ from ddm (for decrease in DNA methylation) and som (for somniferous) mutants. Indeed, unlike ddm and som mutations, sgs mutations were not able to release transcriptional silencing of a 35 S-hpt transgene. Conversely, both sgs 1 and sgs 2 mutations were able to release <b>cosuppression</b> of host Nia genes and 35 S-Nia 2 transgenes.

We also show that transcription of the transgenes is necessary to produce the silencing effect and that repression can be maintained for at least one generation following elimination of the transgenes, thus strongly suggesting that a transgene product and not the transgene per se is the essential intermediate in the silencing effect. The data presented strongly support models in which the repressing effect of antisense transcripts involves the same mechanisms as <b>cosuppression</b> by sense constructs and emphasize the role of symmetrically acting nucleic acid structures in mediating repression...|$|E

Plants that overexpressed PMA 4 showed no major changes in plant growth under normal conditions. However, two transformants were identified by their stunted growth, slow leaf initiation, delayed stem bolting and flowering, and male sterility. Protein gel blot analysis showed that expression of the endogenous and transgenic pma 4 was cosuppressed. <b>Cosuppression</b> was developmentally regulated because PMA 4 was still present in developing leaves but was not detected in mature leaves. The glucose and fructose content increased threefold, whereas the sucrose content remained unchanged. The rate of sucrose exudation from mature leaves was reduced threefold and the sugar content of apical buds was reduced twofold, suggesting failure of sucrose loading and translocation to the sink tissues. <b>Cosuppression</b> of PMA 4 also affected the guard cells, stomatal opening, and photosynthesis in mature leaves.

40|$|WHEN TRANSGENES WERE FIRST INTRODUCED INTO PLANT SPECIES, it was {{discovered}} thattheir expression was often compromised. Matzke et al. (1989) described a situ-ation in which transgenes, with sequence homology between the promoter regions, were silenced when combined together into tobacco. Napoli et al. (1990) and van der Krol et al. (1990) found that introduction of transgenes for anthocyanin pigment synthesis into petunia plants silenced not only multiple transgenes, but the endogenous gene as well. This process {{is referred to as}} <b>cosuppression</b> (Jorgensen 1995) or homology-dependent gene silencing (HDGS) (see also Chapter 1). The numerous examples of <b>cosuppression</b> subsequently described were classified into two categories. Many cases in which homology existed between the RNA-encoding por-tions of the transgenes were found to have normal rates in transcriptional run-on assays (e. g., see Blokland et al. 1994). These results led to the concept that the silencing occurred posttranscriptionally, presumably by affecting RNA turnover (e. g., see Depicker et al. 1996; Metzlaff et al. 1997). The other class of silencing occurred between transgenes with homology in the promoter regions. This type was accompanied by increased methy-lation in the regions of homology and was correlated with reduced rates of transcription (e. g., see Matzke et al. 1989). It was also known that transgenes expressing portions of plant viruses (most of which are of the double-stranded [ds] RNA type) would confer resistance to the homologous virus (e. g., see Goodwin et al. 1996). Subsequently, it was determined that the viral RNA was turned over {{in a manner similar to}} that found for posttranscriptional silencing (Baulcombe and English 1996). This led to the concept that one of the evolutionary pres-sures for <b>cosuppression</b> was as a defense against viruses (Baulcombe and English 1996). Another evolutionary rationale for silencing was described as a means of holding the expression of transposable elements at a low level to keep the mutation rate in chec...|$|E

To understand the molecular mechanism controlling leaf rolling, we screened a rice T-DNA insertion population and isolated the outcurved leaf 1 (oul 1) mutant showing abaxial leaf rolling. The phenotypes were caused by knockout of Rice outermost cell-specific gene 5 (Roc 5), an ortholog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene GLABRA 2. Interestingly, overexpression of Roc 5 led to adaxially rolled leaves, whereas <b>cosuppression</b> of Roc 5 resulted in abaxial leaf rolling. Bulliform cell number and size increased in oul 1 and Roc 5 <b>cosuppression</b> plants but were reduced in Roc 5 -overexpressing lines. The data indicate that Roc 5 negatively regulates bulliform cell fate and development. Gene expression profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA interference (RNAi) analyses revealed that Protodermal Factor Like (PFL) was probably down-regulated in oul 1. The mRNA level of PFL was increased in Roc 5 -overexpressing lines, and PFL-RNAi transgenic plants exhibit reversely rolling leaves by reason of increases of bulliform cell number and size, indicating that Roc 5 may have a conserved function.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether homology-dependent gene silencing or <b>cosuppression</b> mechanisms underlie copy number control (CNC) of Ty 1 retrotransposition, we introduced an active Ty 1 element into a naïve strain. Single Ty 1 element retrotransposition was elevated in a Ty 1 -less background, but decreased dramatically when additional elements were present. Transcription from the suppressing Ty 1 elements enhanced CNC but translation or reverse transcription was not required. Ty 1 CNC occurred with a transcriptionally active Ty 2 element, {{but not with}} Ty 3 or Ty 5 elements. CNC also occurred when the suppressing Ty 1 elements were transcriptionally silenced, fused to the constitutive PGK 1 promoter, or contained a minimal segment of mostly TYA 1 -gag sequence. Ty 1 transcription of a multicopy element expressed from the GAL 1 promoter abolished CNC, even when the suppressing element was defective for transposition. Although Ty 1 RNA and TyA 1 -gag protein levels increased with the copy number of expressible elements, a given element's transcript level varied less than twofold {{regardless of whether the}} suppressing elements were transcriptionally active or repressed. Furthermore, a decrease in the synthesis of Ty 1 cDNA is strongly associated with Ty 1 CNC.

40|$|Silencing of a Nicotiana plumbaginifolia beta- 1, 3 -glucanase (gn 1) {{transgene}} {{in tobacco}} line T 17 occurs in homozygous and in haploid plants with one transgene locus dosage per chromosome set. We have previously {{shown that the}} silent state is manifested by a reduced gn 1 steady state mRNA level and results from a post-transcriptional process that is under developmental control in homozygous T 17 plants, In this study, we show that specific endogenous beta- 1, 3 -glucanase genes are cosuppressed with gn 1 in homozygous T 17 plants. We also demonstrate that the developmental timing of <b>cosuppression</b> depends on environmental conditions and that once silencing is established it is stably maintained during plant development. Analyses of additional transgenic tobacco lines revealed that gn 1 silencing is not restricted to the T 17 line and showed that silencing can also take place in Ro plants containing independent loci in hemizygous states. Furthermore, silencing can also be obtained in progeny plants in which expressing loci have been combined. Importantly, <b>cosuppression</b> occurs via a post-transcriptional mechanism that does {{not interfere with the}} accumulation of transgene nuclear mRNA. These results strongly suggest that the silencing mechanism operates at RNA transport and/or RNA stability levels...|$|E

40|$|We {{generated}} transgenic {{tomato plants}} with altered expression of heat stress transcription factor HsfA 1. Plants with 10 -fold overexpression of HsfA 1 (OE plants) {{were characterized by}} a single HsfA 1 transgene cassette, whereas plants harboring a tandem inverted repeat of the cassette showed <b>cosuppression</b> (CS plants) by posttranscriptional silencing of the HsfA 1 gene connected with formation of small interfering RNAs. Under normal growth conditions, major developmental parameters were similar for wild-type (WT), OE, and CS plants. However, CS plants and fruits were extremely sensitive to elevated temperatures, because heat stress-induced synthesis of chaperones and Hsfs was strongly reduced or lacking. Despite {{the complexity of the}} plant Hsf family with at least 17 members in tomato, HsfA 1 has a unique function as master regulator for induced thermotolerance. Using transient reporter assays with mesophyll protoplasts from WT tomato, we demonstrated that plasmid-encoded HsfA 1 and HsfA 2 were well expressed. However, in CS protoplasts the <b>cosuppression</b> phenomenon was faithfully reproduced. Only transformation with HsfA 2 expression plasmid led to normal expression of the transcription factor and reporter gene activation, whereas even high amounts of HsfA 1 expression plasmids were silenced. Thermotolerance in CS protoplasts was restored by plasmid-borne HsfA 2, resulting in expression of chaperones, thermoprotection of firefly luciferase, and assembly of heat stress granules...|$|E
40|$|Protection of genomes against {{invasion}} by repetitive sequences, such as transposons, viruses, and repetitive transgenes, involves strong and selective silencing of these sequences. During silencing of repetitive transgenes, a trans effect (“cosuppression”) occurs {{that results in}} silencing of cognate endogenous genes. Here we report RNA interference (RNAi) screens performed to catalog genes required for <b>cosuppression</b> in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. We find factors with a putative role in chromatin remodeling and factors involved in RNAi. Together with molecular data also presented in this study, {{these results suggest that}} in C. elegans repetitive sequences trigger transcriptional gene silencing using RNAi and chromatin factors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCosuppression {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} in which silencing among dispersed homologous genes occurs. Here we demonstrate that two nonhomologous reciprocal fusion genes, white-Alcohol dehydrogenase (w-Adh) and Adh-w, exhibit <b>cosuppression</b> using the endogenous Adh sequence as an intermediary. Deletion of the endogenous Adh gene eliminates the interaction, while reintroduction of an 8. 6 kb Adh fragment restores the silencing. Using truncated Adh constructs, a nontranscribed segment in the Adh regulatory region {{was found to be}} one of the sequences required for homology recognition. The silencing interaction is initiated during early development. The silenced transgenes are associated with the Polycomb group complex of chromatin proteins...|$|E
40|$|Strains of the {{chestnut}} blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica harboring RNA viruses {{of the genus}} Hypovirus exhibit significantly reduced levels of virulence (called hypovirulence). The accumulation of a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein) alpha subunit of the Gi class {{was found to be}} reduced in hypovirus-containing C. parasitica strains. Transgenic <b>cosuppression,</b> a phenomenon frequently observed in transgenic plants, reduced the accumulation of this alpha subunit in virus-free fungal strains. Significantly, the resulting transgenic fungal strains were also hypovirulent. These results indicate a crucial role for G-protein-linked signal transduction in fungal pathogenesis and suggest a molecular basis for virus-mediated attenuation of fungal virulence...|$|E
40|$|Gibberellin (GA) {{biosynthesis}} {{is regulated}} by feedback control providing {{a mechanism for}} GA homeostasis in plants. However, regulatory elements involved in the feedback control are not known. In this report, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY 1 (YAB 1) gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice GA biosynthetic genes GA 3 ox 2 and GA 20 ox 2. Overexpression of YAB 1 in transgenic rice resulted in a semidwarf phenotype that could be fully rescued by applied GA. Quantification of the endogenous GA content revealed increases of GA 20 and decreases of GA 1 levels in the overexpression plants, in which the transcripts of the biosynthetic gene GA 3 ox 2 were decreased. <b>Cosuppression</b> of YAB 1 in transgenic plants induced expression of GA 3 ox 2. The repression of GA 3 ox 2 could be obtained upon treatment by dexamethasone of transgenic plants expressing a YAB 1 -glucocorticoid receptor fusion. Importantly, we show that YAB 1 bound to a GA-responsive element within the GA 3 ox 2 promoter. In addition, the expression of YAB 1 was deregulated in GA biosynthesis and signaling mutants and could be either transiently induced by GA or repressed by a GA inhibitor. Finally, either overexpression or <b>cosuppression</b> of YAB 1 impaired GA-mediated repression of GA 3 ox 2. These data together suggest that YAB 1 {{is involved in the}} feedback regulation of GA biosynthesis in rice...|$|E
40|$|In plants, {{metabolic}} pathways {{leading to}} methionine (Met) and threonine diverge {{at the level}} of their common substrate, O-phosphohomoserine (OPHS). To investigate the regulation of this branch point, we engineered transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants affected in cystathionine gamma-synthase (CgS), the enzyme utilizing OPHS for the Met pathway. Plants overexpressing potato CgS exhibited either: (a) high transgene RNA levels and 2. 7 -fold elevated CgS activities but unchanged soluble Met levels, or (b) decreased transcript amounts and enzyme activities (down to 7 % of wild-type levels). In leaf tissues, these <b>cosuppression</b> lines revealed a significant reduction of soluble Met and an accumulation of OPHS. Plants expressing CgS antisense constructs exhibited reductions in enzyme activity to as low as 19 % of wild type. The metabolite contents of these lines were {{similar to those of the}} CgS <b>cosuppression</b> lines. Surprisingly, neither increased nor decreased CgS activity led to visible phenotypic alterations or significant changes in protein-bound Met levels in transgenic potato plants, indicating that metabolic flux to Met synthesis was not greatly affected. Furthermore, in vitro feeding experiments revealed that potato CgS is not subject to feedback regulation by Met, as reported for Arabidopsis. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that potato CgS catalyzes a near-equilibrium reaction and, more importantly, does not display features of a pathway-regulating enzyme. These results are inconsistent with the current hypothesis that CgS exerts major Met metabolic flux control in higher plants. [References: 56] 5...|$|E
40|$|In tobacco line T 17, basic beta- 1, 3 -glucanases are silenced when a beta- 1, 3 -glucanase (gn 1) {{transgene}} of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia {{is present}} in a homozygous condition. <b>Cosuppression</b> of endogenous and transgenic basic beta- 1, 3 -glucanases occurs via a post transcriptional process. This study shows that silencing correlates with a reduced stability of the transcripts encoded by gn 1 and the co-suppressed endogenous glucanase genes. The observed decreases in mRNA stability at least partially explain the reductions in mRNA level. Furthermore, {{the results show that}} the enhanced, silencing-related turnover of gn 1 mRNA does not require continued protein synthesis. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of gene silencing are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The med- 1 and med- 2 genes encode small, highly similar {{proteins}} {{related to}} GATA-type transcription factors {{and have been}} proposed as necessary for specification of both the mesoderm and the endoderm of Caenorhabditis elegans. However, we have previously presented evidence that neither maternal nor zygotic expression of the med- 1 / 2 genes is necessary to specify the C. elegans endoderm. Contradicting our conclusions, a recent report presented evidence, based on presumed transgene-induced <b>cosuppression,</b> that the med- 1 / 2 genes do indeed show an endoderm-specifying maternal effect. In this article, we reinvestigate med- 2 (−); med- 1 (−) embryos using a med- 2 - specific null allele instead of the chromosomal deficiences used previously and confirm our previous results: the large majority (∼ 84 %) of med- 2 (−); med- 1 (−) embryos express gut granules. We also reinvestigate {{the possibility of a}} maternal med- 1 / 2 effect by direct injection of med dsRNA into sensitized (med-deficient) hermaphrodites using the standard protocol known to be effective in ablating maternal transcripts, but again find no evidence for any significant maternal med- 1 / 2 effect. We do, however, show that expression of gut granules in med- 1 / 2 -deficient embryos is exquisitely sensitive to RNAi against the vacuolar ATPase-encoding unc- 32 gene [present on the same multicopy med- 1 (+) -containing transgenic balancer used in support of the maternal med- 1 / 2 effect]. We thus suggest that the experimental evidence for a maternal med- 1 / 2 effect should be reexamined and may instead reflect <b>cosuppression</b> caused by multiple transgenic unc- 32 sequences, not med sequences...|$|E
