5|$|Relations between Nasser and Qasim grew {{increasingly}} bitter on 9 March, after Qasim's forces suppressed a rebellion in Mosul, launched {{a day earlier}} by a pro-Nasser Iraqi RCC officer backed by UAR authorities. Nasser had considered dispatching troops to aid his Iraqi sympathizers, but decided against it. He <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> on Egyptian communist activity due to the key backing Iraqi communists provided Qasim. Several influential communists were arrested, including Nasser's old comrade Khaled Mohieddin, who {{had been allowed to}} re-enter Egypt in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{tightening}} {{of laws and}} increased enforcement by police {{on behalf of the}} British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and other industry groups—often for peripheral issues such as tax evasion—gradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD bootlegs further underground. Physical bootlegging largely shifted to countries with laxer copyright laws with the results distributed through existing underground channels, open market sites such as eBay, and other specialised websites, though {{by the end of the}} decade, eBay had <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> on bootlegs.|$|E
5|$|After halftime, the Hokies {{threatened}} Miami for {{the first}} time all game. Virginia Tech mounted an 80-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown, cutting Miami's lead to 14–10. But the Hurricanes' defense <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> on any further offensive attempts by Virginia Tech and denied the Hokies more points. Miami added twofield goals: one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter that finally put the game out of reach for Virginia Tech. Miami earned the win, 20–10. Miami's win was its first bowl victory since the 1966 Liberty Bowl, which also featured a Hurricanes victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|The 2002 San Francisco Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 2002 at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, California. The weather {{was clear and}} unseasonably warm for San Francisco in late December, but the field was soggy after several days of rain. In the first seven minutes of the game, Air Force scored 10consecutive points to take an early 10–0 lead. The Tech defense {{eventually}} <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> on the Falcons' offense, however, and only allowed three points {{for the remainder of}} the game. The Virginia Tech offense slowly climbed back from the initial 10-point deficit, scoring a touchdown in the first quarter and a field goal in the second. By halftime, the Hokies had equalized the score at 10–10.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionary {{executive}} left Islaz at {{the head}} of a gathering of soldiers and various others, and, after passing through Caracal, triumphantly entered Craiova without meeting resistance from local forces. According to one account, the gathering comprised as many as 150,000 armed civilians. As these events were unfolding, Bibescu was shot at in Bucharest by Alexandru or Iancu Paleologu (the father of French diplomat Maurice Paléologue) and his co-conspirators, whose bullets only managed to tear one of the Prince's epaulettes. Over the following hours, police forces <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> of Frăția, arresting Rosetti and a few other members, but failing to capture most of them.|$|E
5|$|The Bastille {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a prison and a royal fortress under both Henry IV and his son, Louis XIII. When Henry <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> on a Spanish-backed plot among the senior French nobility in 1602, for example, he detained the ringleader Charles Gontaut, the Duke of Biron, in the Bastille, and had him executed in the courtyard. Louis XIII's chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, is credited with beginning the modern transformation of the Bastille into a more formal organ of the French state, further increasing its structured use as a state prison. Richelieu broke with Henry IV's tradition of the Bastille's captain being a member of the French aristocracy, typically a Marshal of France such as François de Bassompierre, Charles d'Albert or Nicolas de L'Hospital, and instead appointed Père Joseph's brother to run the facility. The first surviving documentary records of prisoners at the Bastille also date from this period.|$|E

5|$|A {{prolonged}} {{civil war}} {{known as the}} Anarchy broke out in England from 1138 until 1154, between the followers of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, only ending when Matilda's son, Henry II, finally inherited the kingdom. Despite William having backed Stephen during the war, {{after the end of}} the conflict he proved a loyal supporter of Henry and was allowed to retain his possessions. Henry <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> on the operation of the regional mints, however, and closed the facility at Castle Rising; the local Jews resettled in King's Lynn. A second, rapid phase of construction work on the castle then occurred, probably in the 1170s in response to a major rebellion against Henry II. William supported the King, and fought against the rebels at the Battle of Fornham in neighbouring Suffolk. Around this time the height of the earth defences was doubled and the internal level of the west bailey raised to form a platform.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the Jellaz Incident, the French {{authorities}} imposed martial law on Tunis for almost a decade. Within months however, popular discontent manifested itself in the Tunis Tram Boycott. In response the authorities <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> hard on the Young Tunisian movement several of whose leaders were exiled from the country. After this the movement, which had generally sought to work for the advancement of Tunisia in collaboration with France, became disillusioned with this approach. When the leaders returned form exile, they took a different political approach and founded the Destour party in 1920.|$|E

25|$|In May 1899, Safirin was reelected vicar {{bishop of}} Râmnic, using the title Craioveanul, and was consecrated in July. In February 1900, he was elected, and shortly {{thereafter}} enthroned as Bishop of Roman. According to his apologist C. Cernăianu, from {{his early years}} in office, Safirin <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> on priestly corruption and the intrusions of political power. He was also an ex officio member of the Senate of Romania, but, Cernăianu notes, took distance from other church senators, whom he regarded as undignified, and mostly kept to himself. At the time, his adopted son was also investigated by government and suspended.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the close}} of 1938, King Carol's police forces <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> on the Iron Guard, and killed Codreanu in custody. Alexandrina was placed her under surveillance, {{suspected}} of having helped the outlawed movement, while her GFR and Tinerele Grupiste were also outlawed. Alecu was detained at the concentration camp in Râmnicu Sărat, where, unbeknown to his family, he was shot dead by the guards (September 22, 1939). Around October, rumors spread that Alexandrina and her other sons were also about to be interned; the authorities eventually decided to monitor Alexandrina by placing her under house arrest.|$|E
