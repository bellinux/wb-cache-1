5|$|The RIRA {{also has}} a {{political}} wing, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement (formerly the 32 County Sovereignty Committee), led by Francis Mackey. The RIRA is distinct from the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA,</b> another Provisional IRA splinter group founded in 1986, although the two groups {{have been known to}} co-operate at a local level. The Provisional IRA has been hostile to the RIRA and issued threats to RIRA members, and in October 2000 was alleged to be responsible for the fatal shooting of Belfast RIRA member Joe O'Connor according to O'Connor's family and 32 County Sovereignty Movement member Marian Price.|$|E

40|$|Following the 1998 Belfast Agreement in Northern Ireland, {{levels of}} {{paramilitary}} violence have declined substantially. Among loyalists, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and associated Red Hand Commando (RHC) have formally renounced violence, and dissolved their 'military structures', {{and perhaps the}} most reticent of all of the major paramilitary groupings, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), has taken on board the central tenets of conflict transformation, and 'stood down' all of its 'active service units' in the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). Thus, paramilitary violence now is mainly confined to the activities of 'dissident' republican groups, notably the Real and <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRAs,</b> although low-level sectarian violence remains a problem. Such dramatic societal and political change has resulted in a focus on the roles of formal party political leadership as agents of social change. This gaze, however, tends to obscure other important events such as the efforts, structures and approaches taken at the grassroots level to uphold and sustain conflict transformation and to maintain a reduction in violence. This article provides analysis of the role played by former loyalist paramilitary combatants in conflict transformation, and draws on material obtained through significant access to those former paramilitaries engaged in processes of societal shifts. In both personal and structural terms there is evidence of former combatants working to diminish the political tensions that remain {{as a result of the}} long-term inter-communal hostility developed across decades of violence and conflict...|$|R
50|$|In 1994 {{the leaders}} of Northern Ireland's two largest {{nationalist}} parties, Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Féin and John Hume, {{the leader of the}} Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) entered into peace negotiations with Unionist leaders like David Trimble of the UUP and the British government. At the table most of the paramilitary groups (including the IRA and UVF) had representatives. In 1998 when the IRA endorsed the Good Friday Agreement between nationalist and unionist parties and both governments, another small group split from the IRA to form the Real <b>IRA</b> (RIRA). The <b>Continuity</b> and Real <b>IRA</b> have both engaged in attacks not only against the British and loyalists, but even against their fellow nationalists (members of Sinn Féin, the SDLP and IRA).|$|R
25|$|The IRA {{considered}} {{itself to}} be upholding the Republic that was declared in the 1916 Proclamation, and held {{that the government of}} the Irish Free State was illegitimate. It maintained that it remained the army of that Republic, in direct <b>continuity</b> with the <b>IRA</b> of the War of Independence period. There were several competing organisations on the radical republican side of Irish politics during this period. In addition to the IRA, these included the hard-line elements of anti-Treaty Sinn Féin, such as Mary MacSwiney, who had not followed de Valera into constitutional politics, and the rump of the anti-Treaty members of the Second Dáil, still proclaiming themselves the only legitimate Irish parliament. For most of this period, the IRA's relations with Sinn Féin were poor (IRA members were even forbidden to join the party), despite the reconciliation attempt represented by the 1929 Comhairle na Poblachta. In December 1938, a reconciliation finally took place between the IRA and the rump of the Second Dáil.|$|R
25|$|The {{organization}} remains {{classified as}} a proscribed terrorist group in the UK and as an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland. Two small groups split from the IRA, the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> in 1986, and the Real IRA in 1997. Both reject the Good Friday Agreement and continue to engage in paramilitary activity.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2000s, some {{dissident}} republican {{groups have}} begun using Óglaigh na hÉireann {{as their primary}} title in both Irish- and English-language contexts. These include a <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> splinter group, first reported on by the Independent Monitoring Commission in 2006, and a Real IRA splinter group which began claiming responsibility for attacks in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Provisional Movement {{followed}} this analysis until 1986, when the IRA and Sinn Féin split {{over the issue}} of abstentionism once again. As in 1970, republican legitimatists approached Tom Maguire, who in two statements written in 1986 and 1987 but issued posthumously in 1994, maintained that the Army Council of the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> was the sole legitimate successor to the 1938 Army Council.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, {{a number}} of cumainn (or branches) and {{individual}} members of RSF left the party in protest over the party's treatment of <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> prisoners held in Portlaoise Prison. As a consequence of this dispute, {{a number of}} people resigned from RSF and formed the Concerned Group for Republican Prisoners to raise funds and provide moral support for the former Continuity IRA-aligned prisoners they supported. However a majority of the prisoners choose to return and the organisation as of 2011 is defunct.|$|E
25|$|The {{name has}} also been used by several other {{paramilitary}} groups calling themselves the Irish Republican Army since 1920. These groups each {{claim to be the}} sole legitimist modern successors to the original Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Army, and they have refused to recognise the authority of (variously) the Defence Forces, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; as such, each of these groups claims the sole right to use the name Óglaigh na hÉireann. Such groups have included the Provisional IRA, the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> and the Real IRA.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Irish {{authorities}} were again party to a settlement, the Good Friday Agreement, which set up power-sharing institutions within Northern Ireland, North-South instructions and {{links between the}} various components of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The Irish state also changed Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution to acknowledge both the existence of Northern Ireland and the desire of Irish nationalists for a united Ireland. Even {{in the wake of}} the post-Good Friday Agreement incorporation of the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin into electoral politics, there remain several republican paramilitary groups who wish to use force to destabilise Northern Ireland – such as the Real IRA and the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA.</b> Irish security forces continue to be used to try to prevent attacks by such groups.|$|E
25|$|Their banner was the Plough and the Stars. Connolly {{said the}} {{significance}} of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars. The symbolism of the flag was evident in its earliest inception of a plough with a sword as its blade. Taking inspiration from the bible and following the internationalist aspect of socialism it reflected the belief that war would be redundant with the rise of the Socialist International. This was flown by the Irish Citizens Army during the 1916 rising. The design changed during the 1930s to that of the blue banner on the left, which was designed by members of the Republican Congress, and was adopted as the emblem of the Irish Labour movement, including the Irish Labour Party, though they eventually dropped it. It is also claimed by Irish republicans and has been carried alongside the Irish tricolour and Irish provincial flags at Official IRA, Provisional IRA, Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO) and <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> rallies and marches.|$|E
500|$|After the merger, {{the media}} began {{to refer to}} the group as the [...] "New IRA". As well as RAAD, the {{alliance}} includes an east Tyrone group thought to be responsible for killing PSNI officer Ronan Kerr in 2011, and a Belfast group who badly wounded PSNI officer Peadar Heffron in 2010. The <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA,</b> and the group often referred to as ONH, remain independent. The PSNI reckoned that the new group has a membership of [...] "between 250 and 300 military activists, backed up by associates". In November 2012 it claimed responsibility for shooting dead a Prison Officer near Lurgan, the first prison officer to be killed since 1993.|$|E

2500|$|RSF sees {{itself as}} forming {{part of a}} wider Republican Movement {{with a number of}} organisations which share a similar or {{identical}} ideological and political perspective. These include (but are not limited to) the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA,</b> Cumann na mBan, Fianna Éireann, Cabhair and the National Commemoration Committee and the Republican Prisoners Action Group. Across these organisations there is believed to be some level of dual membership with RSF. RSF strenuously rejects the allegation that it is the [...] "political wing" [...] of the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA,</b> as it denies any assertion that the latter is its [...] "military wing".|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days after}} the Massereene Barracks shooting, PSNI officer Stephen Carroll was shot dead in Craigavon, County Armagh. This was the first killing of {{a police officer in}} Northern Ireland since 1998. The <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> claimed {{responsibility}} for this shooting and stated that [...] "As long as there is British involvement in Ireland, these attacks will continue".|$|E
2500|$|The shootings {{were the}} first British {{military}} fatalities in Northern Ireland since 1997. Two days later, the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> shot dead a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officer; the first Northern Irish police officer to be killed by paramilitaries since 1998. These attacks {{marked the beginning of}} the most intensive period of [...] "dissident republican" [...] activity since the start of their campaign.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{press conference}} on 25 March 2009, Richard Walsh, the {{spokesman}} for Republican Sinn Féin, a party linked to the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA,</b> said the killings were [...] "an act of war" [...] rather than murder. [...] "We have always upheld {{the right of the}} Irish people to use any level of controlled and disciplined force to drive the British out of Ireland. We make no apology for that". He also described the PSNI as [...] "an armed adjunct of the British Army".|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the book}} The Provisional IRA (by Eamon Mallie and Patrick Bishop), roughly 8,000 people passed {{through the ranks of}} the IRA in the first 20 years of its existence, many of them leaving after arrest, [...] "retirement" [...] or disillusionment. In later years, the IRA's {{strength}} has been somewhat weakened by members leaving the organisation to join hardline splinter groups such as the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> and the Real IRA. According to former Irish Minister for Justice Michael McDowell, these organisations have little more than 150 members each.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, a hard-line {{minority}} {{continued to}} reject {{the legitimacy of the}} Free State and its successor, [...] "Republic of Ireland". In 1938, a group calling itself the Executive Council of the Second Dáil delegated its self-declared authority to the IRA Army Council. The Irish Republican Army ultimately ceased military operations against Ireland in 1948 but continued to consider itself the legitimate government of all Ireland. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) split with the original IRA in December 1969 and afterward claimed that it was the sole legtimate representative of the Irish Republic. It based its claim, in part, on the support of Second Dáil member Tom Maguire. The PIRA conducted a campaign of bombings and shootings in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s until 1998, and its political wing, the modern Sinn Féin party, used to insist that the Irish Republic was still legally in existence, with the Provisional IRA as its national army, and the IRA Army Council Ireland's sole legitimate government. This view is still upheld by Republican Sinn Féin and the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA.</b> Until their disbanding, the Provisional IRA continued to use the title Óglaigh na hÉireann (lit. Volunteers of Ireland), the official Irish title for the Irish Defence Forces. <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> based their claims in part on the support they received from the last surviving anti-treaty Second Dáil member, Tom Maguire.|$|E
2500|$|The IRA {{called a}} final ceasefire in July 1997, after its {{political}} wing Sinn Féin was re-admitted into the Northern Ireland peace talks. It supported the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and in 2005 it disarmed under international supervision. An internal British army document (released in 2007 under the Freedom of Information Act) examining its 37 years of deployment in Northern Ireland, describes the IRA as [...] "a professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force", while loyalist paramilitaries and other republican groups {{are described as}} [...] "little more than a collection of gangsters". Several splinter groups have emerged, including the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> which emerged from a split in 1986 but did not become active until the Provisional IRA ceasefire of 1994, and the Real IRA after the final 1997 ceasefire, {{both of which are}} still active in the low-level dissident Irish republican campaign.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 July 2005, the IRA Army Council {{announced}} {{an end to}} its armed campaign, stating that it would work to achieve its aims using [...] "purely political and democratic programmes through exclusively peaceful means", and shortly afterwards completed decommissioning. In September 2008, the nineteenth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission stated that the IRA was [...] "committed to the political path" [...] and no longer represented [...] "a threat to peace or to democratic politics", and that the Army Council was [...] "no longer operational or functional". The organisation remains classified as a proscribed terrorist group in the UK and as an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland. Two small groups split from the Provisional IRA, the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> in 1986, and the Real IRA in 1997. Both reject the Good Friday Agreement and continue to engage in paramilitary activity.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{foreign governments}} in the Anglosphere have taken a public {{position}} against Republican Sinn Féin; the United States State Department lists the party as a [...] "terrorist organisation" [...] along with the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA.</b> The State Department states that the CIRA [...] "is a terrorist splinter group formed in 1994 as the clandestine armed wing of Republican Sinn Féin, which split from Sinn Féin in 1986. 'Continuity' refers to the group's belief that it is carrying on the original Irish Republican Army's (IRA) policy of being {{the army of the}} Irish Republic. CIRA's alleged aliases, Continuity Army Council and Republican Sinn Féin, were also designated as FTOs." [...] The British government currently lists the Continuity Army Council and the Irish Republican Army as a [...] "terrorist group" [...] under the Terrorism Act 2000, but does not mention Republican Sinn Féin.|$|E
50|$|The US {{government}} suspects the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> {{of having}} received funds and arms from {{supporters in the}} United States. Security sources in Ireland have expressed the suspicion that, in co-operation with the RIRA, the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> may have acquired arms and material from the Balkans. They also suspect that the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> arsenal contains some weapons that were taken from Provisional IRA arms dumps, including a few dozen rifles, machine guns, and pistols; {{a small amount of}} the explosive Semtex; and a few dozen detonators.|$|E
5000|$|CABHAIR (help or assistance) is an {{organisation}} {{which supports}} <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> prisoners.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> was {{responsible}} for shooting dead two of its members who had left and attempted {{to create their own}} organisation. Upon leaving the CIRA, they had allegedly taken a number of guns with them. [...] The <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> is believed by Gardaí to have been involved in a number of gangland killings in Dublin and Limerick. Recent internal feuds and splits have seen organisations such as the RCIRA (Real <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA)</b> being formed in the Limerick area and organisations such as Óglaigh na hÉireann (which ceased operating around 2009, not be confused with another more active group, also called Óglaigh na hÉireann) and Saoirse na hÉireann, a group which also ceased around that time. An RSF member remarked that splits aren't uncommon in the <b>Continuity</b> <b>IRA</b> as some individuals think they should be in a leading position of the group.|$|E
