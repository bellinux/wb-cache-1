5|$|In 1873 {{the idea}} was resurrected– again by Palmer, who was now Lord Selborne and the new Lord Chancellor– as the Supreme Court of Judicature bill. While still cautious, Selborne's bill was far more {{structured}} than Hatherley's, and contained more detail on {{what was to be}} done. Rather than fusing the common law and equity, which he saw as impracticable since it would destroy the idea of trusts, he decided to fuse the courts and the procedure. The final draft provided that all of the existing superior courts would be fused into one court consisting of two levels; one of first instance, one appellate. The court of first instance, {{to be known as the}} High Court of Justice, would be subdivided into several divisions based on the old superior courts, one of which, the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division,</b> would deal with equity cases. All jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery was to be transferred to the Chancery Division; Section 25 of the Act provided that, where there was conflict between the common law and equity, the latter would prevail. An appeal from each division went to the appellate level, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. These provisions were brought into effect after amendment with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875, and the Court of Chancery ceased to exist. The Master of the Rolls was transferred to the new Court of Appeal, the Lord Chancellor retained his other judicial and political roles, and the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist, replaced by ordinary judges. The <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> remains to this day part of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales.|$|E
5|$|Academics {{estimate}} that the Court of Chancery formally split from and became independent of the curia regis in the mid-14th century, at which time it consisted of the Lord Chancellor and his personal staff, the Chancery. Initially an administrative body with some judicial duties, the Chancery experienced an explosive growth in its work during the 15th century, particularly under the House of York, which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body. From the time of Elizabeth I onwards the Court was severely criticised for its slow pace, large backlogs, and high costs. Those problems persisted until its dissolution, despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms, particularly during the 19th century. Attempts at fusing the Chancery with the common law courts began in the 1850s, and finally succeeded with the 1873 and 1875 Supreme Court of Judicature Acts, which dissolved the Chancery and created a new unified High Court of Justice, with the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> – one of three divisions of the High Court – succeeding the Court of Chancery as an equitable body.|$|E

25|$|In 1892 the Council {{considered}} further {{reform of}} the court system to deal with growing backlogs in the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> {{and the cost of}} appeals to the House of Lords. They recommended the establishment of a Commercial Court, the creation of a Court of Criminal Appeal to take over from the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, a better division of work between the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> and Queen's Bench Division, an additional judge for the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> and the Attorney General of England and Wales to be given power to appeal against overly lenient sentencing, all of which were eventually put into practice. After this the council met irregularly; only twice between 1900 and 1907. There was a ten-year gap between meetings in 1940 and 1950 respectively, and little was done. The original Judges' Council was eventually indirectly dissolved in 1981, with the Supreme Court Act 1981, which unlike previous Acts of Parliament contained no provisions allowing for the Council's continued existence. Denis Dobson, Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, suggested this was because other bodies now existed to do what the Council had been created to achieve.|$|E

It is the production and issuing of these documents, known collectively as grants of representation, that is the primary function of the Probate Registries, which are part of the High Court, which the general public and probate professionals alike apply to for grants of representation.|$|E

50|$|Like justices of the New Jersey Supreme Court, {{judges of}} the Superior Court are {{appointed}} by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate for initial terms of seven years.

25|$|The {{new legal}} {{structure}} provided a single Court of Appeal, which heard appeals {{from all the}} various Divisions of the new unified High Court of Justice. It only heard civil cases (opportunities for appealing in criminal cases remained limited until the 20th century). In its early days, the Court of Appeal divided its sittings between Westminster Hall for appeals from the Common Law divisions, and Lincoln's Inn for Chancery, Probate, Divorce and Admiralty appeals, with five Lords Justices. After {{the opening of the}} Royal Courts of Justice in 1882 the Court of Appeal transferred there, where it remains. As well as the Lords Justices, the Lord Chancellor, any previous Lord Chancellors, the Lord Chief Justice, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, the Vice-Chancellor of the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> and the Master of the Rolls could also hear cases, although in practice only the Master of the Rolls did so.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{also changed}} the court rules on the {{submission}} of evidence. The Civil Justice Review {{found that many}} cases which {{could easily have been}} settled before the hearings in court were not, primarily because there was no way of assessing the strength of the other side's arguments and their evidence. The Civil Justice Review suggested that forcing parties to provide evidence and witness statements to the other side before the case came to court would make this assessment easier, and would lead to the parties settling their case before it came to court if one side was at an obvious disadvantage. This suggestion was accepted, and included in the Act, which says that each party must produce written statements of any oral evidence they intend to present in court, and that these statements should be given to the other party before the case comes to court. Any party who fails to comply with this may be refused leave to present this oral evidence in court. A similar system had been used in the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division,</b> Admiralty Court and Commercial Court since 1986.|$|E

5000|$|Not all [...] "trial courts" [...] {{exclusively}} exercise original jurisdiction. Indeed, in {{both the}} federal and most state court systems, the trial courts of [...] "general jurisdiction" [...] hear appeals from trial courts of limited original jurisdiction; many states call these courts [...] "superior courts" [...] for this reason. For example, United States district courts hear appeals from their Bankruptcy Courts (which operate as quasi-independent units of district courts but are constitutionally separate Article I tribunals). Similarly, the Law and <b>Chancery</b> <b>Divisions</b> of the Superior Court of New Jersey hear appeals from New Jersey County Courts; the Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas, besides hearing major trials, hear appeals from the minor trial courts (Magistrate Courts in most counties; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have unique systems) and from certain agencies of local (e.g., zoning board) and state governments (e.g., Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board).|$|R
500|$|The Master of the Rolls was {{initially}} a clerk responsible {{for keeping the}} [...] "Rolls", or records, of the Court of Chancery, and {{was known as the}} Keeper of the Rolls of Chancery. The Keeper was the most senior of the dozen Chancery clerks, and as such occasionally acted as keeper of the Great Seal of the Realm. The post evolved into a judicial one as the Court of Chancery did; the first reference to judicial duties dates from 1520. With the Judicature Act 1873, which merged the Court of Chancery with the other major courts, the Master of the Rolls joined the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> of the High Court and the Court of Appeal, but left the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> by the terms of the Judicature Act 1881. He retained his clerical functions as the nominal head of the Public Record Office until the Public Records Act 1958 transferred responsibility for it to the Lord Chancellor; the Master of the Rolls had also been warden of the little-used Domus Conversorum for housing Jewish coverts, which led to the house and chapel being used to store legal documents and later becoming the location of the Public Record Office. [...] One residual reminder of this role {{is the fact that the}} Master of the Rolls of the day continues to serve, ex officio, as President of the British Records Association. The Master of the Rolls was also previously responsible for registering solicitors, the officers of the Senior Courts.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the report}} of the Special Commissioners, the case was appealed to the High Court of Justice's <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division,</b> where it was heard by Vinelott J. In his {{judgment}} (issued 24 November 1989), Vinelott decided, based on the act, that [...] "any expense incurred" [...] referred to the average cost of keeping pupils, not the costs of keeping the teachers' children as pupils, reversing the Special Commissioners' decision. The case was then heard by the Court of Appeal, which issued its judgment on 13 November 1990. The three judges confirmed Vinelott's decision, ignoring the Hansard element of the case and confirming that, based on the Act's text, [...] "any expense incurred" [...] referred to the average cost.|$|E
500|$|While {{some critics}} feared that {{granting}} the courts unlimited jurisdiction would create [...] "a most undignified {{game of chess}} between the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> and the legislature", and that it allowed tax planners another way to hide funds, the Act received general approval at the time.

By this time, Tucker was known for writing extremely thorough opinions that analyzed numerous angles on every issue involved in the case; however, unlike many of his colleagues on the Court of Appeals, he would not deliver his opinions in seriatim if he felt a single, unified court opinion would do. In 1808, Tucker crafted another piece of proposed legislation that would have greatly reduced the number of mandatory appeals a party was entitled to, both in an effort to reduce the Court of Appeals's caseload and to curtail what Tucker saw as pointless delay tactics by parties that only served to clog the court system. The Virginia Assembly rejected this proposal, along with Tucker's idea of splitting the Court of Appeals into legal and <b>chancery</b> <b>divisions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{interlocutory}} {{appeal is}} a highly unusual type of appeal which can be filed before a case is concluded in the trial divisions of the Superior Court (Law or <b>Chancery</b> <b>Divisions</b> or the Family, General Equity, Probate or Foreclosure Parts). Usually, litigants can only appeal a Final Order of a Court in which one or more parties have [...] "lost" [...] and wish to have 3 (usually more experienced) judges rule on their case. Usually, interlocutory appeals are only accepted if the issue being appealed is dispositive of the entire case. A common example would be a criminal {{case in which the}} trial judge has ruled certain evidence, usually drugs, is admissible against the defendant. If the evidence is ruled to be inadmissible, the entire case would be usually be dismissed under the Exclusionary Rule. Therefore, it is efficient to have the issue decided by the appeals court before a trial, after which there may be a successful appeal to have the entire case dismissed -- wasting much time and money in the process. (If the prosecutor loses an exclusionary case, that would almost always be a Final Order and the prosecutor would have 45 days to appeal -- the same as any other litigant.) ...|$|R
500|$|On 19 November 1963, {{the case}} of McClory v Fleming, {{following}} up the 1961 case, was heard at the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> of the High Court. The proceedings lasted three weeks, during which time Fleming was unwell, suffering a heart attack as the case progressed. Two weeks after the case, during the weekly Tuesday staff conference at his employers, The Sunday Times, Fleming suffered a serious, second heart attack that necessitated convalescence, which he undertook at the Dudley Hotel in Hove. While there, one of Fleming's friends, Duff Dunbar, gave him a copy of Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin to read and suggested that he {{took the time to}} write up the bedtime story that Fleming used to tell his son Caspar each evening. Fleming attacked the project with gusto and wrote to his publisher, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape, joking that [...] "There is not a moment, even {{on the edge of the}} tomb, when I am not slaving for you".|$|E
500|$|The Act {{gave the}} courts near-unlimited {{discretion}} to approve [...] "compromise" [...] agreements, {{for the benefit}} of infants or other incapable individuals, for individuals who may become beneficiaries, or for unborn beneficiaries. The courts are also able to approve agreements for individuals who may be beneficiaries under protective trusts, with no requirement that the alterations be for their benefit. The courts have interpreted the Act's scope fairly widely, stating that almost any [...] "variation" [...] is acceptable, and that [...] "benefit" [...] may mean not just a financial benefit, but also a social or moral one. Despite initial fears that it would allow tax planners another way to hide funds and create a back-and-forth fight between the <b>Chancery</b> <b>Division</b> and Parliament, the Act was met with general approval. The ability of the courts to alter trustees' investment powers under the Act was criticised as slow and expensive, and as a result this is now covered by the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E
500|$|The Act, finally {{passed as}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. The King's Bench thus ceased to exist, holding its last session on 6 July 1875, except as the King's Bench Division of the High Court. The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880, allowing for {{the abolition of the}} Common Pleas Division and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880.

5000|$|There {{was some}} exaggeration in both statements. In {{pursuing}} {{the fusion of}} law and equity which was the dominant legal idea of law reformers of that period, {{the framers of the}} first set of rules devised a system which they thought would meet the defects of both systems, and be appropriate for both the common-law and the <b>chancery</b> <b>divisions.</b> In a normal case, the plaintiff delivered his statement of claim, in which he was to set forth concisely the facts on which he relied, and the relief which he asked.

The plaintiff might then reply, and the defendant rejoin, and so on until the pleaders had exhausted themselves. This system of pleading was not a bad one if accompanied by the right of either party to demur to his opponent's pleading, i.e. to say, [...] "admitting all your averments of fact to be true, you still have no cause of action", or [...] "defence" [...] (as the case may be).|$|R
