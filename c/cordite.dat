5|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>cordite</b> handling, {{the battle was}} mostly inconclusive, though both the British {{flagship}} Lion and Seydlitz were severely damaged. Lion lost speed, causing her to fall behind {{the rest of the}} battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships {{for the remainder of the}} engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser Blücher, sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected <b>cordite</b> charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy {{convened a}} {{commission}} to investigate the explosion {{the day after the}} incident with Vice Admiral Murakami Kakuichi as chairman. The commission first suspected arson, but no plausible suspect could be found and it reported that the <b>cordite</b> in her magazine might have spontaneously ignited due to decomposition. Kawachis magazines had been inspected in January–February 1918, however, and no problems were discovered, which made that possibility less likely. The commission made recommendations on tighter control of production and handling of <b>cordite</b> that were successfully adopted by the navy. The Japanese Navy considered salvaging Kawachi, but ultimately decided that it would be too expensive and would delay the construction of one battlecruiser by over a year. Stricken from the navy list on 21 September 1918, the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an artificial reef.|$|E
5|$|A {{gunpowder}} plant {{had been}} established around 1573 in Faversham. The town had a stream which could be dammed at intervals to provide power for watermills. It {{became known as the}} Home Works in the 18th century and was nationalised in 1759. By the 19th century, the site stretched for around a mile along the waterfront. A second explosive works was established at Oare to the northwest of town in the late 17th century, with the Marsh Works following in 1786. Towards the end of the 19th century, two new factories were built alongside the Swale to manage production of TNT and <b>cordite.</b> Faversham developed six explosive factories, and from 1874 to 1919, the town was the centre of the explosives industry in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four <b>cordite</b> powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 15:25, {{and without}} warning, {{a series of}} violent explosions tore through the rear part of the ship. She capsized five minutes later. Some thought {{that she had been}} torpedoed by a German U-boat or detonated a submarine-laid mine, but {{examination}} of the wreckage revealed that the explosions were internal. The divers sent to investigate the ship reported that the explosions began in either the rear 9.2-inch shellroom or the 3-pounder and small arms magazine. The Admiralty court-martial into the causes of her loss concluded that it was caused by an internal ammunition explosion, possibly due to faulty <b>cordite.</b> The Admiralty issued a revised list of the dead and missing that totaled 390 in January 1916, but did not list the women and children on board that day. Losses are listed from 390 to 421.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of <b>cordite</b> in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the <b>cordite</b> used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a further}} {{difference}} in the propellant itself. While the German RP C/12 burned when exposed to fire, it did not explode, as opposed to <b>cordite.</b> RP C/12 was extensively studied by the British and, after World War I, would {{form the basis of}} the later <b>Cordite</b> SC.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet {{had also}} {{emphasised}} speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, <b>cordite</b> {{could not be}} supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open {{that should have been}} shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of <b>cordite</b> were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions. This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices. Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and <b>cordite</b> held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, <b>cordite</b> was stored in insecure places.|$|E
25|$|A diving {{expedition}} {{during the}} summer of 2003 provided corroboration of this practice. It examined the wrecks of Invincible, Queen Mary, Defence, and Lützow to investigate the cause of the British ships' tendency to suffer from internal explosions. From this evidence, {{a major part of the}} blame may be laid on lax handling of the <b>cordite</b> propellant for the shells of the main guns. The wreck of the Queen Mary revealed <b>cordite</b> containers stacked in the working chamber of the X turret instead of the magazine.|$|E
25|$|On 5 June 1916, the First Lord of the Admiralty advised Cabinet Members {{that the}} three battlecruisers had been lost due to unsafe <b>cordite</b> management.|$|E
25|$|Weizmann lectured in {{chemistry}} at the University of Geneva between 1901 and 1903, and later {{taught at the}} University of Manchester. He became a British subject in 1910, and while a lecturer in Manchester he became known for discovering how to use bacterial fermentation to produce large quantities of desired substances. He {{is considered to be}} the father of industrial fermentation. He used the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum (the Weizmann organism) to produce acetone. Acetone was used in the manufacture of <b>cordite</b> explosive propellants critical to the Allied war effort (see Royal Navy <b>Cordite</b> Factory, Holton Heath). Weizmann transferred the rights to the manufacture of acetone to the Commercial Solvents Corporation in exchange for royalties.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Waltham Abbey {{remained}} an important <b>cordite</b> production unit {{and for the}} first two years of the war was the sole producer of RDX. RDX is one component of torpex, the explosive that was used in the Bouncing Bomb.|$|E
25|$|Soon after {{receiving}} his AM, Bastian was invalided {{out of the}} Merchant Navy {{as a result of}} the damage caused to his lungs by the <b>cordite</b> smoke he inhaled during the rescue. In 1947, he settled in Canada, living in Montreal.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Standard Oil first {{produced}} {{isopropyl alcohol}} by hydrating propene. Its major {{use at the}} time was not rubbing alcohol but for oxidation to acetone, whose first major use was in World War One for the preparation of the smokeless propellant, <b>cordite.</b>|$|E
25|$|The United States Navy in 1939 had {{quantities}} of <b>Cordite</b> N, a Canadian propellant {{that was much}} improved, yet its Bureau of Ordnance objected strongly to its use onboard U.S. warships, considering it unsuitable as a naval propellant due to its inclusion of nitroglycerin.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powders, such as <b>cordite,</b> {{in the late}} 19th century created {{the need for a}} spark-sensitive priming charge, such as gunpowder. However, the sulfur content of traditional gunpowders caused corrosion problems with <b>Cordite</b> Mk I and this led to the introduction of a range of sulfur-free gunpowders, of varying grain sizes. They typically contain 70.5 parts of saltpeter and 29.5 parts of charcoal. Like black powder, they were produced in different grain sizes. In the United Kingdom, the finest grain was known as sulfur-free mealed powder (SMP). Coarser grains were numbered as sulfur-free gunpowder (SFG n): 'SFG 12', 'SFG 20', 'SFG 40' and 'SFG 90', for example; where the number represents the smallest BSS sieve mesh size, which retained no grains.|$|E
25|$|Total {{transfer}} of RDX production {{to the west}} of England, to ROF Bridgwater; and dispersal of <b>cordite</b> production to new propellant factories located: in the west of Scotland, three co-located factories at ROF Bishopton, to Wales, ROF Wrexham, and to the North East, ROF Ranskill, was achieved by 1943. Many Waltham Abbey staff played a vital role in developing the new Explosive Royal Ordnance Factories, training staff and superintending production.|$|E
25|$|All the Waltham Abbey barges were of {{wood and}} without {{mechanical}} propulsion, to reduce risk of explosion. In 1943 all the production of <b>cordite</b> and RDX was transferred away from Royal Gunpowder Factory, and Lady of the Lea was fitted with a petrol engine by the Royal Navy. After the end of World War II she was withdrawn from service and sold in 1946 by the Small Craft Disposal Board.|$|E
25|$|It is {{inherently}} dangerous {{to have a}} weapon containing a quantity and shape of fissile material which can form a critical mass through a relatively simple accident. Because of this danger, the propellant in Little Boy (four bags of <b>cordite)</b> was inserted into the bomb in flight, shortly after takeoff on August 6, 1945. This {{was the first time}} a gun-type nuclear weapon had ever been fully assembled.|$|E
25|$|The Formidables and Londons {{improved}} on {{the main}} and secondary armament of previous classes, being upgunned from 35-caliber to 40-caliber 12-inch (305mm) guns, and from 40-caliber to 45-caliber 6-inch (152mm) guns. The 12-inch guns could be loaded at any bearing and elevation, and a split hoist beneath the turrets with a working chamber beneath the guns reduced {{the chance of a}} <b>cordite</b> fire spreading from the turret to the shell and powder handling rooms and to the magazines.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Bulwark, {{along with the rest of}} the squadron, was attached to the Channel Fleet, conducting patrols in the English Channel. On 26 November 1914, while anchored near Sheerness, she was destroyed by a large internal explosion with the loss of 736 men. There were only 14 survivors of the explosion and of these 2 died later in hospital. The explosion was likely to have been caused by the overheating of <b>cordite</b> charges that had been placed adjacent to a boiler room bulkhead.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{disaster}} {{appears to have been}} overheating of <b>cordite</b> charges stored alongside a boiler room bulkhead, and this was the explanation accepted by the court of enquiry. It has also been suggested that damage caused to one of the shells stored in the battleship's cross-passageways may have weakened the fusing mechanism and caused the shell to become 'live'. A blow to the shell, caused by it being dropped point down, could then have set off a chain reaction of explosions among the shells stored in Bulwarks cross-passageways sufficient to detonate the ship's magazines.|$|E
25|$|The British {{found that}} they were at a {{disadvantage}} in night fighting as they were temporarily blinded by the flash of their guns, while the Italian ships carried flashless <b>cordite</b> and good tracer ammunition. The escorts were blamed by the headquarters at Aden {{for a lack of}} aggression, except for Kimberley, despite the risk of abandoning the convoy at night in poor visibility. The Italians had managed to make two torpedo attacks as planned but the division of the destroyers into two units, after previous sorties had failed to find any ships, had meant that neither had the firepower to face the British escorts.|$|E
25|$|The {{restriction}} on weight meant the torpedo {{could not be}} fired from a torpedo tube, but instead was carried in a rear-facing trough. On firing it was pushed backwards by a <b>cordite</b> firing pistol and a long steel ram, entering the water tail-first. A trip-wire between the torpedo and the ram head would start the torpedo motors once pulled taut during release. The CMB would then turn hard over {{and get out of}} its path. There is no record of a CMB ever being hit by its own torpedo, but in one instance the firing pistol was triggered prematurely and the crew had a tense 20 minutes close to the enemy whilst reloading it.|$|E
25|$|Although upon Layforce's formation, the {{commando}} {{concept was}} embryonic, when it embarked from the United Kingdom, {{it had been}} intended that the force would be employed {{to carry out a}} campaign of harassment and dislocation against enemy forces in the Mediterranean. At the time that Layforce was raised, the British were largely in the ascendency in the theatre, having defeated the Italians and it was felt that the commandos could be employed in the capture of the Greek island of Rhodes as part of Operation <b>Cordite.</b> The arrival of the Afrika Korps in Cyrenaica and the invasions of Yugoslavia and Greece greatly changed the strategic outlook and by the time that Layforce arrived in Egypt in March, the situation had deteriorated. There was still a role for commando-style operations and arguably, a series of successful small-scale raids at vital points in the German rear areas, might have forced Rommel to divert some of his offensive capability to defend his lines of communications. Curcumstances undermined the Layforce concept, almost as soon as it became established.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 November 1918, captained by Francis F. Caulfield RN, Britannia was on a voyage in the western {{entrance}} to the Strait of Gibraltar when she was torpedoed off Cape Trafalgar by the German submarine UB-50. After the first explosion, the ship listed ten degrees to port. A few minutes later, a second explosion started a fire in a 9.2-inch (234-mm) magazine, which in turn caused a <b>cordite</b> explosion in the magazine. Darkness below decks made it virtually impossible to find the flooding valves for the magazines, and those the crew did find were poorly located and therefore hard to turn, and the resulting failure to properly flood the burning magazine probably doomed the ship. Britannia held her 10-degree list for 2½ hours before sinking, allowing most of the crew to be taken off. Most {{of the men who}} were lost were killed by toxic smoke from burning cordite; 50 men died and 80 were injured. In total, 39 officers and 673 men were saved.|$|E
500|$|Alfred Nobel (...) {{was born}} on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of engineers. He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. In 1894, Nobel {{purchased}} the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder <b>cordite.</b> As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over <b>cordite.</b> Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth from his 355inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.|$|E
500|$|On 11 March 1916, Capitán Prat {{suffered}} a magazine explosion {{while she was}} anchored in port in Valparaiso. Two cases of bad <b>cordite</b> propellant in the aft main battery magazine exploded. The construction of the ship, however, which provided a quick venting of the explosion, and defects in the propellant cases that allowed the explosive gasses to escape easily, saved the ship from destruction. The <b>cordite</b> was by that time 17 to 20 years old, about the maximum life-span of the propellant. By 1926, Capitán Prat {{was reduced to a}} coast defense ship. From 1928 to 1930, the ship was designated as a submarine tender for Chile's H and [...] submarines. She was disarmed in 1935 to serve with the mechanical training school. The old battleship was ultimately sold for scrap in 1942.|$|E
500|$|In {{the space}} of a week on Tinian, four B-29s crashed and burned on the runway. Parsons became very concerned. If a B-29 [...] crashed with a Little Boy, the fire could cook off the {{explosive}} and detonate the weapon, with catastrophic consequences. Consideration was given to evacuating the 20,000 personnel on Tinian from the island, but instead it was decided to load the four <b>cordite</b> powder bags into the gun breech to arm the bomb in flight.|$|E
500|$|While the calibre of {{the main}} battery {{remained}} quite constant, {{the performance of the}} guns improved as longer barrels were introduced. The introduction of slow-burning nitrocellulose and <b>cordite</b> propellant allowed the employment of a longer barrel, and therefore higher muzzle velocity—giving greater range and penetrating power for the same calibre of shell. Between the Majestic class and Dreadnought, the length of the British 12-inch gun increased from 35 calibres to 45 and muzzle velocity increased from [...] per second to [...] per second.|$|E
500|$|... {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Grand Fleet's battlecruisers throughout World War I. She sank the German light cruiser [...] during the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 and participated in the battles of Dogger Bank in 1915 and Jutland the following year. She was so badly damaged at the Battle of Dogger Bank {{that she had to}} be towed back to port. During the Battle of Jutland, Lion suffered a serious <b>cordite</b> fire that could have destroyed the ship.|$|E
500|$|As a precaution, Gorgons cork lagging was {{stripped}} out {{and replaced by}} silicate wool which revealed the real cause. Part of the cork was missing and folded newspapers {{were found in the}} empty space. Furthermore a number of rivets were entirely missing which meant that ½-inch (12.7mm) holes were present which could have dropped hot ashes onto the newspapers. The forced draught pressure in the boiler room would have supplied air through the rivet holes which would have caused the cork to give off flammable gases and eventually ignite the <b>cordite</b> charges.|$|E

500|$|At Jutland, Harvey, {{although}} {{mortally wounded}} by German shellfire, ordered the magazine of Q turret on the battlecruiser Lion to be flooded. This action prevented the tons of <b>cordite</b> stored there from catastrophically detonating {{in an explosion}} that would have destroyed the vessel and all aboard her. Although he succumbed to his injuries seconds later, his dying act may have saved over a thousand lives and prompted Winston Churchill to later comment: [...] "In the long, rough, glorious history of the Royal Marines there is no name and no deed which in its character and consequences ranks above this".|$|E
500|$|Just as Exmouth {{was coming}} up on the group at 20:45, Audacious heeled sharply, paused, and then capsized. She floated upside down with the bow raised until 21:00, when an {{explosion}} occurred that threw wreckage [...] into the air, followed by two more. The explosion appeared to come from the area of 'B' magazine and was probably caused by one or more high-explosive shells falling from their racks and exploding, then igniting the <b>cordite</b> in the magazine. A piece of armour plate flew [...] and killed a petty officer on Liverpool. This was the only casualty in connection with the sinking.|$|E
