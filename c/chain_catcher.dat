50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>catcher</b> {{helps prevent}} the chain being thrown {{back towards the}} user, if the chain breaks or becomes derailed. The catcher catches the chain when it details {{downwards}} and shortens it. Then the chain moves underneath the saw body smashing against the rear hand protection at the rear handle (The bottom of the handle is wider to the ba side as to the other). As shown in the image chain catchers are made of aluminum not to damage the chain. A worn out <b>chain</b> <b>catcher</b> can be changed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>catcher</b> {{is located}} between the saw {{body and the}} clutch cover. In most cases {{it looks like a}} hook made in aluminum. It is used to stop the chain when it derails from the bar and shortens the length of the chain. When derailing the chain swings from {{underneath}} the saw towards the operator. The shorting prevents hitting the operator, but it hits the rear handle guard.|$|E
