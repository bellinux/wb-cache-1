2500|$|In mathematics, a {{generalized}} hypergeometric series {{is a power}} series in which the ratio of successive coefficients indexed by n is a rational function of n.

The generalized hypergeometric series is sometimes just called the hypergeometric series, though this term also sometimes just refers to the Gaussian hypergeometric series.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we deduce some tight Turán type inequalities for Tricomi <b>confluent</b> <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>functions</b> {{of the second}} kind, which in some cases improve the {{existing}} results in the literature.

Moreover, by using these Turán type inequalities, we deduce some new inequalities for Tricomi <b>confluent</b> <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>functions</b> of the second kind. The key tool in the proof of the Turán type inequalities is an integral representation for a quotient of Tricomi <b>confluent</b> <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>functions,</b> which arises {{in the study of}} the infinite divisibility of the Fisher-Snedecor F distribution.
