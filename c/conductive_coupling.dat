40|$|The geochemical {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in an area covering about 15 km 2 of {{the south side of}} the Wadi Rumman area, SW Jordan. The study area included a part of a basement of complex exposed rocks in southwestern Jordan. The complexes comprised igneous and metamorphic suites, mostly from the late Proterozoic age. A systematic geochemical sampling was conducted using rock and heavy mineral-panned concentrate of geochemical samples. Fifty rock samples were collected from the granitic rocks, simple pegmatite dyke, quartz veins and alteration zone, which covered the area. Next, 45 heavy mineral-panned concentrate samples were collected from the alluvium in the stream sediment within the catchment area, and the dray was sieved to less than 1 mm grain size. The geochemical samples were analyzed for their trace elements and gold by using Ione <b>Conductive</b> <b>Coupled</b> Plasma Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and the Atomic Absorption Spec-trometer (AAS) at Natural Resources Authority (NRA) Labs. The results of the geochemical analy-sis indicated the presence of gold and heavy minerals in the study area, a result considered ab-normal in the rock samples. A strong positive correlation was recorded of Au with As, Cu and W (r = 0. 82, 0. 7 and 1. 0), as with Mo (r = 0. 83), Cu with Pb (r = 0. 83), Sn with Mo (r = 0. 73), Mo with W (r...|$|R
50|$|In electronics, {{crosstalk}} is any phenomenon {{by which}} a signal transmitted on one circuit or channel of a transmission system creates an undesired effect in another circuit or channel.

50|$|Most {{electric}} cars have used <b>conductive</b> <b>coupling</b> to supply electricity for recharging after the California Air Resources Board {{settled on the}} SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001. In Europe, the ACEA has {{decided to use the}} Type 2 connector from the range of IEC_62196 plug types for conductive charging of electric vehicles in the European Union as the Type 1 connector (SAE J1772-2009) does not provide for three-phase charging.|$|E
50|$|Coupling is {{also the}} {{transfer}} of electrical energy from one circuit segment to another. For example, energy is transferred from a power source to an electrical load by means of <b>conductive</b> <b>coupling,</b> which may be either resistive or hard-wire. An AC potential may be transferred from one circuit segment to another having a DC potential by use of a capacitor. Electrical energy may be transferred from one circuit segment to another segment with different impedance by use of a transformer. This is known as impedance matching. These are examples of electrostatic and electrodynamic inductive coupling.|$|E

50|$|RAV4 EV {{pre-production}} prototypes {{were first}} released in a confidential evaluation program with electric utilities throughout the U.S. These prototypes {{were based on}} the smaller, shorter, two-door version of the RAV4. The prototypes included some versions fitted with Panasonic NiMH batteries, and others with high-performance Panasonic lead-acid PbA batteries (the same ones that eventually found their way into the EV1 and other production GM electric vehicles). The RAV4 EV prototypes also were equipped with on-board level 2 chargers and connected via a front fender <b>conductive</b> charger <b>coupling</b> made by Yazaki Corporation.

50|$|The {{charging}} {{power can}} {{be connected to the}} car in two ways. The first is a direct electrical connection known as <b>conductive</b> <b>coupling.</b> This might be as simple as a mains lead into a weatherproof socket through special high capacity cables with connectors to protect the user from high voltages. The modern standard for plug-in vehicle charging is the SAE 1772 conductive connector (IEC 62196 Type 1) in the US. The ACEA has chosen the VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 (IEC 62196 Type 2) for deployment in Europe, which, without a latch, means unnecessary extra power requirements for the locking mechanism.|$|E
50|$|In one {{inductive}} charging system, one winding {{is attached to}} the underside of the car, and the other stays {{on the floor of the}} garage. The major advantage of the inductive approach for vehicle charging is that there is no possibility of electric shock, as there are no exposed conductors, although interlocks, special connectors and RCDs (ground fault interruptors, or GFIs) can make <b>conductive</b> <b>coupling</b> nearly as safe. An {{inductive charging}} proponent from Toyota contended in 1998 that overall cost differences were minimal, while a conductive charging proponent from Ford contended that conductive charging was more cost efficient.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{stimulus}} {{for the development}} of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board. Formerly electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 had used inductive charger couplers. These were ruled out in favor of <b>conductive</b> <b>coupling</b> to supply electricity for recharging with the California Air Resources Board settling upon the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001. Avcon manufactured a rectangular connector compliant with that SAE J1772 REV NOV 2001 specification that was capable of delivering up to 6.6 kW of electrical power.

5000|$|The second {{approach}} {{is known as}} inductive charging. A special 'paddle' is inserted into a slot on the car. The paddle is one winding of a transformer, while the other {{is built into the}} car. When the paddle is inserted it completes a magnetic circuit which provides power to the battery pack. In one inductive charging system, [...] one winding is attached to the underside of the car, and the other stays {{on the floor of the}} garage. The advantage of the inductive {{approach is}} that there is no possibility of electrocution as there are no exposed conductors, although interlocks, special connectors and ground fault detectors can make <b>conductive</b> <b>coupling</b> nearly as safe. Inductive charging can also reduce vehicle weight, by moving more charging componentry offboard.

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of metallic nanoparticles are highly sensitive to interparticle distance, {{giving rise to}} dramatic but frequently irreversible color changes. By electrochemical modification of individual nanoparticles and nanoparticle pairs, we induced equally dramatic, yet reversible, changes in their {{optical properties}}.

40|$|The use {{of power}} {{electronic}} switching controllers {{for all types of}} traction drives can lead to harmonic currents on the supply side. These currents, by <b>conductive</b> or mutual <b>coupling,</b> can cause interference in signalling and telecommunications circuits. After reviewing these basic considerations, this paper outlines the harmonic spectra of d. c. -supplied chopper and inverter drives. In the case of chopper controllers, choosing a frequency unrelated to any signalling frequency combined with the attenuation provided by the input filter is usually suficient to avoid dangerous interference. For inverter drives, the situation is more complex due to the intrinsic sweepfrequency nature of the drive. However, special modulation strategies can be used for the inverter which eliminates, or at least reduces to a safe level, any particular frequency which may interfere with signalling equipment. A method for generating these optimized pulse-width modulation schemes using fast on-board micro-processors is briefly described. ...|$|R

VKE-XPS, <b>coupled</b> with maximum entropy analysis, shows {{significant differences in the}} compositional depth profile between the Al-rich, the La-rich, and stoichiometric films; significant La enrichment at the interface is observed in the La-rich and stoichiometric films, while the Al-rich shows little to no intermixing. Additionally, the La-rich and stoichiometric films show a high concentration of Al at the surface, which is not observed in the Al-rich film. HAXPES valence band (VB) analysis shows a broadening of the VB for the Al-rich sample relative to the stoichiometric and La-rich samples, which have insulating interfaces.
