5|$|It was at {{this moment}} that the timely arrival of the Dutch General <b>Chassé</b> turned the tide in favour of the Anglo-allied army.Chassé's {{relatively}} fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain Krahmer de Bichin. The battery opened a destructive fire into the 1st/3rd Grenadiers' flank. This still did not stop the Guard's advance, so <b>Chassé</b> ordered his first brigade (Colonel Hendrik Detmers) to charge the outnumbered French with the bayonet; the French grenadiers then faltered and broke. The 4th Grenadiers, seeing their comrades retreat and having suffered heavy casualties themselves, now wheeled right about and retired.|$|E
5|$|Tasked {{with the}} defence {{of the greater}} Paris area was the Zone d'Opérations Aériennes Nord or Z.O.A.N (Northern Zone of Air Operations). Groupe de <b>Chasse</b> I/145 (Polish) armed with Caudron C.714 fighters were based at Dreux. G.C. I/1 with Bloch MB.152s were based at Chantilly-Les Aigles. G.C. II/1 Bloch 152s were {{deployed}} to Brétigny-sur-Orge airfield. G.C. II/10 Bloch 152s were located at Bernay-en-Ponthieu, while G.C. III/10 Bloch 152s were based at Deauville. More fighter units operating the Dewoitine D.520 are also listed {{on the order of}} battle: G.C. I/3 at Meaux–Esbly, G.C. II/3 at La Ferté-sur-Chiers–Gaucher, G.C. III/3 with the D.520 and Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 at Illiers-l'Évêque. Further units were located along the line. G.C. I/4 with Curtiss H-75s at Évreux-Fauville, G.C. II/4 Curtiss H-75 at Orconte, G.C. I/6 Morane 406s at LognesÉmerainville, G.C. III/7 (Morane 406s) at Coulommiers, G.C. I/8 Bloch 152s at Claye-Souilly, and G.C. II/9 Bloch 152s at Connantre. These units were supported by night fighter units, (Groupement de <b>Chasse</b> de Nuit, Night Hunting Group), E.C.M.J. 1/16, E.C.N. 1/13, 2/13, 3/13 and 4/13 equipped with the Potez 631. All in all, these groups totalled 240 aircraft. Only 120 fighters were made available to counter German attacks.|$|E
5|$|The first French Spaniel is speculated to have {{appeared}} following the Crusades of the 11th century, {{and it was}} these breeds of dogs that were described in Gaston III of Foix-Béarn's 14th-century work Livre de <b>Chasse.</b> Following the French Revolution the commoners in France were allowed to raise and keep their own hunting dogs. This in turn meant that the pre-existing French Spaniel split into several types specific to their own regions, which were classified according to physical appearance and hunting abilities.|$|E

50|$|An {{independent}} Dutch {{army was}} resurrected {{by the new}} Kingdom of the United Netherlands in 1814, following the Orangist uprising against Napoleonic rule in 1813. This new force, the Netherlands Mobile Army, formed {{an integral part of}} the allied army during the Hundred Days Campaign that culminated in the Battle of Waterloo. Units such as Baron <b>Chassé's</b> were key in securing victory for the allied army. Since 1814, (elements of) the army have been involved in several military conflicts (Waterloo campaign 1815, several colonial wars 1825-1925, and the Belgian Revolution 1830-1832.|$|R
5|$|On November8, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana president, Charlotte Randolph, {{declared}} a state of emergency for the parish as the storm approached the United States Gulf Coast. Although no evacuations were issued, all schools and government offices were closed through November10. Voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in Plaquemines Parish along coastal areas. The Belle <b>Chasse</b> Auditorium was converted into a shelter to house evacuees for the duration of the storm. Grand Isle mayor David Carmadelle issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in recreational vehicles and trailers on the island. Nearly 1,400 families still living in temporary FEMA homes in Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, were urged to stay at home.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 {{units were}} also {{instrumental}} in the Battle of France. It was here {{that most of the}} Ju 87-equipped units were concentrated. They assisted in the breakthrough at Sedan, the critical and first major land battle of the war on French territory. The Stukawaffe flew 300 sorties against French positions, with StG 77 alone flying 201 individual missions. The Ju 87s benefited from heavy fighter protection from Messerschmitt Bf 109 units. When resistance was organised, the Ju 87s could be vulnerable. For example, on 12 May, near Sedan, six French Curtiss H-75s from Groupe de <b>Chasse</b> I/5 (Group Interception) attacked a formation of Ju 87s, claiming 11 out of 12 unescorted Ju 87s without loss (the Germans recorded six losses over Sedan entire). For the most part, Allied opposition was disorganised. During the battles of Montcornet, Arras, Bolougne and Calais the Ju 87 operations broke-up counterattacks and offered pin-point aerial artillery support for German infantry.|$|E
5|$|French Air Forces {{under the}} command of Commandant des Forces (Commander of Forces) Marcel Têtu Aeriennes de Cooperation du Front Nord-Est (Ardennes Cooperation Front North East, or FACNE) rarely {{supported}} the British efforts despite substantial reinforcements. They flew only an average of one sortie per day, including strategic defensive missions. One reason for this was heavy French bomber losses on the previous two days. During the Battle of Maastricht in the Netherlands, the Groupement de Bombardement (Bomber Groups, or GB) had its squadrons reduced. GB I/12 and II/12 had only 13 LeO 451s between them. Groupement de Bombardement d'Assaut 18 (GBA 18) had only 12 of 25 Breguet 693s left. GB I/34 and II/34 could muster eight aircraft out of 22 Amiot 143s, I/38 seven out of 12, and II/38 six out of 11. All of these groups were sent to Sedan on 14 May. Escort was given from Groupement de <b>Chasse</b> (Fighter Groups, or GC). GC III/7 with 12 Morane 406s, 12 Bloch 152s of I/8 and nine Dewoitine D.520s of I/3 took part. GBA 18 was escorted by 15 Bloch 152s of GC I/8. The missions cost the French five bombers, two from ground fire. After this date, the French bomber forces were eliminated from the fight over Sedan. The major efforts were now made by the AASF.|$|E
5000|$|Major General Sir John Byng, {{who was now}} {{in command}} of Anglo-allied I Corps, having heard, on passing Vermand, that Wellington was there, {{immediately}} visited Wellington. On receiving him, Wellington said, [...] "You are the very person I wish to see — I {{want you to take}} Péronne. You may as well take with you a Brigade of Guards, and a Dutch-Belgian brigade. I shall be there almost as soon as yourself". Byng proceed to carry out his orders and issued his own for 1st Brigade (Maitland's), and a Dutch-Belgian Brigade of <b>Chassé's</b> Division attached to his corps, to proceed towards Péronne.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{the left}} of the Anglo-allied army, which was nearest to the presumed point of attack — Netherlands 2nd Division (Perponcher's) and Netherlands 3rd Division (<b>Chassé's)</b> were to be {{assembled}} that night at Nivelles, on which point British 3rd Division (Alten's) was to march as soon as collected at Braine-le-Comte; but this movement was not to be made until the French attack upon the right of the Prussian army and {{the left of}} Wellington's had become a matter of certainty. British 1st Division (Cooke's) was to be collected that night at Enghien, and to be in readiness to move at a moment's notice.|$|R
50|$|On 22 February, Antoine Gruyer led 3,600 {{men of the}} 2nd Light, 24th Line, 36th Line and 122nd Line {{plus the}} 6th Chevau-léger Lancers in an attack on Méry-sur-Seine. There were 5,000 Russians and 1,200 Prussians in opposition. Both sides {{suffered}} about 800 casualties including Gruyer wounded. <b>Chassé's</b> 2nd Brigade, which {{was made up of}} the 16th Light, 8th Line, 28th and 54th Line, was not engaged. In the action, the French overran the village of Méry, but were unable to hold the part of the town on the north bank {{in the face of an}} Allied counterattack. Boyer later reported that the army of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher was moving west along the Seine River. This alerted Napoleon that the Prussian general might be trying to cut his communications with Paris.|$|R

25|$|In 1830, {{the city}} was {{captured}} by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik <b>Chassé.</b> For a time <b>Chassé</b> subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, {{and at the end}} of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, <b>Chassé</b> made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).|$|E
5000|$|On 19 January 1814, Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult {{received}} {{the order to}} begin {{the transfer of the}} infantry divisions of Boyer and Jean François Leval to Napoleon's army operating near Paris. They began their march on 21 January. Boyer's division left behind Jean-Baptiste Pierre Menne's brigade, the 118th and 120th Line Infantry Regiments, and instead took David Hendrik <b>Chassé's</b> brigade, the 16th Light, 8th Line and 28th Line. Boyer received promotion to general of division on 16 February 1814. A detachment under Étienne Gauthier arrived in time to join Marshal Nicolas Oudinot's corps for the Battle of Mormant on 17 February. Present were two battalions each of the 2nd Light and 122nd Line and one battalion each of the 24th Line and 33rd Line. The 33rd was a new unit of conscripts that joined along the way.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that the breast tumor microenvironment drives cancer progression and metastatic development. The aim of our research {{was to investigate the}} prognostic significance of the breast tumor microenvironment in untreated early breast cancer patients. Therefore, we analyzed the association of the expression of α-SMA, FSP, CD 105 and CD 146 in CD 34 -negative spindle-shaped stromal cells, not associated with the vasculature, in primary breast tumors with classical prognostic marker levels, metastatic recurrence, local relapse, disease-free survival, metastasis-free survival and the overall survival of patients. In the same way, we evaluated the association of the amount of intra-tumor stroma, fibroblasts, collagen deposition, lymphocytic infiltration and myxoid changes in these samples with the clinical-pathological data previously described. This study is the first to demonstrate the high CD 105 expression in this stromal cell type as a possible independent marker of unfavorable prognosis in early breast cancer patients. Our study suggests that this new finding can be useful prognostic marker in the clinical-pathological routine. Fil: Martinez, Leandro Marcelo.

6000|$|How {{pleasant}} to lie awake {{and listen to}} the cheery peal! whilst the old city is asleep at midnight, or waking up rosy at sunrise, or basking in noon, or swept by the scudding rain which drives in gusts over the broad places, and the great shining river; or sparkling in snow which dresses up a hundred thousand masts, peaks, and towers; or wrapped round with thunder-cloud canopies, before, which the white gables shine whiter; day and night the kind little carillon plays its fantastic melodies overhead. The bells go on ringing. Quot vivos vocant, mortuos plangunt, fulgara frangunt; so on to the past and future tenses, and for how many nights, days, and years! Whilst the French were pitching their fulgara into <b>Chasse's</b> citadel, the bells went on ringing quite cheerfully. Whilst the scaffolds were up and guarded by Alva's soldiery, and regiments of penitents, blue, black, and gray, poured out of churches and convents, droning their dirges, and marching to the place of the Hotel de Ville, where heretics and rebels were to meet their doom, the bells up yonder were chanting at their appointed half-hours and quarters, and rang the mauvais quart d'heure for many a poor soul. This bell can see as far away as the towers and dykes of Rotterdam. That one can call a greeting to St. Ursula's at Brussels, and toss a recognition to that one at the town-hall of Oudenarde, and remember how after a great struggle there a hundred and fifty years ago the whole plain was covered with the flying French cavalry--Burgundy, and Bern, and the Chevalier of St. George flying like the rest. [...] "What is your clamor about Oudenarde?" [...] says another bell (Bob Major THIS one must be). [...] "Be still, thou querulous old clapper! I can see over to Hougoumont and St. John. And about forty-five years since, I rang all through one Sunday in June, when there was such a battle going on in the corn-fields there, as none of you others ever heard tolled of. Yes, from morning service until after vespers, the French and English were all at it, ding-dong." [...] And then calls of business intervening, the bells have to give up their private jangle, resume their professional duty, and sing their hourly chorus out of Dinorah.|$|R

40|$|Tumour {{cells can}} find in bone marrow (BM) a niche rich in growth factors and cytokines that promote their self-renewal, {{proliferation}} and survival. In turn, tumour cells affect the homeostasis of the BM and bone, {{as well as the}} balance among haematopoiesis, osteogenesis, osteoclastogenesis and bone-resorption. As a result, growth and survival factors normally sequestered in the bone matrix are released, favouring tumour development. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from BM can become tumour-associated fibroblasts, have immunosuppressive function, and facilitate metastasis by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, MSCs generate osteoblasts and osteocytes and regulate osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, MSCs can play an important pro-tumorigenic role in the formation of a microenvironment that promotes BM and bone metastasis. In this study we showed that BM MSCs from untreated advanced breast and lung cancer patients, without bone metastasis, had low osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity compared to that of healthy volunteers. In contrast, chondrogenic differentiation was increased. Moreover, MSCs from patients had lower expression of CD 146. Finally, our data showed higher levels of Dkk- 1 in peripheral blood plasma from patients compared with healthy volunteers. Because no patient had any bone disorder {{by the time of the}} study we propose that the primary tumour altered the plasticity of MSCs. As over 70 % of advanced breast cancer patients and 30 – 40 % of lung cancer patients will develop osteolytic bone metastasis for which there is no total cure, our findings could possibly be used as predictive tools indicating the first signs of future bone disease. In addition, as the MSCs present in the BM of these patients may not be able to regenerate bone after the tumour cells invasion into BM/bone, it is possible that they promote the cycle between tumour cell growth and bone destruction.
