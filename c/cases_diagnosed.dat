5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in <b>cases</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E
5|$|If the {{compressed}} {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The air may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the second most common cause of death while diving (drowning being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of <b>cases</b> <b>diagnosed</b> as AGE, with approximate estimates of frequency.|$|E

25|$|New case {{detection}} {{is another}} {{indicator of the}} disease that is usually reported by countries on an annual basis.

25|$|Although {{the number}} of new leprosy cases {{occurring}} each year is important as a measure of transmission, it is difficult to measure due to leprosy's long incubation period, delays in diagnosis after onset of the disease, and the lack of laboratory tools to detect it in the very early stages. Instead, the registered prevalence is used. Registered prevalence is a useful proxy indicator of the disease burden, as it reflects {{the number of}} active leprosy <b>cases</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with the disease and receiving treatment with MDT at a given point in time. The prevalence rate is defined as the number of cases registered for MDT treatment among the population in which the cases have occurred, again at a given point in time.|$|E
25|$|Another form of skin cancer, {{malignant}} melanoma, is {{much less}} common but far more dangerous, being lethal in about 15–20 percent of the <b>cases</b> <b>diagnosed.</b> The relationship between malignant melanoma and ultraviolet exposure is not yet fully understood, {{but it appears that}} both UVB and UVA are involved. Because of this uncertainty, it is difficult to estimate the effect of ozone depletion on melanoma incidence. One study showed that a 10 percent increase in UVB radiation was associated with a 19 percent increase in melanomas for men and 16 percent for women. A study of people in Punta Arenas, at the southern tip of Chile, showed a 56 percent increase in melanoma and a 46 percent increase in nonmelanoma skin cancer over a period of seven years, along with decreased ozone and increased UVB levels.|$|E

2500|$|Headache {{is one of}} the {{criteria}} for PCS, but it is notably undetermined where the headache comes from. [...] Couch, Lipton, Stewart and Scher (2007) argue that headaches, one of the hallmarks of PCS, occur in a variety of injuries to the head and neck. [...] Further, Lew et al. (2006) reviewed ample studies comparing headaches to post-traumatic headaches and found that there is wide heterogeneity in the source and causes of headaches. [...] They point out that the International Headache Society lists 14 known causes of headaches, as well. [...] Furthermore, the headaches may be better accounted for by mechanical causes, such as whiplash, which is often mistaken for PCS. [...] An additional possibility is that Post-traumatic Stress Disorder can account for some <b>cases</b> <b>diagnosed</b> as PCS, but for emotional regulation as well.|$|E
