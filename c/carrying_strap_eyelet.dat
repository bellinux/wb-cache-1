50|$|Only a few {{significant}} {{changes were made}} to the original Kine Exakta (version 1) during its production run until it was replaced by the model II in 1948: Within a few months the circular focusing loupe, visible on top of the collapsed finder hood, was substituted for a rectangular one covering about 50% of the ground glass image (version 2). This version also appeared on the North American market as Exacta, spelled with a c (version 3). About a year later, a threaded hole was added at the right-hand front above the flashbulb synchronising contacts for securing the flashgun to the camera (version 4). After the 1939 to 1945 hostilities production of the Exacta version slowly resumed, but with several minor changes to the camera body, among these are: The Ihagee logo no longer appear in relief on the rectangular back door leather patch. The <b>carrying</b> <b>strap</b> <b>eyelets</b> {{on either side of the}} top edge of the camera are inserted between two small protrusions and riveted in place.

5000|$|Cart {{bags are}} {{generally}} {{designed to be}} harnessed to a two-wheeled pull cart or a motorized golf cart during play of a round. They often have only a rudimentary <b>carry</b> <b>strap</b> or handle for loading and transporting the bag, and no stand legs, but may feature extra storage or more durable construction, as weight of the loaded bag is a lesser concern.|$|R
5000|$|There is no [...] "one size fits all" [...] shield design {{solution}} to encompass all potential uses and possible threats to a ballistic shield and its user. Many modern hand-carried ballistic shields provide clear armored viewing visors, lighting systems, kickstands, <b>carrying</b> <b>straps,</b> {{and other features}} or options.

50|$|Peltasts {{carried a}} {{crescent-shaped}} wicker shield called a pelte (Latin: peltarion) as their main protection, hence their name. According to Aristotle, the pelte was rimless {{and covered in}} goat or sheep skin. Some literary sources imply that the shield could be round, but in art it is usually shown as crescent-shaped. It also appears in Scythian art {{and may have been}} a common type in Central Europe. The shield could be carried with a central strap and a hand grip near the rim or with just a central hand-grip. It may also have had a <b>carrying</b> <b>strap</b> (or baldric) as Thracian peltasts slung their shields on their backs when evading the enemy. Peltasts' weapons consisted of several javelins (akontia), which may have had throwing straps to allow more force to be applied to a throw.|$|R
50|$|The Minolta SR-2 was {{presented}} in 1958 as the first 35mm SLR camera from Chiyoda Kogaku. Popular cameras of this type at that time were mainly from Europe but a few from Japan, including the Asahi Pentax, the Miranda T and the Topcon R. The miniature SLR camera concept was conceived in the 1930s at Ihagee in Dresden, resulting in the 1936 Kine Exakta. Influential cameras designs {{like that of the}} 1939 KW Praktiflex, the 1949 ZI Contax S, and 1952 the KW Praktina marked the steady progress toward a perfected SLR. Several features of the latter seem to have influenced the design of the SR-2 although dissimilar in many respects. The obvious similarities are the stepped top plate, the <b>carrying</b> <b>strap</b> lugs, the self-timer lever and some general body features.|$|R
