5|$|Reception towards Mulan's {{personality}} {{has been}} generally positive, with critics praising her bravery and heroism. However, some <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> accused Disney of Westernizing the character, while her romantic relationship with Shang {{has been widely}} accused of compromising Mulan's heroism.|$|E
5|$|When {{discussing}} chess {{history from}} the 1850s onwards, <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> debated whether Steinitz could be effectively considered the champion from an earlier time, perhaps as early as 1866. Steinitz lost his title to Emanuel Lasker in 1894, and lost a rematch in 1896–97.|$|E

5|$|A Handful of Dust is a {{novel by}} the British writer Evelyn Waugh. First {{published}} in 1934, it is often grouped with the author's early, satirical comic novels for which he became famous in the pre-World War II years. <b>Commentators</b> <b>have,</b> however, drawn attention to its serious undertones, and have regarded it as a transitional work pointing towards Waugh's Catholic postwar fiction.|$|E
5|$|After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French {{public was}} {{generally}} indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation {{through a series}} of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.|$|E
5|$|Although {{players had}} {{previously}} recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or speedruns, attempts {{to complete a}} map as quickly as possible. Diary of a Camper was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. <b>Commentators</b> <b>have</b> called the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.|$|E

50|$|One <b>commentator</b> <b>has</b> likened Squirrel Nutkin's impertinent {{behaviour}} {{to that of}} {{the rebellious}} working-class of Potter's own day, and another <b>commentator</b> <b>has</b> noted the tale's similarities to pourquoi tales and folk tales in its explanations of Squirrel Nutkin's short tail and characteristics of squirrel behaviour. An abbreviated version of the tale appeared as a segment in the 1971 ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter.|$|R

5|$|<b>Commentators</b> <b>have</b> {{felt the}} game {{was an attempt to}} {{capitalize}} on then-recent, extensive news coverage of the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided missiles) to destroy enemy weapons and installations. Some commentators considered the game's subject matter in bad taste, with one magazine reporting an incident of veterans burning copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|<b>Commentators</b> <b>have</b> offered many {{theories}} for {{the origins}} of vampire beliefs, trying to explain the superstition – and sometimes mass hysteria – caused by vampires. Everything ranging from premature burial to the early ignorance of the body's decomposition cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} that the manner of St Edmund's death, veneration and culthood define him as a sacral king. It {{has been argued that}} St Edmund's story was informed by common Celtic and Germanic notions of sacred kingship. Comparable kings who also embodied theories of divinely-ordained rule, rightful sovereignty and the binding links between king, land and society, include: Conaire Mór, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King Dómaldi and Halfdan the Black.|$|E

5|$|Other speculations {{regarding}} doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the Web Bot project, {{a computer}} program that purports {{to predict the future}} by analyzing Internet chatter. However, <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> debated {{contraception}} laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E
5|$|Stylistically, many <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> {{described}} The Oceanides {{as either}} an outright example of Impressionism or somehow derivative of that art movement. Others have countered that Sibelius's active {{development of the}} two subjects, his sparing use of scales favored by Impressionists, and his prioritization of action and structure over ephemeral, atmospheric background distinguish the piece from quintessential examples, such as Debussy's La mer.|$|E

5|$|Tristano also {{complained about}} the commercialization of jazz and what he {{perceived}} to be the requirement to abandon the artistic part of playing in order to earn a living from performing. Later <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> suggested that these complaints ignored the freedom that he was given by Atlantic and blamed others for what in many cases were the outcomes of his own career decisions.|$|E
5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his {{design for a}} freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
5|$|Another likely {{literary}} {{source is}} the plague narrative in the Book of Exodus, in which Egypt {{is covered by}} darkness for three days. It {{has been suggested that}} the author of Matthew's gospel changed the Marcan text slightly to more closely match this source. <b>Commentators</b> <b>have</b> also drawn comparisons with the description of darkness in the Genesis creation narrative, with a prophecy regarding mid-day darkness by Jeremiah, and with an end-times prophecy in the Book of Zechariah.|$|E

5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E
5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions {{of his works}} were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later <b>commentators</b> <b>have</b> acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E
5|$|Cosima Wagner (born Francesca Gaetana Cosima Liszt; 24 December 1837– 1 April 1930) was the illegitimate {{daughter}} of the Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt and Marie d'Agoult. She became the second wife of the German composer Richard Wagner, and with him founded the Bayreuth Festival as a showcase for his stage works; after his death she devoted {{the rest of her}} life to the promotion of his music and philosophy. <b>Commentators</b> <b>have</b> recognised Cosima as the principal inspiration for Wagner's later works, particularly Parsifal.|$|E
