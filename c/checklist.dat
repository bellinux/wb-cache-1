5|$|The {{approach}} <b>checklist</b> {{was started}} at 20:27:01, {{at which time}} the aircraft's altitude reached 500meters (1,500ft). The first point on the <b>checklist</b> were not readable, but the last three were. At 20:27:32 the captain asked for flaps and landing gear, which were immediately deployed by the first officer and resulted in the aircraft gaining 70meters (200ft) of altitude. The landing gears were confirmed locked at 20:28:00. Four seconds later the passenger asked the captain if there were reserve systems {{which could be used}} if the landing gear did not deploy properly. At this point the aircraft started the descent from 500meters (1,500ft).|$|E

40|$|<b>Checklists</b> are {{in use in}} many work domains, {{including}} aviation, manufacturing, quality control, and healthcare. Despite their adoption, {{the literature}} shows both breadth and persistence of problems with the organizational usage of <b>checklists.</b> In this paper, we conduct a structured literature survey to analyze <b>checklists</b> {{from the perspective of}} informational artifacts. Our contribution is a respective conceptualization of <b>checklists</b> and a rigorous analysis of their problems. As we will argue, these insights help to consider how the capabilities of IT systems can be leveraged to improve <b>checklists</b> and address their problematic aspects. We present our work as a basis for IT-oriented research into a relevant yet under-examined information practice in organizational work routines...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the benefits of <b>checklists</b> for clinical practical courses. Clinical externships are a component of the practical part of the veterinary medicine curriculum. The control is under the responsibility of the training centres. Guidelines and <b>checklists</b> for extramural clinical courses were developed in order to facilitate control mechanisms. The analysis of such <b>checklists</b> should give an overview over the actual situation to enable the setting of minimum standards for extramural courses. The guidelines list practical activities carried out by the students in the veterinary practices or clinics. Data of 360 <b>checklists</b> were assessed in this study to evaluate whether <b>checklists</b> constitute a useful tool to control extramural studies...|$|R

5|$|Until {{the sixth}} {{edition of the}} AOU <b>Checklist</b> of North American Birds was {{published}} by the American Ornithologists' Union in 1983, {{the most commonly used}} name for the American kestrel was the sparrow hawk or sparrowhawk. This was due to a mistaken connection with the Eurasian sparrowhawk in the genus Accipiter. The sixth edition of the AOU <b>Checklist</b> corrected this, officially renaming the bird American kestrel. Several other colloquial names for the kestrel are also in use, including grasshopper hawk, due to its diet, and killy hawk, due to its distinct call.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the utility of}} <b>checklists</b> in attaining more accurate diagnoses {{in the context of}} diagnostic decision-making for mental disorders. The study also aimed to replicate results from a meta-analysis indicating that there is no association between patients’ gender and misdiagnoses. To this end, 475 psychotherapists were asked to judge three case vignettes describing patients with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. Therapists were randomly assigned to experimental conditions in a 2 (diagnostic method: with using diagnostic <b>checklists</b> vs. without using diagnostic <b>checklists)</b> x 2 (gender: male vs. female case vignettes) between-subjects design. Multinomial logistic and linear regression analyses were used to examine the association between the usage of diagnostic <b>checklists</b> as well as patients’ gender and diagnostic decisions. The results showed that when <b>checklists</b> were used, fewer incorrect co-morbid diagnoses were made, but clinicians were less likely to diagnose MDD even when the criteria were met. Additionally, <b>checklists</b> improved therapists’ confidence with diagnostic decisions, but were not associated with estimations of patients’ characteristics. As expected, there were no significant associations between gender and diagnostic decisions...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades many <b>checklists</b> of {{reptiles}} of India and adjacent countries have been published. These publications have furthered the growth of knowledge on systematics, distribution and biogeography of Indian reptiles, and the field of herpetology in India in general. However, the reporting format of most such <b>checklists</b> of Indian reptiles does not provide a basis for direct verification of the information presented. As a result, mistakes in the inclusion and omission of species have been perpetuated and the exact number of reptile species reported from India still remains unclear. A verification of the current listings based on distributional records and review of published <b>checklists</b> revealed that 199 species of lizards (Reptilia: Sauria) are currently validly reported on the basis of distributional records within the boundaries of India. Seventeen other lizard species have erroneously been included in earlier <b>checklists</b> of Indian reptiles. Omissions of species by these <b>checklists</b> have been even more numerous than erroneous inclusions. In this paper, I present a plea to report species lists as annotated <b>checklists</b> which corroborate the inclusion and omission of species by providing valid source references or notes...|$|R

At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} <b>checklist,</b> informed the first officer that they would go down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger.

5|$|German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian corvids plus {{other species}} {{as far as}} India into a single species, C. coronoides, as he {{believed}} there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage.

The official RAOU <b>checklist</b> listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970.

40|$|Road Safety Audit is a {{relatively}} new tool, available to assist road agencies in lowering potential collision risk on new road schemes or highway improvements. The principles can also be extended to cover analysis of existing roads, particularly where accident data is poor or non-existent. Audit Teams often use <b>checklists,</b> which prompt the auditor to consider factors which could lead to road accidents. <b>Checklists</b> are a useful tool aimed at helping the Audit Team during the assessment of the safety problems since they provide a good reminder of issues which need to be reviewed. However, they cannot be expected to cover all the issues which may arise in every Audit and cannot be a substitute for the safety auditor’s skills and safety background. Although <b>checklists</b> are helpful and are included in almost all the international Road Safety Audit guidelines, they have several drawbacks which restrict their effectiveness and use. <b>Checklists</b> can never cover all the safety aspects, and as <b>checklists</b> become more voluminous in order to be comprehensive, they become intimidating and overwhelming. Experienced Safety Audit Teams typically find such <b>checklists</b> redundant since the lists miss the interactivity between design elements, and threaten some of the independent and intelligent creativity of the auditor. It is important that safety auditors base their work on sound safety experience, and where possible, have the means to back up the recommendations from documented sources. Accident control data can be used to assist safety auditors by means of effective and accessible data-bases. This assists with both the identification of problems, and with the recommendations for improvement. This paper describes the potential for a new tool aimed at improving <b>checklists,</b> and at improving the effectiveness of the Road Safety Audit procedure. The tool involves the development of a computer based decision supporting system (DSS) which combines interactive <b>checklists</b> and control data...|$|R
