25|$|When food {{containing}} fat {{enters the}} digestive tract, it stimulates the secretion of <b>cholecystokinin</b> (CCK) from I {{cells of the}} duodenum and jejunum. In response to <b>cholecystokinin,</b> the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the common bile duct, eventually draining into the duodenum. The bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption. Bile consists primarily of water and bile salts, and also acts {{as a means of}} eliminating bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin metabolism, from the body.|$|E
25|$|Secretion {{of these}} proenzymes is via the hormones gastrin, <b>cholecystokinin</b> and secretin, which are {{secreted}} by {{cells in the}} stomach and duodenum in response to distension and/or food.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cholecystokinin</b> (CCK) – {{is in the}} {{duodenum}} and {{stimulates the}} release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and stimulates the emptying of bile in the gall bladder. This hormone is secreted in response to fat in chyme.|$|E
25|$|The GI tract {{releases}} hormones from enzymes to help {{regulate the}} digestive process. These hormones, including gastrin, secretin, <b>cholecystokinin,</b> and ghrelin, are mediated through either intracrine or autocrine mechanisms, {{indicating that the}} cells releasing these hormones are conserved structures throughout evolution.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the primary}} {{mechanism}} for release of insulin. Other substances known to stimulate insulin release include the amino acids arginine and leucine, parasympathetic release of acetylcholine (acting via the phospholipase C pathway), sulfonylurea, <b>cholecystokinin</b> (CCK, also via phospholipase C), and the gastrointestinally derived incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP).|$|E
25|$|The stomach {{contains}} receptors {{that can}} detect {{the presence of}} nutrients, but there are detectors in the intestines as well, and the satiety factors of the stomach and intestines can interact. <b>Cholecystokinin</b> (CCK) is a peptide hormone secreted by the duodenum that controls the rate of stomach emptying. CCK is secreted {{in response to the}} presence of fats, which are detected in by receptors in the duodenum. Another satiety signal produced by cells is peptide YY3-36 (PYY), which is released after a meal in amounts proportional to the calories ingested.|$|E

2500|$|The {{basal ganglia}} {{contains}} many afferent glutamatergic inputs, with predominantly GABAergic efferent fibers, modulatory cholinergic pathways, significant dopamine in the pathways {{originating in the}} ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, as well as various neuropeptides. [...] Neuropeptides found in the basal ganglia include substance P, neurokinin A, <b>cholecystokinin,</b> neurotensin, neurokinin B, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, dynorphin, enkephaline. [...] Other neuromodulators found in the basal ganglia include nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and phenylethylamine.|$|E
2500|$|Trypsin is {{produced}} as the inactive zymogen trypsinogen in the pancreas. When the pancreas is stimulated by <b>cholecystokinin,</b> {{it is then}} secreted into {{the first part of}} the small intestine (the duodenum) via the pancreatic duct. Once in the small intestine, the enzyme enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen into trypsin by proteolytic cleavage. [...] Auto catalysis does not happen with trypsin, as [...] trypsinogen is a poor substrate, therefore enzymatic damage to the pancreas is avoided.|$|E
2500|$|Food {{is first}} churned {{in the stomach}} before passing into the small {{intestine}}. When the lumen of the small intestine comes into contact with nutrients, a number of hormones are released, including <b>cholecystokinin</b> from the duodenum and PYY and GLP-1 from the ileum. These hormones inhibit further food intake and have thus been dubbed [...] "satiety factors". Ghrelin is a hormone that is released in the stomach that stimulates hunger and food intake. Changes in circulating hormone levels after gastric bypass have been hypothesized to produce reductions in food intake and body weight in obese patients. However, these findings remain controversial, and the exact mechanisms by which gastric bypass surgery reduces food intake and body weight {{have yet to be}} elucidated.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{anti-infective}} medications {{have been}} derived from fungi including penicillin and the cephalosporins (antibacterial drugs from Penicillium chrysogenum and Cephalosporium acremonium, respectively) and griseofulvin (an antifungal drug from Penicillium griseofulvum). [...] Other medicinally useful fungal metabolites include lovastatin (from Pleurotus ostreatus), {{which became a}} lead {{for a series of}} drugs that lower cholesterol levels, cyclosporin (from Tolypocladium inflatum), which is used to suppress the immune response after organ transplant operations, and ergometrine (from Claviceps spp.), which acts as a vasoconstrictor, and is used to prevent bleeding after childbirth. Asperlicin (from Aspergillus alliaceus) is another example. [...] Asperlicin is a novel antagonist of <b>cholecystokinin,</b> a neurotransmitter thought to be involved in panic attacks, and could potentially be used to treat anxiety.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cholecystokinin</b> receptors or CCK receptors are a {{group of}} G-protein coupled receptors which bind the peptide hormones <b>cholecystokinin</b> (CCK) and gastrin. There are two {{different}} subtypes CCKA and CCKB which are ~50% homologous: Various <b>cholecystokinin</b> antagonists have been developed and are used in research, although the only drug of this class that has been widely marketed to date is the anti-ulcer drug proglumide.|$|E
50|$|This {{explains}} how abnormally elevated somatostatin can cause diabetes mellitus, by inhibiting insulin secretion, steatorrhoea by inhibiting <b>cholecystokinin</b> and secretin, gall stones by inhibiting <b>cholecystokinin</b> which normally induce gallbladder myocytes to contract, and hypochlorhydria caused by inhibiting gastrin, which normally stimulate acid secretion.|$|E

50|$|CART peptides, in particular, CART (55-102), {{seem to have}} an {{important}} function in the regulation of energy homeostasis, and interact with several hypothalamic appetite circuits. CART expression is regulated by several peripheral peptide hormones involved in appetite regulation, including leptin, <b>cholecystokinin</b> and ghrelin, with CART and <b>cholecystokinin</b> having synergistic effects on appetite regulation.|$|E
50|$|Hormones {{secreted}} include somatostatin, motilin, <b>cholecystokinin,</b> neurotensin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and enteroglucagon.|$|E
50|$|These {{peptides}} act {{primarily at}} the delta opioid receptor, although they also stimulate the mu opioid receptor {{to some extent}} through a delta-opioid receptor mediated interaction with another peptide <b>cholecystokinin,</b> and the enzyme-inhibiting effects of RB-101 thus produce indirect stimulation of both of these opioid receptor subtypes. This causes RB-101 to be strongly synergistic with <b>cholecystokinin</b> antagonists.|$|E
50|$|Other hormones {{produced}} include <b>cholecystokinin,</b> somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, alpha and gamma-endorphin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cholecystokinin</b> tetrapeptide (CCK-4, Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) is a peptide {{fragment}} {{derived from}} the larger peptide hormone <b>cholecystokinin.</b> Unlike cholecystokin which {{has a variety of}} roles in the gastrointestinal system as well as central nervous system effects, CCK-4 acts primarily in the brain as an anxiogenic, although it does retain some GI effects, {{but not as much as}} CCK-8 or the full length polypeptide CCK-58.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cholecystokinin</b> (CCK or CCK-PZ; from Greek chole, [...] "bile"; cysto, [...] "sac"; kinin, [...] "move"; hence, {{move the}} bile-sac (gallbladder)) is a peptide hormone of the {{gastrointestinal}} system responsible for stimulating the digestion {{of fat and}} protein. <b>Cholecystokinin,</b> previously called pancreozymin, is synthesized and secreted by enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum, the first segment of the small intestine. Its presence causes the release of digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreas and gallbladder, respectively, and also acts as a hunger suppressant.|$|E
