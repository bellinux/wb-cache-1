25|$|The Luckey, Platt & <b>Company</b> <b>Department</b> Store {{building}} {{is located at}} the corner of Main and Academy streets in downtown Poughkeepsie, New York, United States. For most of the 20th century it was a major retail destination not only for the city but the entire Hudson Valley. Its closure in 1981, after years of losing customers to suburban shopping malls, was a serious blow to the city's Main Mall. The structure remained vacant until December 2008, when after several years of renovation it was reopened as a residential development with 143 rental apartments, with additional commercial space on the ground floor, as an anchor and catalyst for further downtown revitalization.|$|E

25|$|The John H. Parks Company – Wills Hardware Building is a {{commercial}} building located at 319 Superior Avenue. The building {{was constructed in}} approximately 1890 for the John H. Parks <b>Company</b> <b>Department</b> Store. John H. and his uncle, George S. Parks, opened the department store in 1884 to complement their lumber business. John H. Parks {{served as president of}} the village board and was the first mayor of Crystal Falls. Parks later turned his business into a hardware store. In 1915, Tom Wills purchased the building for his hardware store. The building is a two-story frame Late Victorian commercial block, clad with clapboard with a pair of bay windows on the second floor. A heavy cornice runs along the top of the building and second, smaller cornice runs above the first-floor storefront. The building is significant as one of the best preserved of the few remaining late 19th-century commercial structures in Crystal Falls.|$|E
25|$|New {{apartment}} buildings and condominium residential development in older commercial and office buildings in, for example, the Scarth Street Mall and the Motherwell Building, show promise of revitalising the city core; the Cornwall Centre, an impressive inner city shopping mall originally with Eaton's and Hudson's Bay <b>Company</b> <b>department</b> stores as its anchors together with large cinemas, {{has not yet}} thrived but growing posh residential redevelopment could spur new vitality if urban crime spilling over from North Central can be stemmed. Former commercial and office facilities along Scarth Street are now strata title apartments.Historic entertainment venues and churches have largely lapsed but the Globe Theatre has relocated from the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts to the Old Post Office on 11th Avenue; {{the conversion of the}} Union Station to a casino and the construction of several new hotels are bringing new night life vitality to the Central Business District, albeit with the urgent caveat that urban crime spilling over from the North Central remains a serious issue.|$|E
25|$|On one occasion, {{they entered}} the Hudson's Bay <b>Company</b> <b>Department</b> Store to {{publicize}} their grievances to shoppers. The police came to evict the men, and a bloody clash ensued. After that incident, the unemployed congregated at Victory Square Park, where McGeer came and read the Riot Act. The camp strikers left the city after two months to begin the On-to-Ottawa Trek. They felt they accomplished all they could in Vancouver and voted to take their grievances directly to Prime Minister R. B. Bennett. Shortly before the trekkers left, another Communist-led strike broke out on the waterfront, culminating with another bloody clash that {{became known as the}} Battle of Ballantyne Pier. Gerry McGeer treated these protests not as strikes, but as an attempted Bolshevik uprising. Although he came from a background as an iron molder and union representative, he came to be seen as an enemy of organized labour because of these events.|$|E

500|$|In 1927, the Classical Revival Style {{building}} {{was built by}} local businessman Frank R. Strong as a B. H. Dyas <b>Company</b> <b>Department</b> Store. The construction, which continued into 1928, marked the first department store branch outside of the main Downtown Los Angeles central business district and led to similar large-scale commercial developments outside downtown. Due to the Great Depression, B. H. Dyas had to consolidate its operation back to its original store and The Broadway purchased the 30-year lease for this prime location for $2 million (US$ million in [...] dollars) in 1931.

2500|$|John Wanamaker Department Store was {{the first}} {{department}} store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{and one of the}} first department stores in the United States. At its zenith in the early 20th century, Wanamaker also had a store in New York City at Broadway and Ninth Street. Both employed extremely large staffs. By the end of the 20th century, there were 16 Wanamaker's outlets, but after years of change the chain was bought by Albert Taubman, and added to his previous purchase of Woodward & Lothrop, the Washington, D.C., department store.

RCWU organizers made it a priority to maintain discipline in the ranks {{so as not to}} alienate public opinion. One occasion in particular was an exception to this rule. During one of the RCWU [...] "snake parades", marching in a zig zag through the streets, usually in columns of two, the leader noticed that the entrance to the Hudson's Bay <b>Company</b> <b>department</b> store was unguarded. Other stores all had guards posted and shut their doors because the protesters would parade through the stores to present their case to shoppers. This time, on April 26, the manager of the store telephoned the police, who promptly arrived and attempted to eject the men. A fight ensued, ending with broken display cases and several injuries. One police officer was severely injured. [...] The demonstrators and other protesters converged for a rally at Victory Square, where Mayor McGeer came and read the riot act and the crowd dispersed. Another notable moment during the relief camp strike was when a group of RCWU strikers occupied the city museum for eight hours, coming out only after a promise was given that the city would give them money to feed the strikers for three days.|$|E
