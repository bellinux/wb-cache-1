5|$|Nafaryus hears a rumor about Gabriel {{being the}} savior of the people. He and his family travel to Ravenskill to see him for {{themselves}} ("Lord Nafaryus"). In the Ravenskill town square, Gabriel is performing for the people when the royal family shows up. He continues playing at the emperor's request ("A Savior in the Square"), nearly bringing them all to tears ("When Your Time Has Come"). As he plays, Faythe remembers how she found a music player {{when she was a}} child and kept it a secret all her life, and as she and Gabriel stare at each other and fall in love ("Act of Faythe"). Nafaryus, though briefly moved by Gabriel's song, sees him as a threat to his rule and gives the people of the town three days to deliver their savior to him or he will destroy the town ("Three Days"). Arhys hides his brother and refuses to give him up ("Brother, <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> Me?").|$|E

25|$|In Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot?, Naomi {{is still}} rocking her party-planning {{internship}} under Rachel’s guidance. Her relationship with Austin has ended after Austin allegedly cheated on her with Holly. Austin says Holly snuck in and attacked him {{right after he}} came out of the shower but Naomi refuses to listen to him. Naomi has been so hard at work that her boss, Holly’s mother, gives Naomi the responsibility of hosting her very own event, which is the debutant ball. During the ball, Naomi has rebound sex with a stranger in order to get over Austin. After Naomi has been caught in front of the entire party, Rachel fires her. However, Naomi tells her that Rachel's daughter cheated with her boyfriend. Rachel has sympathy and lets it slide but advises Naomi that she has to be a strong woman and deal with her problems. In Mama <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> Me?, Naomi decides to become a ‘New Naomi’ and try to patch things between Holly and her mother. Rachel briefs Naomi about the impending award season. She entrusts Naomi with a very important assignment. Naomi suggests to her boss that maybe Holly can help too. Although Rachel is reluctant, she agrees to go with Naomi’s suggestion, and appoints Holly as Naomi’s new assistant; shocking both Naomi and Holly. Naomi tries to make amends with Holly, by entrusting her with the very important assignment of getting Mitchell Nash from the hotel to the event. At the event, Rachel is really happy with the way Naomi has organized things, while she is waiting intently for Holly to arrive with Mitchell Nash. Holly arrives at the scene and tells them that Mitchell Nash wasn’t staying at the hotel she had gone to. The boss blasts Naomi for entrusting such an important responsibility to Holly, who according to her has always been irresponsible. Holly and Naomi, haul in a completely drunk Nash to the event. He pukes on the red carpet, with the reporters having a field day. Later Holly and her mother are at it, with Holly trying to defend her position in all that transpired. Naomi again tries defending Holly in front of her mother. The whole thing proves counterproductive, with Naomi getting fired. Later, Holly thanks Naomi for all that she did for her and they both decide to become friends.|$|E

Key problems included an unclear explanation of what Tommy didn't hear or see in [...] "1921", how or why he plays pinball, why [...] "Smash the Mirror" [...] leads into [...] "I overwhelm as I approach you" [...] (the opening line in [...] "Sensation"), why Tommy tells his followers in [...] "We're Not Gonna Take It" [...] they cannot drink or smoke but can play pinball, and what the [...] "you" [...] is in [...] "Listening to you, I get the music".|$|E

She praised Salling's [...] "Only the Good Die Young", which was selected by Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post as the best performance of the episode, for being the most in-keeping with Glee usual tone. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand", writing that, [...] "the Beatles' coy flirtation is replaced with a simple, wistful plea that hits just the right note." [...] She commended Riley's vocals on [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", commenting that Murphy should assign Mercedes more solo performances. Futterman criticized [...] "Losing My Religion", however, observing that Monteith struggled to reach the notes, resulting in a performance [...] "more awkward than inspired." ...|$|E
500|$|Anthony Benigno of the Daily News commented {{positively}} on {{the arrangement}} of Monteith's song, grading the performance [...] "A". His lowest grade went to [...] "Papa, <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> Me?", which he gave a [...] "C". Benigno felt that both Michele and Colfer's solos were damaged {{by the fact that}} the songs' only link to the episode's plot were their titles, finding it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing [...] "I wanna be your man" [...] about his father. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff felt that the music was the worst aspect of the episode, similarly criticizing song selections based on their [...] relationship to religion. He felt that Kurt's performance was the only number which worked even slightly, commenting, [...] "it genuinely grows out of the moment, although the fact that Kurt is singing it to his dad never stops being kind of weird." [...] Both Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV's Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] brought new meaning to the song, with Semigran naming it her favourite number of the episode. She felt that [...] "I Look to You" [...] was the episode's weakest song, preferring Riley's [...] "more powerful" [...] rendition of [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times expressed disappointment in both of Riley's songs, which left her [...] "strangely unmoved". She suggested that, [...] "Mercedes sang admirably, beautifully even, but she didn’t seem truly transported by the music; so we weren't." ...|$|E

Carpio in the musical film Across the Universe, R.E.M.'s [...] "Losing My Religion", Simon & Garfunkel's [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water" [...] as covered by Aretha Franklin, and Joan Osborne's [...] "One of Us". Monteith said he and series music producer Adam Anders [...] "had {{a bit of a}} different idea" [...] about how [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] should be performed. While Anders [...] "always brings the songs in very positive, very upbeat", he felt the song [...] "was expressing a betrayal", and with Finn feeling both betrayal and anger, Monteith wanted his performance to reflect that. All songs performed were released as singles, available for download, and [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] and [...] "One of Us" [...] are included on the album [...] All singles charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100.

2500|$|Sometimes an {{otherwise}} complicated operation reduces to multiplication by a scalar (a number). Such numbers are called eigenvalues of that operation. [...] Eigenvalues {{are closely related}} to vibration frequencies and are used in analyzing a famous problem: <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> the shape of a drum?. Essentially an eigenvalue is like a note being played by the manifold. Perelman proved this note goes up as the manifold is deformed by the Ricci flow. This helped him eliminate some of the more troublesome singularities that had concerned Hamilton, particularly the cigar soliton solution, which looked like a strand sticking out of a manifold with nothing on the other side. In essence Perelman showed that all the strands that form can be cut and capped and none stick out on one side only.|$|E
