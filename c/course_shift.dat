60|$|If I {{must offer}} a guess, {{it is that}} Greeks, and Indians of India, {{inherited}} a very ordinary savage idea. The gods in savage myths are usually beasts. As beasts they beget anthropomorphic offspring. This is the regular rule in totemism. In savage myths we are not told 'a god' (Apollo, or Zeus, or Poseidon) 'put on beast shape and begat human sons and daughters' (Helen, the Telmisseis, and so on). The god in savage myths was a beast already, though he could, of <b>course,</b> <b>shift</b> shapes like any 'medicine-man,' or modern witch who becomes a hare. This is not the exception but the rule in savage mythology. Anyone can consult my Myth, Ritual, and Religion, or Mr. Frazer's work Totemism, for abundance of evidence. To Loki, a male god, prosecuting his amours as a female horse, I have already alluded, and in M. R. R. give cases from the Satapatha Brahmana.|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian {{accidents}} {{are one of}} the most prominent causes of premature injury, handicap and death in the modern world. In children, the problem is so severe that pedestrian {{accidents are}} widely regarded as the most serious of all health risks facing children in developed countries. Not surprisingly, educational measures have long been advocated as a means of teaching children how to cope with traffic and substantial resources have been devoted to their development and provision. Unfortunately, there seems to be a widespread view at the present time that education has not achieved as much as had been hoped and that there may even be quite strict limits to what can be achieved through education. This would, of <b>course,</b> <b>shift</b> the emphasis away from education altogether towards engineering or urban planning measures aimed at creating an intrinsically safer environment in which the need for education might be reduced or even eliminated. However, whilst engineering measures undoubtedly have a major role to play in the effort to reduce accidents, this outlook is both overly optimistic about the benefits of engineering and overly pessimistic about the limitations of education. At the same time, a fresh analysis is clearly required both of the aims and methods of contemporary road safety education. The present report is designed to provide such an analysis and to establish a framework within which further debate and research can take place...|$|E

40|$|The {{swimming}} {{movement of}} Cryptomonas sp. cells generates a helical path, {{as a result}} of rotations with an average period of 500 milliseconds. When a flash of light at 570 nanometers for 20 microseconds was applied unidirectionally at intervals of 500 milliseconds, only a fixed side of each rotating cell was repeatedly exposed to the flashes of light. The relationship between the irradiated side of a cell and the phototactic orientation of the cell, rotating with a period of 475 to 525 milliseconds, was determined by infrared videomicrography. Only when the ventral sides of the cells were exposed to the flashes of light did their <b>courses</b> <b>shift</b> predominantly toward the light source.

50|$|The city of Natchitoches, when founded, {{was located}} on the banks {{at the head of}} {{navigation}} of the Red River in northern Louisiana, roughly midway between Alexandria and Shreveport. It was founded in 1714 by French explorers, who were seeking to firmly establish French claims to the territory against those of New Spain. As such, it eventually developed into a significant trading center, with goods flowing among the French, Spanish, and area Native American tribes. The city's oldest streets are laid out parallel to the river, and the long-distance road network was expanded after French Louisiana was ceded to Spain in 1763. The city remained an important regional trading center until the second quarter of the 19th century, when the Red River's <b>course</b> <b>shifted</b> eastward, leaving the downtown flanking the old channel, now known as the Cane River.

This article focuses on the shift from distance to online education using an educational management perspective {{that is based on}} economic, staff, and student data collected between 1994 and 2010 (Department of Education, Umeå University). The results showed that in 2005, the number of distance education students increased significantly.

The online courses attract many more students compared to traditional campus courses. Overall, the transition from distance to online courses has contributed to more students, an economy of scale that makes it possible to increase pedagogic development work. The online courses have also contributed to better working conditions for teachers. Without a deliberate educational management strategy, general educational courses might have been discontinued, a choice that would threaten the study of education as an academic discipline per se. As a result of these conditions, we believe ICT pedagogical development needs technical and pedagogical support as well as strategic leadership...|$|R
