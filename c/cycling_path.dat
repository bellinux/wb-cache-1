25|$|Supporters of the {{greenway}} {{claim that}} use of a greenway will protect the trackbed from adverse possession claims and will not preclude reinstatement of the disused sections of line as a working railway in the future. However, the recent case of the Comber railway in Belfast shows that once a rail line is converted into a walking or <b>cycling</b> <b>path</b> it is practically impossible to get it back.|$|E
25|$|Work {{to upgrade}} the track and remove the {{overhead}} wiring began in August 2010. The project received planning approval in February 2011. The extension was originally {{scheduled to open in}} 2012, but in September 2011 the newly elected O'Farrell Government announced that it would not open until 2014, and that the cost had risen from $120 million to $176 million. The Greenway walking and <b>cycling</b> <b>path</b> which was to run alongside much of the route was deferred. The new government blamed hasty planning by their predecessor for the delay and cost overruns, and the lack of an active transport masterplan for the deferral of the Greenway.|$|E

The first part covers existing literature on <b>cycling</b> <b>paths</b> in the Netolice region, and physical-geographic {{conditions such as}} geology, geomorphology, pedology, waters, climate, fauna and flora, nature and landscape preservation. The second part covers general characteristics of the Netolice micro region, history, trailblazing, and <b>cycling</b> <b>paths</b> classification. In this second part, there are introduced, among others, projects dedicated to cycling in the Czech Republic. The final part covers the existing <b>cycling</b> <b>paths,</b> their benefits and shortcomings. Moreover, characteristics of newly created <b>cycling</b> <b>paths</b> are provided there.

All in all, a total of 39.3 km of dedicated cycling routes has been planned , with {{the first phase of}} the master plan, a 12.5 km coastal <b>cycling</b> <b>path</b> from George Town to Queensbay Mall, already completed.The completed coastal <b>cycling</b> <b>path</b> between George Town and Queensbay Mall to the south also includes a 1.5 km route between Komtar and Karpal Singh Drive, and a 70-metre-long concrete-and-steel bridge across the Pinang River. Much of the path runs along the eastern shoreline of Penang Island, specifically at Jelutong and Gelugor, thus offering scenic seaside views. The path is physically separated from the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway alongside it and fenced off to minimise traffic hazards to cyclists. Into the city centre, the <b>cycling</b> <b>path</b> has been painted green and are also shared with pedestrians.In addition to the future routes round Penang Island, sidewalks along certain streets within George Town's UNESCO World Heritage Site, such as Pitt Street, have also been painted green for similar purposes.
