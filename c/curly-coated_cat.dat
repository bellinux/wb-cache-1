The clinic's personnel told her that they had known the cat since 1947. The doctor named the cat Lämmchen (German for [...] "little lamb"). Her supposition that she must {{be the result of}} a mutation, was shown to be correct. Thus Lämmchen was the first breeder-owned Rex-type cat and the maternal ancestor of all the current German Rex.|$|E

The breed founders were Linda and Richard Koehl from The Dalles, Oregon, whose cat Speedy {{gave birth to}} a curly-coated kitten, named Curly, from whom all LaPerms descend. The Koehls allowed a free-breeding colony of <b>curly-coated</b> <b>cats</b> to develop over a period of ten years before making contact with members of the cat fancy and instigating a formal breeding programme.The breed was named after their curly coat which bears resemblance to a shaggy perm. The name follows the Chinookan tradition of adopting French words while incorporating the definite article to create a new word, for example in Chinook Wawa pipe is lapeep and apple is lapom, (la pipe and la pomme respectively in French).|$|R
