Macedonia {{has been}} prevented from joining the alliance by Greece, one {{effect of the}} Macedonian naming dispute. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> Sweden, Finland, and Serbia have open political debate {{on the topic of}} membership, while in <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> Ukraine, support and opposition to membership is tied to ethnic and nationalist ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly in the Eastern Bloc has been a cause of increased tension between NATO countries and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Many, if not all, {{countries}} have {{some degree of}} polyethnicity, with <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> the United States and Canada having large levels and <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries has spurred some arguments against it, which include a belief that it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.|$|E

It also had a record release of 110 screens across North India, and was screened at 6:00 AM in fifteen selected screens across Hyderabad on the release day. Aagadu was dubbed into Hindi as Encounter Shankar, and into Tamil as Idhudhaanda Police.|$|E

After its worldwide release, the song became a success on the dance charts of the United States but failed to enter the official Billboard Hot 100 chart, only peaked at six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. It reached the top ten in <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy and topped the chart in Spain.|$|E

The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is currently {{in a state of}} decline as competition arises in <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> South Korea, the United States and China. However, despite also facing similar competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong due to an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.|$|E
5|$|Mutation {{analysis}} of the ATP7B gene, {{as well as other}} genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.|$|E

The successor of the Do 17 was the much more powerful Dornier Do 217, which started to appear in strength in 1942. Even so, the Do 17 continued service in the Luftwaffe in various roles {{until the end of}} the war, as a glider tug, research and trainer aircraft. A considerable number of surviving examples were sent to other Axis nations as well as <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> Finland. Few Dornier Do 17s survived the war and the last was scrapped in Finland in 1952.|$|E

5|$|The {{cessation}} of menstrual cycles {{at the end}} of a woman's reproductive period is termed menopause. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause before age 45 is considered premature in industrialised <b>countries.</b> <b>Like</b> the age of menarche, the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E
5|$|Although M-n {{outside of}} Michigan could conceivably refer to other state, provincial, local, or {{national}} highways, local usage {{in those areas}} does not mimic the Michigan usage in most cases.

M-numbered trunklines are designated along a variety of roads, including eight-lane freeways in urban areas, four-lane rural freeways and expressways, principal arterial highways, and two-lane highways in remote rural areas. The system also includes M-185 on Mackinac Island, a non-motorized road restricted to bicycles, horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians.|$|E
