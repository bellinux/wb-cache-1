5|$|Addition {{of boron}} nitride to silicon nitride <b>ceramics</b> {{improves}} the thermal shock {{resistance of the}} resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina <b>ceramics.</b> Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass <b>ceramics,</b> enamels, and composite <b>ceramics</b> with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|Although use of {{the local}} Ocosito-style <b>ceramics</b> continued, there was a marked {{intrusion}} of K'iche' <b>ceramics</b> from the highlands in the Postclassic period, concentrated particularly {{in the northern part}} of the site but extending to cover the whole. The indigenous accounts of the K'iche' themselves claim that they conquered this region of the Pacific coast, suggesting that the presence of their <b>ceramics</b> is associated with their conquest of Takalik Abaj.|$|E
5|$|In this period, the <b>ceramics</b> {{showed a}} {{change with the}} entry of the {{highland}} Solano style, This ceramic tradition is most associated with the Solano site in the southeastern Valley of Guatemala and the most characteristic type is a brick-red ware covered with a bright orange micaceous slip, sometimes painted with pink or purple decoration. This style of <b>ceramics</b> {{has been associated with}} the highland K'iche' Maya. These new <b>ceramics</b> did not replace the pre-existing Ocosito complex but rather became mingled with them.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} note is that {{chemical analysis}} of ceramic fragments {{has revealed that}} the very same workshops not only produced the highest-quality Ik-style polychrome <b>ceramics</b> but also general low-quality <b>ceramics</b> for household use. High quality Ik-style <b>ceramics</b> made at Motul de San José have been excavated from across the Maya region, including Tikal and Uaxactún to the northeast of the city, Copán far to the south, and Altar de Sacrificios, Tamarindito and Seibal, in western Petén.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium is used {{to color}} <b>ceramics</b> yellow.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{bearings}} {{are both}} full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings with balls in <b>ceramics</b> and races in steel. Silicon nitride <b>ceramics</b> have good shock resistance {{compared to other}} <b>ceramics.</b> Therefore, ball bearings made of silicon nitride ceramic are used in performance bearings. A representative example is use of silicon nitride bearings in the main engines of the NASA's Space Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium {{compounds}} {{are used}} as pigments for <b>ceramics.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Han <b>ceramics</b> {{industry}} was upheld by private businesses {{as well as}} local government agencies. <b>Ceramics</b> were used in domestic wares and utensils as well as construction materials for roof tiles and bricks.|$|E
5|$|After the Real/Xe complex, {{came the}} Escoba period, dating to {{approximately}} 600CE-300CE. The <b>ceramics</b> {{between these two}} periods are similar, but Escoba <b>ceramics</b> are more extensive and stratigraphically separated. There is also evidence during {{this time of the}} population increase that would peak {{at the end of the}} Cantutse period.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} part of the period there is {{relatively}} little metalwork and a larger amount of <b>ceramics.</b> The assemblage of early Iron Age <b>ceramics</b> from Atlantic Scotland is large compared with the rest of Britain. There are a wide variety of forms and styles, some which resemble those of southern Britain, particularly those with incised geometric ornament.|$|E
5|$|In the 8th century AD {{the city}} had {{important}} relationships with Maya cities to the southwest, especially in the Petexbatún region, and on the Pasión and Usumacinta rivers, including Seibal (on the Pasión), Altar de Sacrificios (near where the Pasión becomes the Usumacinta), and Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Tamarindito, Arroyo de Piedra and Cueva de Sangre (all five in the Petexbatún region). It {{is possible that the}} widespread distribution of Ik-style <b>ceramics</b> in elite tombs at sites in the Petexbatún region may be linked to the military defeat of Motul de San José by Dos Pilas, with these high quality <b>ceramics</b> forming a part of the tribute payment made to the Petexbatún kingdom. After its defeat {{at the hands of the}} Petexbatún kingdom, Motul de San José no longer erected sculpted stelae but the history of the site continued to be recorded to a certain extent in texts on Ik-style <b>ceramics.</b>|$|E

5|$|Porcelain: Although glazed <b>ceramics</b> existed beforehand, {{the author}} and {{historian}} Samuel Adrian M Adshead writes that the earliest type of vitrified, translucent <b>ceramics</b> that {{could be classified as}} true porcelain was not made until the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The archaeologist Nigel Wood of the University of Oxford states that true porcelain was manufactured in northern China from roughly the beginning of the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century, while true porcelain was not manufactured in southern China until about 300 years later, during the early 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Pottery {{produced}} locally in East Africa {{was shaped}} by hand, unglazed, and assumed to be open fired, {{but it has been}} proposed that the absence of evidence for kilns {{may be the result of}} mistaking their remnants for metal furnaces. However, the absence of glazed and wheeled pottery illustrates that the inhabitants of the Swahili Coast did not adapt these technologies as a result of Indian Ocean trade, but were primarily the recipients of finished products in exchange for other local produce. Conversely, fifteen different potters' marks have been found at Gedi on pottery found on or near the surface of the site dating to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which has been used to suggest the site may have had a communal kiln at that time. The pots inscribed with the potters marks show the variation of different types and styles of <b>ceramics</b> over time, which were influenced by local production, as well as, the adaption of foreign design elements. Prior to the diversification of local styles and types, early <b>ceramics</b> at Gedi were more uniform and contained similarities with <b>ceramics</b> found at other coastal sites. Despite the increase of imported <b>ceramics</b> in the fifteenth century, local varieties continued to be present in later levels of the sites occupation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the vast}} {{majority}} of these <b>ceramics</b> are without provenance, analysis has largely focused on the ceramics' styles and subjects.|$|E

5|$|The {{arts and}} crafts of Marrakesh have had a wide and {{enduring}} impact on Moroccan handicrafts to the present day. Riad décor is widely used in carpets and textiles, <b>ceramics,</b> woodwork, metal work and zelij. Carpets and textiles are weaved, sewn or embroidered, sometimes used for upholstering. Moroccan women who practice craftsmanship are known as Maalems (expert craftspeople) and make such fine products as Berber carpets and shawls made of sabra (cactus silk). <b>Ceramics</b> are in monochrome Berber-style only, a limited tradition depicting bold forms and decorations.|$|E
5|$|The ceramic waste forms offer higher waste {{loadings}} {{than the}} glass options because <b>ceramics</b> have crystalline structure. Also, mineral analogues of the ceramic waste forms {{provide evidence for}} long term durability. Due to this fact {{and the fact that}} they can be processed at lower temperatures, <b>ceramics</b> are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms. Ceramic waste forms offer great potential, but a lot of research remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|The {{variations}} in artistic style and chemical {{composition of the}} Ik-style <b>ceramics</b> suggests that they were produced {{in a number of}} workshops local to the Motul de San José area. They have been subdivided into five types, four from Motul de San José itself and one from one of its satellite sites. There are also various lower-quality examples that are presumed to have been manufactured in sites of lesser importance within the Motul de San José polity. The Ik-style <b>ceramics</b> are believed to have been produced in the period from 740800 AD. In spite of differences, all the Ik-style <b>ceramics</b> are thought to have been made within a network of allied workshops dedicated to producing vessels for use in the banquets of the aristocracy of Motul de San José and of the petty nobility of the capital's satellites. The <b>ceramics</b> were distributed widely in the Maya region as gifts in order to seal alliances between the elites of various Maya kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Along with maize and beans, squash {{has been}} {{depicted}} in the art work of the native peoples of the Americas for at least 2,000 years. For example, cucurbits are often represented in Moche <b>ceramics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Altar 10 was {{associated}} with Stela13 and was found {{on top of the}} large offering of <b>ceramics</b> associated with that stela and the royal tomb in Structure7A. The monument was originally a throne with cylindrical supports that was reused as an altar in the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the destruction of monuments and interruption of new construction at the site occurred simultaneously with the arrival of so-called Naranjo style <b>ceramics,</b> which appear to be linked to styles from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. The Naranjo ceramic tradition is particularly characteristic of the western Pacific coast of Guatemala between the Suchiate and Nahualate rivers. The most common forms are pitchers and bowls with a surface that has been smoothed with a cloth, leaving parallel marks, and usually coated with a white or yellow wash. At the same time, the use of local Ocosito <b>ceramics</b> waned. This Teotihuacan influence places the destruction of monuments {{in the second half of}} the Early Classic. The presence of the conquerors linked to the Naranjo-style <b>ceramics</b> was not of long duration and suggests that the conquerors exerted long-distance control of the site, replacing the local rulers with their own governors while leaving the local population intact.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride <b>ceramics</b> are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in <b>ceramics,</b> alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have long}} been celebrated in the arts of Japan, {{including}} in painting, woodblock printing, cloisonné, <b>ceramics</b> and indeed poetry from the 18th and 19th centuries. Print artists like Utamaro and Hokusai made use of Western and Chinese influences to give a sophisticated effect, while Hiroshige reworked the traditional bird-and-flower genre.|$|E
5|$|Burial 265 {{was found}} {{at the base of}} the {{stairway}} of Terrace 1 Structure 2 in the acropolis. <b>Ceramics</b> associated with the burial have been dated to the Middle Preclassic Period. This burial is the only evidence yet found of such early activity at the site. It consists of the burial of a seated infant together with a newborn. The burial was laid out upon a layer of large stones and was accompanied by a plate and other <b>ceramics</b> as a funerary offering. The child's skull was found underneath the plate itself. Burnt stones and earth were found next to the burial.|$|E
5|$|Caldas da Rainha {{has five}} {{institutions}} offering {{professional development and}} vocational education. The Escola Técnica Empresarial do Oeste (ETEO, Technical Business School of the West) offers courses in business and technology. The Centro de Formação Profissional Para a Indústria Cerâmica (CENCAL, Vocational Training Centre for the <b>Ceramics</b> Industry) offers training related to the <b>ceramics</b> industry. The Centro de Formação Profissional da Indústria Metalúrgica e Metalomecânica (CENFIM, Vocational Training Centre of Metallurgical and Metalworking Industry) offers courses in metallurgy and metalworking. The Escola de Sargentos do Exército (ESE, School of Army Sergeants) trains sergeants for the Portuguese Army. The Escola de Hotelaria e Turismo do Oeste-Caldas da Rainha (EHTO, School of Hospitality and Tourism of the West) offers training in hospitality and tourism.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic finds at {{the site}} include {{frequent}} finds of incense-burners with handles and molded decoration. The most common domestic <b>ceramics</b> are of a micaceous ware and include ceramic comals (a type of griddle). Imported <b>ceramics</b> include Chinautla Polychrome and White-on-red, they are reasonably common {{at the site}}. Brown bowls are of a type also found in Zaculeu and Mixco Viejo, both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation. Three-legged metates (a kind of mortar) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black obsidian blades were found in great quantities. Simple jade jewellery was also found.|$|E
5|$|Cultural {{assimilation}} in Guangxi and Guizhou {{happened during}} the late Western Han and occurred later than in Guangdong. As in Guangdong, a number of Han-style mirrors, coins, <b>ceramics,</b> bronze, iron, and lacquerware were discovered in the region's tombs.|$|E
5|$|During the Woodland period, many American Indians in Iowa shifted {{away from}} hunting and {{gathering}} and used more domesticated plants, although wild food was still important. <b>Ceramics,</b> the bow and arrow, burial mounds, and evidence {{of political and social}} hierarchy became common at Woodland sites in Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Geometric {{patterns}} {{occur in}} a variety of forms in Islamic art and architecture including kilim carpets, Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, muqarnas decorative vaulting, jali pierced stone screens, <b>ceramics,</b> leather, stained glass, woodwork, and metalwork.|$|E
5|$|Helium leaks through cracks {{should not}} be {{confused}} with gas permeation through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants (thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, <b>ceramics,</b> and synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{after making}} 24 {{memorial}} tablets for the project, William De Morgan abandoned the <b>ceramics</b> business {{to become a}} novelist, and the only <b>ceramics</b> firm able to manufacture appropriate further tiles was Royal Doulton. Dissatisfied with Royal Doulton's designs, and preoccupied with {{the management of the}} Watts Gallery and Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton, Surrey, Mary Watts lost interest in the project. Work to complete it was sporadic and ceased altogether in 1931 with only 53 of the planned 120 tiles in place. In 2009, the Diocese of London consented to further additions to the memorial, and the first new tablet in 78 years was added.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic {{the site}} {{appears to have}} {{recovered}} from its earlier defeat. Naranjo-style <b>ceramics</b> diminished greatly in quantity {{and there was a}} surge in new large-scale construction. Many monuments broken by the conquerors were re-erected at this time.|$|E
5|$|Like other hard <b>ceramics</b> (namely alumina and boron carbide), {{silicon carbide}} {{is used in}} {{composite}} armor (e.g. Chobham armor), and in ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Dragon Skin, which was produced by Pinnacle Armor, used disks of silicon carbide.|$|E
5|$|Lithium and its {{compounds}} {{have several}} industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and <b>ceramics,</b> lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.
