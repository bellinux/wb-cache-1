5|$|Before <b>custodial</b> interrogations, {{police are}} {{required}} to give suspects a Miranda warning that informs suspects of their legal rights during interrogation. However, Alvarado was not given a Miranda warning {{at any time during}} questioning. This would form part of the basis for Alvarado's legal defense.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{served as}} a {{consultant}} to banks and non-financial institutions and sat on the boards of several companies, including Sonat, Hammermill Paper Company and Keystone <b>Custodial</b> Funds. He was a trustee of the Chase Manhattan Mortgage and Realty Trust, the largest real estate investment trust of its time.|$|E
5|$|Copeland was {{considered}} a prodigy who rose to stardom despite not starting ballet {{until the age of}} 13. By age 15, her mother and ballet teachers, who were serving as her <b>custodial</b> guardians, fought a custody battle over her. Meanwhile, Copeland, who was already an award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The 1998 legal issues involved filings for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother. Both sides dropped legal proceedings, and Copeland moved home to begin studying under a new teacher who was a former ABT member.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} his first criminal conviction in November 1977, aged 15, for burglary. Between 1977 and 1984, he accrued six more convictions {{and was sentenced}} to a care order until the age of 18 for robbery in August 1978. In January 1980 he was convicted of two further crimes including theft of property from his lodgings the night before De Simone's murder. He was subsequently convicted of a series of burglaries committed in Portsmouth for which he received an 18-month <b>custodial</b> sentence of which he served 9months. Following his release he committed robbery again and was sentenced at Portsmouth Crown Court to five years and nine months imprisonment, which he served at HMP Dartmoor.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943 Graf Zeppelin {{was again}} towed eastward, first to Gotenhafen, {{then to the}} {{roadstead}} at Swinemünde and finally berthed at a back-water wharf in the Parnitz River, two miles (3km) from Stettin, {{where she had been}} briefly docked in 1941. There she languished {{for the next two years}} with only a 40-man <b>custodial</b> crew in attendance. When Red Army forces neared the city in April 1945, the ship's Kingston valves were opened, flooding her lower spaces and settling her firmly into the mud in shallow water. A ten-man engineering squad then rigged the vessel's interior with demolition and depth charges in order to hole the hull and destroy vital machinery. At 6pm on 25 April 1945, just as the Soviets entered Stettin, commander Wolfgang Kähler radioed the squad to detonate the explosives. Smoke billowing from the carrier's funnel confirmed the charges had gone off, rendering the ship useless to her new owners for many months to come.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1935 at 6:43pm, a <b>custodial</b> {{engineer}} {{called the}} Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove {{items from the}} smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started {{in the basement of}} the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories. The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Elected Presidency {{scheme was}} {{created as a}} {{constitutional}} safeguard for the nation's future to prevent irresponsible governance. Being directly elected by the people gives the President legitimacy and moral authority {{to serve as a}} check on the executive's powers. The President's two main responsibilities are the protection of Singapore's past reserves and the preservation of the integrity of the public service. However, the President's role is <b>custodial</b> and ceremonial – he does not exercise executive powers. In fact, the President is generally required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution or any other written law, unless the contrary is expressly provided for.|$|E
5|$|Stuart William Morgan is an English {{lorry driver}} and former heating {{engineer}} from Poole. One {{of five children}} of John and Julianne Morgan, {{he was raised in}} Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where his father was employed as a council foreman and his mother– a refugee from the former East Germany– worked as a school cleaner. Morgan left school with three CSEs, and in 1974 served a <b>custodial</b> sentence in borstal following a conviction for burglary. After attending Croydon Polytechnic to train as a plumber and heating engineer, he established a plumbing business in the Tunbridge Wells area. He moved to Dorset following the failure of that business in 1983 and worked as a heating engineer for Bournemouth Borough Council. He became a lorry driver in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Many of Oppenheimer's {{associates}} in {{the years}} before World War II were Communist Party USA members. They included his wife Kitty, whose first husband Joe Dallet had been killed fighting with the Lincoln Battalion in the Spanish Civil War; his brother Frank Oppenheimer and Frank's wife Jackie; and his girlfriend Jean Tatlock. One of his Communist associates was a colleague at the University of California, an assistant professor of French literature named Haakon Chevalier. The two had met during a rally for Spanish Loyalists, and had co-founded a branch of the American Federation of Teachers at Berkeley known as Local 349. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941, after he had attended a December 1940 meeting at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman and its treasurer Isaac Folkoff, both of whom were targets of FBI surveillance and wiretaps. Agents had recorded the license plate of Oppenheimer's car. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a Communist front. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its <b>Custodial</b> Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency.|$|E
5|$|Rashad (T.I.) is a teen {{living in}} Atlanta, Georgia with his Uncle, George (Mykelti Williamson) {{and his little}} brother Ant (Evan Ross). He and his brother were raised by their uncle George since their parents {{died in a car}} accident, and they work with him as part of his <b>custodial</b> company. When not working or {{finishing}} his last semester of high school, Rashad {{spends most of his time}} with his friends Brooklyn (Albert Daniels), Teddy (Jason Weaver), and Esquire (Jackie Long). Rashad is a talented artist but does not see much of a future in that field as he has become accustomed to working the family business. Esquire, Rashad's best friend, goes to a prep school on the opposite side of town from where they live, and is trying to attend an Ivy League college after senior year. However, he finds out that he will need a letter of recommendation from someone of high stature to better his chances of acceptance at the school he wants to attend.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its <b>Custodial</b> Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency. Debates over Oppenheimer's Party membership or lack thereof have turned on very fine points; almost all historians agree he had strong left-wing sympathies during this time and interacted with Party members, though there is considerable dispute over whether he was officially {{a member of the}} Party. At his 1954 security clearance hearings, he denied {{being a member of the}} Communist Party, but identified himself as a fellow traveler, which he defined as someone who agrees with many of the goals of Communism, but without being willing to blindly follow orders from any Communist party apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The planned major {{trial for}} the {{campaign}} of reprisals never took place, {{but a series of}} smaller trials was held instead in Padua between April and June 1947 for SS Brigadeführer Willy Tensfeld, Kapitänleutnant Waldemar Krummhaar, the 26th Panzer Division's Generalleutnant Eduard Crasemann and SS Gruppenführer Max Simon of the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS. Tensfeld was acquitted; Crasemann was sentenced to 10 years; and Simon was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted. Simon's trial was the last held in Italy by the British. By 1949, British military tribunals had sentenced 230 Germans to death and another 447 to <b>custodial</b> sentences. None of the death sentences imposed between the end of 1946 and 1948 were carried out. A number of officers, all below the rank of General, including Kappler, were transferred to the Italian courts for trial. These applied very different legal standards to the British – ones which were often more favourable to the defendants. Ironically, in view of the repeated attempts by many senior Wehrmacht commanders to shift blame for atrocities onto the SS, the most senior SS commanders in Italy, Karl Wolff and Heinrich Himmler's personal representative in Italy, SS Standartenführer Eugen Dollmann, escaped prosecution.|$|E

25|$|According to the Government of India Home Ministry, 2008 was {{the year}} with the lowest {{civilian}} casualties in 20 years, with 89 deaths, compared {{to a high of}} 1,413 in 1996. In 2008, 85 security personnel died compared to 613 in 2001, while 102 militants were killed. The human rights situation improved, with only one <b>custodial</b> death, and no <b>custodial</b> disappearances. Many analysts say Pakistan's preoccupation with jihadis within its own borders explains the relative calm.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{something}} that is somewhat unusual in Japanese custody arrangements is the system of koseki, which legally defines households and persons' legal identity in Japanese law. When a non-Japanese marries a Japanese, the foreign spouse's name is recorded into Japanese spouse's koseki upon filing of the marriage, but the spouse's entry is not created in the koseki {{because of lack of}} Japanese citizenship. When their child is born, because the child has Japanese citizenship, an entry is created for the child in the Japanese spouse's koseki. There is a widespread misunderstanding that when a divorce occurs, the foreign spouse is removed from the koseki and the children's custody is automatically kept by the Japanese spouse who hold the koseki. Koseki and custody are not related. The confusion is increased by the fact that completely uncontested divorces are performed not by a court, but by the spouses simply filling out a family registry form at the city hall. When a divorce is finalized at the city hall, the name of the <b>custodial</b> parent of each child must be written in the filing. The name of the <b>custodial</b> parent is then recorded in each child's entry in the koseki. Therefore, it is wrong to assume that unless custody is litigated in Japan, the Japanese parent will automatically hold custody of children in Japan, irrespective of the ruling of the foreign court. A divorce is not finalized in Japan unless custody is agreed to by the spouses or determined by the Japanese court. Furthermore, it is also wrong, but common, to assume that if the <b>custodial</b> parent dies, custody of the child is transferred within the koseki, which would mean that custody would be retained by the dead spouse's new married partner or Japanese grandparents who retain their custody as primary caregiver and would not be transferred to the surviving parent. When a sole <b>custodial</b> parent dies, the family court starts the procedure of appointing a guardian unless one has been designated in the will of the <b>custodial</b> parent.|$|E
25|$|The care being {{rendered}} by {{the nursing}} home must be skilled. Medicare part A does not pay stays that only provide <b>custodial,</b> non-skilled, or long-term care activities, including {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) such as personal hygiene, cooking, cleaning, etc.|$|E
