50|$|Following the {{responses}} to the consultation the Scottish Government presented the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to the Scottish Parliament on 22 June 2015. The Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 16 March 2016, and received Royal Assent on 22 March 2016 becoming Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016. The most radical and controversial provision of the act was the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permitted Scottish Ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a <b>community</b> <b>body</b> with a registered interest. Like the Crofting Community Right to Buy and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land, the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a third party to purchase land on the same basis.|$|E
5000|$|A further {{provision}} {{is the creation}} of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a <b>community</b> <b>body</b> with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and extended by the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015, the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows crofting communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor project Future Planet Studies, major biology. ABSTRACT Animal {{species with}} a larger body-size tend to have larger home ranges than small-bodied animals. Therefore {{it is likely that}} they are more {{affected}} by habitat fragmentation than small-bodied species. Body size of birds also seems to have a negative relation with species richness. This research has therefore looked into whether birds {{with a larger}} body-size are more sensitive to habitat fragmentation caused by forest fragmentation, than birds with a smaller body-size. Also the relation between biodiversity and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> mass was investigated. This was done by linking the community body-mass of birds at specific sites in 14 different countries spread around the globe with the core area index (CAI) of these sites and the distance from these sites {{to the edge of a}} habitat supporting a high biodiversity (DEHHB). Of the 10 analyzed studies concerning the relation between CAI and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> size for three studies a negative relation was found, while the remaining seven indicated a positive relation. Of these 10 studies only three studies had a p-value lower than 0. 05. These three studies did not correspond with the three studies for which a negative relation was found. Of the seven analyzed studies concerning the relation between DEHHB and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> size for three studies a negative relation was found, while the remaining four indicated a positive relation. None of these relations were significant. Therefore, it is concluded that no relation was found between CAI and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> mass as well as no relation between DEHHB and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> mass. Both these findings are in contrast with previous literature might be due to the fact that there was no consistent edge type in the analysed studies, also the limited size of this study and the lack of data could be a cause. It is recommended to obtain more data concerning bird species abundance and mean <b>community</b> <b>body</b> mass with a large amount of species per study, so more inclusive research can be conducted and to study areas which contain the same type of edge...|$|E
