40|$|Abstract The spatial {{responses}} {{of many of}} the cells recorded in all layers of rodent medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) show mutually aligned grid patterns. Recent experimental findings have shown that grids can often be better described as elliptical rather than purely circular and that, beyond the mutual alignment of their grid axes, ellipses tend to also orient their long axis along preferred directions. Are grid alignment and ellipse orientation aspects of the same phenomenon? Does the grid alignment result from singleunit mechanisms or does it require network interactions? We address these issues by refining a single-unit adaptation model of grid formation, to describe specifically the spontaneous emergence of conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells in layers III, V, and VI of mEC. We find that tight alignment can be produced by recurrent <b>collateral</b> <b>interactions,</b> but this requires head-direction (HD) modulation. Through a competitive learning process driven by spatial inputs, grid fields then form already aligned, and with randomly distributed spatial phases. In addition, we find that the self-organization process is influenced by any anisotropy in the behavio...|$|E
40|$|The word superiority {{effect has}} lost some luster in the {{literature}} but has never been satisfactorily explained. Proposed models vary from facilitatory interactive parallel processing to positive feedback from higher centers, to even independent parallel channels. Issues such as this call for data and analyses {{that are able to}} assess central dynamic visual mechanisms. Accuracy-only experiments are incapable of providing such diagnostics. The vast majority of research on the word superiority effect has been based on accuracy and response time based effects have been elusive. In this work, we have developed a specialized task so that we may use the workload capacity coefficient, a particularly sensitive, response time based measure of processing efficiency. Using this measure, we have found clear evidence of dramatic word superiority effects hallmarked by super capacity, in the response time domain to complement the existing research based on accuracy. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that either parallel channels with positive <b>collateral</b> <b>interactions</b> or, alternatively, models possessing facilitatory-feedback are required—independent parallel models with no facilitatory interactions or feedback cannot reasonably predict our data...|$|E
40|$|The {{multiple}} {{layers of}} medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) contain cells that differ in selectivity, connectivity, and cellular properties.

40|$|Septo-hippocampal GABAergic neurons immunoreactive for parvalbumin {{are thought}} to {{play a crucial role}} in the {{generation}} of hippocampal theta oscillations associated with a specific stage of memory formation. Here we use in vivo juxtacellular recording and filling in the medial septum followed by immunocytochemical identification of the recorded cells containing parvalbumin to determine their firing pattern, phase relationship with hippocampal theta, morphology, and to thereby reveal their involvement in the generation of hippocampal theta activity. We have demonstrated that GABAergic medial septal neurons form two distinct populations exhibiting highly regular bursting activity that is tightly coupled to either the trough (178 °) or the peak (330 °) of hippocampal theta waves. Additionally, different types of bursting as well as nonbursting activity patterns were also observed. The morphological reconstruction of theta-bursting neurons revealed extensive axon arbors of these cells with numerous local collaterals establishing symmetrical synapses; thus, synchrony among the septal pacemaker units may be brought about by their recurrent <b>collateral</b> <b>interactions.</b> Long projecting axons could also be found running dorsally toward the hippocampus and ventrally in the direction of basal forebrain regions. We conclude that GABAergic neurons in the medial septum, which are known to selectively innervate hippocampal interneurons, are in a position to induce rhythmic disinhibition in the hippocampus and other theta-related subcortical areas at two different phases of hippocampal theta.

40|$|The major immediate-early (IE) {{promoter}} of human cytomegalovirus directs {{the expression of}} several differentially spliced and polyadenylated mRNAs that encode isoformic proteins with apparent molecular masses of 55, 72, and 86 kDa. All of these proteins are potent transcriptional regulatory proteins. We {{are interested in the}} <b>collateral</b> <b>interactions</b> between human cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the context of dual infection of a cell. The roles of the specific IE protein isoforms and their respective response elements involved in trans activation of the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) are not known. Here we present evidence that major IE proteins IE 86, IE 72, and IE 55 are capable of trans-activating the HIV LTR in a T-cell line, HUT- 78. The IE 55 isoform noncooperatively stimulates the HIV LTR in the presence of either isoform IE 72 or IE 86. Interactions between isoforms IE 72 and IE 86, however, result in strong synergistic activation of the LTR. Our results suggest that a specific 155 -amino-acid protein domain that is unique for the IE 86 protein participates in this synergic interaction. Point mutational analysis of the LTR identified a distinct cis-acting target site, located between nucleotide positions - 174 and - 163, that mediates exclusively synergistic trans activation by the IE 72 and IE 86 proteins. Finally, this study underscores the role of a cellular intermediate(s) for communicating the synergic interactions between two IE trans activators...|$|E
40|$|Collateral {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} features of a debt contract. A substantial theoretical literature motivates the use of collateral as a means to alleviate ex-ante and ex-post information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders and the incidence of credit rationing. Through its seniority effect, collateral may also affect banks’ incentives to monitor borrowers. There is little empirical evidence, however, on the precise workings of <b>collateral,</b> its <b>interaction</b> with other contract terms, and its impact on banks’ monitoring incentives. We study a change in the Swedish law that exogenously reduced the value of all outstanding company mortgages, i. e., a type of collateral that is comparable to the floating lien. We explore this natural experiment to identify how collateral determines borrower quality, loan terms, access to credit and bank monitoring of business term loans. Using a differences-in-differences approach, we find that following the change in the law and the loss in collateral value borrowers pay a higher interest rate on their loans, receive a worse quality assessment by their bank, and experience a substantial reduction in the supply of credit by their bank. Consistent with theories that consider collateral and monitoring to be complements, the reduction in collateral precedes a decrease in bank monitoring intensity and frequency of both collateral and borrower. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{internal}} policy mismanagements can {{be cited}} in most recent emerging market crises, they seldom account fully for {{the severity of}} these crises. The reluctance of international investors to provide the resources that would limit {{the extent of the}} reversal almost invariably {{plays a key role in}} bringing a previously (over?) -heated economy to a costly halt. Domestic assets experience dramatic depreciation and otherwise solvent investment projects and production, especially in the nontradeables sector, find no financiers and are wastefully shutdown. Ultimately, the reason for this breakdown of a country's access to international capital markets must lie in the inadequacy (real or perceived) of its international collateral. We build a framework where this insufficiency and its consequences stem from microeconomic contractual problems. Fire sales of domestic assets naturally arise as a result of desperate competition for scarce international collateral. This begs the question of why the private sector does not take steps to ensure sufficient international collateral when crises are likely. The answer lies in the presence of a pecuniary externality. We show that contractual problems also lead to a problem of insufficient domestic collateral, which restricts the transfer of surplus arising from the use of international collateral between the users and providers of this international <b>collateral.</b> The <b>interaction</b> between domestic and international collateral also sheds light on when pre-crisis capital flows ought to be regulated and on whether there is scope for currency support measures during the crisis or not. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays concerning Monetary Theory and Policy. Essay 1, 2 ̆ 2 Monetary Policy and Asset Prices 2 ̆ 2, develops a dynamic model in which money and a financial asset compete as media of exchange. We show that money circulates {{if and only if}} real assets are scarce, in the sense that their supply is not sufficient to satisfy the demand for liquidity. Our model also generates a connection between asset prices and monetary policy. When money grows at a higher rate, inflation is higher and the return on money decreases. In equilibrium, no arbitrage amounts to equating the real return of both objects. Thus, the price of the asset increases in order to lower its real return. Essay 2, 2 ̆ 2 Monetary Policy and Interest Rates with Collateralized Borrowing 2 ̆ 2, proposes a model of money that analyzes <b>collateral</b> and its <b>interaction</b> with monetary policy and interest rates. The value of the asset that serves as collateral, which is specific to each agent, plays a crucial role. This asset is different from fiat money and a standard financial asset. Therefore, its valuation is not standard. I prove existence and uniqueness of equilibrium in an environment where the Mundell-Tobin effect is not present. Heterogeneity of borrowers has a relevant effect on the impact of changes in the interest rates. ...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{responses}} {{of many of}} the cells recorded in all layers of rodent medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) show a triangular grid pattern, and once established might be based in part on path-integration mechanisms. Grid axes are tightly aligned across simultaneously recorded units. Recent experimental findings have shown that grids can often be better described as elliptical rather than purely circular and that, beyond the mutual alignment of their grid axes, ellipses tend to also orient their long axis along preferred directions. Are grid alignment and ellipse orientation the same phenomenon? Does the grid alignment result from single-unit mechanisms or does it require network interactions? We address these issues by refining our model, to describe specifically the spontaneous emergence of conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells in layers III, V and VI of mEC. We find that tight alignment can be produced by recurrent <b>collateral</b> <b>interactions,</b> but this requires head-direction modulation. Through a competitive learning process driven by spatial inputs, grid fields then form already aligned, and with randomly distributed spatial phases. In addition, we find that the self-organization process is influenced by the behavior of the simulated rat. The common grid alignment often orients along preferred running directions. The shape of individual grids is distorted towards an ellipsoid arrangement when some speed anisotropy is present in exploration behavior. Speed anisotropy on its own also tends to align grids, even without collaterals, but the alignment is seen to be loose. Finally, the alignment of spatial grid fields in multiple environments shows that the network expresses the same set of grid fields across environments, modulo a coherent rotation and translation. Thus, an efficient metric encoding of space may emerge through spontaneous pattern formation at the single-unit level...|$|E

El objetivo de esta comunicación es analizar la prescripción de medicamentos para el tratamiento de enfermedades, trastornos, síntomas y signos que experimentan los afectados de ACSa, teniendo en cuenta el diagnóstico establecido por los MAP o psiquiatras. Configuración y método: Estudio observacional, longitudinal, basado en la revisión de los registros médicos de las personas afectadas por HSW. Principales medidas de resultado: datos socio-demográficos, días de incapacidad temporal, el período de HSW psicológica, los principales diagnóstico de {{acuerdo a}} la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades (CIE- 10), la prescripción patrón de acuerdo con la clasificación ATC. Resultados: 50 pacientes fueron incluidos en el estudio (edad media: 45, 5 años; 62 % mujeres). Los períodos medios de ACS y de ILT eran 4 años y 413 días respectivamente. Los principales diagnósticos fueron 76, 5 % F 40 - 48 y el 23, 1 % F 30 - 39 por médico de cabecera y el 49, 4 % F 30 - 39 y del 42, 1 % F 40 - 48 por el psiquiatra. El número total de prescripciones fue 909, incluyendo 67 diferentes principios activos, principalmente del grupo N de la clasificación ATC (88 %), dirigidos a mitigar los síntomas mentales y lograr la remisión completa de los síntomas de la enfermedad mental. El restante (12 %) se utiliza para tratar el estado psicosomático aparato locomotor, digestivo, cardiovascular, endocrino, dermatológicas infecciosas, respiratorias y los trastornos de dolor crónico. Los psiquiatras se centran su actividad en la depresión y, así, su prescripción es el 49 % de los antidepresivos en comparación con el 29 % de los ansiolíticos. Además, la prescripción de antidepresivos aproximadamente {{coincide}} con el porcentaje de pacientes con diagnóstico de depresión (43 %), mientras que el porcentaje de casos diagnosticados de ansiedad (53 %) es muy superior que receta ansiolíticos. Sin embargo, la Guía NICE para los estados depresivos que en el caso de los asociados síntomas de la depresión y la ansiedad, la depresión merece una atención prioritaria. Conclusiones: Los diagnósticos de los psiquiatras son consistentes con los criterios establecidos en la literatura internacional al describir los trastornos mentales graves y discapacitantes que afectan a HSW psicológico. La prescripción de antidepresivos está de acuerdo con el enfoque de diagnóstico informado por todos los especialistas, y también está de acuerdo con las recomendaciones de NICE Directrices para la depresión. Objectives: The first {{aim of this}} study was to examine the possible association of long standing Systematic psychological harassment at work (SPHW) with psychiatric disorders and its characteristics. The second aim was to analyze drug prescription used to treat diseases, disorders, symptoms, and signs of those affected with psychological SPHW, taking into account the established diagnosis by the General Physician (GP) or Psychiatrists. Method and study subjects: Design: Longitudinal observational study with follow up focused on persons undergoing a long duration SPHW; based on the review of medical records of people affected by SPHW Total length of the follow up period was 6 years, from 2006 to 2012. Mean duration of follow up was 3. 1 years (range 1. 1 - 6. 3 years). Setting: Patients who voluntarily attend to a Catalonia Harassment Victims association (Associació de Víctimes d’Assejament laboral de Catalunya: AVALC) asking for psychological and laboral aid. Subjects: 132 persons were recruited along a seven years period, 84 women (63. 6 %) and 48 men (36. 4 %). Mean age was 45. 5 years (SD ± 9. 8), 43. 8 years for women and 48. 3 years for men (p= 0. 114). SPHW was measured by self-reported data. All participants were assessed using several neuropsychological instruments such as the Beck Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, the Echeburua Scale, the PDS (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale) and the LIPT (Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terrorization). Medical records were examined to verify all the diagnosis affecting to the participants. After checking the medical records, only 50 cases (37. 3 %), 31 women and 19 men, had verified psychiatric diagnostics, according to ICD- 10 criteria. Main outcome measures: - Socio-demographic data: age, gender - Work environment: types of harassers, mainly distributed by work sectors, public administration workers and private organizations workers, days of temporary disability, period of SPHW. - Main diagnosis according to International Classification of Diseases ICD- 10 - Type of assistance: primary care, mental health unit, emergency department, neurologist or occupational health unit. - Previous pharmacotherapeutical history including all prescribed drugs (generic or brand) related with working problems and concomitant medication, number of prescriptions, active principles (DCI), reason for prescription, dose and dosing interval, duration of treatment, and number of drugs per patient. - Established treatment planning (pharmaceutical care) designed to detect, prevent and solve potential or acute problems related with the prescribed drugs, such as adherence, <b>interactions,</b> <b>collateral</b> effects, negative outcomes, effectiveness and safety. - Prescription pattern according to Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical Classification System (ATC classification). - Most prescribed active principles and percentages of utilization.

Background/Introduction The phenomenon of systematic psychological harassment at work (SPHW) first described by Heinz Leymann, refers to systematic and prolonged exposure to frequent hostile behaviours at work. SPHW is commonly considered as an expression of violent behaviour. SPHW has been defined as ‘‘harassing, offending, socially excluding someone or negatively affecting someone’s work tasks [...] . ” it has to occur repeatedly and regularly (e. g., weekly) and over a period of time (e. g., about six months). However, there is no accepted common definition as yet and different terminology is used as synonym of bullying (e. g., harassment, mobbing, emotional abuse, victimisation, psychological abuse at work). Research about this topic has dramatically increased in the last years. These behaviours may lead to the stigmatisation and victimization of the exposed individuals. A reciprocal relationship between SPHW and mental distress has been described. Several studies have shown that SPHW is associated with mental distress. Furthermore, mental distress was shown to be a predictor of bullying. It seems that experiencing workplace bullying can contribute to mental distress, but individual characteristics may also contribute to the perception of bullying. Thus, a significant relationship between general proneness to negative feelings and work victimization has been described. A theoretical framework, the cognitive theory of trauma, proposes the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as the result of systematic psychological harmful events. The traumatic potential of bullying is unquestionable. So, the path from job demands to PTSD through bullying seems plausible. PTSD is a severe anxiety disorder that can be developed after exposure to any event that results in psychological trauma. Diagnostic symptoms for PTSD include re-experiencing the original trauma(s) through flashbacks or nightmares, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, and increased arousal, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, anger, and hyper vigilance. Diagnostic criteria require that symptoms last more than one month and cause significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Exposure to intense bullying at work may change the individual’s perceptions of their work-environment and life in general to one of threat, danger, insecurity and self-questioning, which may result in emotional, psychosomatic and psychiatric problems, even affecting the personal and familiar relationships of the victims. Most studies examining the relationship between psychosocial work characteristics and mental health outcomes, ranging from symptoms and psychological distress to diagnosed psychiatric disorders, have been cross-sectional and, therefore, the causal association between work stressors and mental health remains uncertain. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe and analyze the possible relationship between SPHW characteristics and the subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, such as the presence of PTSD symptoms as a possible consequence of workplace bullying-related victimization. PTSD in the workplace may be a common problem and there has been scarce research about this topic (32). RESULTS Mean duration of SPHW was 4. 0 years (SD ± 2. 8), 3. 7 years for women and 4. 6 years for men (p= 0. 226). 14 % of participants suffered SPHW along 3 years or less, 48 % from 3 to 6 years, 30 % from 6 to 9 years and 8 % more than 9 years. In 62. 7 % of cases, the harassers were hierarchic superiors and in 9. 4 % of cases companions and/or collaborators contributed to bullying. In 62. 7 % of cases, the harassers were hierarchic superiors and in 9. 4 % of cases companions and/or collaborators contributed to bullying. Cases were mainly distributed by work sectors as follows: 28. 4 % public administrations, 23. 2 % commercial sector, 23. 2 % industrial sector and 14. 0 % services.
