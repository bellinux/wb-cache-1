5|$|Arizona {{has been}} {{affected}} by hurricanes on numerous occasions. Usually, these storms originate in the eastern Pacific Ocean, make landfall in the Mexican states of Baja <b>California</b> <b>or</b> Sonora, and dissipate before crossing into the United States. Thus, in most cases, {{it is only the}} tropical cyclones' remnant moisture that produces heavy rainfall—and in some occasions, flooding—in portions of Arizona. However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient strength to enter the state as a tropical storm or a tropical depression. Arizonans can expect indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either <b>California</b> <b>or</b> federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first.

Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|In December 1843, Smith petitioned Congress to make Nauvoo an {{independent}} territory {{with the right}} to call out federal troops in its defense. Smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what they would do to protect the Mormons. After receiving noncommittal or negative responses, Smith announced his own independent candidacy for President of the United States, suspended regular proselytizing, and sent out the Quorum of the Twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries. In March 1844 — following a dispute with a federal bureaucrat — Smith organized the secret Council of Fifty. Smith said the Council had authority to decide which national or state laws Mormons should obey. The Council was also to select a site for a large Mormon settlement in Texas, <b>California,</b> <b>or</b> Oregon, where Mormons could live under theocratic law beyond other governmental control.|$|E

5|$|The California {{sea lion}} ranges {{along the western}} coast and islands of North America, from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja <b>California</b> <b>or</b> Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and {{the mouth of the}} bay (Southern stock). The stock status of the sea lions at the deep waters of the central bay has not been analyzed.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Sweetwater valley, the trail {{encounters}} {{one of the most}} important landmarks on the trail, Independence Rock. Independence Rock was named because settlers tried to reach it by July 4 (Independence Day in the United States) in order to help ensure that they will be at their destinations in <b>California</b> <b>or</b> Oregon before the winter snows come. Many of the travelers left their names on the rock, either carved or painted on with axle grease. It is estimated that more than 50,000 signatures were inscribed on Independence Rock. Other notable landmarks along the Sweetwater valley include Split Rock, Devil's Gate and Martin's Cove, where, in November 1856, the Martin Handcart Company was stranded by heavy snow until a rescue party from Salt Lake City arrived.|$|E
