5|$|When a Bullhampton farmer is {{murdered in}} the course of a burglary, {{suspicion}} falls on Sam Brattle and his associates. Fenwick believes in Sam's innocence, and acts as one of his bondsmen. Through Sam he discovers Carry's whereabouts, and resolves to rescue her if he can. He finds her a temporary home, but it becomes <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the only permanent solution must involve bringing her back into the Brattle family, which means winning her father's forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|Although the British Army {{refused to}} co-operate with the producers—and Winston Churchill thought the film would ruin wartime morale—Colonel Blimp confounded critics when {{it proved to}} be an artistic and {{commercial}} success. Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor Roger Livesey in his next film, A Canterbury Tale (1944), but her agent had sold her contract to MGM. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
60|$|The young {{fisherman}} {{had become}} more and more agitated, as the writing had become <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He now left it lying before the captain, over whose shoulder he had been reading it, and dropping into his former seat, leaned forward on the table and laid his face in his hands.|$|R

25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear what {{relationship}} the encounter {{in the dressing room}} had on Houdini's eventual death. As Snopes points out, the relationship between blunt trauma and appendicitis is not clear. One theory suggests that Houdini was unaware that he was suffering from appendicitis, which would have been <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> had he not received blows to the abdomen.|$|R
5|$|The {{far left}} wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, guarded the Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles {{did not like to}} use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt no qualms placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a couple hundred mercenaries at Freiburg im Breisgau.|$|E

It was the first pre-sapiens discovery of a fossil man, and it was immediately <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the brain case was surprisingly large.|$|E
25|$|When Admiral Somerville {{inspected}} the base at Trincomalee, its deficiencies were <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He found the port inadequate, {{vulnerable to a}} determined attack, and open to spying. An isolated island base with a safe, deep anchorage in a suitably strategic position was required. Addu Atoll, in the Indian Ocean, met the requirements and it was secretly developed as a fleet anchorage.|$|E

50|$|Keynes wrote four prefaces, to the English, German, Japanese and French editions, {{each with}} a {{slightly}} different emphasis.In the English preface, he addresses the book to his fellow economists but mentions he hopes it will be helpful to others who read it. He also claims that the connection between this book and his Treatise on Money, written five years earlier, {{will most likely be}} <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> than anyone else. Any contradictions should be viewed as an evolution of thought.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} day of the team, one of his duplicates is shot and killed, and Madrox learns for the first time that he cannot absorb a {{deceased}} duplicate. This makes him realize for the first time how independent his duplicates actually are. This becomes <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> when a duplicate, working for Mister Sinister, decides that it wants to absorb the original, which it does for a short time, until Jamie's dominant personality breaks free and reabsorbs the wayward dupe.|$|R
25|$|The uncompromising {{attitude}} of the kinsmen, though it was made the excuse for sending the elder to the Tower, brought no further punishment to James than easy detention within ten miles of Newcastle-on-Tyne. During his residence there it was made <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by the king's agents that he would receive high reward if he supported the royal plans. In 1613 negotiations were begun for his return to Scotland, but his health was broken, and he died at Berwick in January 1614.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} commercial {{failure of}} the novel has been suggested as pivotal in Herbert's later career – it was <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that novel-writing was not likely to prove financially rewarding, which helped focus his efforts on light journalism and {{set the tone for}} most of his later writings. He would not write anything quite the same again – The House by the River (1920), a crime novel, retains something of the simple style, but begins to introduce elements of humour not found in The Secret Battle.|$|E
25|$|McClellan's {{replacement}} was Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, {{the commander}} of the IX Corps. Burnside had established a reputation as an independent commander, with successful operations earlier that year in coastal North Carolina and, unlike McClellan, had no apparent political ambitions. However, he felt himself unqualified for army-level command and objected when offered the position. He accepted only when it was made <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that McClellan would be replaced in any event and that an alternative choice for command was Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, whom Burnside disliked and distrusted. Burnside assumed command on November 7.|$|E

50|$|Diallo {{missed the}} first five games of his {{freshman}} season with Kansas after the NCAA failed <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play due to eligibility concerns. On November 25, 2015, he was <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> play for the Jayhawks in their game against Loyola on December 1, after the NCAA ultimately ruled Diallo had received {{a limited amount of}} impermissible benefits.

60|$|It was a <b>clear</b> {{invitation}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> a pleading <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} he repented, to make his peace with his godfather.

25|$|Pramas {{made the}} offer {{to publish the}} setting if Kenson would also create a superhero game system based on the d20 System. Kenson agreed and got to work. Over time, it became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the game {{would need to be}} {{released}} only under the Open Game License. Releasing the game under the d20 Standard Trademark License, as originally planned, would have prohibited the inclusion of ability generation and character advancement rules. Presenting a complete game was seen as taking precedence over having a d20 logo on the product, so {{the decision was made to}} use the OGL without the d20 license.|$|E
25|$|Braxton Bragg had arguably won a {{tactical}} victory, having fought aggressively and pushed his opponent back {{for over a}} mile. But his precarious strategic situation became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as he {{found out about the}} III Corps advance on the Springfield Pike, and when he learned late in the day of the II Corps' presence on the Lebanon Pike. At 9 p.m. he met with his subordinates at the Crawford House and gave orders to begin a withdrawal after midnight, leaving a picket line in place while his army joined up with Kirby Smith's. As the army marched toward Harrodsburg, they were forced to leave 900 wounded men behind.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{had voted}} against the Schuman Declaration in 1950 and had {{supported}} entry only because {{he believed that the}} Common Market was simply a means to secure free trade. In March 1969, he opposed Britain's joining the European Economic Community. Opposition to entry had hitherto been confined largely to the Labour Party but now, he said, it was <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the sovereignty of Parliament was in question, as was Britain's very survival as a nation. This nationalist analysis attracted millions of middle-class Conservatives and others, and {{as much as anything else}} it made Powell the implacable enemy of Heath, a fervent pro-European; but there was already enmity between the two.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, Tony's wife Hannah arrives on his doorstep, with the {{disturbing}} news that her new lover, Neville Agard (Gordon Case), had been beating both her and their daughter Cassie. Tony is furious and promptly confronts Neville, returning later covered in blood. Despite their past problems, Tony and Hannah decide to give their marriage another chance and both she and Cassie come to live in Albert Square. Problems still persist, however, and Hannah regularly nags Tony and makes it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that Walford {{is not good enough}} for her. Things reach a climax when Tony hits Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer) in February 1987 for making a pass at Hannah. Hannah is furious and can't condone his violent actions, despite willingly allowing him to assault her ex-lover months earlier. Hannah subsequently decides that the marriage is over and she leaves Walford to live with her sister.|$|E
25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the Government of the Ethiopian Empire {{would have to move}} from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E
25|$|John Bosco {{records that}} when Dominic {{arrived at the}} Oratory, he at once placed himself under his guidance. He also notes that Dominic worked {{diligently}} and followed the school rules. He would happily listen to talks and sermons (even if they tended to be lengthy at times), and would, without hesitation, ask for clarification on points that were not <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> John Bosco also notes how Dominic was obedient to his teachers and chose his companions carefully. This happened in the year 1854, while, in Rome, the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary was being defined. Preparations for the observation of this feast were thus {{going on at the}} Oratory. Don Bosco records that, at the advice of his confessor, Dominic renewed his First Communion promises at the altar of Mary at the Oratory. John Bosco says that, from this point the result of Dominic's attempts towards holy life were so apparent, that he (John Bosco) took to recording the various incidents that occurred for future reference.|$|E

25|$|The {{strategic}} {{situation in}} Europe had altered considerably by January 1805. The Spanish had allied with France, but Napoleon {{was concerned about}} Austria and Russia, {{who appeared to be}} in negotiations with Britain. The danger of committing most of his forces across the Channel, from where they could not easily be recalled, had become <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Should a combined Russian and Austrian force open a second front to the east, Napoleon would be hard pressed to deal with it. He decided to temporarily put his plans for invasion on hold, and developed a new strategy whereby his largely idle fleet could cause trouble for Britain. Villeneuve and Missiessy were ordered to embark troops and take their fleets to sea, where they would sail to the West Indies and attack the British possessions there. This would force the British to reallocate resources to defend them. Missiessy duly sailed from Rochefort on 11 January with five ships of the line, evaded Vice-Admiral Thomas Graves's blockading force and escaped into the Atlantic. Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane took his forces in pursuit, and both fleets sailed to the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} vote, on April 23, {{it was obvious}} that neither a strong Spanish {{candidate}} nor a strong French candidate could be elected. Medici and d'Este met, and Medici proposed two possible compromise candidates to d'Este: Cardinal Albani and Cardinal Felice Peretti Montalto. Madruzzo's chosen candidate was Cardinal Sirleto, but in a meeting with d'Este shortly after he entered the Conclave on the 24th, it was made <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that Sirleto was being excluded by the votes of the French. Madruzzo declared that he would not accept Albani. D'Este met with Cardinal Farnese, hoping to stop any effort that Farnese might begin to exclude Montalto. He had already been trying to organize some of Gregory XIII's cardinals into a faction of his own. Farnese already believed that Montalto had little real support, and d'Este encouraged that misapprehension. But, when all the likely votes were tallied, it seemed that the supporters of Montalto lacked four votes, which would have to come from Farnese. When the Cardinals assembled to begin the balloting, d'Este suddenly intervened and announced that it was not necessary to proceed to a ballot since they already had a pope—Cardinal Montalto. The cardinals immediately proceeded to 'adore' Montalto—which was a legitimate method for electing a pope. There had to be no opposition, and there was none. Farnese had been silenced and coerced into cooperation.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} Myshkin's trip {{is to make}} the {{acquaintance}} of his distant relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna Yepanchina, and to make inquiries about a matter of business. Madame Yepanchina is the wife of General Yepanchin, a wealthy and respected man in his mid-fifties. When the Prince calls on them, he is instructed to wait by a servant. He strikes up a conversation with the servant, treating him as an equal and expatiating, to the lackey's surprise, {{on the subject of the}} horror of capital punishment. General Yepanchin has an ambitious and vain assistant, Gavril Ardalionovich Ivolgin (Ganya), who the Prince also meets while waiting. The General and his business partner, the aristocrat Totsky, are seeking to arrange a marriage between Ganya and Nastassya Filippovna. Though herself of noble descent, Nastassya Filippovna became a ward of Totsky at the age of 7, following a family tragedy. When she was 16, Totsky had settled her in a comfortable little house in the country, provided her with tutors, a library and other cultural refinements, and for the next four years treated her as his concubine. Now a grown woman, she has made it frighteningly <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that she does not intend to let him off lightly. Totsky, thinking the marriage might settle her and free him to pursue his desire for marriage with General Yepanchin's eldest daughter, has promised 75,000 rubles. Nastassya Filippovna, unsure of Ganya's motives and aware that his family does not approve of her, has reserved her decision but has promised to announce it that evening at her birthday soirée. Ganya and the General openly discuss the subject in front of Myshkin. Ganya shows him a photograph of her, and her face particularly strikes him. The Prince tells them of Rogozhin's interest in Nastassya Filippovna, and Ganya asks the Prince whether Rogozhin would marry her. The Prince replies that he might well marry her and then murder her a week later.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{winners of}} the 1979 {{election}} were not re-elected: Healey was elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, so {{did not need to}} run for election to the Shadow Cabinet. David Owen did not return. He informed Michael Foot of his decision not to run in November, after the PLP rejected [...] "one member, one vote" [...] and it became <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that he would be defecting. Not long afterward, he joined William Rodgers (who did win a seat in the Shadow Cabinet), Shirley Williams, and Roy Jenkins in founding the Social Democratic Party. Because of Rodgers's defection, Tony Benn joined the Shadow Cabinet in January 1981 by virtue of being the top loser.|$|R

At first {{he did not know}} where he was, but by degrees his situation <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and he beheld it in all the ghastliness of a right mind. She knew the worst of him--the very worst. How could he face her now? She would soon be coming down to see about breakfast, as she had said, and there would he be in all his shame confronting her. He could not bear the thought, and softly drawing on his boots, and taking his hat from the nail on which she had hung it, he slipped noiselessly out of the house.|$|R
