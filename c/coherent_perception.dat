25|$|The {{relationship}} between the binding problem and multisensory perception {{can be thought of}} as a question – the binding problem, and potential solution – multisensory perception. The binding problem stemmed from unanswered questions about how mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, <b>coherent</b> <b>perception</b> of their surroundings from the cacophony of electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis of the world around us. It was investigated initially in the visual domain (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the binding problem is central to multisensory perception.|$|E
50|$|Thalamocortical {{resonance}} {{is thought}} to be a potential explanation for coherence of perception in the brain. Temporal coincidence could occur through this mechanism by the integration of both specific and non-specific thalamic nuclei at the pyramidal cortical cell, as they both synapse on its apical dendrites. Feedback from the cortical cell back to the thalamic nuclei then relays the integrated signal. As there are numerous thalamocortical loops throughout the cortex, this process takes place simultaneously across many different regions of the brain during conscious perception. It is this ability to support large-scale synchronized events between remote brain regions that may provide for <b>coherent</b> <b>perception.</b> Altogether, the specific, ventrobasal neurons in the thalamus serve to introduce sensory input to a self-sustained feedback loop that is sustained by the non-specific, centrolateral TCs relaying information about the current cognitive state of the brain.|$|E
50|$|Detecting visual contours, edges, or {{boundaries}} is {{an important}} function in human and computer vision which facilitates figure-ground segmentation and object recognition. Contour integration depends on a subject’s ability to link representations of separate visual stimuli into a coherent percept. Subjects with schizophrenia {{have been shown to}} perform worse than healthy adults on tasks that depend on contour integration, and these deficits may be related to factors such as illness severity, chronicity, and degree of disorganized symptoms. In these experiments, subjects often viewed stimuli that could be connected to form a <b>coherent</b> <b>perception</b> of a line, like a simplified connect the dots puzzle. It is worth noting that in general, the magnitude of visual processing abnormalities (such as abnormal contour detection performance) in schizophrenia are fairly small. Therefore, {{it may be necessary to}} examine experimental data from a large number of subjects in order to observe difference between healthy adults and those with schizophrenia using statistical methods.It has been proposed that weaker lateral excitation due to deficient NMDA-receptor functioning could disrupt neural processing, and that this might underlie problems with contour integration in schizophrenia. This idea is consistent with the Glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, as dysfunction in this neurotransmitter system may explain symptoms observed in this disorder.|$|E

In order to test the dorsal stream deficit hypothesis, we investigated coherent and biological motion perception as well as <b>coherent</b> form <b>perception</b> in a group of adolescents with autism and a group of age-matched typically developing controls. If the dorsal stream hypothesis were true, we would expect to document deficits in both coherent and biological motion processing in this group but find no deficit in <b>coherent</b> form <b>perception.</b> Using the method of constant stimuli and standard psychophysical analysis techniques, we mea-sured thresholds for coherent motion, biological motion and coherent form. We found that adolescents with autism showed reduced sensitivity to both coherent and biological motion but performed as well as age-matched controls during <b>coherent</b> form <b>perception.</b> Correlations between intelligence quotient and task performance, however, appear to drive much of the group difference in <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception.</b> Differences between groups on <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception</b> did not remain significant when intelligence quotient was controlled for, but group differences in biological motion perception were more robust, remain-ing significant even when intelligence quotient differences were accounted for. Additionally, aspects of task performance on the biological motion perception task were related to autism symptomatology. These results do not support a general dorsal stream dysfunction in adolescents with autism but provide evidence of a more complex impairment in higher-level dynamic attentiona...|$|R
40|$|The brain generates <b>coherent</b> <b>perceptions</b> {{of objects}} from {{elementary}} sensory inputs. To examine how higher-order representations of smells {{arise from the}} activation of discrete combinations of glomeruli, we analyzed transformations of activity patterns between the zebrafish olfactory bulb and two of its telencephalic targets, Vv and Dp. Vv is subpallial whereas Dp is the homolog of olfactory cortex. Both areas lack an obvious topographic organization but perform complementary computations. Responses to different odors and their mixtures indicate that Vv neurons pool convergent inputs, resulting in broadened tuning curves and overlapping odor representations. Neuronal circuits in Dp, in contrast, produce a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to each neuron that controls action potential firing in an odor-dependent manner. This mechanism can extract information about combinations of molecular features from ensembles of active and inactive mitral cells, suggesting that pattern processing in Dp establishes representations of odor objects...|$|R
40|$|Vision in Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) is {{characterized}} by enhanced perception of local elements, but impaired perception of global percepts. Deficits in <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception</b> seem to support this characterization, but the roots and robustness of such deficits remain unclear. We aimed to investigate {{the dynamics of the}} perceptual decision-making network known to support <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception.</b> In a series of forced-choice <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception</b> tests, we parametrically varied a single stimulus dimension, viewing duration, to test whether the rate at which evidence is accumulated towards a global decision is atypical in ASC. 40 adult participants (20 ASC) performed a classic motion discrimination task, manually indicating the global direction of motion in a random-dot kinematogram across a range of coherence levels (2 – 75 %) and stimulus-viewing durations (200 – 1500 ms). We report a deficit in global motion perception at short viewing durations in ASC. Critically, however, we found that increasing the amount of time over which motion signals could be integrated reduced the magnitude of the deficit, such that at the longest duration {{there was no difference between}} the ASC and control groups. Further, the deficit in motion integration at the shortest duration was significantly associated with the severity of autistic symptoms in our clinical population, and was independent from measures of intelligence. These results point to atypical integration of motion signals during the construction of a global percept in ASC. Based on the neural correlates of decision-making in global motion perception our findings suggest the global motio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe develop on a {{model for}} multi-sensory {{integration}} to perform sensorimotor tasks. The aim of the model is to provide missing modality recall and generalization using cortico-inspired mechanisms. The architecture consists in several multilevel cortical maps with a generic structure. Each map has to self organize with a continuous, decentralized and unsupervised learning which provides robustness and adaptability. These self-organizations are constrained by the multi modal context to obtain multi-sensory generalization. More precisely, each modality is represented by a perceptive map and each perception by an activity bump, that emerges thanks to a competition mechanism, in the corresponding map. All perceptive maps are reciprocally and laterally connected to an unique associative map. A competition {{takes place in the}} associative map to generate an activity bump which represents the multi-sensory perception. Multi modal constraints are relaxed, thanks to the lateral connections, to converge towards <b>coherent</b> <b>perceptions</b> within a multi modal context. We will present a model of perceptive map using a modulated BCM (Bienenstock Cooper Munro) learning rule to create a self-organization at the map level, which can be influenced by the multimodal context.

40|$|Abstract. The {{cognitive}} {{problem is}} how a given sensorial input elicits a decision. Since the neuron dynamics are affected by deterministic chaos, information is lost {{over the course of}} time. Control of chaos reduces such a loss rate by adding extra degrees of freedom. This addition is a change of code; such a recoding occurs on two time scales, namely, (A) the cognitive one (lasting up to 3 s), within which the brain reaches a collective state associated with a perception, and (B) the linguistic one (beyond 3 s), whereby memory retrieves different (A) units and compares them. In (A) the neurons are mutually coupled in large networks; collective synchronization of neuron arrays elicit decisions. In (B), different (A) slots are compared after retrieval. This requires a subject to be conscious of him/herself as well as that the pieces of the stream be correlated. While in (A) the neuron synchronization is described in dynamic terms, in (B) the slot comparison is formalized by an inverse Bayes rule. Distinction of (A), where <b>coherent</b> <b>perceptions</b> are built, from (B), where we formulate attributions of truth, recovers the fundamental philosophical difference between apprehension and judgment...|$|R
40|$|Individuals {{with autism}} are often {{characterized}} as ‘seeing the trees, {{but not the}} forest’—attuned to individual details in the visual world {{at the expense of}} the global percept they compose. Here, we tested the extent to which global processing deficits in autism reflect impairments in (i) primary visual processing; or (ii) decision-formation, using an archetypal example of global <b>perception,</b> <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception.</b> In an event-related functional MRI experiment, 43 intelligence quotient and age-matched male participants (21 with autism, age range 15 – 27 years) performed a series of <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception</b> judge-ments in which the amount of local motion signals available to be integrated into a global percept was varied by controlling stimulus viewing duration (0. 2 or 0. 6 s) and the proportion of dots moving in the correct direction (coherence: 4 %, 15 %, 30 %, 50 %, or 75 %). Both typical participants and those with autism evidenced the same basic pattern of accuracy in judging the direction of motion, with performance decreasing with reduced coherence and shorter viewing durations. Critically, these effects were exaggerated in autism: despite equal performance at the long duration, performance was more strongly reduced by shortening viewing duration in autism (P 50. 015) and decreasing stimulus coherence (P 50. 008). To assess the neural correl-ates of these effects we focused on the responses of primary visual cortex and the middle temporal area, critical in the early visual processing of motion signals, as well as a region in the intraparietal sulcus thought to be involved in perceptual decision-making. The behavioural results were mirrored in both primary visual cortex and the middle temporal area, with a greate...|$|R

In this study, we examined the effects of two factors on perceived simultaneity in a visuo-haptic task scenario: active (self-generated) motor control and additional visual motion feedback. We used a psychophysical method to measure the differences in points of subjective simultaneity (PSSs) and just noticeable differ-ences (JNDs) in visuo-haptic events.

40|$|When human {{observers}} {{are exposed to}} even slight motion signals followed by brief visual transients—stimuli containing no detectable coherent motion signals—they perceive large and salient illusory jumps. This novel effect, which we call “high phi”, challenges well-entrenched assumptions about the perception of motion, namely the minimal-motion principle and the breakdown of <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception</b> with steps above an upper limit. Our experiments with transients such as texture randomization or contrast reversal show that {{the magnitude of the}} jump depends on spatial frequency and transient duration, but not on the speed of the inducing motion signals, and the direction of the jump depends on the duration of the inducer. Jump magnitude is robust across jump directions and different types of transient. In addition, when a texture is actually displaced by a large step beyond dmax, a breakdown of <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception</b> is expected, but in the presence of an inducer observers again perceive coherent displacements at or just above dmax. In sum, across a large variety of stimuli, we find that when incoherent motion noise is preceded by a small bias, instead of perceiving little or no motion, as suggested by the minimal-motion principle, observers perceive jumps whose amplitude closely follows their own dmax limits...|$|R

40|$|<b>Coherent</b> <b>perception</b> {{of objects}} in our {{environment}} often requires perceptual integration of auditory and visual information. Recent behavioral data suggest that audiovisual integration depends on attention. The current study investigated the neural basis of audiovisual integration using 3 -Tesla {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in 12 healthy volunteers during attention to auditory or visual features, or audiovisual feature combinations of abstract stimuli (simultaneous harmonic sounds and colored circles). Audiovisual attention was found to modulate activity in the same frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortical regions as auditory and visual attention. In addition, attention to audiovisual feature combinations produced stronger activity in the superior temporal cortices than attention to only auditory or visual features. These modality-specific areas might be involved in attention-dependent perceptual binding of synchronous auditory and visual events into coherent audiovisual objects. Furthermore, the modality-specific temporal auditory and occipital visual cortical areas showed attention-related modulations during both auditory and visual attention tasks.

Performance of the simple motion discrimination task was significantly depressed by TMS stimulation, and highly correlated within observers in TMS conditions, but there was no significant decrement in performance of the biological motion task, despite low intra-observer correlations across TMS conditions. We conclude that extrastriate area MT+/V 5 is an obligatory waypoint in the neural processing of simple coherent motion, but is not obligatory for the processing of biological motion.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the ophthalmological characteristics and {{to evaluate the}} magnocellular function in Russian orphanage children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Methods: In the study 100 children aged 10 - 16 from Russian (St Petersburg) orphanages were examined: 50 with FAS and 50 control children. In the first study all 100 children were tested with distant visual acuity with subjective optimal correction (VA; Sivtsev chart), skiascopy, visual inspection for FAS external ocular features, biomicroscopy, eye alignment using cover test and indirect ophthalmoscopy. In the second study 89 children from above groups (49 with FAS and 40 controls) {{were included in the}} study. A <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception</b> test was used. The test consisted of 150 white moving dots on a black background presented in different signal-to-noise ratio conditions. The task was direction detection of the coherently moving dots whose percentage decreased at each step of the test. Results: All analyzed parameters were worse in children with FAS compared with controls. FAS children showed a higher incidence of amblyopia, hyperopia, astigmatism and anisometropia. In FAS children the incidence of blepharophimosis was 34 % (8 % in controls), epicantus 14 % (2 % in controls), telecantus 32 % (compared to 4 % in controls), eye-lid ptosis 9 % (none in controls) and strabismus 26 % (10 % in controls). Ophthalmoscopy revealed a tilted optic disc in five FAS-children (7 %) compared with none in controls. In the Motion perception test {{a significant difference between the}} two groups was found (p = 0. 018). Children with FAS had lower <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception</b> ability in all the signal-to-noise ratio conditions. A significant difference between difficulty levels (p < 0. 001) was found for all subjects in both groups – decreasing the stimulus signal-to-noise level decreased the motion perception score. In both groups, the motion perception score differed for vertical and horizontal stimuli (p = 0. 003) with better performance for vertical stimuli. Conclusion: Russian FAS children show a higher incidence of structural and functional visual problems that needs to be taken into account and demands participation of the ophthalmologist in monitoring of those patients. Impaired motion perception in FAS children could be indicative of a magnocellular pathway developmental dysfunction resulting from alcohol brain damage...|$|R

In a temporal two-interval forced-choice paradigm we used a direction discrimination task to investigate the effect of varying the temporal and spatial characteristics of the Fourier components and pattern contrast on the probability of <b>coherent</b> motion <b>perception.</b> Agreement across observers regarding the conditions required for coherent motion was excellent using this more objective method. We find that patterns do not produce coherent motion when presented at contrast threshold, irrespective of how similar the Fourier components are. We also confirm that when the temporal frequency, spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings are sufficiently similar, observers report the direction of motion indicating coherent motion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coherent</b> visual <b>perception</b> necessitates {{the ability}} to track {{distinct}} objects as the same entities over time and motion. Calculations of such object persistence appear to be fairly automatic and constrained by specific rules. We explore the nature of object persistence here within the object-file framework; object files are mid-level visual representations that track entities over time and motion as the same persisting objects and store and update information about the objects. We present three new findings. First, objects files are constrained by the principle of ‘‘boundedness’’; persisting entities shouldmaintain a single closed contour. Second, object files are constrained by the principle of ‘‘containment’’; all the parts and properties of a persisting object should reside within, and be connected to, the object itself. Third, object files {{are sensitive to the}} context in which an object appears; the very same physical entity that can instantiate object-file formation in one experimental context cannot in another. This contextual influence demon-strates {{for the first time that}} object files are sensitive to more than just the physical properties contained within any given visual display...|$|R
40|$|If the Fourier {{components}} of a moving plaid have similar temporal frequency, spatial frequency and contrast, coherent motion is perceived according to subjective judgements. We have devised a more objective method of determining the conditions required for coherent motion. Moving plaid stimuli were created with one stationary component. Plaids with a stationary component always have a single perceived direction of motion, which {{is determined by the}} presence or absence of coherent motion.
