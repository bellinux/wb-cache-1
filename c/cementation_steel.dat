50|$|The {{cementation}} process, {{which was}} lost {{from the end}} of the Roman to the early Medieval period, continued in the same way with brass. Brass production increased during the medieval period due to a better understanding of the technology behind it. Furthermore, the process for carrying out cementation for brass did not change greatly until the 19th century. However, during this period a vast and highly important technological innovation happened using the cementation process, the production of steel. Steel production using iron and carbon works in the same way as brass with the iron metal being mixed with carbon to produce steel. The first examples of <b>cementation</b> <b>steel</b> is wootz steel from India (Craddock 1995: p276), where the crucibles were filled with the good quality wrought iron and carbon in the form of organics such as leaves, wood etc. However, no charcoal was used within the crucible. These early crucibles would only produce a small amount of steel as they would have to be broken once the process has finished.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} materials of various types and characteristics used for gear production, depending on gear function procurement possibilities and available technology. The most used materials for gear box production are structural steel, heat-treatable steel and <b>cementation</b> <b>steel.</b> The effect of material quality and its properties on gears will be presented through calculation of gear load capacity, in cases when gears are made of <b>cementation</b> <b>steel</b> and heat-treateble steel. Besides requirements related to material quality there are also requirements posed for gears teeth quality. Choice of gear theeth quality, although has a large influence on load capacity, has {{to be related to}} costs, and also technical and technological production capacities. An influence of material quality and gear teeth quality presented in this paper will be analysed exclusively from gear load capacity aspect. Key words: quality of materials, quality of gear teeth, gear load capacity. 1. AN INFLUENCE OF GEOMETRICAL CHARACTERISTICS A simple one level gear train, which is defined with a center distance ''a' ' and gear's ratio ''in' ' can be realised kinematically with different basic parameters (mn, β, z 1, z 2, x 1, x 2) in domain of previously defined boundary values of diametral pitch mn, deviation of gear ratio Δimax i Δimin, an angle of slope of tooth curve βmax i βmin and a profile displacement factor xmax i xmin, beeing in a correlation dependance. With change in one or more basic parameters several other parameters, which are in correlation, must be changed automatically. Uporedni pregled nosivosti parova zupčanik...|$|E

50|$|The {{strength}} and hardness of iron increases with {{the concentration of}} phosphorus. 0.05% phosphorus in wrought iron makes it as hard as medium carbon steel. High phosphorus iron can also be hardened by cold hammering. The hardening effect is true for any concentration of phosphorus. The more phosphorus, the harder the iron becomes and the more it can be hardened by hammering. Modern steel makers can increase hardness {{by as much as}} 30%, without sacrificing shock resistance by maintaining phosphorus levels between 0.07 and 0.12%. It also increases the depth of hardening due to quenching, {{but at the same time}} also decreases the solubility of carbon in iron at high temperatures. This would decrease its usefulness in making blister <b>steel</b> (<b>cementation),</b> where the speed and amount of carbon absorption is the overriding consideration.|$|R

The present work {{is devoted}} {{research}} of influence of various modes of electrolytic-plasma cementation on feature of change a structurally-phase conditions and hardening of a constructional steel 30 CrMnSi. It is chosen scientifically proved low-power and resources-economy a processing kind {{which leads to}} formation stable ferrite-perlites structures, provides higher mechanical properties. Cementation process carried out with selection of different modes of electrolytic-plasma processing in the electrolyte containing water solution of 10 % of sodium carbonate and 10 % of glycerin. As the basic methods of research in work we used metallographic the analysis with microscope application «NEOPHOT- 21 », X-ray analysis on diffractometer Х’PertPRO in monochromatic CrKα- radiation, tests for microhardness for device PMT- 3. It is established that a microstructure of samples steel 30 CrMnSi at different modes of processing consist from α- phases, particle carbides and retained austenite. Microhardness of the initial sample makes approximately 3000 МPа, and after processing its microhardness makes 6100 МPа that speaks about of a processing mode. The developed technology of electrolytic-plasma <b>cementation</b> of constructional <b>steels</b> in {{the conditions of the}} arc category in electrolyte is the optimal as provides reliable quality and demanded properties of details, working in variable loadings and often exposed to wear, forms the strengthened, modified surface coating...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} study was {{conducted}} to compare the retentive strengths of zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate and glass ionomer cements using Instron universal testing machine. Thirty preformed and pretrimmed stainless steel crowns were used for cementation on 30 extracted human primary molars which were divided into three groups of 10 teeth in each group. Then the teeth were stored in artificial saliva and incubated at 37 &# 176;C for 24 h. A load was applied on to the crown and was gradually increased till the crown showed dislodgement, and then the readings were recorded using Instron recorder and analyzed for statistical significance. The surface area of crown was measured by graphical method. The retentive strength was expressed in terms of kg/cm 2, which was calculated by the equation load divided by area. Retentive strengths of zinc phosphate (ranged from a minimum of 16. 93 to amaximum of 28. 13 kg/cm 2 with mean of 21. 28 kg/cm 2) and glass ionomer cement (minimum of 13. 69 - 28. 15 kg/cm 2 with mean of 20. 69 kg/cm 2) were greater than that of polycarboxylate cement (minimum of 13. 26 - 22. 69 kg/cm 2 with mean of 16. 79 kg/cm 2). Negligible difference (0. 59 kg/cm 2) of retentive strength was observed between zinc phosphate (21. 28 kg/cm 2) and glass ionomer cements (20. 69 kg/cm 2). Glass ionomer cements can be recommended for <b>cementation</b> of stainless <b>steel</b> crowns because of its advantages and the retentive strength was almost similar to that of zinc phosphate cement...|$|R
