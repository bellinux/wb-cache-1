Spreaders are usually swept rearwards approximately in line of the side stay between the hounds and the <b>chain</b> <b>plate.</b> They help hold the mast straight (in column) when under heavy load such as when carrying a spinnaker on a tight reach.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship was}} at least 14 metres long and {{contained}} a beam 3 metres in width. Clinker built with riveted construction, the rivets were spaced at intervals of approximately 140 millimetres {{and according to the}} watercolour painting, there were nine strakes a side. The rivets are of usual Anglo-Saxon style, being composed of iron and having domed heads and diamond roves. Excavators also uncovered fragments of a metal strip, at least 300 millimetres in length, which was vertically riveted to the outside of the hull. Filmer-Sankey noted that this could be interpreted as a <b>chain</b> <b>plate</b> that held the shrouds of a mast.|$|E
50|$|Rigging- wire or rod {{used to hold}} up a mast. Since the 1960s {{stainless}} steel wire has become universal in the developed world. Elsewhere galvanized wire or even rope may be used because of its availability and cheapness.3 types of {{stainless steel}} wire are commonly used. Type 1 x 19 is a non-flexible wire used for standing rigging such as stays. Type 7 x 7 is a semi flexible wire used for luff wires in sails, halyards (sometimes plastic coated) trapeze wires and light halyards. Type 7 x 19 is used for all halyards, wire sheets, vangs and strops that must run through a pulley (sheave). The common way of attaching wire is to form a small loop at the end which is fixed in place by clamping a soft metal swage over the free ends. Talurite is a common brand of swagging. The wire loop is then fastened to a rigging screw with a bow shackle to the <b>chain</b> <b>plate.</b> Kevlar rope is sometimes used in place of wire in small sailboats.|$|E

Therefore the friction in X-ring chain does not increase much when pressure is applied by the <b>chain</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R

40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, bush, pin and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are press fitted with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an offset plate as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an offset plate, the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an offset plate. The holes in the offset plate are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape <b>chain</b> <b>plate.</b> A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the <b>chain</b> <b>plate</b> as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable.

However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations.

25|$|The X-ring {{chain is}} {{developed}} from O-ring chain {{which in turn}} is developed from non O-ring chain. While the regular O-ring chain has high durability, it also has more friction(compared to other types of roller chain) due to distortion of the O-ring due to pressure from the inner and outer <b>chain</b> <b>plates.</b> This results in loss of power in the transmission. Therefore, X-ring chain was developed by replacing O-ring seal with X-ring seal which increased durability and greatly reduced friction.|$|R

In {{order to}} apply silent chain on conveyor, double-pitch {{time-sharing}} meshing silent chain is proposed, and by comparing with traditional silent chain with same pitch, the self-weight 20 %~ 30 % of this chain is reduced.
