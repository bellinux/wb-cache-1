Scully arrives with a key <b>chain</b> <b>bearing</b> the insignia of an investment company that uses astrology to make financial predictions, taken from the doll collector's body - the same key chain was found on two of the other dead fortunetellers.

He says that Mulder and Scully {{will not be able to}} talk to Dukenfield though, because he has been murdered.|$|E

40|$|Adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) {{gene therapy}} vectors require {{protection}} against antibodies, complement proteins and blood cells {{if they are}} to be delivered intravenously to treat metastatic disease. Such protection can be achieved by chemically modifying Ad 5 with polymers based on hydrophilic HPMA. Here, such polymers were designed to include side <b>chains</b> <b>bearing</b> reactive carbonyl thiazolidine- 2 -thione groups (TTs) to covalently modify available amino groups of the lysine residues in the Ad 5 capsid. Furthermore, the inclusion of side <b>chains</b> <b>bearing</b> positively charged quaternary ammonium groups (QAs) was designed to improve electrostatic interaction of the polymers with negatively charged Ad 5 hexon protein. Finally, to enable triggered uncoating and reactivation of the Ad 5, either the TTs or both the TTs and the QAs were linked to polymer backbone via reductively degradable disulfide bonds. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that these polymers covalently modified Ad 5 capsid proteins in a reduction reversible manner. In infection studies, polymers containing QAs prevented binding of coagulation factor X to Ad 5. Furthermore, the antibody and complement mediated binding of Ad 5 to erythrocytes was reduced by such polymers (> 95 % without polymer, 25 % following coating). These data indicate that coating Ad 5 therapeutics with such polymers will improve blood circulation half-life and deposition at disease sites...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{accumulation}} of pre-PhoS {{under conditions of}} PhoS overproduction has been previously described. It is now demonstrated that during the induction of PhoS, a delay in the completion of polypeptide chain elongation can be detected. This delay {{is related to the}} extent of jamming of export sites by pre-PhoS or by other exported proteins. These results suggest that a component required for completion of pre-PhoS polypeptide becomes limiting, being titrated by the excess of nascent <b>chains</b> <b>bearing</b> signal peptides. This component thus probably acts at an early step in the export pathway...|$|R

Further modification of the free amino groups with 1, 4 -difluoro- 9, 10 -anthraquinone (DFA) yields red-colored oligomeric anthraquinone dyes.
