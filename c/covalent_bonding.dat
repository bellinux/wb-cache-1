5|$|<b>Covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.|$|E
5|$|The +4 {{oxidation}} state dominates titanium chemistry, but compounds in the +3 {{oxidation state}} are also common. Commonly, titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a notable exception. Because {{of its high}} oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit {{a high degree of}} <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding.</b> Unlike most other transition metals, simple aquo Ti(IV) complexes are unknown.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding.</b> In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E

50|$|Covalent, which {{generally}} forms between two nonmetals. Examples include nitrogen dioxide. Electrons in a <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> are essentially shared between the constituent atoms. There are {{several types of}} covalent bonds: in polar <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds,</b> electrons {{are more likely to}} be found around one of the two atoms, whereas in nonpolar <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds,</b> electrons are evenly shared. Homonuclear diatomic molecules are pure covalent. The polarity of a <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> is determined by the electronegativities of each atom, and a polar <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> usually creates a dipole moment.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are also}} {{affected}} by the electronegativity of the connected atoms which determines the chemical polarity of the bond. Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make nonpolar <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> such as H–H. An unequal relationship creates a polar <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> such as with H−Cl. [...] However polarity also requires geometric asymmetry, or else dipoles may cancel out resulting in a non-polar molecule.|$|R
5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} {{as a type of}} <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are free to move as well as the ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible {{competitive}} antagonists also involve {{competition between}} the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist. For some antagonist, {{there may be a}} distinct period during which they behave competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, there may be a shift in the log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} insulators, diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> and low phonon scattering. Thermal conductivity of natural diamond {{was measured to be}} about 2200W/(m·K), which is five times more than copper. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest thermal conductivity of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating. At lower temperatures conductivity becomes even better, and reaches 41000W/(m·K) at 104K (12C-enriched diamond).|$|E
50|$|An even {{nominal mass}} {{indicates}} that a net even number of <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> have been broken or formed and an even number of nitrogen atoms are present, or that a net odd number of <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> have been broken or formed and an odd number of nitrogen atoms are present.

5000|$|Count up {{the number}} of {{electrons}} in the atom's [...] "circle." [...] Since the circle cuts the <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> [...] "in half," [...] each <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> counts as one electron instead of two.|$|R
5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} boron {{is dominated by}} its small atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E
5|$|Within the Solar System, the nucleon {{fraction}} of xenon is , for {{an abundance of}} approximately one part in 630thousand of the total mass. Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun's atmosphere, on Earth, and in asteroids and comets. The abundance of xenon in the atmosphere of planet Jupiter is unusually high, about 2.6 {{times that of the}} Sun. This abundance remains unexplained, but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals—small, subplanetary bodies—before the heating of the presolar disk. (Otherwise, xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices.) The problem of the low terrestrial xenon may be explained by <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> of xenon to oxygen within quartz, reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|In the {{molecule}} , the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding.</b> Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities. Thus, <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> {{does not necessarily}} require that the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable electronegativity. <b>Covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> that entails sharing of electrons over more than two atoms {{is said to be}} delocalized.|$|E
40|$|This review {{summarizes}} {{the use of}} orthogonal dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> to build functional systems. Dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> are unique because of their dual nature. They can be as labile as non-covalent interactions or as permanent as <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds,</b> depending on conditions. Examples from nature, reaching from the role of disulfides in protein folding to thioester exchange in polyketide biosynthesis, indicate how dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> are best used in functional systems. Several synthetic functional systems that employ a single type of dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> have been reported. Considering that most functional systems make simultaneous use of several types of non-covalent interactions together, one would expect the literature to contain many examples in which different types of dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> are similarly used in tandem. However, the incorporation of orthogonal dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> into functional systems is a surprisingly rare and recent development. This review {{summarizes the}} available material comprehensively, covering a remarkably diverse collection of functions. However, probably more revealing than the specific functions addressed is that the questions asked are consistently quite unusual, very demanding and highly original, focusing on molecular systems that can self-sort, self-heal, adapt, exchange, replicate, transcribe, or even walk and “think” (logic gates). This focus on adventurous chemistry {{off the beaten track}} supports the promise that with orthogonal dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> we can ask questions that otherwise cannot be asked. The broad range of functions and concepts covered should appeal to the supramolecular organic chemist but also to the broader community...|$|R
50|$|In a polar <b>covalent</b> <b>bond,</b> {{one or more}} {{electrons}} are unequally shared {{between two}} nuclei. <b>Covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> often result {{in the formation of}} small collections of better-connected atoms called molecules, which in solids and liquids are bound to other molecules by forces that are often much weaker than the <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> that hold the molecules internally together. Such weak intermolecular bonds give organic molecular substances, such as waxes and oils, their soft bulk character, and their low melting points (in liquids, molecules must cease most structured or oriented contact with each other). When <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> link long chains of atoms in large molecules, however (as in polymers such as nylon), or when <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> extend in networks through solids that are not composed of discrete molecules (such as diamond or quartz or the silicate minerals in many types of rock) then the structures that result may be both strong and tough, at least in the direction oriented correctly with networks of <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds.</b> Also, the melting points of such covalent polymers and networks increase greatly.|$|R
50|$|In dynamic <b>covalent</b> {{chemistry}} <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are broken}} and formed in a reversible reaction under thermodynamic control. While <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are key to}} the process, the system is directed by noncovalent forces to form the lowest energy structures.|$|R

25|$|Chemically, {{they are}} characterised—to varying degrees—by <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> tendencies, acid-base amphoterism and the {{formation}} of anionic species such as aluminates, stannates, and bismuthates (in the case of aluminium, tin, and bismuth, respectively). They can also form Zintl phases (half-metallic compounds formed between highly electropositive metals and moderately electronegative metals or metalloids).|$|E
25|$|What is in most respects {{a purely}} {{covalent}} structure can support metallic delocalization of electrons; metallic carbon nanotubes are one example. Transition metals and intermetallic compounds based on transition metals can exhibit mixed metallic and <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding,</b> resulting in high shear strength, low ductility, and elevated melting points; {{a classic example}} is tungsten.|$|E
50|$|Transition metal {{complexes}} {{are generally}} bound by coordinate <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds.</b> For example, the ion Ag+ reacts as a Lewis acid with two molecules of the Lewis base NH3 {{to form the}} complex ion Ag(NH3)2+, which has two Ag←N coordinate <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hardness: Very hard, due to {{the strong}} <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> {{throughout}} the lattice (deformation can be easier, however, in directions {{that do not require}} the breaking of any <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds,</b> as with flexing or sliding of sheets in graphite or mica).|$|R
50|$|If a free {{electron}} with a sufficient energy strikes a silicon atom, it can break the <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> of silicon and liberate an electron from the <b>covalent</b> <b>bond.</b> If the electron liberated gains energy {{by being in}} an electric field and liberates other electrons from other <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> then this process can cascade very quickly into a chain reaction producing {{a large number of}} electrons and a large current flow. This phenomenon is called impact avalanche.|$|R
25|$|The idea of <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> can {{be traced}} several years to Gilbert N. Lewis, who in 1916 {{described}} the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. He introduced the so-called Lewis notation or electron dot notation or The Lewis Dot Structure in which valence electrons are represented as dots around the atomic symbols.|$|E
25|$|Parish writes that, 'as anticipated', the {{borderline}} metals of groups 13 and 14 have non-standard structures. Gallium, indium, thallium, germanium, and tin are specifically {{mentioned in this}} context. The group 12 metals are also noted as having slightly distorted structures; this has been interpreted as evidence of weak directional (i.e. <b>covalent)</b> <b>bonding.</b>|$|E
25|$|Certain {{molecules}} such as xenon difluoride and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} have higher co-ordination numbers {{than would be}} possible due to strictly <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> according to the octet rule. This is explained by the three-center four-electron bond ("3c–4e") model which interprets the molecular wavefunction in terms of non-bonding highest occupied molecular orbitals in molecular orbital theory and ionic-covalent resonance in valence bond theory.|$|E
50|$|A {{coordinate}} <b>covalent</b> <b>bond,</b> {{also known}} as a dative bond or coordinate bond is a kind of 2-center, 2-electron <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> in which the two electrons derive from the same atom. The bonding of metal ions to ligands involves this kind of interaction.|$|R
50|$|In an HF {{molecule}} the <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> {{is formed}} by the overlap of the 1s orbital of H and the 2pz orbital of F, each containing an unpaired electron. Mutual sharing of electrons between H and F results in a <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> in HF.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{electrons}} forming simple and multiple <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> {{may have different}} contribu-tions to the interatomic interactions due to the degeneracy of electron states. A simple relationship between the length of <b>covalent</b> <b>bond,</b> its order and atomic numbers of the interacting atoms is de-duced...|$|R
25|$|A {{covalent}} bond, {{also called}} a molecular bond, is a chemical bond {{that involves the}} sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding.</b> For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain {{the equivalent of a}} full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration.|$|E
25|$|While {{the idea}} of shared {{electron}} pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding,</b> quantum mechanics is needed {{to understand the nature}} of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond (molecular hydrogen) in 1927. Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the atomic orbitals of participating atoms.|$|E
25|$|Covalent and ionic bonding form a continuum, with ionic {{character}} increasing {{with increasing}} {{difference in the}} electronegativity of the participating atoms. <b>Covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> corresponds to sharing {{of a pair of}} electrons between two atoms of essentially equal electronegativity (for example, C–C and C–H bonds in aliphatic hydrocarbons). As bonds become more polar, they become increasingly ionic in character. Metal oxides vary along the iono-covalent spectrum. The Si–O bonds in quartz, for example, are polar yet largely covalent, and are considered to be of mixed character.|$|E
