500|$|On September 22, 1851, Minot was in {{a parked}} {{passenger}} train at Turner Station. He glanced {{out the window of}} the train and saw the new telegraph wires. Departing the train, Minot ran into the station, got on the new telegraph, and wired the next station along the line, Monroe, to see if the eastbound train to Piermont-on-Hudson had gone past. The station agent said no. At that point, Minot ordered the engineer of the train to proceed on their way to Goshen. The engineer refused to take Minot's order, and instead, Minot got into the cab car himself and drove the train himself to Port Jervis, hours ahead of the planned scheduled time of arrival. This was the second of the several [...] "firsts" [...] the Erie Railroad created in its time, along with the shipment of milk by rail at Chester station in 1842. The use of the telegraph and Minot's system remained until 1888, when a new system of block signaling, developed by the competitor Pennsylvania Railroad, helped expand Minot's use of telecommunications to <b>control</b> <b>rail</b> traffic.|$|E

50|$|Sealand was {{the final}} station on the former Chester & Connah's Quay Railway between Chester Northgate and Hawarden Bridge. Services also passed through this station before joining the North Wales and Liverpool Railway. Located 200 m west of the A550 near RAF Sealand, the station was just before a {{triangular}} junction at Dee marshes which <b>controlled</b> <b>rail</b> services from North Wales, Liverpool and Cheshire.|$|R
50|$|Railroads Illustrated was {{originally}} published as CTC Board (ISSN 0164-8373), a monthly magazine devoted to railroad photography, rail industry and tourist railroad news, and historical articles, from 1970 to 2006. The magazine's name {{referred to the}} centralized traffic control displays used by train dispatchers to <b>control</b> <b>rail</b> traffic across a given territory. The magazine's well-known cover logo was an Alaska Railroad F-unit.|$|E
50|$|Power was {{supplied}} at 500 V AC {{to power}} the train, via a sheathed conductor below the running plate of the track. A <b>control</b> <b>rail</b> was also provided for train control, and a generator provided to clear trains from the track in emergencies. The train control and maintenance facility is located between Convention and Paddy's Market stations, where a traverser moved trains {{in and out of}} service.|$|E
50|$|In December 2011, Network Rail began {{construction}} of a rail operating centre at Three Bridges, one of 14 countrywide intended to replace several hundred signalboxes; the Three Bridges centre was built to <b>control</b> <b>rail</b> operations in the Sussex area. The facility was constructed by C. Spencer Ltd, and was expected to employ around 600 people, with a 900-person net job benefit once complete. The facility was officially opened in January 2014.|$|E

Ashford IECC still controls the UK stretch of the Eurotunnel Rail Link (HS1/CTRL).|$|R
50|$|In late 2003, Chessie {{successor}} CSX Transportation finally undertook the renovation. The project included extensive {{work on the}} miter rails, {{the mechanisms}} that allow the rails to be connected and disconnected as the bridge is opened and closed. Because the bridge could not be opened during construction, close coordination was required between the contractors; CSX, which <b>controlled</b> <b>rail</b> traffic; and the U.S. Coast Guard, which controlled marine traffic. The rehabilitation was completed on time in May 2004.|$|R
50|$|Toward {{the south}} end of the {{platforms}} are two stairs leading to the only mezzanine in the station. It has been renovated with stainless steel fare <b>control</b> <b>rails</b> and features red accent stripes in the IND style. Old wall lights exist but are not functional. The waiting area inside fare control has windows that allow a full view of the platforms and tracks. The northern half of the station without the mezzanine has very high ceilings.|$|R
50|$|George Lawson, Federal Minister for Transport in 1942, was {{responsible}} for the administration of the National Security Act (1942) and Regulations. These gave the Commonwealth full power and authority to <b>control</b> <b>rail</b> and road transport and do all things necessary to give effect to the regulations. This included provision for setting up the Commonwealth Land Transport Board (CLTB) which was charged with giving effect to the regulations and directing what rail and road transport services should be maintained and the terms and conditions of operation. The CLTB was also responsible for the acquisition, by purchase or manufacture, of any required vehicles and accessories and to operate and use them and determine routes and priorities of transport.|$|E
5000|$|After {{initially}} decreasing by over half, rail subsidies spiralled {{after the}} Hatfield rail crash in 2000. In 1994, the total government support received by British Rail was £1,627m, (£2,168m in 2005 terms, adjusted by RPI), while in 2005, government support from all sources totalled £4,593m. Once the extra safety investment after the Hatfield crash had finished, subsidies {{have since been}} brought under <b>control.</b> <b>Rail</b> subsidies have increased from £bn in 1992-93 to £bn in 2015-16 (in current prices), although subsidy per journey has fallen from £ per journey to £ per journey.

50|$|The Newtown Railroad was {{chartered}} on April 2, 1860, as the Philadelphia & Montgomery County Railroad Company. The Newtown's {{early history}} {{was a part}} of the competition to <b>control</b> <b>rail</b> traffic between New York City and Philadelphia. By the 1860s, there were two lines running between Philadelphia and New York by the New Jersey Rail Road and Transportation Company (NJRR) and the Camden & Amboy Railroad (C&A). On February 1, 1867, the C&A and NJRR were informally joined as the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Companies (UNJ). The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) approved a lease of the UNJ on May 15, 1871, and the UNJ approved May 19. The lease was made December 1 and the PRR began operating the UNJ that day. The PRR thereby established a monopoly on New York-Philadelphia rail traffic.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we use {{simulation}} {{as a method of}} inquiry to support rail infrastructure control designers in making more effective decisions during the design process. Limitations encountered in commercial simulation tools when modeling rail system elements, are related to the choice of just one formalism (discrete or continuous) to model the element behavior. When supporting the design of rail system <b>control,</b> <b>rail</b> controllers and rail control designers might be in different locations. Therefore distribution of the simulation model is a required feature which is usually not possible in current simulation environments. In order to more accurately represent rail systems behavior and improve the effectiveness of control design, we propose a simulation library where different formalisms can be integrated in one single model and where simulation components are accessible by users in different locations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{vibration}} isolation performance of floating floor and floating box structures to <b>control</b> <b>rail</b> vibration transmission. Simple theoretical and experimental methods are developed {{to analyze the}} effects of stiffener beam, mass and arrangement of isolator on the fundamental natural frequency of the flexural vibration of floating floor and box structure. The vibration reduction performances of floating floor and box structure {{are found to be}} degraded by flexural vibration of the floor or supporting stiffener beam. From the results of vibration measurements; stiffener beams increase the fundamental natural frequency of flexural vibration of floating floor and enhance vibration isolation. Also they can further alleviate the effect of flexural vibration using optimum isolator arrangement effectively. The proposed floating box design achieved a vibration reduction of 15 - 30 dB in frequency region of critical rail vibration (30 - 200 Hz). Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The Class 1 {{heavy haul}} railroads of North America are using rail {{grinding}} best practices to ensure maximum returns on their investment in rail to their shareholders. AREMA Committee 4, Sub Committee 9, focus group consists of rail grinding managers responsible for implementing rail grinding best practice in North America. This group {{has issued a}} survey and gathered together the most recent knowledge of rail grinding best practices for the AREMA manual. This will provide railways worldwide a guideline {{for the implementation of}} a preventive grinding strategy with the supporting economic justification. The most important reason for grinding in North America today is to <b>control</b> <b>rail</b> surface fatigue defects. The best way to control these defects is by preventive grinding and having in place a proper lubrication strategy. For preventive grinding to be successful a railroad must have engineered rail profiles ground onto the rail to reduce the wheel / rail contact stress. These rail profiles will significantly increase rail life, improve train stability and curving. Rail corrugations will be in control, however if they are presen...|$|E
40|$|Since its inception, {{just after}} the Second World War, {{ergonomics}} research has paid {{special attention to the}} issues surrounding human control of systems. Command and Control environments continue to represent a challenging domain for Ergonomics research. We take a broad view of Command and Control research, to include C 2 (Command and Control), C 3 (Command, Control and Communication), and C 4 (Command, Control, Communication and Computers) as well as human supervisory control paradigms. This special issue of ERGONOMICS aims to present state-of-the-art research into models of team performance, evaluation of novel interaction technologies, case studies, methodologies and theoretical review papers. We are pleased to present papers that detail research on these topics in domains as diverse as the emergency services (e. g., police, fire, and ambulance), civilian applications (e. g., air traffic <b>control,</b> <b>rail</b> networks, and nuclear power) and military applications (e. g., land, sea and air) of command and control.

40|$|This {{research}} {{study focused on}} the effect of using damping chamber elements made from waste tires on railway noise reduction. First, the energy absorption characteristics of damping chamber elements with various gradation combinations and compaction indices were measured in the laboratory using compression testing. The laboratory compression results demonstrated that the optimal gradation combination of damping chamber elements is as follows: the content of fine rubber particles is 10 %, the content of coarse granules is 90 %, and the optimal compaction index is 0. 98. Next, the findings from the laboratory compression-test studies were used to produce damping chamber elements that were applied to a full-scale modern track model in the laboratory. The measurements of the dynamic properties indicated that the damping chamber elements could significantly reduce the vibration levels of the rail head. Finally, the damping chamber elements, which had been proven effective through laboratory dynamic tests, were widely applied to test rail sections in the field. The field tests demonstrated that damping chamber elements can significantly increase the track vibration decay rate in the frequency range of 200 – 10000 [*]Hz. Therefore, damping chamber elements made from waste tires are able to <b>control</b> <b>rail</b> vibration and noise in modern tram track systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Currently, <b>rail</b> <b>control</b> {{designers}} {{are looking for}} innovative types of control strategies {{in order to make}} rail infrastructures more robust, more reliable, and more efficient. Control {{designers are}} focusing on more flexible control strategies {{in order to keep the}} system performance stable when non planned situations occurs. Applying new <b>control</b> strategies to <b>rail</b> infrastructures is difficult, because strategies cannot be fully assessed for their quality before implementation. Existing testing tools normally only assess the strategy itself and do not consider its impact on the whole system, nor do they assess the impact of the system on the strategy.
