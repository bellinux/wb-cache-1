5|$|Large-scale {{economic}} issues {{played a role}} in the decline of the maritime fur trade and the China trade in general. Before the 19th century, Chinese demand for Western raw materials or manufactured goods was small, but bullion (also known as specie) was accepted, resulting in a general drain of precious metals from the West to China. The situation reversed in the early 19th century for a variety of reasons. Western demand for Chinese goods declined relative to new options (for example, <b>coffee</b> <b>from</b> the West Indies began to replace tea in the United States), while Chinese demand for Western items increased, such as for English manufactures, American cotton goods, and opium which was outlawed but smuggled into China on a large and increasing scale. Before long, China was being drained of specie and saturated with Western goods. At the same time, intense speculation in the China trade by American and British merchant companies began. By the 1820s, too many firms were competing for an overstocked market, resulting in bankruptcies and consolidation. The inevitable commercial crisis struck in 1826–27, after the Panic of 1825. Tea prices plummeted and the China trade's volume collapsed by about a third. By this time, the old maritime fur trade on the Northwest Coast and the Old China Trade itself were dying. The final blow came with the depression of 1841–43, following the Panic of 1837.|$|E

50|$|Arabica coffee {{production}} in Indonesia began in 1699. Indonesian coffees, such as Sumatran and Java, {{are known for}} heavy body and low acidity. This makes them ideal for blending with the higher acidity <b>coffees</b> <b>from</b> Central America and East Africa.|$|R
25|$|Of the {{two main}} species grown, arabica <b>coffee</b> (<b>from</b> C. arabica) is {{generally}} more highly regarded than robusta <b>coffee</b> (<b>from</b> C. canephora); robusta tends to be bitter and have less flavor but better body than arabica. For these reasons, about three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is C. arabica. Robusta strains also contain about 40–50% more caffeine than arabica. Consequently, this species is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends. Good quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends to provide a full-bodied taste and a better foam head (known as crema).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present article is to investigate the importance of geographical indications (GIs) in the coffee market, particularly for Honduran coffees. Geographical indications for coffee have emerged only recently, {{and only a few}} scientific studies have been carried out on this topic so far. The present article addresses this lack of research by highlighting recent developments in the coffee market and by presenting the results of a hedonic price analysis that used internet auction data for specialty coffees. The aim of this analysis is to investigate the influence of the region of origin on the achieved auction price of Honduran specialty coffee, controlling for other coffee attributes. The results indicate that <b>coffees</b> <b>from</b> the region Marcala, for which a denomination of origin was established in 2005, possess on average a higher quality than coffees grown in other Honduran regions. Consequently, since quality is the most important price determinant in the internet auctions, <b>coffees</b> <b>from</b> Marcala achieve on average a higher price than <b>coffees</b> <b>from</b> other Honduran coffee-growing regions. However, the hypothesis that Marcala coffees can also achieve a higher price due to an already established reputation could not be confirmed.

Circa 1727, the King of Portugal sent Francisco de Melo Palheta to French Guiana to obtain coffee seeds {{to become a part of}} the coffee market. Francisco initially had difficulty obtaining these seeds, but he captivated the French Governor's wife and she sent him enough seeds and shoots to commence the coffee industry of Brazil.

25|$|Al-Madina Souq, {{as it is}} locally known, is {{an active}} trade centre for {{imported}} luxury goods, such as raw silk from Iran, spices and dyes from India, and <b>coffee</b> <b>from</b> Damascus. Souq al-Madina {{is also home to}} local products such as wool, agricultural products and soap. Most of the souqs date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on. Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in khans (caravanserais) and scattered in the souq. Other types of small market-places were called caeserias (ﻗﻴﺴﺎﺭﻳﺎﺕ). Caeserias are smaller than khans in their sizes and functioned as workshops for craftsmen. Most of the khans took their names after their location in the souq and function, and are characterized with their beautiful façades and entrances with fortified wooden doors.|$|E
25|$|Viennese cafés have an {{extremely}} long and distinguished history {{that dates back}} centuries, and the caffeine addictions of some famous historical patrons of the oldest are something of a local legend. These coffee houses are unique to Vienna and many cities have unsuccessfully sought to copy them. Some people consider cafés as their extended living room where nobody will be bothered if they spend hours reading a newspaper while enjoying their coffee. Traditionally, the coffee comes {{with a glass of}} water. Viennese cafés claim to have invented the process of filtering <b>coffee</b> <b>from</b> booty captured after the second Turkish siege in 1683. Viennese cafés claim that when the invading Turks left Vienna, they abandoned hundreds of sacks of coffee beans. The Polish King John III Sobieski, the commander of the anti-Turkish coalition of Poles, Germans, and Austrians, gave Franz George Kolschitzky (Polish – Franciszek Jerzy Kulczycki) some of this coffee as a reward for providing information that allowed him to defeat the Turks. Kolschitzky then opened Vienna's first coffee shop. Julius Meinl set up a modern roasting plant in the same premises where the coffee sacks were found, in 1891.|$|E

25|$|The {{precursor}} of the Folger Coffee Company {{was founded in}} 1850 in San Francisco, California, U.S., as the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. The owner, William H. Bovee, saw an opportunity to produce roasted and ground coffee ready for brewing. Before that, Californians had to purchase green coffee beans, and roast and grind them on their own. To help build his mill, Bovee hired James A. Folger as a carpenter. James had arrived from Nantucket Island {{at the age of}} 15 with his two older brothers during the California Gold Rush. In the 1850s, kerosene began to offer a cheaper alternative to whale oil, which had been Nantucket's life-blood, resulting in the re-purposing of many of its ships to bring <b>coffee</b> <b>from</b> South America to San Francisco. After working at Bovee’s mill for nearly a year, James had saved enough money to stake a claim in the company and headed out to mine for gold. He agreed to carry along samples of coffee and spices, taking orders from grocery stores along the way. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1865, James became a full partner of The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out the other partners and renamed the company to J.A. Folger & Co.|$|E
25|$|Coffee beans {{were first}} {{exported}} from Karachi to Yemen. Yemeni traders brought coffee {{back to their}} homeland and began to cultivate the bean. The word qahwa originally meant wine, and Sufis in Yemen used the beverage {{as an aid to}} concentration and as a kind of spiritual intoxication when they chanted the name of God. Sufis used it to keep themselves alert during their nighttime devotions. A translation of Al-Jaziri's manuscript traces the spread of <b>coffee</b> <b>from</b> Arabia Felix (the present day Yemen) northward to Mecca and Medina, and then to the larger cities of Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad, and Constantinople. By 1414, the beverage was known in Mecca, and in the early 1500s was spreading to the Mameluke Sultanate of Egypt and North Africa from the Yemeni port of Mocha. Associated with Sufism, a myriad of coffee houses grew up in Cairo (Egypt) around the religious University of the Azhar. These coffee houses also opened in Syria, especially in the cosmopolitan city of Aleppo, and then in Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, in 1554. In 1511, it was forbidden for its stimulating effect by conservative, orthodox imams at a theological court in Mecca. However, these bans were to be overturned in 1524 by an order of the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Suleiman I, with Grand Mufti Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi issuing a fatwa allowing the consumption of coffee. In Cairo, Egypt, a similar ban was instituted in 1532, and the coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee beans were sacked. During the 16th century, it had already reached the rest of the Middle East, the Safavid Empire and the Ottoman Empire. From the Middle East, coffee drinking spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, and coffee plants were transported by the Dutch to the East Indies and to the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{account for}} 8% to 12% of dried green coffee beans. A {{majority}} of the proteins are of the 11-S storage kind (alpha – component of 32 kDa, beta – component of 22 kDa), {{most of which are}} degraded to free amino acids during maturation of green coffee beans. Further, 11-S storage proteins are degraded to their individual amino acids under roasting temperature, thus are an additional source of bitter components due to generation of Maillard reaction products. High temperature and oxygen concentration and low pH degrade 11-S storage proteins of green coffee beans to low-molecular-weight peptides and amino acids. The degradation is accelerated in the presence of organic acids such as chlorogenic acids and their derivatives. Other proteins include enzymes, such as catalase and polyphenol oxidase, which are important for the maturation of green coffee beans. Mature coffee contains free amino acids (4.0mg amino acid/g robusta coffee and up to 4.5mg amino acid/g arabica coffee). In Coffea arabica, alanine is the amino acid with the highest concentration, i.e. 1.2mg/g, followed by asparagine of 0.66mg/g, whereas in C. robusta, alanine is present at a concentration of 0.8mg/g and asparagine at 0.36mg/g. The free hydrophobic amino acids in fresh green coffee beans contribute to the unpleasant taste, making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds. In fresh green <b>coffee</b> <b>from</b> Peru, these concentrations have been determined as: isoleucine 81mg/kg, leucine 100mg/kg, valine 93mg/kg, tyrosine 81mg/kg, phenylalanine 133mg/kg. The concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (a neurotransmitter) has been determined between 143mg/kg and 703mg/kg in green coffee beans from Tanzania. Roasted coffee beans do not contain any free amino acids; the amino acids in green coffee beans are degraded under roasting temperature to Maillard products (reaction products between the aldehyde group of sugar and the alpha-amino group of the amino acids). Further, diketopiperazines, e.g. cyclo(proline-proline), cyclo(proline-leucine), and cyclo(proline-isoleucine), are generated from the corresponding amino acids, and are the major source of the bitter taste of roasted coffee. The bitter flavor of diketopiperazines is perceptible at around 20mg/liter of water. The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30mg, which is responsible for its bitterness.|$|E
