5|$|Frequency {{estimates}} vary enormously. In 2015 it {{was estimated}} that 37.2 million people globally are affected. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1; combining the geometric mean ratio of 5:1 with a conservative prevalence estimate for autism of 1.3 per 1,000 suggests indirectly that the prevalence of AS might be around 0.26 per 1,000. Part of the variance in estimates arises from differences in diagnostic <b>criteria.</b> For example, a relatively small 2007 study of 5,484 eight-year-old children in Finland found 2.9 children per 1,000 met the ICD-10 <b>criteria</b> for an AS diagnosis, 2.7 per 1,000 for Gillberg and Gillberg <b>criteria,</b> 2.5 for DSM-IV, 1.6 for Szatmari et al., and 4.3 per 1,000 for the union of the four <b>criteria.</b> Boys seem to be more likely to have AS than girls; estimates of the sex ratio range from 1.6:1 to 4:1, using the Gillberg and Gillberg <b>criteria.</b> Females with autism spectrum disorders may be underdiagnosed.|$|E

50|$|Majority {{judgment}} voting {{satisfies the}} majority <b>criterion</b> for rated ballots, the mutual majority <b>criterion,</b> the monotonicity <b>criterion,</b> and the later-no-help <b>criterion.</b> By assuming that ratings are given independently of other candidates, it satisfies {{the independence of}} clones <b>criterion</b> and the independence of irrelevant alternatives <b>criterion,</b> but the latter <b>criterion</b> is incompatible with the majority <b>criterion</b> if voters shift their judgments in order to express their preferences between the available candidates.|$|R
50|$|The Nanson {{method and}} the Baldwin method satisfy the Condorcet criterion: since Borda always gives any {{existing}} Condorcet winner {{more than the}} average Borda points, the Condorcet winner will never be eliminated.

5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent response rate. The questionnaire used twenty <b>criteria</b> in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty <b>criteria</b> to the reader. Eight <b>criteria</b> are based on alumni responses; eleven <b>criteria</b> are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E
5|$|The ICD-10 <b>criteria</b> are {{typically}} used in European countries, while the DSM <b>criteria</b> {{are used in}} the United States and to varying degrees around the world, and are prevailing in research studies.

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's <b>Criteria</b> for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These <b>criteria</b> require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic <b>criteria</b> and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's <b>Criteria</b> as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E
