When Drake first wakes up, Tenzin leads him to Fisher and Schäfer. He is a Sherpa guide who leads Drake through the mountain passes surrounding the area. There, he helps Drake through various challenges that require more than one person to pass. Despite acting as a guide, Tenzin cannot speak any English. After returning, Drake and Tenzin find that the village has <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> by Lazarevic.|$|E
5|$|The midget {{submarine}} attacks and subsequent bombardments {{are among the}} best-known examples of Axis naval activity in Australian waters during World War II, and are the only occasion in history when either city has <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack.</b> The physical effects were slight: the Japanese had intended to destroy several major warships, but sank only an unarmed depot ship and failed to damage any significant targets during the bombardments. The main impact was psychological; creating popular fear of an impending Japanese invasion and forcing the Australian military to upgrade defences, including the commencement of convoy operations to protect merchant shipping.|$|E
5|$|The novel interweaves {{two major}} plots into a fictional world called the Four Lands. One follows the protagonist Shea Ohmsford on {{his quest to}} obtain the Sword of Shannara {{and use it to}} confront the Warlock Lord (the antagonist). The other plot shadows Prince Balinor Buckhannah's attempt to oust his insane brother Palance from the throne of Callahorn while the country and its capital (Tyrsis) <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> from {{overwhelming}} armies of the Warlock Lord. Throughout the novel, underlying themes appear of mundane heroism and nuclear holocaust.|$|E

As a result, Hesperus {{was out of}} action for 2 months. In February 1943 a depleted B2 under temporary command of Cdr Proudfoot escorted Convoy SC 118. This convoy <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> by wolfpack Pfeil and lost eight ships for three U-boats destroyed {{in one of the}} hardest fought battles of the campaign.|$|R

5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) {{was building a}} new factory in Karis, a location considered less likely than Helsinki to <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, {{striking}} workers in Chicago met near the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant. Union molders {{at the plant}} had been locked out since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 general strike, strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed the picket lines.|$|E
5|$|The first French {{units to}} <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> were those {{officers}} accompanying the local gendarmerie or standing guard. The contingents of the French garrison at Marash, numbering only 2,000 men, were separated {{from one another}} in the citywide siege. Direct communications did not exist between Marash and division headquarters and General Dufieux was only informed of the insurrection on 31 January, after several Armenians from the French Armenian Legion managed to disguise themselves as Muslims and cross the battle lines. He immediately appointed Lieutenant Colonel Robert Normand to lead a relief expedition, composed of three infantry battalions and half a squadron of cavalry, to Marash, and dispatched aerial recon flights, giving hope to the besieged French, Armenians and American relief workers who were assisting the local population.|$|E

5|$|While {{mourning}} Roth, Lara accepts {{that the}} storms are not natural, but are somehow {{connected to the}} Sun Queen and designed to prevent anyone from leaving the island. She meets up with her friends (Reyes, Jonah, Alex, and Sam), who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island, provided {{that it can be}} repaired. They are joined by Whitman, who claims to have escaped, though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists. Lara joins Alex in finding parts for the boat in the wreck of the Endurance. She finds him injured and stuck under some rubble. They <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion, sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape with the tools.|$|E
5|$|After the Marianas {{began to}} <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack,</b> the United States {{military}} {{stepped up its}} raids on the Japanese-held islands {{which could be used}} to launch raids on the B-29 bases. Particular attention was given to Iwo Jima, as it was correctly assumed that the Japanese aircraft which attacked the Marianas were flying from Japan and staging through the island en route to their targets. Following the first raid against Saipan in November, XXI Bomber Command B-29s were dispatched against Iwo Jima's airfields on November5 and 8. These attacks were primarily training missions and caused little damage. The first raid was unopposed by the Japanese, but the second was met by eight fighters which inflicted light damage on a B-29; this was the first combat damage suffered by any of XXI Bomber Command's aircraft. The Seventh Air Force also increased the number of B-24 Liberator attacks on Iwo Jima, and these attacked the island 30 times during November.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards the SEES members {{break into}} the school and indeed find Fuka inside Tartarus when the Dark Hour strikes. However when Akihiko pieces {{together}} {{the connection between the}} full moon and the powerful Shadows, Mitsuru and Yukari <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> by the Emperor and Empress Arcanas at Tartarus' entrance. Junpei, Akihiko and Fuka rush to their aid however the Arcanas easily overwhelm all of their Personas. In the midst of the battle, Fuka also awakens a Persona, Lucia, to defend an entranced Natsuki. However when the Emperor moves to attack her, Makoto arrives {{in the nick of time}} and launches a barrage of Persona attacks despite his teammates begging him to flee for his safety. With everyone approaching their physical limits, Fuka uses Lucia to sense the Arcanas' weaknesses and coordinates the SEES members in a collaborative effort which results in the Shadows' defeat. A few days later, Fuka moves into the Iwatodai dorm and repairs her relations with Natsuki, while life returns to a level of normalcy.|$|E

5|$|By 1980 the bridge's {{structure}} had <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> from marine woodworm, which threatened its closure. British Rail {{discovered that}} woodworm had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated {{it would cost}} £2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which immediately resulted {{in the loss of}} traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and from the factory at Penrhyndeudraeth. That traffic was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. However, Gwynedd County Council were opposed to closing the bridge completely as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a £2.5 million grant from the EEC to repair the bridge, with a further £4.6m being spent on improving the signalling. The bridge was closed entirely to traffic for six months during the temporary repair works eventually undertaken, and 30 of the piles were replaced.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being hired}} after the {{completion}} of nearly all the principal photography, Trumbull had an enormous amount of creative input on the film. The Spock spacewalk sequence, for example, was radically changed from the Abel version. The original plan was for Kirk to follow Spock in a spacesuit and <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> from a mass of sensor-type organisms. Spock would save his friend, and the two would proceed through V'ger. Wise, Kline and Abel had been unable to agree on how to photograph the sequence, and the result was a poorly designed and ungainly effect that Trumbull was convinced was disruptive to the plot and would have cost millions to fix. Instead, he recommended a stripped-down sequence that omitted Kirk entirely and would be simple and easy to shoot; Robert McCall, known for designing the original posters to 2001: A Space Odyssey, provided Trumbull with concept art to inform the new event.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid was {{detached}} {{with the}} cruisers Astoria, Minneapolis and New Orleans, and four destroyers on 11 May 1942 and sailed for Nouméa, while Fletcher took {{the rest of}} Task Force 17 to Tongatapu. Kinkaid then headed north to join the Vice Admiral William F. Halsey's Task Force 16. Kinkaid's force became part of its screen which was {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. Shortly after Task Force 16 returned to Pearl Harbor, Halsey was hospitalized with a severe case of dermatitis and, on his recommendation, was replaced as commander of Task Force 16 by Spruance. Kinkaid then became commander of the screen, also known as Task Group 16.2. He was one of only four American flag officers present during the subsequent Battle of Midway. However, he saw little action, as Task Force 16 did not <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lützow {{was posted}} {{missing in action}} {{following}} combat on 24 April 1945 while attempting to intercept an attack by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers near Donauwörth. According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, were just beginning their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came under attack by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving down from their top cover position {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot noticed {{that he was about to}} <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> and attempted to dive away. Unable to recover from this dive, the American pilots observed the Me262 crashing into a small hill. This Me262 may have been piloted by Lützow.|$|E
5|$|Milton Blockhouse was {{designed}} by the Clerk of the King's Works, James Nedeham, and the Master of Ordnance, Christopher Morice, with Robert Lorde serving as the paymaster for the project and Lionel Martin, John Ganyn and Mr Travers acting as the local overseers. The fort was built on Chapel Field, which the Crown bought, along with the land for Gravesend Blockhouse, from William Burston for £66; the field had previously been part of Milton Chantry, dissolved by Henry VIII during the Reformation. The work was quickly completed, and by 1540 the blockhouse was in operation and equipped with 30 artillery guns, 6 handguns and various pikes and longbows. Initially commanded by Captain Sir Edward Cobham, it had a small garrison of 12 men, including a second in command, a porter, three soldiers and seven gunners; these men would have been supported by reinforcements if the fort had ever <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25/26 August 1942 about 2,000 Japanese marines with tank support carried out an amphibious landing north of Milne Bay. As the Japanese {{advanced}} towards the 7th Brigade's main defensive position from their beachhead around Waga Waga, the 61st Battalion bore {{the brunt of the}} initial assault and temporarily halted the Japanese advance with an ambush before launching a counterattack against them. The following morning, however, after the 2/10th Battalion had <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> from Japanese armour, the 61st Battalion was also forced back towards the No. 3 airstrip, where they formed a defensive line against the main Japanese thrust which came on 31 August. With strong artillery support, the 61st and 25th Battalions managed to turn back the Japanese attack, inflicting heavy casualties and in the process seizing the initiative. Following this, elements of the 18th Brigade advanced towards the Japanese beachhead, which they subsequently captured on 6 September, inflicting upon the Japanese their first defeat in a major battle on land during the war.|$|E

5|$|Other Marines {{who have}} also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another {{extraction}} point near Black Mesa's Lambda Complex, but en route they <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard {{makes it to the}} Lambda Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen {{in the final stages of}} Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all this, Captain Pierre-Jean Daniel André, {{the head}} of the Marash detachment, {{requested}} additional reinforcements but, due to the indecisiveness of his superior, Lt. Colonel Jean Flye-Sainte-Marie, he was ordered to go to Adana to apprise the division commander, Brigadier General Julien Dufieux, of the situation. Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Quérette to Marash but by 17 January, when the reinforcements arrived, the French had already lost the initiative: supply convoys in Bel Punar and El-Oghlu had <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> and a relief column led by battalion commander Major Corneloup had been ambushed. On 21 January, General Quérette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their complicity in the attacks and demanded that they {{put an end to the}} hostilities. As the leaders departed, Turkish police chief Arslan Toğuz drew out his pistol and fired five rounds into the air, signaling the beginning of the uprising.|$|E
