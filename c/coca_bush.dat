Criminalization also applies to the [...] "cultivation of opium poppy, <b>coca</b> <b>bush</b> or cannabis plants for the purpose of the production of narcotic drugs".

American anti-narcotics aid for Peru stands at $71.7 million this year, slightly higher than last year’s $70.7 million. American anti-narcotics officials operate from a newly expanded Peruvian police base in Tingo María, overseeing Peruvian teams that fan out to nearby valleys to cut down <b>coca</b> <b>bushes</b> by hand.|$|R
5000|$|The Single Convention created four Schedules of {{controlled}} substances and {{a process for}} adding new substances to the Schedules without amending the treaty. The Schedules were designed to have significantly stricter regulations than the two drug [...] "Groups" [...] established by predecessor treaties. For the first time, cannabis {{was added to the}} list of internationally controlled drugs. In fact, regulations on the cannabis plant - as well as the opium poppy, the <b>coca</b> <b>bush,</b> poppy straw and cannabis tops - were embedded in the text of the treaty, making it impossible to deregulate them through the normal Scheduling process. A 1962 issue of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs' Bulletin on Narcotics proudly announced that [...] "after a definite transitional period, all non-medical use of narcotic drugs, such as opium smoking, opium eating, consumption of cannabis (hashish, marijuana) and chewing of coca leaves, will be outlawed everywhere. This is a goal which workers in international narcotics control all over the world have striven to achieve for half a century." ...|$|E
40|$|Cocaine is a {{powerful}} drug {{that comes from the}} leaves of the <b>coca</b> <b>bush,</b> a plant grown in South America. It’s sold as a white powder that is most often snorted (inhaled through the nostrils), {{but it can also be}} dissolved in water and injected, or formed into a solid to be smoked. The cocaine you can buy on the street is rarely pure; often, it’s mixed with other substances, like talcum powder or dextrose, or with other drugs, like amphetamines. Heating cocaine hydrochloride and combining it with baking soda makes crack cocaine, a very strong form of cocaine that can be smoked. Crack is divided up into many tiny “rocks ” that are sold for $ 10 to $ 20 each. This makes crack a fairly cheap drug, per dose. But because the high doesn’t last long and is addictive, people will take many doses in a short time, making cocaine or crack a very expensive drug habit. It’s no wonder less than 1 % of Canadians over the age of 15 use cocaine...|$|E

Initially the use of these was only for the purpose of relieving the physical and mental capabilities, and for medicinaland surgical purpose. But the human spirit of innovation must have led to the use of these substances for mood-altering effects and offer an escape from the real and difficult world of existence to a more agreeable world of fantasy. These things are perhaps a few of the oldest natural substances a fewer of the oldest natural substances used by human race. The major purpose of the study is to highlight the origin and development of the drug addiction in the South Asian region, and discover its impacts on Pakistan. The problem of the drug addiction, which once could be learned as a by-product of drug traffickingthroughout Pakistan has become a major challenge for the governments, philanthropists and the social reformers of this age.

40|$|For the {{majority}} of its history, the cultivation of cannabis did not stand out, at least compared to the cultivation of other illegal plants. Cannabis plantations, like <b>coca</b> <b>bush</b> or opium poppy plantations, were typically large in size, grown by local farmers in a handful of developing (producing) countries, processed and then exported to industrial (consuming) nations. While cocaine and heroin are still produced in a handful of developing countries, cannabis cultivation is increasingly universal. From Europe to the Americas and Oceania, import substitution in cannabis markets has been noticed in almost every developed country around the world, with a notable aversion for discrimination. Geographical, technological, cultural and economic factors help to explain why (indoor and outdoor) domestic cultivation is well established, and why {{the nature and extent of}} cultivation varies so dramatically across the western, developed nations. As we start the second decade of the 21 st century, the new cannabis industry continues to fascinate both casual and academic observers of the drug scene. Researchers around the world have become increasingly interested in the phenomenon, aiming to describe, and potentially explain, the rapid switch from importation to domestic production in their own countries. In bringing together some of the world's leading experts on cannabis cultivation this book contains sixteen chapters that take an interdisciplinary look at global trends in cannabis cultivation. It will serve as an exemplar for wider discussions of key theories and concepts relating to the spread not just of cannabis cultivation, but also of illegal markets more generally, the actors that operate within these markets and the policies and practices that are employed in response to developments within these markets...|$|E
40|$|Criminals, {{especially}} drug traffickers, {{may have}} laundered around 1. 6 trillion, or 2. 7 per cent of global GDP, in 2009, {{according to a}} new report by UNODC. This figure is consistent with the 2 to 5 per cent range previously established by the International Monetary Fund to estimate the scale of money-laundering. Less than 1 per cent of global illicit financial flows is currently being seized and frozen, according to the report Estimating illicit financial flows resulting from drug trafficking and other transnational organized crime. "Tracking the flows of illicit funds generated by drug trafficking and organized crime and analysing how they are laundered through the world's financial systems remain daunting tasks," acknowledged Yury Fedotov, Executive Director of UNODC. The UNODC report estimates that the total amount of criminal proceeds generated in 2009, excluding those derived from tax evasion, may have been approximately 2. 1 trillion, or 3. 6 per cent of GDP in that year (2. 3 to 5. 5 per cent). Of that total, the proceeds of transnational organized crime - such as drug trafficking, counterfeiting, human trafficking and small arms smuggling - may have amounted to 1. 5 per cent of global GDP, and 70 per cent of those proceeds are likely to have been laundered through the financial system. The illicit drug trade - accounting for half of all proceeds of transnational organized crime and a fifth of all crime proceeds - is the most profitable sector. The study paid particular attention to the market for cocaine, probably the most lucrative illicit drug trafficked across borders. Traffickers' gross profits from the cocaine trade stood at around 84 billion in 2009. While Andean <b>coca</b> <b>bush</b> farmers earned about 1 billion, the bulk of the income generated from cocaine was concentrated in North America (35 billion), followed by West and Central Europe (26 billion). Approximately two-thirds of that total may have been laundered in 2009. The findings suggest that most profits from the cocaine trade are laundered in North America and in Europe, whereas illicit income from other subregions is probably laundered in the Caribbean. Once illegal money has entered the global and financial markets, it becomes much harder to trace its origins, and the laundering of ill-gotten gains may perpetuate a cycle of crime and drug trafficking. "UNODC's challenge is to work within the United Nations system and with Member States to help to build the capacity to track and prevent money-laundering, strengthen {{the rule of law and}} prevent these funds from creating further suffering," said Mr. Fedotov...|$|E
40|$|In 2015 about {{a quarter}} of a billion people used drugs. Of these, around 29. 5 million people - or 0. 6 per cent of the global adult {{population}} - were engaged in problematic use and suffered from drug use disorders, including dependence. Opioids were the most harmful drug type and accounted for 70 per cent of the negative health impact associated with drug use disorders worldwide, according to the latest World Drug Report, released today by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Disorders related to the use of amphetamines also account for a considerable share of the global burden of disease. And while the market for new psychoactive substances (NPS) is still relatively small, users are unaware of the content and dosage of psychoactive substances in some NPS. This potentially exposes users to additional serious health risks. The Report finds that hepatitis C is causing the greatest harm among the estimated 12 million people who inject drugs worldwide. Out of this number, one in eight (1. 6 million) is living with HIV and more than half (6. 1 million) are living with hepatitis C, while around 1. 3 million are suffering from both hepatitis C and HIV. Overall, three times more people who use drugs die from hepatitis C (222, 000) than from HIV (60, 000). However, the Report stresses that despite recent advances in the treatment of hepatitis C, access remains poor, as treatment remains very expensive in most countries. This year marks 20 years of the World Drug Report, which comes at a time when the international community has decided to move forward with joint action. UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov highlighted that the outcome document of the 2016 landmark UN General Assembly special session on the world drug problem contains more than 100 concrete recommendations to reduce demand and supply, however he acknowledges that more needs to be done. Changing business models for drug trafficking and organized crime “There is much work to be done to confront the many harms inflicted by drugs to health, development, peace and security, in all regions of the world,” said Mr. Fedotov. In 2014, transnational organized crime groups across the globe were estimated to have generated between one fifth and one third of their revenues from drug sales. Mobile communications offers new opportunities to traffickers, while the darknet allows users to anonymously buy drugs with a crypto-currency, such as bitcoin. While drug trafficking over the darknet remains small, there has been an increase in drug transactions, of some 50 per cent annually between September 2013 and January 2016 according to one study. Typical buyers are recreational users of cannabis, “ecstasy”, cocaine, hallucinogens and NPS. Global Drug Market Trends The spectrum of substances available on the drug market has widened considerably, the Report says. The opioid market in particular is becoming more diversified, with a combination of internationally controlled substances like heroin, and prescription medicines that are either diverted from the legal market or produced as counterfeit medicines. NPS continued to evolve such that by 2015, the number of reported substances had nearly doubled to 483 compared with 260 NPS in 2012. Opium production is up and the cocaine market is thriving. In 2016, global opium production increased by one third compared with the previous year and this was primarily due to higher opium poppy yields in Afghanistan. The Report also points to the expansion of the cocaine market, such that from 2013 - 2015, <b>coca</b> <b>bush</b> cultivation increased by 30 per cent mainly as a result of increased cultivation in Colombia. Following a period of decline, there are signs that cocaine use is increasing in the two largest markets, North America and Europe. Drugs and terrorism Although not all terrorist groups depend on drug profits, some do. Without the proceeds of drug production and trafficking, which make up almost half of the Taliban’s annual income, the reach and impact of the Taliban would probably not be what it is today. Up to 85 per cent of opium cultivation in Afghanistan occurs in territory under some influence of the Taliban. The 2017 World Drug Report provides a global overview of the supply and demand of opiates, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamine-type stimulants and new psychoactive substances (NPS), as well as their impact on health. It highlights the scientific evidence for hepatitis C causing greatest harm among people who use drugs; and brings into view further diversification of the thriving drug market, as well as changing business models for drug trafficking and organized crime...|$|E
