The study carried out in different countries and author’ own measurements are presented. It was shown that the pollution flashover voltage of spiral <b>shaped</b> <b>insulators</b> is lower than that of insulators with standard sheds. The poorer performance of spiral <b>shaped</b> <b>insulators</b> is caused by the formation of non-uniform surface layer along the leakage path...|$|R

40|$|Microneedle {{technology}} {{is one of}} the attractive methods in transdermal drug delivery. However, the clinical applications of this method are limited owing to: complexity in the preparation of multiple coating solutions, drug leakage while inserting the microneedles into the skin and the outer walls of the solid microneedle can hold limited quantity of drug. Here, the authors present the fabrication of an array of rectangular <b>cup</b> <b>shaped</b> silicon microneedles, which provide for reduced drug leakage resulting in improvement of efficiency of drug delivery and possibility of introducing multiple drugs. The fabricated solid microneedles with rectangular <b>cup</b> <b>shaped</b> tip have a total height of 200 mu m. These <b>cup</b> <b>shaped</b> tips have dimensions: 60 x 60 mu m (length x breadth) with a depth of 60 mu m. The cups are filled with drug using a novel in-house built drop coating system. Successful drug dissolution was observed when the coated microneedle was used on mice. Also, using the above method, it is possible to fill the cups selectively with different drugs, which enables simultaneous multiple drug delivery. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society...|$|R
5000|$|In the Hebrew Bible, the almond was {{a symbol}} of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering. In the Bible the almond is {{mentioned}} ten times, beginning with Book of Genesis 43:11, where it is described as [...] "among the best of fruits". In Numbers 17 Levi is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by Aaron's rod, which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the menorah which stood in the Holy Temple, [...] "Three <b>cups,</b> <b>shaped</b> like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three <b>cups,</b> <b>shaped</b> like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four <b>cups,</b> <b>shaped</b> like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers" [...] (Exodus 25:33-34; 37:19-20).|$|R

40|$|The morphologic {{appearance}} of the optic disc is of interest in glaucoma. In contrast to descriptive classification systems that are currently used, a quantitative approach {{to the analysis of}} optic disc morphology is required. Our goal was to determine the optimal method for quantifying optic <b>cup</b> <b>shape</b> by comparing traditional (ovality, form-factor and neuroretinal rim (NRR) width ratio) and geometric morphometric approaches. Left optic disc stereophotographs of 160 (80 normal and 80 glaucomatous (stratified by severity)) subjects were examined. The optic cup margins were stereoscopically delineated with a custom tracing system and saved as a series of discrete points. The geometric morphometric methods of elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) and sliding semi-landmark analysis (SSLA) were used to eliminate variation unrelated to shape (e. g. size) and yield a series of shape variables. Differences in optic <b>cup</b> <b>shape</b> between normal and glaucoma groups were investigated. Discriminant functions were computed and the sensitivity and specificity of each technique determined. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for all methods and evaluated in their potential to discriminate between normal and glaucomatous eyes based on the shape variables. All geometric morphometric methods revealed differences between normal and glaucomatous eyes in optic <b>cup</b> <b>shape,</b> in addition to the traditional parameters of ovality, form-factor and NRR width ratio (p< 0. 0005). SSLA (minimum bending energy criterion - 18 points) had the best sensitivity (83 %) and area under the curve (AUC) (0. 91). EFA (72 points) performed similarly well (74 %, 0. 89) as did the set of traditional shape-based variables (76 %, 0. 86). This study demonstrated that a geometric morphometric approach for discriminating between normal and glaucomatous eyes in optic <b>cup</b> <b>shape</b> is superior to that provided by traditional single parameter shape measures. Such analytical techniques could be incorporated into future automated optic disc screening modalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
