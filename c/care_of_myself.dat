500|$|I'm {{trying to}} {{understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "I've {{considered}} [...] for two years, and in {{the last}} six months, it's seemed real clear to me. I realized that my job would become my career if I stayed. Some people stay with a series until the end, you know, and afterwards they often have some problems, I think, finding new opportunities. And I wanted a career after Dallas. There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show – I was never bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. My plans are set. I have a project with a network that is ready to go that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the post-fight, Angulo stated how he {{was unhappy}} with the stoppage, [...] "I told Tony he did the wrong job tonight. The referee tells us {{to take care of}} {{ourselves}} at all times. I can take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> My plan was to work harder in the final four or three rounds. I had good preparation for this fight." [...] His trainer Virgil Hunter was also unhappy with referee Tony Weeks, [...] "I'm very upset. I told the referee and the doctor that if Canelo put two or three shots together that I would stop the fight. He landed one punch. Everyone knows Alfredo was coming on strong, everyone knows that." ...|$|E

5000|$|His {{style in}} the {{beginnings}} was artificial and conventional, but later it became very well cared for and precise. He himself defined his intention when writing: [...] "I have taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> explaining <b>myself</b> with nobility and of using a language worthy of the great subjects that I have treated".|$|R
5000|$|Liu Jun, however, was unappreciative of her, and he freed {{himself from}} her embrace, stating, [...] "I must take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> all things <b>myself.</b> Be assured that I will not cause you trouble!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In June 2012, Osbourne {{announced}} that he had been diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. He had experienced symptoms {{for a number of years}} including blindness in one eye; numbness in both legs; and problems with his bladder, bowel, and stomach. Osbourne injects Copaxone medication daily, uses vitamin supplements and hormone replacement therapy, and has travelled to Europe for stem cell therapy. He has also made lifestyle changes such as minimising stress, exercising regularly, and significantly altering his diet. However, he has spoken of his fear of a rapid decline and has admitted that his doctors have urged him to stop participating in highly intensive physical workouts: [...] "Right now am I going to be in a wheelchair? No. But if I don't take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> who knows." [...] While appearing on Dancing with the Stars in October 2013, Osbourne said that he did not suffer from [...] "any severe symptoms other than the odd bit of tingling down my leg and the occasional bout of fatigue." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{for three}} years without any of my money. I guess. I can take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{along with some of}} my money here in San Francisco. I don't care to handle my {{business}} affairs yet, but I do want a bank account, a respectable-sized one. I want to spend it as I see fit, for what I see fit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{he said to}} {{the leader}} of the soldiers, at the same time giving him a piece of money. [...] "There is no further {{occasion}} for your services, all danger of rescue being past. I can now take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> them <b>myself,</b> being armed, as you see, while they are bound. Convey my thanks and compliments to your commanding officer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you {{are given}} {{back again to}} me Who have kept intact for you your virginity. Who {{for the rest of}} life walk out <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> Indifferent here <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> since I am gone Where you are gone, and you and I out there [...] Walk now as one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go!" [...] he said, sternly; [...] "I {{can take}} <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the cattle <b>myself,</b> without help. But stay, {{a man of}} your {{peaceful}} nature and humility may, perchance, not be too proud {{to take charge of}} pigs." ...|$|R
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. Nothing need happen. I {{never heard}} such {{nonsense}} {{in all my}} life. I shall {{know how to take}} <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't you worry," [...] she replied, with a {{confident}} smile. [...] "I can take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> I {{grew up in}} Colorado. I'm no tenderfoot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{cried the}} maiden, again {{correcting}} herself, [...] "for {{the best of}} all reasons; there was none to be had, so I took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him <b>myself.</b> If there had been a doctor at hand, I am sure we would gladly have had him; for my part, I am clear for doctoring, though Harvey says I am killing myself with medicines; but I am sure it will make but little difference to him, whether I live or die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hunt your holes, you scum!" [...] {{which they}} did; then he said: [...] "Follow me, Shadbelly; I'll take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> your case <b>myself.</b> No--keep your pop-gun; {{whenever}} I {{see the day}} that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be {{time for me to}} join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly following.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brook {{smiled as}} with the sadness of having too much to triumph. [...] "Because I'm not, like Fanny, without mesquinerie. I'm not generous and simple. I'm exaggeratedly anxious about Nanda. I <b>care,</b> in spite <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> for what people may say. Your wife doesn't--she towers above them. I can be a shade less brave through the chance of my girl's not {{happening}} to feel her {{as the rest of}} us do." ...|$|R
6000|$|Stoller {{started as}} if the word money {{reminded}} him of something. [...] "I can take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> young man. How much do I owe you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I can't {{expect to}} do that, but if I take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> I don't see why I shouldn't last another three or four." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In your father's, then. I {{will take}} <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and speak when I want it. Don't trouble your father about it till {{he sees his}} way.' ...|$|E
5000|$|On 22 June 2004, {{police arrested}} Sharpe and interviewed him twice: {{during his first}} interview, he {{continued}} to deny any knowledge of their whereabouts, but during the second, having spoken to his family, he admitted to both murders. He told police he killed his wife because she was [...] "controlling and moody" [...] and their marriage was unhappy. He also told police he [...] "was thinking <b>of</b> taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Gracie by <b>myself</b> and just amongst all this madness ... that's when I lost the plot".|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought you'd like it, Granny, for you are {{a decent}} cat, and know what is proper," [...] {{continued}} Molly, leaning down to stroke the old puss, who blinked affectionately at her. [...] "I can't imagine what put it into Miss Bat's head. I never said a word, and gave up groaning over the clutter, as I couldn't mend it. I just took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Boo and <b>myself,</b> and left her to be as untidy as she pleased, {{and she is a}} regular old----" ...|$|R
2500|$|Following the reception, Elvis and Priscilla {{boarded a}} private jet and enjoyed a short honeymoon in Palm Springs. On May 4, they flew back to Memphis and retreated to their private ranch, just over the Mississippi state line, for a three-week break. Many of Elvis' inner circle joined them, {{although}} {{for the most part}} the couple were left alone and were able to enjoy each other's company without the intrusion of the Memphis Mafia. Priscilla reveled in her chance to be a proper wife; cooking, cleaning, and washing for her husband. [...] "I loved playing house" [...] she later remarked, adding [...] "Here was an opportunity to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him <b>myself.</b> No maids or housekeepers to pamper us." [...] In an attempt to heal rifts, Elvis and Priscilla held another reception at Graceland on May 29 for the friends and family who were unable to attend the original ceremonies.|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't {{you worry}} about me, mother; I'll take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> and you too," [...] remarked Toady, with the cheery belief in impossibilities which makes youth so charming.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you. It {{is kind of}} you to give me this warning. But I think I {{can take}} <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> I come, you see, of a {{military}} family.' ...|$|E
60|$|Now I was {{at liberty}} to go to {{any part of the}} world, and take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> my money <b>myself.</b> The first thing that I {{resolved}} to do was to go directly to England, for there, I thought, being among my country-folks--for I esteemed myself an Englishwoman, though I was born in France--there, I say, I thought I could better manage things than in France; at least, that I would be in less danger of being circumvented and deceived; but how to get away with such a treasure as I had with me was a difficult point, and what I was greatly at a loss about.|$|R
40|$|The diploma work is {{oriented}} on {{the additional}} pension insurance (superannuation scheme) {{and on its}} value as a reserve for the retirement age. In the theoretical part there is described {{the history of the}} additional pension insurance, main terms and definition and next there are in detail described the particular pension funds and their rentability. The theoretical part finishes with the integral part of the additional pension insurance, which is the tax prefference. In the introduction of the practical part there I am concerned with the pension reform, because the additional pension insurance is an instrument used for saving for the pension age. The pension reform has three phases. The first phase already has been confirmed by the government and its main consequence are the rules for the retirement. Next two phases are being discussed. No matter how the discussion about the reform ends I consider as reasonable to <b>care</b> <b>of</b> securing <b>myself</b> in the future by using the additional pension insurance. This is demonstrated on four independent examples, where I show that it is advantageous to start saving money by additional pension insurance. In the final phase of the practical part there is the general conclusion of the diploma work and my own opinion {{about the importance of the}} additional pension insurance...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kiss the {{children}} for me. I wish them, when they are old enough, to read this defense <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{and to know that}} their father, who loved them dearly, was an innocent man. My good brother will take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> you, for my sake. I have done.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{can take}} <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{as well as}} you, an' if I don't knock 'round when there's a fire, how am I ever goin' to learn the business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I shall take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> There's {{nothing so}} safe {{as a little}} {{nonsense}} with a married woman. Of course, it means nothing, you know, between her and me." ...|$|E
60|$|Do not {{accuse me}} of romance for obeying this impulse towards the South; nor suppose that, to satisfy the {{imaginary}} longing of an idle curiosity, I am in any danger of risking the solid comforts of my present condition. Whoever has hitherto taken charge of my motions has shown me, by convincing proofs more weighty than the assurances which they have witheld, that my real advantage is their principal object. I should be, therefore, worse than a fool did I object to their authority, even when it seems somewhat capriciously exercised; for assuredly, at my age, I might--intrusted as I am with the <b>care</b> and management <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> in every other particular--expect {{that the cause of}} excluding me from England should be frankly and fairly stated for my own consideration and guidance. However, I will not grumble about the matter. I shall know the whole story one day, I suppose; and perhaps, as you sometimes surmise, I shall not find there is any mighty matter in it after all.|$|R
60|$|The first <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Job and <b>myself,</b> {{after seeing}} to Leo, was to wash {{ourselves}} {{and put on}} clean clothing, for what we were wearing had not been changed since {{the loss of the}} dhow. Fortunately, as I think that I have said, by far the greater part of our personal baggage had been packed into the whaleboat, and was therefore saved--and brought hither by the bearers--although all the stores laid in by us for barter and presents to the natives was lost. Nearly all our clothing was made of a well-shrunk and very strong grey flannel, and excellent I found it for travelling in these places, because though a Norfolk jacket, shirt, and pair of trousers of it only weighed about four pounds, a great consideration in a tropical country, where every extra ounce tells on the wearer, it was warm, and offered a good resistance to the rays of the sun, and best of all to chills, which are so apt to result from sudden changes of temperature.|$|R
40|$|I was {{introduced}} to the Physician Assistant profession as a high school sophomore during a pre-medical program. I always desired to be in the medical field as I enjoyed science, problem solving, and interacting with others. I decided to learn more about what a PA does and if I could see myself becoming one. I began shadowing my now supervising physician in 2004. At the time, he had a physician assistant working with him, so I had the opportunity to observe their interaction, learn dermatologic terminology and procedures, and strengthen my interpersonal communication skills. I knew I could see myself as an integral part <b>of</b> the patient’s <b>care</b> and was determined to become a physician assistant. Once accepted as a dual admission student, my undergraduate journey began. I had a rigorous schedule for three years which included required science courses and honors program seminars. I was on the executive board of pre-medical clubs and was a peer tutor at Academic Services. It was crucial to have an organized and strict schedule, which I feel helped prepare me well for the challenging and intense coursework in PA school. Being a PA student taught me to persevere and gave me confidence to apply my knowledge when diagnosing and treating patients. I have been practicing as a physician assistant for over six years and still learn new things each day; about medicine, those I take <b>care</b> <b>of,</b> and <b>myself.</b> It’s about working as a team to comfort patients, educate patients, and save lives...|$|R
