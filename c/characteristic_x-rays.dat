25|$|In {{secondary}} electron imaging, or SEI, the {{secondary electron}}s are emitted from {{very close to}} the specimen surface. Consequently, SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 nm in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by elastic scattering. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and consequently the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM along with the spectra made from the <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-rays,</b> because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution of different elements in the sample. For the same reason, BSE imaging can image colloidal gold immuno-labels of 5 or 10nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images in biological specimens. <b>Characteristic</b> <b>X-rays</b> are emitted when the electron beam removes an inner shell electron from the sample, causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy.

The relative geometric positions of the analyzer’s source, detector and specimen are emphasized, which impacts the analyte’s <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-ray</b> fluorescence counts.

The best geometric positions for the XRF analyzer had the incident angle for the excitation source (β) equivalent to the exit angle for the specimen’s <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-ray</b> (β). The maximal <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-ray</b> peak counts were obtained when α and β were orthogonal, and the minimum counts were obtained when parallel.
