40|$|Ticks were {{collected}} at approximately bi-monthly intervals between June 1996 and June 1997 from <b>crested</b> <b>francolins,</b> Francolinus sephaena, {{and from the}} vegetation on a mixed cattle and wildlife farm in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The birds were infested with the immature stages of 13 tick species, of which Amblyomma hebraeum, Amblyomma marmoreum and Hyalomma marginatumrufipes were the most numerous and prevalent. Ten ixodid tick species {{were collected}} from the vegetation, of which the immature stages of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi were the most numerous. No adult ticks were collected from the birds and only two from the vegetation. The restricted home range of <b>crested</b> <b>francolins</b> implies that they {{could serve as a}} source of tick infestation only for other animals within the same habitat as the birds. </span...|$|R
40|$|Birds are {{hosts of}} the {{immature}} stages of several ixodid tick species (Theiler 1962) and consequent-ly {{could serve as}} a source of subsequent adult tick infestation for other hosts. This is particularly so for migrating birds (Hoogstraal, Kaiser, Traylor, Gaber & Guindy 1961), or species such as helmeted guinea-fowls, Numida meleagris, that on occasion can har-bour large numbers of immature ticks (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak, Spickett, Braack & Williams 1991). Two species of guineafowls and several spe-cies of francolins occur in South Africa and of these the ixodid tick burdens of helmeted guineafowls, Cape francolins, Francolinus capensis, and grey-wing francolins, Francolinus africanus, have been determined (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak et al. 1991; Horak & Boomker 1998). Similar data for <b>crested</b> <b>francolins,</b> Francolinus sephaena, or crest-ed guineafowls, Guttera pucherani, both of which occur in the northern and north-eastern regions of South Africa, have not been collected. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether <b>crested</b> <b>francolins,</b> which prefer thick cover and matted vegetation, play the same role as hel-meted guineafowls, which prefer thorny scrub and savanna veld, as hosts for the immature stages of ticks of veterinary importance.

50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>francolin</b> (Dendroperdix sephaena) is {{a species}} of bird in the Phasianidae family.It is found in Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. One of its subspecies, Dendroperdix sephaena rovuma, is {{sometimes}} considered a separate species, Kirk's francolin.|$|E
50|$|Over 120 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} in the reserve and the adjacent Fountains Valley. Game birds include guineafowl, Swainson's spurfowl and <b>crested</b> <b>francolin.</b> The grassy floodplain of the Apies river and its riparian vegetation provide breeding habitat {{for a number of}} weaver, bishop and widow species, while the open woodlands on the lower hill slopes provide breeding territories for bushshrike and tchagra species.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} bird {{species in the}} conservancy is {{estimated}} at 350. 60% {{of the total number}} of bird families recorded in Kenya are present in the conservancy. 13 species are listed on East Africaâ€™s regional Red Data List, including the hooded vulture and Clarke's weaver. Other, more common species inhabiting the conservancy are the saddle-billed stork, eastern violet-backed sunbird, the white-throated bee-eater and the <b>crested</b> <b>francolin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, major {{authorities}} placed all francolins in the genus Francolinus. In 1992 {{it was suggested}} that this treatment was problematic, and the francolins should be split into four genera: Francolinus for the Asian species, and the African species divided into Peliperdix, Scleroptila and Pternistis. The <b>crested</b> <b>francolin</b> and Nahan's francolin were considered possibly quite distinct, but still maintained in Peliperdix and Pternistis respectively. Based on further evidence, the <b>crested</b> <b>francolin</b> was moved to the monotypic genus Dendroperdix in 1998, and the Nahan's francolin was moved to Ptilopachus in 2006. Though some still maintain all these in Francolinus, the split into multiple genera is becoming more widespread. When split, the English name [...] "francolin" [...] is generally restricted {{to the members of the}} genera Francolinus, Peliperdix, Dendroperdix and Scleroptila, while the name [...] "spurfowl" [...] is used for Pternistis ("spurfowl" [...] is also used for Galloperdix of the Indian subcontinent). As the Nahan's [...] "francolin" [...] is related to the stone partridge rather than the true francolins and spurfowl, its name is sometimes modified to Nahan's partridge.|$|E
