25|$|Several GI diseases, {{especially}} {{those associated with}} malabsorption, can cause recurrent mouth ulcers, atrophic glossitis, and angular <b>cheilitis</b> (e.g. Crohn's disease is sometimes termed orofacial granulomatosis when it involves the mouth alone).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are {{mucocutaneous}}: dry lips, skin and nose. Other common mucocutaneous side effects are inflammation and chapping of the lips (<b>cheilitis),</b> redness {{of the skin}} (erythema), rashes, peeling, eczema (dermatitis), itching (prunitis) and nose bleeds (epistaxis). Absence of dryness of the lips is considered an indication of non-compliance with treatment (not taking the drug as advised), as it occurs in almost all patients.|$|E

Sometimes angular <b>cheilitis</b> can coexist, which is {{inflammation of the}} corners of the mouth, also often associated with Candida albicans. Stomatitis rarely develops under a lower denture. The affected mucosa is often sharply defined, {{in the shape of the}} covering denture.|$|E
2500|$|Isotretinoin is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} treatment for severe acne. The most common adverse effects are a transient worsening of acne (lasting 1-4 months), dry lips (<b>cheilitis),</b> dry and fragile skin, and an increased susceptibility to sunburn. [...] Uncommon and rare side effects include muscle aches and pains (myalgias), and headaches. Isotretinoin is known to cause birth defects due to in utero exposure because of the molecule's close resemblance to retinoic acid, a natural vitamin A derivative which controls normal embryonic development. It is also associated with psychiatric side effects, including depression.|$|E
2500|$|Rarely, {{allergic}} {{reactions of the}} mouth and lips may manifest as erosions; however, such reactions usually do not produce frank ulceration. An example of one common allergen is Balsam of Peru. If individuals allergic to this substance have oral exposure they may experience stomatitis and <b>cheilitis</b> (inflammation, rash, or painful erosion of the lips, oropharyngeal mucosa, or angles of their mouth). [...] Balsam of Peru is used in foods and drinks for flavoring, in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance, and in medicine and pharmaceutical items for healing properties.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{widespread}} use of carmine-based dyes in food and cosmetic products, a small number of people have been found to experience [...] occupational asthma, food and cosmetic allergies (such as allergic rhinitis and <b>cheilitis),</b> IgE-mediated [...] respiratory hypersensitivity, and in rare cases [...] anaphylactic shock. In 2009 the FDA ruled that labels of cosmetics and food that include cochineal extract must include that information on their labels [...] (under the name [...] "cochineal extract" [...] or [...] "carmine"). In 2006 the FDA stated it found no evidence of a [...] "significant hazard" [...] to the general population. [...] In the EU authorities list carmine as additive E120 in the list of EU-approved food additives. An artificial, non-allergenic cochineal dye is labeled E124. The directive governing food dyes approves the use of carmine for certain groups of foods only, but is still found in several products particularly alcoholic beverages.|$|E
50|$|It {{is divided}} into {{endogenous}} (due to an inherent characteristic of the individual), and exogenous (where it is caused by an external agent). The main cause of endogenous eczematous <b>cheilitis</b> is atopic <b>cheilitis</b> (atopic dermatitis), and the main causes of exogenous eczematous <b>cheilitis</b> is irritant contact <b>cheilitis</b> (e.g., caused by a lip-licking habit) and allergic contact <b>cheilitis.</b> The latter {{is characterized by a}} dryness, fissuring, edema, and crusting. It affects females more commonly than males, in a ratio of about 9:1.|$|E
50|$|Plasma cell <b>cheilitis</b> {{appears as}} well defined, infiltrated, dark red plaque with a {{superficial}} lacquer-like glazing. Plasma cell <b>cheilitis</b> usually involves the lower lip. The lips appear dry, atrophic and fissured. Angular <b>cheilitis</b> is sometimes present.|$|E
5000|$|Plasma cell <b>cheilitis</b> is a {{very rare}} {{presentation}} of a condition which more usually occurs on the gingiva (termed [...] "plasma cell gingivitis") or sometimes the tongue. Plasma cell <b>cheilitis</b> appears as well defined, infiltrated, dark red plaque with a superficial lacquer-like glazing. Plasma cell <b>cheilitis</b> usually involves the lower lip. The lips appear dry, atrophic and fissured. Angular <b>cheilitis</b> is sometimes also present.|$|E
5000|$|Angular <b>cheilitis</b> {{could be}} {{considered}} to be a type of <b>cheilitis</b> or stomatitis. Where Candida species are involved, angular <b>cheilitis</b> is classed as a type of oral candidiasis, specifically a primary (group I) Candida-associated lesion. This form angular <b>cheilitis</b> which is caused by Candida is sometimes termed [...] "Candida-associated angular cheilitis", or less commonly, [...] "monilial perlèche". Angular <b>cheilitis</b> can also be classified as acute (sudden, short-lived appearance of the condition) or chronic (lasts a long time or keeps returning), or refractory (the condition persists despite attempts to treat it).|$|E
50|$|It is {{a general}} term, {{and there are many}} {{recognized}} types and different causes. <b>Cheilitis</b> can be either acute or chronic. Most <b>cheilitis</b> is caused by exogenous factors such as dryness (chapping) and acute sun exposure. Patch testing may identify allergens that cause <b>cheilitis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Inflammation of {{the lips}} is termed <b>cheilitis.</b> This {{can be in}} several forms such as chapped lips (dry, peeling lips), angular <b>cheilitis</b> (inflammation of {{the corners of the}} mouth), herpes labialis (cold sore, a form of herpes simplex) and actinic <b>cheilitis</b> (chronically sun damaged lips).|$|E
50|$|Chapped lips (also <b>cheilitis</b> simplex or common <b>cheilitis)</b> are {{characterized}} by cracking, fissuring, and peeling of {{the skin of the}} lips, and {{are one of the most}} common types of <b>cheilitis.</b> While both lips may be affected, the lower lip is the most common site. There may also be burning or the formation of large, painful cracks when the lips are stretched. If chronic, <b>cheilitis</b> simplex can progress to crusting and bleeding.|$|E
5000|$|Allergy to Balsam of Peru can {{manifest}} as <b>cheilitis.</b> [...] Allergies to metal, wood, {{or other}} components can cause <b>cheilitis</b> reactions in musicians, especially players of woodwind and brass instruments, e.g., the so-called [...] "clarinetist's cheilitis", or [...] "flutist's cheilitis". [...] "Pigmented contact cheilitis" [...] is {{one type of}} allergic <b>cheilitis</b> in which a brown-black discoloration of the lips develops. Patch testing is used to identify the substance triggering allergic contact <b>cheilitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Plasma cell gingivits is rare, and {{plasma cell}} <b>cheilitis</b> is very rare. Most people with plasma cell <b>cheilitis</b> have been elderly.|$|E
50|$|Angular <b>cheilitis</b> (AC), is {{inflammation}} {{of one or}} both corners of the mouth. Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. It can also be itchy or painful. The condition can last for days to years. Angular <b>cheilitis</b> {{is a type of}} <b>cheilitis</b> ({{inflammation of}} the lips).|$|E
50|$|Allergic {{reactions}} {{may account}} for about 25-34% of cases of generalized <b>cheilitis</b> (i.e., inflammation {{not confined to the}} angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular <b>cheilitis,</b> but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic <b>cheilitis</b> may present involving the corners of the mouth alone.|$|E
50|$|OFG {{could be}} {{classified}} as a type of <b>cheilitis</b> (lip inflammation), hence the alternative names for the condition using the word <b>cheilitis,</b> and a granulomatous condition.|$|E
5000|$|Also termed [...] "lip dermatitis", {{eczematous}} <b>cheilitis</b> is {{a diverse}} group of disorders which often have an unknown cause. Chronic eczematous reactions account for the majority of chronic <b>cheilitis</b> cases.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes {{the term}} [...] "cheilitis simplex" [...] {{is used as}} a synonym for <b>cheilitis</b> generally, however, exfoliative <b>cheilitis</b> (discussed later) is also {{sometimes}} stated to be the equivalent of chapped lips.|$|E
50|$|Angular <b>cheilitis</b> {{is thought}} to be multifactorial {{disorder}} of infectious origin, with many local and systemic predisposing factors. The sores in angular <b>cheilitis</b> are often infected with fungi (yeasts), bacteria, or a combination thereof; this may represent a secondary, opportunistic infection by these pathogens. Some studies have linked the initial onset of angular <b>cheilitis</b> with nutritional deficiencies, especially of the B(B2-riboflavin) vitamins and iron (which causes iron deficiency anemia), which in turn may be evidence of malnutrition or malabsorption. Angular <b>cheilitis</b> can be a manifestation of contact dermatitis, which is considered in two groups; irritational and allergic.|$|E

5000|$|Herpes labialis (cold sore) is {{a common}} cause of {{infectious}} <b>cheilitis.</b> A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur {{in the corner of}} the mouth, and be mistaken for other causes of angular <b>cheilitis.</b> In fact this is herpes labialis, and is sometimes termed [...] "angular herpes simplex".|$|E
5000|$|... 22% {{of cases}} of angular <b>cheilitis</b> are due to irritants. Saliva {{contains}} digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. The corner of the mouth is normally exposed to saliva {{more than any other}} part of the lips. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular skin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. The tendency of saliva to pool in these areas is increased, constantly wetting the area, which may cause tissue maceration and favors the development of a yeast infection. As such, angular <b>cheilitis</b> is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. [...] Angular <b>cheilitis</b> is also commonly seen in denture wearers. Angular <b>cheilitis</b> is present in about 30% of people with denture-related stomatitis. It is thought that reduced vertical dimension of the lower face may be a contributing factor in up to 11% of elderly persons with angular <b>cheilitis</b> and in up to 18% of denture wearers who have angular <b>cheilitis.</b> Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking.|$|E

50|$|Actinic <b>cheilitis</b> (abbreviated to AC, also termed actinic cheilosis, actinic keratosis of lip, solar cheilosis, sailor's lip, farmer's lip), is <b>cheilitis</b> (lip inflammation) {{caused by}} long term {{sunlight}} exposure. Essentially it is a burn, and {{a variant of}} actinic keratosis which occurs on the lip. It is a premalignant condition, as it can develop into squamous cell carcinoma (a type of mouth cancer).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} causes of {{allergic}} contact <b>cheilitis</b> is lip cosmetics, including lipsticks and lip balm, followed by toothpastes. A lipstick allergy {{can be difficult}} to diagnose in some cases as it is possible that <b>cheilitis</b> can develop without the person even wearing lipstick. Instead, small exposure such as kissing someone who is wearing lipstick is enough to cause the condition.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{systemic}} {{disorders are}} involved in angular <b>cheilitis</b> {{by virtue of their}} association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. Such examples include people with anorexia nervosa. [...] Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. More still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like Candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular <b>cheilitis</b> by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular <b>cheilitis.</b> In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores {{at the corner of the}} mouth. Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular <b>cheilitis</b> may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular <b>cheilitis.</b> Angular <b>cheilitis</b> may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. Angular <b>cheilitis</b> is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, or sideropenic dysphagia (also called Plummer-Vinson syndrome or Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome).|$|E
5000|$|Orofacial granulomatosis is {{enlargement}} of lips {{due to the}} formation of non-caseating granulomatous inflammation, which obstruct lymphatic drainage of the orofacial soft tissues, causing lymphedema. Essentially, granulomatous <b>cheilitis</b> refers to the lip swelling that accompanies this condition. [...] "Median cheilitis" [...] may be seen, which is fissuring in the midline of the lips due to the {{enlargement of}} the lips. Angular <b>cheilitis</b> may also be associated with orofacial granulomatosis.|$|E
