5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman. It was {{originally}} planned that series four would <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Christmas special. It {{would have been}} a pastiche of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, with Sarah Jane being shown Christmas past, present and future by a guide. Tom Baker was considered at one point for the role of the guide.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Braunschweig {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise in June and July, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> winter training cruise. During torpedo training on 16 February 1905, Wörth ran aground off Stollergrund; Braunschweig unsuccessfully attempted to pull her free and other ships were called to come to Wörths aid. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. On 22 November, Prince Heinrich boarded the ship in Kiel, which then steamed to Denmark to take Prince Carl of Denmark to Norway, where he was crowned Haakon VII of Norway. Braunschweig was back in Kiel by 30 November. On 14 December, Braunschweig was replaced as the deputy commander's flagship by the battleship , which had larger facilities for a command staff.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Elsass {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise during the summer, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> winter training cruise. For Elsass, her career began with squadron training in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in May, followed by the summer cruise in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. KzS Reinhard Scheer replaced Bachmann in October 1907. The winter cruise that year went to the Baltic.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} second inauguration on March 4, 1901, William and Ida McKinley {{undertook}} a six-week {{tour of the}} nation. Traveling mostly by rail, the McKinleys were to travel through the South to the Southwest, and then up the Pacific coast and east again, to <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> visit on June 13, 1901, to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. However, the First Lady fell ill in California, causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches {{he had planned to}} give urging trade reciprocity. He also postponed the visit to the fair until September, planning a month in Washington and two in Canton before the Buffalo visit.|$|E

25|$|Thirty conference seasons <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single-elimination tournament. Traditionally, all conference {{schools are}} eligible, {{regardless}} of record. However, some conferences, {{most notably the}} Big East, do not invite the teams with the worst records. The conference tournament winner receives an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. A school that wins the conference regular season title is guaranteed an NIT bid; however, it may receive an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
25|$|During {{their senior}} year, while still {{completing}} upper-division Cluster Courses, students are also {{required to complete}} a six-credit senior capstone project in order to graduate. The capstone integrates class work with community-based work. These projects are integrated with local community organizations, and cover {{a wide range of}} issues, from social justice to grantwriting, environmental conservation, youth education, and more. Capstone courses often <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> public presentation from the students on their experiences with the community organization or cause which they explored.|$|E

Although Sahashi had rejected the possibility of a business affiliation with another English school, Benesse Corporation (parent company of Berlitz Language Schools and provider of home nursing services) announced {{that it would not be}} undertaking any business relationship with Nova and saw no synergy between the two companies.|$|E
25|$|I want to <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few {{remarks about}} the {{domestic}} scene {{and the role of}} Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, yoga {{was taught}} one on one—one teacher {{teaching}} one student at a time. In modern times, yoga {{is more often}} taught in group classes. The Jivamukti In-Class Private (or ICP) allows students to experience both methods of teaching simultaneously: the student {{and his or her}} private certified Jivamukti Yoga teacher together attend a regular group class. From beginning to end, the student practices with the guidance and hands-on assists of the private teacher. ICPs always <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special deep relaxation yoga massage in shavasana, or corpse pose. An ICP can be adapted to almost any Jivamukti Yoga class, but is most frequently given in an Open class.|$|E

25|$|It {{was in the}} Baroque {{period that}} the writing of fugues became central to composition, in part as a {{demonstration}} of compositional expertise. Fugues were incorporated {{into a variety of}} musical forms. Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Johann Jakob Froberger and Dieterich Buxtehude all wrote fugues, and George Frideric Handel included them in many of his oratorios. Keyboard suites from this time often <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fugal gigue. Domenico Scarlatti has only a few fugues among his corpus of over 500 harpsichord sonatas. The French overture featured a quick fugal section after a slow introduction. The second movement of a sonata da chiesa, as written by Arcangelo Corelli and others, was usually fugal.|$|E
500|$|The text, {{addressed}} to God, expresses faith, thankfulness and simple humility. The recorder ritornello {{is written in}} concertante style, with constantly flowing semiquaver figures, unhurried with no hint of virtuosity. It contrasts with the sustained quavers of the cantabile vocal part, which is imbued with the qualities of a [...] "simple song". The aria follows the same scheme as the first alto aria, with the text divided into two halves, each sung twice, interspersed with instrumental interludes which <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> da capo reprise of the ritornello.|$|E
500|$|The vast moral {{chasm between}} Erictho and the Sibyl is nicely brought out by Lucan's {{account of their}} {{respective}} preparations. While the Sibyl piously insists that the unburied corpse of Misenus (exanimum corpus, Aen. 6.149) must be properly buried before Aeneas embarks on his underworld journey, Erictho specifically requires an unburied corpse (described similarly as exanimes artus, 720) for her undertaking. As [...] Masters points out, {{there is a clear}} connection between Erictho's cadaver and Virgil's Misenus. This facilitates one further inversion: whereas the Sibyl's rites begin within a burial, Erictho's <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> burial.|$|E

500|$|Walker uses a {{standard}} I-IV-V twelve-bar blues {{structure for the}} song {{and it has been}} notated in 12/8 time in the key of G with a tempo of 66 beats per minute. [...] The lyrics chronicle the feelings of lost love through the days of week, starting on Monday: [...] "They call it stormy Monday, but Tuesday's just as bad". [...] The mood improves by Friday, when [...] "the eagle flies", a metaphor for payday, which allows for carousing on Saturday. [...] The lyrics end with Sunday, [...] "when the blues and spirituals converged [...] a continuation of a trend used by earlier Mississippi Delta blues singers" [...] and <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> prayer asking for the Lord's help because the singer's [...] "Crazy about my baby, yeah send her back to me".|$|E
500|$|The game {{allows the}} player to request {{chemical}} and nuclear tactical strikes against the enemy. A chemical attack is automatically targeted at an enemy capital city, and will <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> readout announcing {{the outcome of}} the attack, such as civilian casualties. In order to launch a strategic nuclear attack, the player is given 30 seconds to call a dedicated 1-800 telephone number and obtain a special authorisation code from the automated answerphone message. Once the authorisation code has been received, the player will be given three separate options on how to proceed. Standby mode will postpone the nuclear launch, whereas a strategic launch will involve one nuclear warhead targeting a city. The third option, known as [...] "Fire-Plan", will issue a full-scale nuclear strike across Europe and may result in a nuclear holocaust, which will end the game.|$|E
500|$|In February 2001, {{during his}} {{extensive}} promotion for the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass, Harrison named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] among his three favourite tracks on the album. The electronic press kit accompanying the release included {{a scene where}} Harrison plays back the song at his Friar Park studio and isolates {{certain parts of the}} recording in turn, such as the backing vocals and slide guitars. In the CD booklet, Harrison's liner notes <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thank-you to [...] "the amazing Mr. Phil Spector" [...] and the acknowledgement: [...] "He helped me so much to get this record made. In his company I came to realise the true value of the Hare Krishna Mantra." [...] The Pope-related lyrics in [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] were again omitted from the booklet; they similarly do not appear on the lyric sheet supplied with the 2014 Apple Years reissue.|$|E
