60|$|But the {{rigorous}} {{conditions of the}} Method of Difference are not yet satisfied; for we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that these unpoisonous bodies agree with the poisonous substances in every property, except the particular one of entering into a difficultly decomposable compound with the animal tissues. To render the method strictly applicable, we need an instance, not of a different substance, but {{of one of the}} very same substances, in circumstances which would prevent it from forming, with the tissues, the sort of compound in question; and then, if death does not follow, our case is made out. Now such instances are afforded by the antidotes to these poisons. For example, in case of poisoning by arsenious acid, if hydrated peroxide of iron is administered, the destructive agency is instantly checked. Now this peroxide is known to combine with the acid, and form a compound, which, being insoluble, can not act at all on animal tissues. So, again, sugar is a well-known antidote to poisoning by salts of copper; and sugar reduces those salts either into metallic copper, or into the red sub-oxide, neither of which enters into combination with animal matter. The disease called painter’s colic, so common in manufactories of white-lead, is unknown where the workmen are accustomed to take, as a preservative, sulphuric acid lemonade (a solution of sugar rendered acid by sulphuric acid). Now diluted sulphuric acid has the property of decomposing all compounds of lead with organic matter, or of preventing them from being formed.|$|E
60|$|To {{this must}} be added, that when we know the causes, {{we may be able}} to judge whether there exists any known cause capable of counteracting them, while as long as they are unknown, we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> but that if we did know them, we could predict their {{destruction}} from causes actually in existence. A bed-ridden savage, who had never seen the cataract of Niagara, but who lived within hearing of it, might imagine that the sound he heard would endure forever; but if he knew it to be the effect of a rush of waters over a barrier of rock which is progressively wearing away, he would know that within a number of ages which may be calculated it will be heard no more. In proportion, therefore, to our ignorance of the causes on which the empirical law depends, we can be less assured that it will continue to hold good; and the further we look into futurity, the less improbable is it that some one of the causes, whose co-existence gives rise to the derivative uniformity, may be destroyed or counteracted. With every prolongation of time the chances multiply of such an event; that is to say, its non-occurrence hitherto becomes a less guarantee of its not occurring within the given time. If, then, it is only to cases which in point of time are adjacent (or nearly adjacent) to those which we have actually observed, that any derivative law, not of causation, can be extended with an assurance equivalent to certainty, much more is this true of a merely empirical law. Happily, for the purposes of life it is to such cases alone that we can almost ever have occasion to extend them.|$|E

6000|$|... § 6. The {{first of}} the two {{arguments}} {{in support of the}} theory that axioms are a priori truths, having, I think, been sufficiently answered; I proceed to the second, which is usually the most relied on. Axioms (it is asserted) are conceived by us not only as true, but as universally and necessarily true. Now, experience can not possibly give to any proposition this character. I may have seen snow a hundred times, and may have seen that it was white, but this can not give me entire assurance even that all snow is white; much less that snow must be white. “However many instances we may have observed of the truth of a proposition, there is nothing to assure us that the next case shall not be an exception to the rule. If it be strictly true that every ruminant animal yet known has cloven hoofs, we still <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that some creature will not hereafter be discovered which has the {{first of the}}se attributes, without having the other.... Experience must always consist of a limited number of observations; and, however numerous these may be, they can show nothing with regard to the infinite number of cases in which the experiment has not been made.” Besides, Axioms are not only universal, they are also necessary. Now “experience can not offer the smallest ground for the necessity of a proposition. She can observe and record what has happened; but she can not find, in any case, or in any accumulation of cases, any reason for what must happen. She may see objects side by side; but she can not see a reason why they must ever be side by side. She finds certain events to occur in succession; but the succession supplies, in its occurrence, no reason for its recurrence. She contemplates external objects; but she can not detect any internal bond, which indissolubly connects the future with the past, the possible with the real. To learn a proposition by experience, and to see it to be necessarily true, are two altogether different processes of thought.”(76) And Dr. Whewell adds, “If any one does not clearly comprehend this distinction of necessary and contingent truths, he {{will not be able to}} go along with us in our researches into the foundations of human knowledge; nor, indeed, to pursue with success any speculation on the subject.”(77) ...|$|E

Creativity was measured by the test for creative thinking - drawing production of Urban and Jellen, academic performance by general achievement, and academic preferences by a questionnaire. The sample comprised final primary school graders. Low and statistically significant positive correlation was found between creativity and school achievement in the sub-sample of girls.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and provide an overview of occupational therapy interventions and their impacts on persons with stroke that rehabilitate within inpatient care. The data has been collected through a systematic search of published scientific articles. The authors of this study have selected keywords with the purpose of the study in mind, they have also chosen to use databases that are oriented towards medicine and health. In the data analysis, an occupational therapy process model was used to classify which types of intervention and assessments that were used on persons with stroke in inpatient care. The results of the study indicate that people with stroke, who was rehabilitated in inpatient care, receive more functional training than activity training and that most of the occupational therapy intervention <b>are</b> <b>not</b> likely neither client-centered nor activity-based. Another result of the study indicates that occupational therapists in inpatient care, most frequently measure people's level of functioning, in an objective manner. Further it’s shown that, in most cases the effect of occupational therapy intervention on functional level does not show any significant difference. Other studies have also found that functional training is used more frequently as occupational therapy interventions and also that functional training, in most cases did not show any significant difference. In the scientific articles nearly all occupational therapists worked in teams and the authors <b>can</b> there for <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> whether the conclusions only depend on the occupational therapy intervention.

Those who {{considered}} the dictum de omni {{as the foundation}} of the syllogism, looked upon arguments in a manner corresponding to the erroneous view which Hobbes took of propositions. Because there are some propositions which are merely verbal, Hobbes, in order apparently that his definition might be rigorously universal, defined a proposition as if no propositions declared any thing except the meaning of words. If Hobbes was right; if no further account than this could be given of the import of propositions; no theory could be given but the commonly received one, of the combination of propositions in a syllogism. If the minor premise asserted nothing more than that something belongs to a class, and if the major premise asserted nothing of that class except that it is included in another class, the conclusion would only be that what was included in the lower class is included in the higher, and the result, therefore, nothing except that the classification is consistent with itself. But we have seen that it is no sufficient account of the meaning of a proposition, to say that it refers something to, or excludes something from, a class. Every proposition which conveys real information asserts a matter of fact, dependent on the laws of nature, and not on classification. It asserts that a given object does or does not possess a given attribute; or it asserts that two attributes, or sets of attributes, do or do not (constantly or occasionally) co-exist. Since such is the purport of all propositions which convey any real knowledge, and since ratiocination is a mode of acquiring real knowledge, any theory of ratiocination which does not recognize this import of propositions, <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> we may <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>be</b> the true one.|$|R

5000|$|This module {{introduces}} two new sorts, {{and a set}} of rewrite rules. We {{also include}} our previous module, to illustrate how equations and rewrite rules differ. The rewrite rules is thought of as a set of legal state changes, so while equations hold the same meaning {{on both sides of the}} equality sign, rewrite rules do not (rewrite rules use a => token instead of an equality sign). You are still the same person after you're married (this is open for debate), but something has changed, your marital status at least. So this is illustrated by a rewrite rule, not an equation.

5000|$|Salahuddin's father sultan Ali {{had been}} engaged in a mortal combat against the Portuguese in Melaka. Hostilities paused {{temporarily}} after his death. However, in September 1537 an Acehnese fleet appeared before Melaka, carrying a standing regiment of circa 3,000 men. The Acehnese landed successfully but could not invest the fortress. After some ferocious fighting they had to withdraw with great losses after two days.

The much later chronicle Bustanus Salatin (c. 1640) alleges that Salahuddin lived for nine years after his deposition until his death in 1548. It is thus somewhat unclear whether he was deposed before or after the launch of an unsuccessful attack on Melaka. Hoesein Djajadiningrat believed that the coup came first and the attack was led by Alauddin al-Kahar, while Denys Lombard places the coup two years after the attack, which he believes was led by Salahuddin himself.|$|E
50|$|According to Shi‘ites, {{people know}} that they are possessed by Allah, but that acting while under that possession, without His permission, is evil. If they are to gain His favor, but <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of the righteousness of their actions, there must be a prophet to give that permission, and to inform them of that which they do not know and of the rewards of {{obedience}} and punishments of disobedience. The prophets teach that which is needed to live a righteous life. In addition, according to philosophical and theological doctrines, to establish the rule of Grace and the clarity of the Divine message, Allah sent selected individuals as prophets to guide the people, to establish a social system, and {{to put an end to}} intellectual and social disputes. Thus, they believe that discharging of such a heavy responsibility is only possible if the prophet is immune from any error, and always reflects all aspects of truth and the Divine Will. Therefore, in their perspective, it is only in this way that people are guided and can form a wholesome social system, and that the philosophy behind the sending of the prophets necessitates their infallibility, and that their thoughts, actions, and sayings reflect Divine Will. Therefore, Allah does not guide via authoritative texts (i.e. the Qur'an and Hadith) alone, but also through specially endowed individuals known as Imams. Shi‘ites believe that status and authority attributed to Imams would have been senseless if they were prone to the same weaknesses found in ordinary people, therefore, that the prophets must be infallible (ma'sum) for the same reason that they were sent. In other words, they believe that the ismah or infallibility of the messengers establishes the authenticity of the message: To be required to follow a prophet who commits sin is a contradiction.|$|E
