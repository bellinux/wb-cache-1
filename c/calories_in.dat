5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into <b>calories</b> (<b>in</b> a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E

40|$|Background Obesity {{was known}} to be caused by {{imbalance}} in energy in food consumption and energy output in daily activities. It has become a public health epidemic all over the world. Obesity associated diseases has brought large burden on the healthcare systems. Morbidity and mortality related to obesity are increasing. Overconsumption of calorie from away-home-food has a large contribution to the epidemic. Dining out frequently is associated with overconsumption of <b>calorie</b> <b>in</b> food selected and intake, in which its popularity is on the rise. Calorie labeling on restaurant menus has got mixed evidence on reducing <b>calorie</b> <b>in</b> food selection and consumption. This paper aims to review and synthesize relevant evidence among randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of energy labeling in restaurant menu and total energy in food purchase and consumption so that possible causal relationship could be inferred and implications on future researches and policies could be provided. Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Cochrane Library to locate relevant articles in English that examined the effectiveness of calorie labeling on energy reduction in food selection and consumption from 1966 to 30 June 2014. Results Twelve RCTs were included, with most of them (nine studies) conducted in the US. Overall, all the studies evaluated the effectiveness of calorie labeling on energy in food selection, 4 RCTs involved evaluated the effectiveness of calorie labeling on energy in food consumption. Studies were categorized into groups of real, laboratory and simulated settings for comparisons. In total, eight out of twelve RCTs revealed a significant <b>calorie</b> reduction <b>in</b> food selection with energy labeling, with proportional calorie reduction ranging from 8. 3 % to 36. 7 %. While in evaluating the effectiveness of calorie labeling on food consumption, three out of the four RCTs showed a significant <b>calorie</b> reduction <b>in</b> the intervention group, with proportional energy reduction ranging from 6. 2 % to 11. 4 %. One RCT showed a significant increase <b>in</b> <b>calorie</b> consumption after the study meal. Six of the 12 studies had recruited normal weight participants, and they found mixed results <b>in</b> <b>calorie</b> reduction of food selection with energy labeling, while 4 RCTs recruited averagely overweight participants and found significant <b>calorie</b> reduction <b>in</b> food selection. This difference <b>in</b> effectiveness of <b>calorie</b> labeling among various weight status of participants suggested that this policy would be more effective in secondary prevention of obesity rather than primary prevention. There was more evidence showing that calorie labeling is effective on reducing <b>calorie</b> <b>in</b> food selection in consumption in this systematic review among studies reviewing <b>calorie</b> reduction <b>in</b> food selection and consumption at a short period of time. Conclusions Mandating calorie labeling on restaurant menus could possibly reduce the energy in food selection and consumption. A minimal reduction <b>in</b> <b>calorie</b> <b>in</b> food selection and consumption might possibly bring a large population benefit. However, more scientifically rigorous researches were called for a longer exposure period of time to evaluate its sustainability in altering people's eating behaviour. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

25|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{physiology}} of starvation, in 1944 Keys carried out a starvation study with 36 conscientious objectors as test subjects in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. At the time, conscientious objectors were being placed in virtual concentration camps, with a few functioning like the Civilian Public Service, so that recruiting them would prove easier than seeking out volunteers in the general population. The original pool of 400 responders was reduced to 36 selectees, of whom 32 {{would go on to}} complete the study. The main focus of the study was threefold: set a metabolic baseline for three months, study the physical and mental effects of starvation on the volunteers for six months, and then study the physical and mental effects of different refeeding protocols on them for three months. The participants would first be placed on the three-month baseline diet of 3200 calories after which their calories were reduced to 1800 calories/day while expending 3000 <b>calories</b> <b>in</b> activities such as walking.

500|$|Another {{issue that}} has been {{difficult}} to understand is how they took off.

Later research shows them instead as being warm-blooded and having powerful flight muscles, and using the flight muscles for walking as quadrupeds. Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth and Mike Habib of Johns Hopkins University suggested that pterosaurs used a vaulting mechanism to obtain flight. The tremendous power of their winged forelimbs would enable them to take off with ease. Once aloft, pterosaurs could reach speeds of up to [...] and travel thousands of kilometres.|$|E

500|$|The caloric {{content and}} {{structure}} of medieval diet varied over time, from region to region, and between classes. However, for most people, the diet tended to be high-carbohydrate, {{with most of the}} budget spent on, and the majority of calories provided by, cereals and alcohol (such as beer). Even though meat was highly valued by all, lower classes often could not afford it, nor were they allowed by the church to consume it every day. In England in the 13th century, meat contributed a negligible portion of calories to a typical harvest worker's diet; however, its share increased after the Black Death and, by the 15th century, it provided about 20% of the total. Even among the lay nobility of medieval England, grain provided 65–70% of <b>calories</b> <b>in</b> the early 14th century, though a generous provision of meat and fish was included, and their consumption of meat increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Black Death as well. In one early 15th-century English aristocratic household for which detailed records are available [...] (that of the Earl of Warwick), gentle members of the household received a staggering [...] of assorted meats in a typical meat meal in the autumn and [...] in the winter, in addition to [...] of bread and [...] of beer or possibly wine (and there would have been two meat meals per day, five days a week, except during Lent).

2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that soft drinks could play a special role in weight gain. One four-week experiment compared a 450 calorie/day supplement of sugar-sweetened soft drinks to a 450 calorie/day supplement of jelly beans. The jelly bean supplement {{did not lead to}} weight gain, but the soft drink supplement did. The likely reason for the difference in weight gain is that people who consumed the jelly beans lowered their caloric intake at subsequent meals, while people who consumed soft drinks did not. Thus, the low levels of satiety provided by sugar-sweetened soft drinks may explain their association with obesity. That is, people who consume <b>calories</b> <b>in</b> sugar-sweetened beverages may fail to adequately reduce their intake of calories from other sources. Indeed, people consume more total <b>calories</b> <b>in</b> meals and on days when they are given sugar-sweetened beverages than when they are given artificially sweetened beverages or water. However, these results are contradicted by a study by Adam Drewnowski published in 2004, in which [...] "32 subjects consumed a 300-calorie snack of fat-free raspberry cookies or regular cola on two occasions each – either two hours ("early") or 20 minutes ("late") before lunch."
