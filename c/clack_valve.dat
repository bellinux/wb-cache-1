5000|$|A check valve, <b>clack</b> <b>valve,</b> {{non-return}} valve, reflux valve, or one-way valve is a valve {{that normally}} allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it {{in only one}} direction.|$|E
5000|$|In 1559, Taqi al-Din {{invented a}} six-cylinder 'Monobloc' pump. It was a hydropowered water-raising machine {{incorporating}} valves, suction and delivery pipes, piston rods with lead weights, trip levers with pin joints, and cams on the axle of a water-driven scoop-wheel. His 'Monobloc' pump could also create a partial vacuum, which was formed [...] "as the lead weight moves upwards, it pulls the piston with it, creating vacuum which sucks the water through a non return <b>clack</b> <b>valve</b> into the piston cylinder." ...|$|E
50|$|Larger {{quarries}} used big rotary {{machines that}} required {{huge amounts of}} down thrust and high rotation speeds to drive the tri-cone bit hard enough to crush the rock. This system could not be successfully used for holes below 6 inches (150mm) and the machines were very expensive to buy and to run. Another system in use was the very primitive cable tool machine (or bash and splash as it was known by the drillers) which caused a heavy bar and chisel to be lifted and dropped on the rock to crush it whilst water was introduced to create a slurry, which in the process, enabled the hole to be drilled. This system could not guarantee a finished hole size and only pure vertical holes could be drilled as the system basically relied on gravity. Debris from the hole was baled out using a baling tube with a <b>clack</b> <b>valve,</b> which was periodically dropped on a winch to capture the slurry, which was then brought {{to the top of}} the hole to be discharged.|$|E
50|$|The Franco-Crosti boiler is a {{modification}} of the conventional fire tube boiler design used on most steam locomotives. Unlike conventional boilers the heat remaining in the exhaust gases is used to preheat the water supply for the main boiler using a secondary heat exchange mechanism. This mechanism, known as the feedwater heater is essentially a secondary boiler. The preheated feedwater is fed at full boiler pressure into the main boiler via <b>clack</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Superheating of {{the boiler}} was first applied to no. 3702, Halifax in June 1910. All {{of the class}} had been fitted with superheaters by 1912. Boiler feed was {{originally}} by <b>clack</b> <b>valves</b> fitted to {{the underside of the}} barrel. Top feed was introduced in 1912 and new cast iron chimneys in 1921. The slide valves were replaced by 8 in semi-plug piston valves from 1914. All the engines were fitted with steam reversing gear but only a few, including no. 3716 City of London, had the gear replaced by the screw reverse. The Dean suspension bogie was replaced by a bogie developed from the type used on the de Glehn Atlantics.|$|R
5000|$|The Wheel Wreck is {{the remains}} of a {{shipwreck}} lying in Crow sound off Little Ganinick in the Isles of Scilly. [...] The wreck site consists of a discrete mound of cargo, that appears to consist of numerous sizes of different iron wheels, cogs, <b>clack</b> <b>valves,</b> tubes and boiler pipes. Lead scupper pipes and other small artefact material show the ship was once present, however, not much remains of this vessel today. [...] A Trotmann style anchor lies some 60m from the site, and this along with the cargo, date the site as sometime just after 1835. It has been published that this may be the wreck of the Padstow, however, being lost in 1804 this can not be so as neither boiler tubes or Trotmann anchors were invented back then. The wreck was discovered by local divers Todd Stevens and Phillip Roberts in 2005 and investigated by the archaeological contractor for the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 in 2006. It still remains unidentified.|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} numerical method, {{realizing the}} splitting scheme, quick-acting method for {{the solution of}} matrix problems and high-precision approximation schemes, has been developed in the paper for the determination of statical and vibratory loads of liquid on constructions. The applicability of the method both with small and overtransition Reynolds numbers has been proved. The reason of the pressure hightened gradients in the reception angular <b>clack</b> <b>valve</b> and {{in the region of}} hightened loads in a pipe-line has been determined. It has been shown, that a vortex trail behind a prominent part of an underwater device is the reason of the effectiveness decrease for a screw of the device. Aerodynamic forces, resulted from the movement of automobiles GAZ- 2410, GAZ- 3105, have been determined as well as the effectiveness and optimum size of a mounted flap for a KAMAZ autotrain. The method has been applied to the solution of technical problems, requiring the investigation of the interaction of complex form constructions with non-stationary viscous incompressible flows. Characteristics, giving the possibilities for the determination of ways for the construction reliability and effectiveness increase at the design, are the investigation results. The method gives the possibility of the replacement of the natural experiment by the numerical experiment. The investigation results make it possible to accelerate and reduce the price of the process of the construction optimization design. The paper results may find their field of application in general machine building, ship building, automobile industry, chemical machine buildingAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The human larynx is a {{miscellaneous}} organ, which main {{functions are}} phonation, protection, and {{regulation of the}} air ways. The VF and the FVF make up the laryngeal double valve that {{is required for the}} ability of building up the abdominal prelum. With the loss of the larynx, the person concerned suffers from many handicaps, amongst others, the disability to build up abdominal pressure. The development of a self-regulating double <b>clack</b> <b>valve</b> for a functional laryngeal prosthesis {{is the subject of this}} thesis. The valve was designed to imitate the laryngeal double valve function. A model with a narrow and a wide inlet was built to abstract the larynx and its vocal folds and false vocal folds as clacks. When using the narrow inlet model, it was shown, that the FVC were closed during expiration, whereas the VC were closed during inspiration. Whereas using the wide inlet demonstrated that the VC were closed during expiration and the FVC were closed during inspiration. To sim ulate fluid flow the angle of the VC and of the FVC, the distance between both clacks and the flow rate were altered against each other. During certain simulations vortices were built between the clacks, which build up pressure upon the particular clack and initiated the closure. Vortices occurred significantly more often during simulations with a narrow inlet than a wide one. The developed "two way clack valve" was shown to be working well while using the narrow inlet. Furthermore the narrow inlet model describes the natural conditions in the human larynx more appropriate than the wide one. The designed valve represents a fundament for future work on the functional laryngeal prosthesis...|$|E
50|$|The first models {{featured}} a 493cc (80x98mm) single ported cylinder-head, {{topped by a}} cast-aluminium enclosure for the rockers, with exposed valve springs. Alongside the cast barrel were plated tubes to cover the pushrods. Easy cam contours and wide bases on the tappets ensured no associated <b>valve</b> <b>clack,</b> meaning that the Sloper was regarded by many {{as one of the}} smoothest and quietest of sporting 500cc machines. The large crankcase accommodated both a large and heavy flywheel, and a separate oil feed tank controlled by a hand meter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Laser {{cladding}} of Co-base alloy on the sealing {{surfaces of}} nuclear <b>valve</b> <b>clacks</b> has been performed with a 5 KW CO 2 transverse flowing laser. The laser cladding was compared with plasma spraying. Both laser cladded and plasma sprayed zones {{were characterized by}} optical and scanning electron microscopes. The high temperature impact-slide wear resistance of laser cladded and plasma sprayed coatings were studied. The experimental results showed that {{compared with that of}} plasma sprayed coating, the laser cladded coating has higher microhardness, more uniform microstructure, smaller grain size, lower dilution rate, and fewer pores and impurities. The experimental results also showed that the weight loss of plasma sprayed coating during the high temperature impact-slide wear is two times larger than that of laser cladded coating...|$|R
