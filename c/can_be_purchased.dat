5|$|In the post-apocalyptic environment, {{ammunition}} is a {{rare and}} essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse, military-grade ammunition is used as currency. Players can avoid consuming all the valuable currency by using lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and other items. The military-grade ammunition {{can be used to}} purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. Weapon attachments, such as scopes and silencers, which improve weapon efficiency, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>purchased</b> with these bullets.|$|E

5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil.

5|$|Some 5,000,000 half dollars were struck, {{far beyond}} the actual demand, and half of them were melted.

The pieces <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>purchased</b> in circulated condition for less than $20; coins in near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 the makers of the Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E
5|$|The Norse-American medal {{is not a}} coin, and is {{not legal}} tender.
