40|$|Recent visual marking {{studies have}} shown that the <b>carry-over</b> <b>of</b> distractor {{inhibition}} can impair the ability of singletons to capture attention if the singleton and distractors share features. The current study extends this finding to first-order motion targets and distractors, clearly separated in time by a visual cue (the letter X). Target motion discrimination was significantly impaired, a result attributed to the <b>carry-over</b> <b>of</b> distractor inhibition. Increasing the difficulty of cue detection increased the motion target impairment, as distractor inhibition is thought to increase under demanding (high load) conditions in order to maximize selection efficiency. The apparent conflict with studies reporting reduced distractor inhibition under high load conditions was resolved by distinguishing between the effects of “cognitive” and “perceptual ” load...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined. Here, appropriation is recognized as another source of lyric expression, critical innovation, and conceptual development in contemporary poetry.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of tolerance to cloxacillin and methicillin was studied in Staphylococcus aureus. It was {{demonstrated that the}} minimal bactericidal concentrations showed marked differences, depending on the method of detection used. These differences resulted from <b>carry-over</b> <b>of</b> the antibiotic to the subculture plates. When <b>carry-over</b> <b>of</b> the antibiotic was prevented {{by the addition of}} beta-lactamase to the nutrient medium, the antibiotics were no longer bactericidal. At a certain antibiotic concentration and at higher concentrations, however, each strain showed a certain survival percentage after 24 h. The tolerance percentage was determined for 15 strains. The values found for the individual strains ranged from less than 0. 1 to 11 % for cloxacillin and methicillin. since these percentages were reproducible within narrow limits, they could be regarded as a characteristic of the strains. The tolerance percentage was independent of the growth phase of the initial cultures...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} dose {{recovery}} experiments are undertaken on grains of potassium-rich feldspar using a single aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) protocol, measuring the post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence signal (post-IR IRSL). The ability to successfully recover a laboratory dose {{depends upon the}} size of the test dose used. It is shown that using current SAR protocols, the magnitude of the luminescence response (Tx) to the test dose is dependent upon {{the size of the}} luminescence signal (Lx) from the prior regeneration dose because the post-IR IRSL signal is not reduced to a low level at the end of measuring Lx. Charge originating from the regeneration dose is carried over into measurement of Tx. When the test dose is small (i. e. 1 %? 15 % of the given dose) this <b>carry-over</b> <b>of</b> charge dominates the signal arising from the test dose. In such situations, Tx is not an accurate measure of sensitivity change. Unfortunately, because the <b>carry-over</b> <b>of</b> charge is so tightly coupled {{to the size of the}} signal arising from the regeneration dose, standard tests such as recycling will not identify this failure of the sensitivity correction. The <b>carry-over</b> <b>of</b> charge is due to the difficulty of removing the post-IR IRSL signal from feldspars during measurement, and is in stark contrast with the fast component of the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signal from quartz for which the SAR protocol was originally designedPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R

40|$|According to Locke, {{appropriation}} is {{a precondition}} for moral responsibility and thus we can expect that it plays a distinctive role in his theory. Yet it is rare to find an interpretation of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that does not associate it with serious problems. To {{make room for a}} more satisfying understanding of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> we have to analyse why it was so widely misunderstood. The aim of this paper is fourfold: First, I will show that Mackie’s and Winkler’s interpretations that have shaped the subsequent discussion contain serious flaws. Second, I will argue that the so-called appropriation interpretation —that is the view that appropriation is meant to provide alternative persistence conditions for persons—lacks support. Third, I will re-examine Locke’s texts and argue that we can come {{to a better understanding of}} his notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in the Essay if we interpret it in analogy to his account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in Two Treatises. Fourth, I will offer a more fine-grained interpretation of the role <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in relation to persistence conditions for persons.
