The location of conflict areas in Mindanao was derived from Barandiaran (2002), while conflict intensity, defined as the annual number of battle-related deaths, was obtained from Gleditsch et al (2002). Following the findings of Jalan and Ravallion (1998) that education and health outcomes are key determinants of chronic poverty, the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Quality of Life Index (QLI) are used as proxy variables for chronic poverty. The HDI is a <b>composite</b> <b>index</b> of life expectancy, functional literacy, and real per capita income. The QLI is a <b>composite</b> <b>index</b> of <b>number</b> of births attended by a medical professional, under-five nutrition, and elementary cohort survival rate. T-tests of means for HDI and QLI were performed, comparing provinces with conflict and provinces without conflict.

This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{construct}} <b>composite</b> <b>index,</b> which is a linear combination of several variables, by deriving weights on the criterion of Shapley value (from cooperative game theory) that a constituent variable has in making the <b>composite</b> <b>index.</b>   In practice it is found oftentimes that the most common method of principal component analysis {{has a tendency to}} ignore (or poorly weigh) those constituent variables that do not have strong correlation with the sister variables. This elitist nature of PCA forces a compromise upon the analyst’s desire and need to incorporate those weakly correlated (but theoretically and practically important) variables into the <b>composite</b> <b>index.</b> In that case, one must construct a <b>composite</b> <b>index</b> that is more inclusive in nature.
