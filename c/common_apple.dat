6000|$|No case of {{the direct}} action of the pollen of one variety on another is better {{authenticated}} or more remarkable {{than that of the}} <b>common</b> <b>apple.</b> The fruit here consists of {{the lower part of the}} calyx and of the upper part of the flower-peduncle (11/144.

Cases of apples thus affected were recorded by Bradley in the early part of the last century; and other cases are given in old volumes of the 'Philosophical Transactions' (11/145. Volume 43 1744-45 page 525 volume 45 1747-48 page 602.); in one of these a Russeting apple and an adjoining kind mutually affected each other's fruit; and in another case a smooth apple affected a rough-coated kind.

40|$|Soil {{aggregate}} {{stability is}} an important indicator for controlling soil losses and can improve soil quality, particularly in an area such as the Loess Plateau. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the differences in soil aggregates across six different land-use systems (grassland, apple orchard, abandoned apple orchard, cropland maize, cropland wheat, and shrub-grassland). For this purpose, dry and wet sieving techniques were employed to assess aggregate content and aggregate stability. Higher percentages of water stable aggregates were observed in the abandoned apple orchard and shrub-grassland at 63 % and 61 %, respectively. The maximum dry aggregate stability (%) was recorded at 78 % and 77 % in both wheat cropland and <b>common</b> <b>apple</b> orchard, and the abandoned apple orchard was only 74 %. Both mean weight diameters and geometric mean diameters of aggregate were recorded as higher in grassland, shrub-grassland, and the abandoned apple orchard, than the other land uses. The formation of soil aggregates and their stability were positively correlated with soil organic carbon content and root biomass of different plant communities. Higher amounts of soil organic carbon content were noted in the abandoned apple orchard, <b>common</b> <b>apple</b> orchard, and natural grassland at the 0 – 20 cm soil layer. The results of the correlation coefficient showed a positive significant correlation between the mean weight diameter, geometric diameter, root biomass, and soil organic carbon content. Conclusively, the type of land use affected the soil aggregation and distribution of size fractions; the small fractions of the aggregates formed large fractions by combining with fresh organic matter, and increased soil organic carbon concentrations were closely linked with the formation of macro-aggregates. Thus, converting slope farmland to forestland and grassland could improve water-stable aggregate and reduce soil disturbances in areas (like the Loess Plateau) with the highest erosion risk...|$|E

30|$|Apple {{proliferation}} symptoms {{have also}} been frequently observed {{in the last decade}} in apple orchards in Asturias, in the North coast of Spain. This region has long tradition in cider-making, and most of the 10, 000  ha of apple orchards are cultivated almost exclusively to produce cider-apples. The majority of the surface devoted to apple production is occupied by traditional extensive orchards with big trees grown on seedling rootstocks. Since the early 1990 s, an increasing percentage of these old orchards have been substituted by new semi-intensive ones with trees growing on semi-dwarfing rootstocks (Dapena et al. 2005). Those orchards are planted with selected local cultivars tolerant to several <b>common</b> <b>apple</b> diseases (scab, canker, powdery mildew). The use of pesticide in both situations is very low, even null. Sprays are mainly made with narrow-spectrum insecticides against the codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) or the rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea Passerini). Such situation of low pressure of pesticide use potentially allows high abundance and diversity of insects in orchards (Miñarro et al. 2005, 2009). The immersion of those orchards in an agricultural landscape characterized by a mosaic of small and different-land-use plots separated by hedgerows, as well as the occurrence of a permanent rich floral groundcover, also favour insect abundance and richness (Miñarro and Prida 2013; Rosa García and Miñarro 2014).|$|E

40|$|Fire blight, {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Erwinia amylovora, attacks more than 70 members of the Rose (Rosaceae) family, and is a devastating disease of apples and pears. Symptoms Fire blight produces several different symptoms depending on the host and site of infection. The most commonly observed symptom is the characteristic “shepherd’s crook ” that develops on wilting twigs, shoots, and leaders (Figure 1). The name “fire blight ” aptly describes the blackened leaves characteristic of infections on pears (Figure 2). In apple, infected branches turn reddish brown to brown (Figure 3). Figure 1. Young shoot tips wilt when infected, resulting in a characteristic “shepherd’s crook. ” Cankers develop, and the margins become raised and blistered, eventually cracking (Figure 4). When the bark is removed, the cankered area may show red-brown streaking. Dead branches scattered throughout the canopy are common, and trees can die if infec- Figure 2.

The above-ground portions of the tree may not develop symptoms, while the susceptible rootstock is cankered. As the canker girdles the rootstock, the upper portion of the tree will develop symptoms of decline (smaller leaves, weak growth, early fall coloration).

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{potential}} role of perennial woody food-producing species ("food trees") in {{cities in the}} context of urban sustainable development and propose a multifunctional approach that combines elements of urban agriculture, urban forestry, and agroforestry into what we call "urban food forestry" (UFF). We used four approaches at different scales to gauge the potential of UFF to enhance urban sustainability and contribute to food security {{in the context of}} urbanization and climate change. First, we identified 37 current initiatives based around urban food trees, and analyzed their activities in three categories: planting, mapping, and harvesting, finding that the majority (73 %) only performed one activity, and only 8 % performed all three. Second, we analyzed 30 urban forestry master plans, finding that only 13 % included human food security among their objectives, while 77 % included habitat for wildlife. Third, we used Burlington, Vermont as a case study to quantify the potential fruit yield of publicly accessible open space if planted with Malus domestica (the <b>common</b> <b>apple)</b> under nine different planting and yield scenarios. We found that 108 % of the daily recommended minimum intake of fruit for the entire city's population could be met under the most ambitious planting scenario, with substantial potential to contribute to food security even under more modest scenarios. Finally, we developed a Climate-Food-Species Matrix of potential food trees appropriate for temperate urban environments as a decision-making tool. We identified a total of 70 species, 30 of which we deemed "highly suitable" for urban food forestry based on their cold hardiness, drought tolerance, and edibility. We conclude that substantial untapped potential exists for urban food forestry to contribute to urban sustainability via increased food security and landscape multifunctionality...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse fruit quality through consumers’ perceptions and their preferences revealed by two panel questionnaires. Among the most <b>common</b> <b>apple</b> cultivars on the Romanian markets, were chosen the ones existing simultaneously and continuously (over two-years, during January-March) : ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Braeburn’, ‘Granny Smith’, ‘Red Delicious’, ‘Jonagold’, ‘Jonathan’, ‘Florina’, ‘Idared’. The consumers’ panel for sensory evaluation was represented by students, who completed two types of questionnaires. Both questionnaires refer to foremost traits for dessert apple, such as fruit appearance (size, shape, color) and intrinsic peculiarities (pulp consistency, juiciness, taste, flavor). First questionnaire comprised different scales for the traits (1 - 3, 1 - 5 or 1 - 15), while the second one consisted of the hedonic scale (1 - 9) for all traits. For commercial appearance of the fruits were highlighted ‘Idared’, ‘Granny Smith’, ‘Braeburn’ and especially ‘Jonagold’. ‘Braeburn’ was distinct by the highest quality taste (average grade 13. 9 on the scoring taste scale 1 - 15) and also for fruit flavor. ‘Granny Smith’, a commercially attractive-looking fruit, received only an average of 6. 2 for taste and 2. 6 for flavor. ‘Granny Smith’ presented the largest value for the coefficients of variation for taste, this variety being preferred less by female than male tasters. Inconsistency of the market, prices and foreign assortment on Romanian market was illustrated by the lack of statistical correlations between commercial fruit quality and price. The study could provide useful background information for apples breeders, farmers and marketing fruits strategy. The use of different scales for panel evaluation, dependent on the relevance of traits, might be a proper solution for reducing bias. In this case, the 1 - 15 large scale for apple taste compared with lower ones for other traits assured a more appropriate image of the tasters’ preferences...|$|E
