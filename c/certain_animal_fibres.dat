40|$|A {{substantial}} up-to-date {{reference manual}} has been prepared which documents important {{issues for the}} supply chain of rare natural <b>animal</b> <b>fibres.</b> New developments in textiles have been included. Cashmere, mohair and camelid fibres have special properties of softness, smoothness and lustre, when compared with sheep wool. They also have other attributes which affect market prices and consumer perceptions, such as being rare and exotic luxuries, and are associated with expensive, comfortable and exclusive garments. These fibres add to the range of wool processing, and add value to wool textiles. Generally, knowledge about these <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> is limited, and research effort small compared with research into wool and other natural and man-made fibres. Compared with wool, rare natural <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> are more difficult and costly to process. Knowledge about processing these fibres is kept guarded as industrial knowledge. There are problems with clearly identifying rare natural <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> when goods are traded or fibres are blended, and fraud {{is a major concern}} for textile manufacturers and industry groups. Prickle discomfort in mohair and alpaca next-to-skin wear is a major concern for consumers and textile manufacturers. Natural colours, whiteness and yellowness of rare natural <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> are important fibre attributes for dyers and consumers, and the current products have both positive and negative colour attributes for processors. Past investments by RIRDC have made substantial gains in knowledge about fundamental and applied areas of knowledge on the properties, testing and processing performance of rare natural <b>animal</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R

40|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopy (SEM) {{is currently the}} most reliable method to identify <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> and to determine the composition of <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> mixtures. The SEM-analysis is time consuming and requires an operator experienced in <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> analysis. There is the need of objective criteria, which {{make it possible to}} evaluate the microscopic pictures in an automated process. One of the major problems is the detection of the edge heights of the cuticle scales. These are of particular significance for the differentiation of wool and speciality fibres. The approach pursued in this work is the analysis of two-dimensional fibre profiles, which potentially can be obtained in an automated process, either with profilometric methods or through edge detection in microscopic fibre photographs. Especially white-light interferometry, light microscopy and scanning {{electron microscopy}} are used. The profiles are submitted to Fourier-analysis and the obtained spectra are evaluated with regard to the height and length of the cuticle scales as well as to their variation. Models for <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> profiles are developed and analysed. This leads to parameters that facilitate the interpretation of the spectra of <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> profiles. One set of parameters, the area under the spectrum and the position of the main peak in the smoothed spectrum, is directly derived from the amplitude spectrum and relates to the height and length of the cuticle scales of the fibres. Another set of four parameters is obtained by fitting a symmetric distribution function to a spectrum which has a logarithmic frequency axis. This function is a mixture of the Gauß- and Lorentz-distribution. The four parameters relate to the height and length of the cuticle scales of the fibres as well as their variation. Within the context of a discriminant analysis, these parameters enable to quantitatively identify the composition of fibre mixtures. Taking into account the hit rate for single fibres, the composition of merino-cashmere mixtures can be determined with an error of 3 %. The comparison of hit rates in the discriminant analysis shows no difference between white-light interferometry, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The investigations have been conducted with merino wool with mean diameters of 17, 20, 24 and 31 µm, mohair as well as cashmere from China, Mongolia and Iran...|$|R

40|$|Softness is {{a unique}} selling point for luxury fibres such as alpaca. However, {{there is very little}} {{objective}} data on the softness of <b>animal</b> <b>fibres.</b> This study first establishes that the resistance to compression (RtC) behaviour of alpaca and wool fibres is quite different, and that the RtC method {{can not be used to}} examine the softness of different <b>animal</b> <b>fibres.</b> It then reports a new method for evaluating fibre softness. This method is based on the measurement of the force required to pull a fibre bundle through a series of parallel pins. This force, reflecting the combined effect of fibre surface properties, fibre diameter and rigidity, can achieve reasonable discrimination between fibres of varying levels of softness, such as alpaca and wool. Mechanisms responsible for the superior softness of alpaca fibres are discussed also. <br /...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} an {{important}} and challenging task to classify and evaluate the contents in wool blends. Quantitative characterisation of <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> scale patterns has attracted considerable attention, since it is the major evidence for identification and subsequent classification purpose. Although techniques such as imaging processing and linear demarcation functions have been used to identify unknown fibre type with some success, a more comprehensive approach is required to perform this task. In this paper, a new approach is presented, which employs non-linear demarcation functions by using an artificial neural network (ANN). Based on scale pattern features extracted by using image processing techniques the artificial neural network (ANN) model is to classify mohair and merino fibres. It is observed that the techniques developed in this work are very effective and have the potential to be applied to other <b>animal</b> <b>fibres.</b> <br /...|$|R

40|$|Increase {{in demand}} for <b>animal</b> natural <b>fibres</b> in recent years for the {{production}} of high quality textile products has resulted in the adulteration and false declaration of these fibres causing heavy financial loss. Fibres are expensive due to limited feedstock and less fibre production. To keep up with the demand these fibres are adulterated with less expensive fibres viz., wool to give special effect to the fabric. To control false declaration, {{there is a need for}} fibre identification and to ascertain blend composition. Though Scanning Electron Microscopy is generally used for fibre analysis but this method is time consuming, expensive and the reliability of results depend on the expertise of the microscopist. Hence, there is a need for reliable and economical method to characterize these fibres and to study composition of each <b>animal</b> <b>fibre</b> in blends. The aim of the present study was mitochondrial DNA extraction from <b>animal</b> natural <b>fibres</b> in untreated and blends. The modified protocol includes addition of Proteinase K, Dithioerythritol individually in each tube and final extraction with phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol, amplification of D-loop region using species specific and mammalian specific primers. We observed that with species specific primers, it was possible to study inter species variation but the blends could be detected if there was prior knowledge about the fibres in blends. With mammalian specific primers we could study blends and differentiate between fibres from sheep breeds but inter species variation was difficult. It can be concluded that mtDNA analysis can be used to differentiate <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> and control adulteration...|$|R

40|$|Felting is {{a unique}} {{attribute}} of <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> used {{for the production of}} a range of industrial and apparel textiles. Felting can be an adverse attribute as a consequence of dimensional shrinkage during laundering. As there is little objective information regarding the feltability of rare <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> or the factors which may affect felting three investigations were undertaken. A survey (n = 114) of the feltability of cashmere from different origins of production, cashgora, quivet, camel hair, llama, guanaco, bison wool, cow fibre and yak wool quantified the large variation between and within these fibre types. Cashmere from some origins and cashgora produced higher feltball density than the other fibres. Different nutritional management of cashmere goats (n = 35) showed that cashmere grown by poorly fed goats had a lower propensity to felt compared with cashmere grown by better fed goats. A consequence of the progressive blending of cashmere (n = 27) with a low propensity to felt superfine wool (high fibre curvature) increased the propensity of the blend to felt, but when the same cashmere was blended with low curvature superfine wool, there was little or no effect on feltability. The mechanisms which lead to variance in feltability of these fibres were quantified with multiple regression modelling. The mechanisms were similar to those reported for wools, namely variations in the resistance to compression, fibre curvature and mean fibre diameter, with likely effects of fibre crimp form. It is possible to source cashmere and other <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> which have different propensities to felt and therefore to produce textiles which are likely to have different textile properties. <br /...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, sereval {{varieties}} of <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> including cashmere and Australian fine Merino wool have been analysed by Fourier transform infrared microscope and differential scanning calorimeter. The {{results showed that}} both Chinese and Australian cashmere fibres started absorbing heat at a relatively higher temperature but were thermally degraded quicker than other <b>animal</b> <b>fibres</b> tested. However, the mass changes (within the temperature range of 200 oC to 350 oC) and associated onset temperatures varied among fibre varieties. From the attenuated total reflectance spectra, the Chinese cashmere was clearly different from Australian cashmere and wool in a peak near 1040 cm- 1 wavelength for S-O stretching of cysteic acid residues. The Chinese cashmere presented a stronger absorption at 1019 cm- 1 wavelength, while Australian cashmere and wool peaked at 1079 cm- 1 wavelength and had a weaker absorption. Combined with thermal analysis, the normalised R-SO 3 - content of cysteic acid residues to the amide II peak of the protein backbone may have potential use in identifying Australian fine Merino wool from Chinese cashmere. <br /...|$|R
