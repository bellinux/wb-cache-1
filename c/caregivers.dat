5|$|<b>Caregivers</b> use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with <b>caregivers.</b> Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. <b>Caregivers</b> find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, <b>caregivers</b> adapt their interactions accordingly. <b>Caregivers</b> also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. <b>Caregivers</b> may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E

The conceptual framework was guided by the symbolic interactionist perspective of role strain theory and related literature regarding caregiving and TBI survivors. Data were collected, in eight provinces in eastern Thailand, via nine questionnaires, and analyzed through descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and path analysis. The final model fit the data well and explained variance in <b>caregiver</b> strain (46 %), rewards of caregiving (41 %), <b>caregiver</b> health (19 %) and amount of care (33 %). The model illustrated care receiver function had a direct negative effect on amount of care.

5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from <b>caregivers</b> between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of <b>caregivers,</b> or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Dementia <b>caregivers</b> {{are subject}} to high rates of {{physical}} and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary <b>caregivers</b> include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family <b>caregivers</b> often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with <b>caregivers</b> in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive <b>caregivers</b> it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary <b>caregivers</b> and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these <b>caregivers.</b> It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary <b>caregivers</b> who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their <b>caregivers.</b> The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} and {{moderate}} stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden. Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue {{the person with the}} disease or the use of modified daily life objects. If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even pureed. When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the <b>caregivers</b> and family members. The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their <b>caregivers.</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Discrepancy between self- and <b>caregiver</b> apathy ratings was {{examined}} longitudinally {{for persons with}} mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. Particular focus was on {{the distinction between the}} positive and negative <b>caregiver</b> bias and its predictive value for a clinical diagnosis of apathy. METHOD: Apathy rating discrepancy was based on the apathy evaluation scale. Dyads were categorized depending on whether the <b>caregiver</b> reported fewer deficits (positive <b>caregiver</b> bias) or more deficits (negative <b>caregiver</b> bias) than the cognitively impaired person did. RESULTS: <b>Caregiver</b> ratings and rating discrepancy showed a significant increase from baseline to follow-up. By contrast, self- and clinician ratings showed no change across the two time points. Ratings with a negative <b>caregiver</b> bias remained stable, while those with a positive <b>caregiver</b> bias showed {{a significant increase in the}} <b>caregiver</b> ratings but also a significant decrease in the self-ratings. A negative <b>caregiver</b> bias at baseline was significantly related to greater likelihood of having clinical apathy at follow-up, adjusted for an array of control variables. CONCLUSION: Positive and negative <b>caregiver</b> bias should be distinguished, as they seem to reflect distinct dyadic processes and are relevant for clinical outcome. Furthermore, negative rating discrepancies can be considered a risk factor for developing apathy...|$|R

DESIGN: The score distributions, internal consistency and convergent validity of the <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale were determined. SUBJECTS: A total of 92 partners (53 % male, age 62 years) of patients with acquired brain injury (91 % stroke) discharged from inpatient rehabilitation (time since injury 32 months). MAIN MEASURES: Outcome measure: <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale. Reference measures: <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and CarerQoL. RESULTS: The <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale has a normal distribution, with no floor or ceiling effects. Its internal consistency is acceptable (Cronbach's alpha: 0. 75). The convergent validity analyses confirmed our hypothesis that {{higher scores on the}} <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale correlate with less burden, lower levels of anxiety and depression and greater well-being. Furthermore, partners scoring high on the <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale mostly scored below the clinical cut-off scores on the <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index and the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, whereas partners scoring low on the <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale were more likely to score above the cut-off points.

5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} children {{make use of}} multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues {{are available from the}} start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of <b>caregivers</b> and use the focus of <b>caregivers</b> to direct their word mapping.
