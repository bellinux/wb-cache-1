5|$|After briefly reading {{law with}} former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury, a family friend, in Portsmouth, {{he spent a}} {{semester}} at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts, followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst, New Hampshire. He {{was admitted to the}} New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his first <b>case,</b> <b>but</b> soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as did his personal charm and deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E

5|$|After the loss, MacShara {{withdrew from}} the <b>case</b> <b>but</b> Rudzewicz appealed the {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In the filing, Rudzewicz claimed that since they were residents of Michigan, and because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida, that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long-arm statute violated the 14th Amendment and was unconstitutional. Citing a similar case, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court's decision. The court also agreed with Rudzewicz's assertion of the constitutionality of Florida's long arm statute in its application to the case.|$|E
5|$|At Columbia, John R. Dunning {{believed}} {{that this was the}} <b>case,</b> <b>but</b> Fermi was not so sure. The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample of uranium 235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota to prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a mass spectrometer. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then carried out a series of experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.|$|E

However, Reyes says she can't call Doggett since it is about him. Meanwhile, Jeb is in a hotel room in Georgia trying to shoot himself in the head.

5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the <b>case,</b> <b>but</b> Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper <b>case,</b> <b>but</b> authorities responded that they {{have no reason to believe}} that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the ground. When the larvae hatch in late August or early September, they do not leave the egg <b>case</b> <b>but</b> remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, the larvae emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E

5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority.

Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
