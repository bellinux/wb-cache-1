5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively {{untouched by the}} outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened {{to the outside world}} in the 1970s, it became an icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for major changes in the Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a <b>celebrity</b> <b>status</b> within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) convinces Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) not {{to include}} a {{photograph}} of the glee club in the school yearbook, as in previous years, glee club photographs have been heavily defaced in the library copy of the yearbook by fellow students.

Fearing unpopularity, the club nominates Rachel (Lea Michele) to represent them in the photograph. Rachel convinces Finn (Cory Monteith) to appear alongside her, but after being teased by his peers, he drops out. When it transpires that the school photographer (John Ross Bowie) is soon to direct a commercial for his brother-in-law, a local mattress store owner, Rachel convinces him to cast the glee club in it, believing that local <b>celebrity</b> <b>status</b> will prevent the other students from mocking them.|$|E
40|$|Corporate {{communications}} {{are central}} to corporate reputation. Stock prices are driven more by perceptions than fundamental values (Fombrun, 1990, 1996) and corporate communication practices are key in shaping investors’ perceptions. While intangible assets of firms are studied widely in the strategy field, researchers have recently shifted their attention on a more narrow set of intangible assets called “social approval assets” (Pfarrer, Pollock, & Rindova, 2010) which include reputation(s) and <b>celebrity</b> <b>statuses</b> of organizations. Social approval assets derive their value from favorable collective perceptions (Pfarrer et al., 2010). This research proposes that corporate communications help shape collective perceptions and therefore contribute to building and/or sustaining social approval assets within organizations. The underlying assumptions of this research are the following: i) corporate communications can and do influence market prices; ii) different corporate communication practices are associated with different levels of impact on organizational performance; and iii) firm specific and group specific reputation have an observable effect on communications outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The wide {{readership}} {{and commercial}} {{power of the}} ghostwritten celebrity memoir are indicative of its cultural significance, yet it remains a critically overlooked, much-derided genre. With {{some of the most}} popular texts being associated with female celebrities, both the books and their female author-subjects are ‘bad objects’: viewed as inauthentic due to visible mediation and thus denied authority. This article seeks to demonstrate that, far from being a legitimate means by which to invalidate the genre, the ghostwritten <b>status</b> of <b>celebrity</b> memoir is a source of complexity that rewards critique, and, indeed, makes it an exemplary site for the study of the wider dynamics of the construction and circulation of celebrity. This reading accounts for both the collaborative authorship and the industrial conditions of these texts’ construction without dismissing them as the solely cynical manufacture of corporate merchandise. Contrasting the memoirs of Paris Hilton and Jade Goody (and their respective ghostwriters where visible) offers a productive interplay between polar class positions that enables a reading of the ways in which access to certain capitals inflects the <b>celebrity’s</b> <b>status</b> as subject of her own life story. This shows the ways in which agency in self-representation is multiple and negotiated within gendered parameters...|$|R

In 1976, he also became an author by publishing Life on the Run. Using a 20-day stretch of time during one season as the main focus of the book, he chronicled his experiences in the NBA and the people he met along the way.

5|$|Amy {{is also a}} major {{character}} in the 2003–2006 anime series Sonic X. Attacking one of Eggman's machines, Sonic triggers Chaos Control and sends him, Amy, Tails and other characters from their world to Earth. On Earth, they befriend a human boy, Chris Thorndyke and his family and friends; Amy particularly likes his maid, Ella, who teaches her to cook. She frequently tries to woo Sonic and his discomfort angers her. In one episode Amy makes a seashell bracelet, which Sonic graciously accepts; shortly afterward he saves her from drowning, and she returns the favor when one of Eggman's robots holds him underwater. Sonic also rescues Amy from Eggman's creations on other occasions. She sometimes flares up at Sonic, attacking him when she realizes that he has tricked her into acting insane. The second season opens with arcs based on Adventure and Adventure 2, where Amy reprises {{her role in the}} games. During the first and second seasons Amy and her friends—often without Sonic—are frequently together, capturing (and recapturing) Chaos Emeralds from Doctor Eggman and adjusting to their <b>celebrity</b> <b>status</b> on Earth.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} an {{immediate}} critical and popular success. The satire was heightened by Gibbons's mockery of purple prose, whereby she marked the most florid and overwritten passages of the book with asterisks, [...] "for the reader's delectation and mirth".

50|$|Among the {{rejected}} {{ideas for}} Beverly Hills Cop III included a Robert Towne screenplay idea (one in which Foley {{has to deal}} with his <b>celebrity</b> cop <b>status),</b> a scenario teaming Murphy with Sean Connery as a Scotland Yard detective, and another Axel-in-London idea where his Scotland Yard counterpart would have been played by John Cleese. The last story would have involved British gangsters loosely based on the real-life Kray brothers, who were captured in Detroit and transported to London by Jeffrey (Axel's friend from Beverly Hills Cop and Beverly Hills Cop II, played by Paul Reiser), and Axel would have gone overseas after the gangsters' henchmen broke them out of custody and murdered Jeffrey. This concept was scrapped because producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer decided it was too close to the storyline of Michael Douglas' 1989 film Black Rain.|$|R

But by the time the 1946 edition was printed, Irma was nearing 70, and her health was beginning to decline. A series of family crises and tragedies compounded the perpetual warfare with Bobbs-Merrill to leave Irma feeling weakened and concerned about the future of Joy. Deciding that she would need a collaborator for the next edition, and hoping that the book would remain a family project, she asked her daughter Marion to help her with the next version of the text, and she negotiated a clause in her contract with Bobbs-Merrill specifying that Marion was to have sole authority to complete future revisions of Joy in the event of Irma's disability or death.|$|R

The umbrella is revealed to be belonging to a group of Japanese tourists. Biniya develops a liking for the umbrella and trades it with her bear claw necklace called Yantra with the Japanese tourists. Wearing a bear claw necklace is considered to be auspicious and bring good luck. For that she is scolded by her mother. Everyone in the village is amazed by the beauty of the umbrella and Biniya acquires a <b>celebrity</b> like <b>status.</b> This makes some people jealous of her.
