40|$|This paper proposes {{contingent}} behavior {{survey questions}} {{as a valuable}} supplement to observed data in travel cost models of non-market demand for recreational resources. A set of observed and contingent behavior results for each survey respondent allows the researcher to control for individual heterogeneity {{by taking advantage of}} panel data methods when exploring the nature of respondent demands. The <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios</b> also provide opportunities to (a) test for differences between observed and contingent preferences and/or (b) assess likely demands under conditionsbeyond the domain of observed variation in costs or resource attributes. Most importantly, <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios</b> allow the researcher to imposeexogenously varying travel costs. Exogenous imposition of travel costs together with panel methods reduces the omitted variables bias that plagues observed-data travel cost models of recreational demand. Using a convenience sample of data for illustrative purposes, we show how to estimate the demand for recreational angling by combining observed and contingent behavior data. We begin with simple naive pooled Poisson models and progress to more theoretically appropriate fixed effects panel Poisson specifications.

Specifically, the paper uses a split-sample survey to investigate the effects of experience with monetary and labor payment vehicles on the acceptance of a <b>contingent</b> valuation <b>scenario</b> and protest bids.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Public {{agencies}} need {{information on}} the value of recreational activities to assist in managing fish and wildlife species. Over the past two decades economists have developed and applied techniques to measure the value of such non-marketed commodities. The contingent valuation method (CVM) is one technique used by economists to measure net benefits associated with a change in the quantity or quality of a non-marketed commodity. Unlike other techniques such as the travel cost and hedonic methods, which use market data to infer willingness to pay (WTP), CVM directly elicits willingness to pay or willingness to accept (WTA) information. CVM is used in this thesis to estimate the use value of changes in the quality of the elk hunting experience. The focus of the study is elk hunting on the Starkey Research Forest in eastern Oregon. Since 1988, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) and the U. S. Forest Service have collected data on big game hunting on this area. The Starkey data sets provide unique research opportunities because of the enclosed nature of the Starkey Research Forest (25, 000 acres surrounded by 38 miles of fence) and the duration of the survey effort (10 years). Although the surveys contain questions specific to an analysis by both the contingent valuation and travel cost methods, only the contingent valuation method is considered here. Specific objectives of the thesis research include: (1) derivation of valuation functions for the two dichotomous choice WTP and WTA elicitations, (2) estimation of changes in WTA and WTP for changes in significant explanatory variables, and (3) suggestions for improvements in future Starkey surveys. Valuation functions, as used here, provide increased flexibility over point estimates. The explanatory variables in a valuation function can be changed to obtain estimates of the corresponding changes in WTP and WTA values. The valuation functions can then be used to derive estimates of central tendency for the <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Results include an estimated median value of 113 per hunter for access to hunting and an estimated mean value per trip of 287 per hunter for increases in the elk herd (to ensure an opportunity to shoot at an elk). Additionally, the flexibility of valuation functions is demonstrated by showing how changes in the values of significant (at the. 05 level) explanatory variables affect WTP and WTA values. Four policy and three methodological implications are gleaned from the results. The four policy implications are that: (1) the elk hunting recreational experience is providing substantial benefits to Starkey hunters, (2) willingness to pay values are sensitive to the size of respondents' incomes, (3) respondents are willing to pay more to increase the elk herd {{to the point where they}} would be virtually certain of having an opportunity to shoot at an elk and (4) Starkey hunters object to the tradeoff between their right to hunt and private goods. The three methodological implications are (1) a demonstration of the flexibility of WTP functions, (2) a confirmation of the importance of using specific and unambiguous wording in the <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios,</b> and (3) a confirmation of the importance of pretests to determine the initial ranges and number of bids in dichotomous choice surveys. Two problems with the current surveys are the loss of efficiency due to the low number and narrow range of bids and the lack of specificity and ambiguous wording used in some of the <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Suggestions include increases in the number and range of the bids, the inclusion of an additional question and the inclusion of a "not for sale" category...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyAn {{inventory}} and analysis {{has been made}} of 15 non-market-based valuation studies in Central American and Caribbean countries. The method most frequently used for determining the willingness to pay for drinking water or protected areas was that of contingent valuation. Its main shortcomings were that it was based on open questions, it used <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios</b> and information frames with a low level of detail, it used small population samples, and it displayed the possible cultural and strategic skews associated with surveys of national residents. The study based on the travel cost method, for its part, was based on low-quality census data rather than on data from surveys of visitors, as well as being based on unrealistic hypotheses regarding the calculation of transport costs, the number of visitors with a single destination, and the levels of surplus consumption of international visitors. The two studies based on the hedonic valuation method were affected by the existence of heterogeneous neighbouring market segments and their inability to obtain reliable ownership values. By way of conclusion, various strategies and a research programme are suggested for improving non-market-based valuation studies in Central American and Caribbean countries...|$|R

40|$|We {{value the}} option of {{subcontracting}} to improve financial performance and system coordination by analyzing a competitive stochastic investment game with recourse. The manufacturer and subcontractor decide separately on their capacity investment levels. Then demand uncertainty is resolved and both parties {{have the option to}} subcontract when deciding on their production and sales. We analyze and present outsourcing conditions for three contract types: (1) price-only contracts where an ex-ante transfer price is set for each unit supplied by the subcontractor; (2) incomplete contracts, where both parties negotiate over the subcontracting transfer; and (3) state-dependent price-only and incomplete contracts for which we show an equivalence result. While subcontracting with these three contract types can coordinate production decisions in the supply system, only state-dependent contracts can eliminate all decentralization costs and coordinate capacity investment decisions. The minimally sufficient price-only contract that coordinates our supply chain specifies transfer prices for a small number (6 in our model) of <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Our game-theoretic model allows the analysis of the role of transfer prices and of the bargaining power of buyer and supplier. We find that sometimes firms may be better off leaving some contract parameters unspecified ex-ante and agreeing to negotiate ex-post. Also, a price-focused strategy for managing subcontractors can backfire because a lower transfer price may decrease the manufacturer’s profit. Finally, as with financial options, the option value of subcontracting increases as markets are more volatile or more negatively correlated...|$|R

This study was motivated {{by the lack of}} insight in iconic value in the appraisal of infrastructure projects aspiring to become iconic artifacts in Cost-Benefit Analysis. We designed a contingent valuation experiment, with two <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios</b> and two respondent samples. One sample representing the inhabitants of the city of Rotterdam and one sample representing the inhabitants of the Netherlands excluding the inhabitants of Rotterdam. For both respondent samples significant (from zero) WTP estimates were found. Furthermore, people who virtually never use the Erasmus Bridge for transportation goals, or even see the Erasmus Bridge still have a WTP for the iconic value of the Erasmus Bridge. Allowing for uncertainties we estimated a lower bound and an upper bound for the total WTP for the iconic value of the Erasmus Bridge for inhabitants of the Netherlands. Regardless if we choose the lower bound (69. 7 million euros) or the upper bound (95. 7 million euros) the iconic value of the Erasmus Bridge is higher than the extra costs made in reality to build the Erasmus Bridge instead of a more conservative design (18 million euros). Hence, it can be concluded that the iconic value of infrastructure projects can be substantial, at least {{in the case of the}} Erasmus Bridge.

40|$|This thesis {{sought to}} {{estimate}} the economic value of selected Sydney beaches, {{in order to provide}} the necessary information to allow local and State government agencies to identify the most appropriate management response to projected climate change impacts. Three case-study sites (Collaroy-Narrabeen, Manly Ocean Beach, and a combined site in the Hawkesbury River that included the Brooklyn Baths and Dangar Island) were selected via a weighted-criteria method using an expert panel. Valuation methods were selected in response to the key coastal management challenges in the region, vulnerability to inundation and shoreline recession. A truncated negative binomial travel cost model identified consumer surplus values of between AUD$ 2. 72 and $ 20. 63 for a beach day, depending on the site under investigation and the specification of the cost parameter. These are similar to those in the published literature. Aggregate values are derived only for comparison with costs of management options, due to concerns about the quality of visitation information. These comparisons suggest a strong economic argument for beach nourishment at the case-study beaches. The Contingent Valuation (CV) method was employed {{to estimate the}} willingness to pay (WTP) of beach visitors for prevention of climate change erosion at the case-study beaches. Screening and follow-up questions were employed to identify the influence of scenario rejection on WTP responses and values. Binary probit analysis of non-protest responses resulted in average WTP of AUD$ 116. 27 ± 69. 63 as a one-time donation. Comparison with previous studies is not possible due to difference in <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios</b> and payment vehicles. The Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) was employed to identify price premiums for beachfront property in Collaroy-Narrabeen. Significant variation in beachfront price premiums is explained by the variation in erosion risk information linked to property titles. &# 145;Risk-free&# 146; beachfront properties were subject to price premiums around 264 %, relative to an average property in the sample. Properties in the central portion of the beach, which is subject to greater exposure to erosion, were subject to much lower premiums, in the order of 130 %. These figures are substantially higher than those in the published literature, which {{is a function of the}} exclusivity of the Sydney beachfront property market...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{three main}} {{reasons why so}} many of the contingent valuation studies conducted in developing countries are so bad. First, the contingent valuation surveys themselves are often poorly administered and executed. Second, <b>contingent</b> valuation <b>scenarios</b> are often very poorly crafted. Third, few CV studies conducted in developing countries are designed to test whether some of the key assumptions that the reseacher made were the right ones, and whether the results are robust with respect to simple variations in research design and survey method. The paper concludes that research on stated preference methods in developing countries is critically important to the successfull implementation of these methods because (1) there is no empirical evidence to suggest that rapid, "streamlined" CV surveys yield reliable, accurate results, and (2) there is a significant risk that the current pust for cheaper, simpler CV studies could discredit the methodology itself. Moreover, the policy debates to which CV researchers are asked to contribute are often of tremendous importance to the well-being of households in developing countries. Because the costs of policy mistakes can prove tragic, it is critical that CV researchers push for excellence in this research enterprise and that funding agencies think more carefully about the value of policy-relevant information in the fields in which the contingent valuation method is being used to study household preferences and behavior (e. g., water and sanitation services, urban air pollution, soil erosion, deforestation, biodiversity, watershed management, ecosystem valuation, vaccines for the poor). contingent valuation method, demand assessment, developing countries, household surveys, stated preferences...|$|R

The research methodology employed to elicit behavioural responses to certain price levels for road use was the Contingent Valuation Method (Mitchell and Carson, 1989). Three stakeholder samples were surveyed: visitor, resident and businessoperator samples. All three were administered with mail-back questionnaires containing hypothetical <b>Contingent</b> Valuation <b>scenarios.</b> Willingness To Pay (WTP) questions to elicit monetary preferences for road use were posed to the visitor and resident samples, whereas the business operator sample respondents were asked for their Willingness To Accept (WTA) a compensation payment for {{the potential impact of}} the road-user charging scheme on their trade. The research findings determined that a road-user charge would result in a considerable reduction in the visitor sample's intention to use a private motor-vehicle on the Great Langdale valley road network. The residential population expressed limited support for themselves or visitors being subject to a road-user charge. In addition, the business operator sample demonstrated similar opposition to the road- user charging proposal.

The need to understand these benefits in economic terms {{has never been more}} pressing. Contingent valuation and choice experiments are survey-based non-market valuation methods that can be applied to estimate the values of these benefits. This thesis aims to address some of the challenges facing non-market valuation of coastal ecosystem services, comprising a summary and four appended papers that are based on two separate studies designed to value coastal ecosystem services in two archipelago areas in Sweden. Paper I addresses the challenge of creating and describing a <b>contingent</b> valuation <b>scenario</b> so as to achieve content validity. A holistic valuation scenario based on ecological measures that are well connected to policy was developed and is described and evaluated. Sometimes when decisions have to be made and new valuation studies are impossible due to time and funding restrictions, estimates from existing studies can be transferred to a new setting, an approach referred to as benefit transfer. Including socio-economic information in choice experiment models for benefit transfer is addressed in Paper II. The findings suggest that a more ‘general’ model based on socio-economic information that can be easily obtained from public databases performs quite well as a model that would require the collection of more detailed information. Paper III addresses distributional effects of environmental policies affecting coastal ecosystem services. The study presents information regarding distributional effects in both monetary terms and in terms of environmental quality for different socio-economic groups. Paper IV addresses the important topic of model selection uncertainty for choice experiments in environmental valuation. To be able to ensure robustness of results, this study proposes an information-theoretic approach for model selection. The findings also indicate that greater attention should be paid to potential policy implications that may follow from different model specifications...|$|R

To measure HRQL, disease severity, and WTGT, eligible patients were mailed a questionnaire comprised of a generic HRQL scale (the Duke Health Profile), an asthma-specific HRQL scale (the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire - Marks), questions regarding the frequency of asthma symptoms, and a <b>contingent</b> valuation <b>scenario</b> measuring WTGT. Healthcare utilization data were obtained from a computerized medical record system. Data were collected during the months of February–April of 2000.

There was a statistically significant relationship between overall asthma HRQL and WTGT (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) while controlling for age. Symptom-based asthma severity also had a statistically significant relationship with WTGT, P = 0. 0006 and P = 0. 0092 for WTGT 45 and WTGT 95 respectively. The healthcare utilization measures did not have a statistically significant relationship with WTGT. HRQL explained more of the variance in WTGT the than symptom-based severity and healthcare utilization. ^ The results suggest that one way to enhance participation in an asthma self-management program is to tell the potential participants an estimation of the magnitude of the program 2 ̆ 7 s benefits.

40|$|Scenario {{planning}} {{is a widely}} used approach for developing long-term strategies. The typical scenario process involves developing scenarios, identifying strategies whose success is <b>contingent</b> on the <b>scenario,</b> and monitoring the environment regularly to know which scenario(s) may become more likely. Hence it becomes necessary {{to find a way}} to monitor the business environment in order to inform the process of making strategic decisions under uncertainty. This thesis proposes to use a set of nested indicators to monitor environment. The approach consists of a seven-step process to build composite indicators and link them with scenarios. Individual indicators are selected based on intuitive theoretical frameworks. Different weights are assigned to individual indicators using factor analysis. And then composite indicators are built by linear aggregation of individual indicators. The composite indicators are used to assess the changes in the driving forces over time. Such changes serve as the basis for judging whether the level of the driving forces is high or low. Those levels are then used to infer which scenario is likely to come to pass. This thesis used a set of four scenarios to illustrate the application of the approach. Those scenarios were built for a chemical company's supply chain in Asian/Pacific region in 2025. The result suggested that the environment of the sub-region in the monitoring year was more like a "Collaborative World" or a mix of "Collaborative World" and "Demanding World". And it is more possible that the environment was evolving into those two scenarios instead of the others. by Zheng He. Thesis (M.

40|$|Livestock sector {{forms an}} {{important}} livelihood activity for farmers, through supporting agriculture and supplementing income in India. The lack of availability of sufficient feed {{is one of}} the major limiting factors for better productivity of livestock. The feed are of two types as roughages (high in crude fibrous material) available at public forest, farm lands, etc. and concentrates (high in nutrients and mixture of oil, coarse grain, and cereals). The general degradation of forest reduces the fodder availability, severely. Therefore, improving forest condition may provide pathways for sustainability of both, livestock and forest. This may be addressed through sustainable forest management, which requires scientific inputs and may be shifting of some demand of locals to other resources. This requires huge amount from government. Presently, livestock sector is part of the Agriculture and Allied Activities sector in the accounting system of India, and therefore, all related shares and expenditure is part of the component. This results into under allocation for the actual shares of forestry contribution to livestock, in the Forestry and Logging sector. This occurs primarily, due to the lack of scientific information on the share and value of fodder from forest. This study has been undertaken to estimate the share and economic value of forests derived livestock feed. Primary data has been collected as per pretested questionnaire from 316 randomly selected households engaged in livestock rearing from 66 villages distributed across the Uttarakhand, India. Information pertaining to the fodder to livestock from all sources and socio-economic attributes were collected from each household to understand the feed consumption behavior of livestock. The feed sources were classified in forests, other than forests and market. The shares and economic value of livestock feed derived from different sources has been estimated for all livestock. The prices of various feeds were either collected directly from market or estimated through non market valuation techniques based on two <b>scenarios</b> (<b>contingent</b> valuation and ratio of dry and green matter basis of 0. 40). The average proportion of feed quantity consumed by livestock was 58 % from forests, 39 % from other than forests and 3 % from markets for hilly region. It was 97 % from other than forests and 3 % from markets for plain region. For hilly region, the proportion of economic value varies from 40 – 41 % for forest; 40 – 41 % for agriculture and 18 – 20 % from market. The total value of forest fodder was Rs 4811 millions in scenario 1 and Rs 5209 millions in scenario 2 for the Uttarakhand. The study concludes and recommends that these proportions may be utilized to allocate the appropriate share of livestock feed into Forestry and Logging sector, which may results into the realistic share of the sector.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} basic {{questions}} about the organization and functioning of society involve issues raised by the existence of public goods. With respect to environmental public goods, how should funds used to support environmental improvement be collected and used? In particular, are collective, mandatory payments superior to voluntary, charitable payments due to the possibility of free riding? And to what degree should the government be involved in spending these funds: should the government directly fund environmental improvement projects or should the private sector be used to collect funds and determine funding priorities? This report explores these questions from the perspective of renewable energy: wind, geothermal, biomass, hydropower, and solar. In particular, this report analyzes the payment preferences of U. S. households through the implementation of a large-scale contingent valuation (CV) survey of willingness to pay (WTP) for renewable energy. Renewable energy can be supported through a mandatory ''tax'' on electric bills or through voluntary payments via green power marketing; the government {{may or may not be}} heavily involved in the collection and expenditure of such funds. The question of how households prefer to pay for renewable energy is therefore highly relevant. The primary objective of this study is to explore variations in stated WTP for renewable energy under the following four payment and provision contexts: (1) A mandatory increase in the electricity bills of all customers, the funds from which are collected and spent by the government on renewable energy projects. (2) A voluntary increase in the electricity bills of those customers who choose to pay, the funds from which are collected and spent by the government on renewable energy projects. (3) A voluntary increase in the electricity bills of those customers who choose to pay, the funds from which are collected and spent by electricity suppliers on renewable energy projects. (4) A mandatory increase in the electricity bills of all customers, the funds from which are collected and spent by electricity suppliers on renewable energy projects. These payment and provision scenarios are consistent with contemporary forms of support for renewable energy. The first scenario [...] mandatory payments and government provision [...] is consistent with a system-benefits charge policy, a policy that has been adopted in 15 U. S. states. The third scenario [...] voluntary payments to an electricity supplier [...] is consistent with competitive green power marketing. The fourth scenario [...] mandatory payments through electricity suppliers [...] is consistent with a renewables portfolio standard, a policy adopted in thirteen U. S. states as of mid 2003. The second scenario [...] voluntary payments and government provision [...] has only been used in a limited fashion in the United States. In addition to having contemporary policy relevance, these four <b>contingent</b> valuation <b>scenarios</b> allow one to distinguish differences in stated WTP based on: (1) the payment method [...] is WTP affected by whether payments are to be made collectively or voluntarily? and (2) the provision arrangement [...] does the manner in which a good is provided, in this case through the government or the private sector, affect stated WTP? A split-sample, dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey of 1, 574 U. S. residents was developed and implemented to test the sensitivity of stated WTP to these variables at three different payment levels, or bid points. Three secondary objectives also influenced research design, and are discussed in this report. First, this study indirectly and tentatively evaluates the importance of ''participation expectations'' in contingent valuation surveys: specifically, are individuals who state a WTP for renewable energy more likely to think that others will also contribute? Such relationships are commonly discussed in the sociology, social psychology, and marketing literatures, and are also frequently referenced in the collective action literature, but have yet to be tested thoroughly in a contingent valuation context. Second, this report assesses the effects of socioeconomic, demographic, and attitudinal variables on willingness to pay for renewable energy through regression analysis. This analysis helps test the construct validity of the contingent valuation method, and informs our understanding of who is and is not willing to pay for renewable energy under different payment and provision contexts. Finally, through the implementation of a concurrent opinion survey with 202 respondents, this study compares the results of the CV surveys to a more direct approach of eliciting individuals' payment preferences. Responses to the opinion survey also allow a deeper exploration of other issues related to payment preferences...|$|R
