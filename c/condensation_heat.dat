50|$|In {{dropwise}} condensation the condensate liquid collects {{in the form}} of countless droplets of varying diameters on the condensing surface instead of forming a continuous film and does not wet the solid cooling surface. The droplets develop at a point of surface imperfection (pit, scratch), called nucleation sites and grow in size as more vapour condenses on its exposed surface. When the size of droplets is large there comes a time the droplet breakaway from the surface and knock off other droplets and carries it downstream. The moving droplet devours the droplets of smaller size. Dropwise condensation {{is one of the most}} effective mechanism of heat transfer and extremely large heat transfer coefficients can be achieved with this mechanism. There is no liquid film in this case to resist heat transfer as a result heat transfer coefficients can be achieved more than 10 times larger than those associated with film <b>condensation.</b> <b>Heat</b> transfer coefficients is large so designers to achieve a specified heat transfer rate with a smaller surface area and thus a smaller and less expensive condenser.|$|E

Below these ammonia ice clouds, denser clouds made of ammonium hydrosulfide or ammonium sulfide (between 1-2 bar) and water (3-7 bar) are thought to exist. There are no methane clouds as the temperatures are too high for it to condense. The water clouds form the densest layer of clouds and have the strongest influence on {{the dynamics of the}} atmosphere.

Various tropospheric (at 200-500 mbar) and stratospheric (at 10-100 mbar) haze layers reside above the main cloud layers. The latter are made from condensed heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or hydrazine, which are generated in the upper stratosphere (1-100 μbar) from methane under the influence of the solar ultraviolet radiation (UV).

40|$|A set of AGCM {{experiments}} is used {{to study}} the annual cycle of precipitation in the region surrounding the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The experiments are designed to reveal {{the relative importance of}} insolation over land and the (uncoupled) SST on the annual cycle of precipitation over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, Africa, and the tropical Americas. SST variations impact the position of the maritime ITCZ by forcing the hydrostatic adjustment of the at-mospheric boundary layer and changes in surface pressure and low-level convergence. The <b>condensation</b> <b>heating</b> released in the ITCZ contributes substantially to the surface circulation and the maintenance of the SST-induced ITCZ anomalies. The remote influence of SST is felt in equatorial coastal areas and the Sahel. The circulation driven by <b>condensation</b> <b>heating</b> in the maritime ITCZ extends to the coastal regions, thus communicating the SST signal onshore. Conversely, the Sahel responds to variations in SST through boundary layer processes that do not involve the maritime ITCZ. The atmospheric response to changes in subtropical SST is advected inland and forces changes in sea level pressure and low-level convergence across a large part of tropical Africa. The impact of local insolation on continental precipitation can be explained by balancing net energy input {{at the top of the}} atmospheric column with the export of energy by the divergent circulation that accompanies convection. Increased insolation reduces the stability of the atmosphere in the main continental convection centers, but not in monsoon regions. Insolation over land impacts the intensity of the maritime ITCZ via its influence on precipitation in Africa and South America. Reduced land precipitation induces the cooling of the Atlantic upper troposphere and the enhancement of convective available potential energy in the maritime ITCZ. 1...|$|R

40|$|Responses of {{tropical}} atmosphere to low-boundary forcing are investigated in a 2 -D cumulus ensemble model (CEM) with an imposed warm-pool and cold-pool SST contrast (deltaSST). The domain-mean vertical motion is constrained to produce heat sink and moisture source {{as in the}} observed tropical climate. In a series of experiments, the warm pool SST is specified at different values while the cold pool SST is specified at 26 C. The strength of the circulation increases with increasing deltaSST until deltaSST reaches 3. 5 C, and remains unchanged as deltaSST exceeds 3. 5 C. The regulation {{of tropical}} convection by zonal SST gradient is constrained by the radiative cooling over the cold pool. For deltaSST less than 3. 5 C, an enhanced subsidence warming is balanced by a reduced <b>condensation</b> <b>heating</b> over the cold pool. For deltaSST greater than 3. 5 C, the subsidence regime expands over the entire cold pool where no <b>condensation</b> <b>heating</b> exist so that a further enhanced subsidence warming {{can no longer be}} sustained. The above regulation mechanism is also evident in the change of energy {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (TOA) that is dominated by cloud and water vapor greenhouse effect (c (sub LW)) and G (sub clear). The change in shortwave radiation at TOA is largely cancelled between the warm pool and cold pool, likely due to the same imposed vertical motion in our experiments. For deltaSST less than 3. 5 C, an increase of deltaSST is associated with a large increase in c (sub Lw) due to increased total clouds in response to enhanced SST-induced circulation. For deltaSST greater than 3. 5 C, clouds over the warm pool decrease with increasing SST, and the change in c (sub LW) is much smaller. In both dSST regimes, the change in CLW is larger than the change in G(sub clear) which is slightly negative.
