40|$|The 12 -km-wide Vargeao impact {{structure}} was formed 123 Myr {{ago in the}} Parana basaltic province (southern Brazil). At this time the province region had a dry climate, although a large brackish aquifer had been formed in the underlying sandstones. It is therefore {{one of the best}} terrestrial analogs for studying impact-related products on a dry martian surface environment with preserved ice-rich ground. The basalts within the impact structure display cm-sized breccia veins filled with lithic clasts, glassy remnants, newly formed Fe-oxyhydroxides and secondary phases, such as calcite, phyllosilicates and, subordinately quartz and zeolite. The textural and mineralogical study of these phases demonstrate their hydrothermal origin. Although {{the very center of the}} structure has experienced the highest pressures and temperatures, the most developed hydrothermal changes are recognized in an <b>inner</b> <b>collar</b> surrounding the central depression. This <b>inner</b> <b>collar</b> is also the location of major modifications of the rock magnetic properties. These magnetic signatures are related to the distribution of impact-related faults and to the formation of new iron oxides. Geochemical modeling indicate that hydrothermal phases formation required low water/rock ratios. Our observations therefore suggest that hydrothermal alteration took place following the perturbation of the aquifer by the impact, but evidence for hydrothermal circulation is limited in comparison with other impact-related hydrothermal systems. This situation may be explained by the presence of the aquifer below the heat source, such a setting being exceptional for the Earth, but common on Mars. However, the spectroscopic signatures in visible/near infrared images suggest that this kind of impact-related hydrothermal alteration may be still indentified in large impact craters on Mars by orbital instruments. These results does not exclude the possibility that more developed alteration took place in breccias that are today eroded...|$|R

50|$|Bars and CollarsFrom {{the early}} 1930s {{until the early}} 1950s, BUR sold a {{standard}} 1-1/16” bar. Collars were attached separately. Most, if not all, of these bars were knurled in 3 places. None had a separate revolving sleeve. There were no markings on the BUR bars or collars to distinguish these from the bars or collars of other manufacturers. Bar lengths ranged from 4’ to 6’.In the 1950s, {{with the introduction of}} the BUR-140, BUR began selling a bar with a 1” diameter and a removable 38” chrome plated sleeve that allowed for bar rotation during lifts. BUR oversized <b>inner</b> <b>collars</b> were included with the new bar.

50|$|On {{the edge}} of the US dime, quarter and half dollar, and many world coins there are ridges, similar to knurling, called reeds. Some older US coins, and many world coins have other designs on {{the edge of}} the coin. Sometimes these are simple designs like vines, more complex bar {{patterns}} or perhaps a phrase, as on the United States dollar coin, on which are the date, mintmark, and motto, E Pluribus Unum. Historically these kinds of designs are imparted into the coin through a multisectioned third die called a <b>collar,</b> whose <b>inner</b> edge diameter is the same as that of {{the edge of the}} coin. When the obverse and reverse dies strike the planchet the planchet expands to fill the collar, impressing the collar design into the edge of the coin. The collar sections are then separated to allow the coin to be removed. When the collar is missing, it results in a type of error called a broadstrike. A broadstruck coin is generally a bit flatter and quite a bit bigger around than the regular non-error coin of the same denomination. A second and faster process by which a design is applied to the edge of a coin is by use of an edge incusing machine. The struck coin is feed into the machine and the machine then pressed the design into the edge of the coin. Sometimes a mint will use both methods to apply an edge design. The U.S. Mint, for example, used an edge incusing machine to letter the edges business strike presidential dollars and a collar for the proof versions of these coins.|$|R
60|$|The breast-plate {{was made}} of tinned copper. It covered part of the back, breast, and {{shoulders}} of the diver, and had a circular neck, to which the helmet was to be ultimately screwed. It rested on the <b>inner</b> <b>collar</b> of the dress, and the outer collar--of stout india-rubber--was drawn over it. In this outer collar were twelve holes, corresponding to twelve screws round {{the edge of the}} breast-plate. When these holes had been fitted over their respective screws, a breast-plate-band, in four pieces, was placed over them and screwed tight by means of nuts--thus rendering the connection between the dress and the breast-plate perfectly water-tight. It now only remained to screw the helmet to the circular neck of the breast-plate. Previously, however, a woollen night-cap was drawn over the poor man's head, well down on his ears, and Rooney looked--as indeed he afterwards admitted that he felt--as if he were going to be hanged. He thought, however, of the proverb, that a man who is born to be drowned never can be hanged, and somehow felt comforted.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} and {{aspects of}} the histomorphology of Chonopeltis victori, parasitic on Labeo rosae, L. congoro, L. ruddi, L. cylindricus and Barbus marequensis, are described from scanning electron micrographs and transverse sections. Chonopeltis victori is characterised by sharply pointed tips of the abdomen which are directed outward. Sexual dimorphism is particularly evident from {{the structure of the}} natatory lobes on the fourth swimming legs and the accessory copulatory structures on the second, third and fourth swimming legs of males. The most striking feature on leg four of the male is the peg. The elevated peg appears tubular, but the sides are not fused. On the <b>inner</b> <b>collar</b> elliptical projections, each with a central, circular pore, are present. On the elongated outer collar small indentions occur peripherally. The dorsal surface of the peg is subterminally covered by elongated scales. The ventral surface of the thorax and swimming legs are covered with different shapes of posteriorly directed scales. Interspersed amongst these scales, {{as well as on the}} dorsal surface, eight types of setae are present in large numbers. The possible function of the peg and other structures are described...|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} of the node and the flanking paranodal regions are distinct from the internodes under the compact myelin sheath, but are very similar in CNS and PNS. The axon is exposed to the extra-cellular environment at the node and is constricted in its diameter. The decreased axon size reflects a higher packing density of neurofilaments in this region, which are less heavily phosphorylated and are transported more slowly. [...] Vesicles and other organelles are also increased at the nodes, which {{suggest that there is}} a bottleneck of axonal transport in both directions as well as local axonal-glial signaling. [...] When a longitudinal section is made through a myelinating Schwann cell at the node, three distinctive segments are represented: the stereotypic internode, the paranodal region, and the node itself. In the internodal region, the Schwann cell has an outer collar of cytoplasm, a compact myelin sheath, and <b>inner</b> <b>collar</b> of cytoplasm, and the axolemma. At the paranodal regions, the paranodal cytoplasm loops contact thickenings of the axolemma to form septate -like junctions. In the node alone, the axolemma is contacted by several Schwann microvilli and contains a dense cytoskeletal undercoating.|$|R
2500|$|After {{two seasons}} in the diagonally sashed kit, both {{yielding}} Final Series football, the first season, winning the Grand Final, Puma released {{a new set of}} kits, including, for the first time, an alternative strip, deemed by the club as an [...] "Event" [...] kit.

40|$|The {{weakening}} mechanisms {{involved in}} the collapse of complex impact craters are controversial. The Araguainha impact crater, in Brazil, exposes a complex structure of 40 km in diameter, and is an excellent object to address this issue. Its core is dominated by granite. In addition to microstructural observations, magnetic studies reveal its internal fabric acquired during the collapse phase. All granite samples exhibit impact-related planar deformation features (PDFs) and planar fractures (PFs), which were overprinted by cataclasis. Cataclastic deformation has evolved from incipient brittle fracturing to the development of discrete shear bands {{in the center of the}} structure. Fracture planes are systematically decorated by tiny grains (< 10 mu m) of magnetite and hematite, and the orientation of magnetic lineation and magnetic foliation obtained by the anisotropies of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and anhysteretic remanence (AAR) are perfectly coaxial in all studied sites. Therefore, we could track the orientation of deformation features which are decorated by iron oxides using the AMS and AAR. The magnetic fabrics show a regular pattern at the borders of the central peak, with orientations consistent with the fabric of sediments at the crater's <b>inner</b> <b>collar</b> and complex in the center of the structure. Both the cataclastic flow revealed from microstructural observations and the structural pattern of the magnetic anisotropy match the predictions from numerical models of complex impact structures. The widespread occurrence of cataclasis in the central peak, and its orientations revealed by magnetic studies indicate that acoustic fluidization likely operates at all scales, including the mineral scales. The cataclastic flow made possible by acoustic fluidization results in an apparent plastic deformation at the macroscopic scale in the core. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
