5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work <b>concerns</b> <b>the</b> changes that tele-commuting {{would have on the}} workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century <b>concerns</b> <b>the</b> expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy <b>concerns</b> <b>the</b> economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E
