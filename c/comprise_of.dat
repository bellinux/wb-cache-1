25|$|Shunting signals allow a {{train to}} move forward onto a line which may already be occupied, for example the {{platform}} of a station, a siding, or a particular road in a marshaling yard. Modern ones <b>comprise</b> <b>of</b> three lenses in a triangular formation. They may be attached to a main signal in which case they are only cleared when the shunting movement is required (known as a subsidiary signal). When cleared they display two white lights at an angle of 45° indicating that the driver may pass the signal with caution, even if the main signal is showing danger, but at a speed that allows the train to stop short of any obstruction. When not cleared these signals would be unlit, displaying nothing, and the train driver would simply obey the aspect of the main signal.|$|E

40|$|Herein, we {{systematically}} investigate phospholipid-subclass-specific {{alterations in}} the partitioning of both cationic and anionic amphiphiles {{to identify the}} importance of ester, ether and vinyl ether linkages at the sn- 1 position of phospholipids in the partitioning of charged amphiphiles. The results demonstrated that the membrane-water partition coefficient of a prototypic cationic amphiphile (i. e. 3, 3 '-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide) was approximately 2. 5 times higher in membranes <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> plasmenylcholine in comparison with membranes <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> either phosphatidylcholine or plasmanylcholine. In striking contrast, the membrane-water partition coefficient of a prototypic anionic amphiphile [i. e. bis-(1, 3 -dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol] in membranes <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> plasmenylcholine was approximately 2. 5 times lower than that manifest in membranes <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> phosphatidylcholine or plasmanylcholine. Utilizing theseexperimentally determined partition coefficients,the relative membrane dipole potential <b>of</b> membranes <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> plasmenylcholine was calculated and found to be approximately 25 mV lower than in membranes <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> phosphatidylcholine or plasmanylcholine. This lower membrane dipole potential in membranes <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> plasmenylcholine {{is equivalent to the}} membrane potential induced by incorporation of approximately 25 mol% of anionic phospholipids in membranes <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> phosphatidylcholine. Collectively, these results demonstrate that phospholipid-subclass-specific differences in the membrane dipole potential contribute to alterations in the partitioning of lipophilic ions in membrane bilayers <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> distinct phospholipid subclasses. Moreover, they suggest that these physicochemical differences can be exploited to facilitate the targeting of charged lipophilic drugs to specific cells and subcellular membrane compartments...|$|R
