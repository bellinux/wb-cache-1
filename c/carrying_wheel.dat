5000|$|A <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> on a steam {{locomotive}} is a wheel {{that is not}} driven, i.e. it is uncoupled and can run freely, unlike a coupled or driving wheel. It is also described as a running wheel and their axle may be called a carrying axle. A <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is referred to as}} leading wheel if it is at the front, or a trailing wheel if it is {{at the rear of the}} locomotive.|$|E
50|$|There were {{scarcely}} {{any differences}} between the various build series. Not until 1896 were minor changes made to the heating areas, the weights and the coal and water capacities. The rigid mounting of the driving and carrying wheels {{and the location of}} the cylinder {{just in front of the}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> did not prove a success. The D IX locomotives could haul 170 t on the flat at a speed of 65 km/h, on routes with a 2% incline they could manage 95 tons at 20 km/h.|$|E
50|$|In service, {{difficulty}} was {{experienced with}} the trailing bogie wheels fouling the firebox and {{the heads of}} stays and rivets. This was partially overcome by fitting stops to the engine frame, but this restriction of the sideways movement of the bogie wheels resulted in derailments in tight curves such as on diverging points. The engines performed well at relatively low speeds, but were prone to serious lateral oscillations at higher speeds. Cases of derailment on straight track at speed demonstrated the limitations of a design {{where there was no}} leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> to stabilise the engine and considerable overhang of the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The du Bousquet design had {{an unusual}} wheel arrangement; both trucks had six driving <b>wheels</b> and two <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> {{supporting}} the cylinders. Unlike many other articulated designs, these <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{toward the center}} of the locomotive, as were the cylinders. This arrangement is expressed in the French classification as 031+130, in the Whyte notation as 0-6-2+2-6-0T, or in the UIC classification as (C1')(1'C)t.|$|R
50|$|The driving axles {{were fixed}} in the frame, the leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{designed}} as a Novotny-Klien axle.|$|R
50|$|Their rigidly mounted leading and {{trailing}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> {{were also}} arranged as radial axles {{to allow for}} sideways motion of the wheels {{in relation to the}} locomotive frame, since the locomotive did not have separate bogie trucks. As on the Class Hd, this resulted in a rigid wheelbase of 17 ft, even though the leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were arranged to the rear instead of ahead of the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The 40 Tonners {{were found}} to be {{satisfactory}} in service, but the absence of leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> resulted in a rough ride.|$|R
50|$|The Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) had {{received}} similar locomotives, the Class T 4.I, that however were somewhat smaller and had smaller driving and <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... two {{revolving}} units like bogies made up {{each one}} of a steam engine involving a group of driving wheels and possibly comprising <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Three {{of these}} {{locomotives}} were also produced for the Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) as the T 4.II, but these had different dimensions, including smaller driving and <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first thirty had 3 ft <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{the latter}} twenty had 3 ft <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b> The LNWR reused numbers from {{withdrawn}} locomotives, so the numbering system was completely haphazard. The 3 ft 9 in engines were numbered by 528, 531, 784, 1295, 1305, 1981-1985, 97, 111, 181, 196, 562, 616, 803, 1356, 1508, 2210, 139, 653, 834, 874, 1506, 1572, 1589, 1671, 1714, and 2165. The 3 ft 3 in engines were numbered 44, 527, 612, 762, 827, 875, 1427, 1764, 2196, 2446, 920, 935, 1164, 1219, 1523, 1536, 1551, 2077, 2223 and 2228.|$|R
50|$|The {{coupled axles}} were sprung {{underneath}} with leaf springs. Weight balancing was achieved using an equalising beam between the springs. The front <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> had leaf springs above the axles.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, Société Anonyme John Cockerill of Seraing in Belgium {{delivered}} {{four new}} 2-6-2+2-6-2 locomotives, numbered {{in the range}} from NG85 to NG88, which were so similar to the older locomotives that they were initially designated Class NG G13 as well. However, {{in view of the fact}} that all the <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were fitted with roller bearing axle boxes and arranged as swiveling pony trucks, compared to the Class NG G13 of which the inner <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement, it was soon decided to reclassify them to Class NG G16.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, with Heusinger valve gear, piston {{valves and}} outside plate frames. Since {{they were to}} be used across the Namib Desert, they were equipped with dust covers to protect the motion from wind-blown sand. Their leading and trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were not mounted in separate bogie trucks, but were rigidly mounted and arranged as radial axles to allow for sideways motion of the wheels in relation to the locomotive frame. This resulted in a rigid wheelbase of 17 ft, even though the leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were arranged to the rear instead of ahead of the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The Prussian T 9 was a {{class of}} German steam {{locomotive}} which included several types of tank engine, all with six coupled <b>wheels</b> and two <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> operated by the Prussian state railways.|$|R
50|$|A {{search of}} the suspects' {{apartment}} found DNA matching that on the suitcases and receipts for the gas canister and gas. Surveillance cameras caught both suspects <b>carrying</b> <b>wheeled</b> baggage onto the train at Cologne.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} {{there were three}} locomotives, Victoria, Britannia and Caledonia, all six wheeled tender engines, with five foot driving wheels and 3 ft 6in <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b> They had outside cylinders and inside bearings.|$|R
50|$|This rather {{distinctive}} locomotive had plate 10 ft wheels {{instead of}} the more usual spoked ones, the <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> being 5 ft. The 14 x 20 in cylinders were fed from a doubled-domed boiler.|$|R
50|$|Five 2-2-2 {{locomotives}} originally {{built by}} Stothert & Slaughter for the B&GR. These had 6 ft 6 in driving wheels and 3 ft. 6 in. <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> with cylinders of 15 in. dia. × 21 in. stroke.|$|R
50|$|A ferry slip is a {{specialized}} docking facility that receives a ferryboat or train ferry. A similar structure called a barge slip receives a barge or car float {{that is used}} to <b>carry</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicles across a body of water.|$|R
50|$|This {{system was}} not {{suitable}} for steam locomotives so Arnoux invented a separate system for them. The locomotives had a 2-4-2 wheel arrangement and the driving wheels were flangeless. The <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were arranged to pivot and were controlled by near-horizontal guide wheels.|$|R
50|$|Two express {{locomotives}} {{were provided}} from the Canada Works with 6 ft. 0 in. driving wheels and 3 ft. 6 in. <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{with a total}} wheelbase of 14 ft. 2 in. They had cylinders of 20 in. dia. × 15¼ in. stroke.|$|R
50|$|In 1851 the {{carriage}} portion was removed {{and the power}} unit rebuilt, presumably with {{a new pair of}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> making it an 0-2-2. Its use {{for the next few years}} is unclear, although it might have been moved to Taunton to pump water.|$|R
50|$|This {{locomotive}} {{worked the}} first train on the Great Western Railway {{when it opened}} on 4 June 1838. In 1843 it was fitted with more conventional 6 ft driving and 3 ft <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> with 15 x 18 in cylinders; at some time it was converted to a 2-2-2T tank locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Syndicated {{programming}} on WKRN includes Wheel of Fortune, Extra, Live with Kelly and Ryan, Rules of Engagement and The Closer, among others. The Nashville {{market is}} one of the few that <b>carries</b> <b>Wheel</b> of Fortune on a separate station because Jeopardy! (as a broadcast oddity) airs on Fox affiliate WZTV.|$|R
25|$|In 1659, the Italian Tito Livio Burattini built {{a machine}} with nine {{independent}} wheels, {{each one of}} these wheels was paired with a smaller <b>carry</b> <b>wheel.</b> At the end of an operation the user had to either manually add each carry to the next digit or mentally add these numbers to create the final result.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{standard}} axle [...] "bogies" [...] provide the drive mechanism. Each bogie {{is driven by}} 3-phase alternating current (AC) motor. A third rail provides power. Braking is either regenerative (returning electricity to the grid) with supplemental disc and (emergency) mechanical braking. Power is delivered to the vehicles using brushes or by current <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{locomotive}} {{was withdrawn}} in 1843 but was rebuilt {{and returned to}} service in 1846. It now had 6 ft driving and 3 ft <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels,</b> with 15 x 18 in cylinders; at some time it was also converted to run as a 2-2-2T tank locomotive. The name was also carried by a Fire Fly Class locomotive from 1841.|$|R
50|$|Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) {{ships are}} vessels {{designed}} to <b>carry</b> <b>wheeled</b> cargo, such as cars, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, trailers, and railroad cars, that are driven {{on and off}} the ship on their own wheels or using a platform vehicle, such as a self-propelled modular transporter. This is in contrast to lift-on/lift-off (LoLo) vessels, which use a crane to load and unload cargo.|$|R
50|$|On December 1857 {{the company}} {{procured}} Crampton locomotives (Class A) with a 4-2-0 wheel arrangement for fast passenger services. These 12 engines had 1,219 mm diameter <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> and 1,829 mm diameter driving wheels. From 1859 a further 12 engines were bought from Maffei with a wheel arrangement of 2-2-2. All the engines were rebuilt in 1869 to 2-4-0 and grouped as Class B locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Article 9. The Government of His Majesty the King of Annam {{undertakes}} to repair, at {{the public}} expense and upon terms agreed by the two High Contracting Parties, the main road from Hanoi to Saigon, and to maintain it in good condition {{so that it can}} <b>carry</b> <b>wheeled</b> traffic. France will provide engineers to supervise the construction of technically demanding works such as bridges and tunnels.|$|R
5000|$|The DRG Class 86 was a {{standard}} goods train tank locomotive of the DRG. It {{was intended for}} duties on branch lines and was manufactured by almost all the locomotive building firms producing for the DRG. From 1942, a simplified wartime version was built, on which the most obvious changes were the omission of the second side windows in the cab and the solid disc <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{power unit}} {{had a single}} pair of driving wheels driven through a {{jackshaft}} by small 8 x 12 in cylinders, the steam produced in a vertical boiler. The boiler was not covered by a cab or other bodywork; the two pairs of <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were beneath the carriage portion. It had seats for 16 first class and 32 second class passengers. It was once timed as running at 52 mph.|$|R
50|$|During the trials, the {{locomotive}} gave some trouble due to broken plate frames {{on the engine}} units {{and it was also}} found that the absence of trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> on the engine units was a disadvantage since it led to excessive flange wear on the coupled wheels. As a result, no. 2140 remained the only representative of its Class. All subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks.|$|R
50|$|The {{tricycle}} undercarriage, unusual at the time, had short main legs {{made possible}} by the combination of lower fuselage depth and hence lower wing position, together with the offset propeller. These legs were joined to the front wing spar close to the fuselage, cross braced and splayed outwards to increase the track. The front leg, mounted just behind the engine, was much longer; all three legs were faired and <b>carried</b> <b>wheels</b> enclosed in spats.|$|R
50|$|In 1887 he {{conducted}} ground-breaking {{research into the}} behaviour of locomotives on curves. From this theoretical work a practical result ensued in 1888: {{the design of the}} Krauss-Helmholtz bogie, which saw widespread use on locomotives with <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> - and not only on steam locomotives. The Austrian designer, Karl Gölsdorf, drew even wider-ranging conclusions from the work of Helmholtz and created a radially-sliding coupled axle, the so-called Gölsdorf axle, which became a standard in the construction of locomotives.|$|R
