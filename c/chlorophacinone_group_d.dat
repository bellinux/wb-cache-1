40|$|The Streptococcus mutans <b>group</b> <b>d</b> antigen {{of strain}} B 13 has been {{purified}} and characterized {{with respect to}} chemical composition and immunochemical properties. The antigen was extracted from lyophilized cells or cell walls by using 5 % trichloroacetic acid at 5 C for 16 h. The antigen could also be extracted with water or 0. 01 N HCl at 100 C for 20 min. The antigen was purified by ion-exchange and gel chromatography and was found to contain 96 % carbohydrate, 1. 6 % protein, and 0. 3 % phosphorus. Characterization by gas chromatography indicated that the polysaccharide was composed of galactose and glucose in a 2 : 1 ratio. The antigen contained two serologically active sites: one site specific for <b>group</b> <b>d</b> and a second site common to both <b>group</b> <b>d</b> and <b>group</b> a strains. Agar diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis indicated that the two sites existed on a single molecule. The immunological specificity of the <b>group</b> <b>d</b> polysaccharide site depended on a terminal d-galactose.

Purpose: To investigate the therapy effect of Buyanghuanwu Tang (BYHWT), a decoction with 7 herbal ingredients, on neonatal rats with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and its mechanism. Methods: 50 3 -week male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into normal control group, model <b>group,</b> BYHWT 1 <b>d</b> <b>group,</b> BYHWT 3 <b>d</b> <b>group</b> and BYHWT 7 <b>d</b> <b>group,</b> 10 rats in each group. The HIE model of was es-tablished in later 4 groups. The later 3 groups were treated with BYHWT for 1, 3 and 7 days, respectively, and the normal control group and model group were treated with PBS. The Morris water maze test and dynamic 18 F-FDG-PET/CT imaging were performed. The changes of hippocampal tissue observed by histopathologic examination, and the expressions of JNK 1 /JNK 2 and TNF-α protein were observed western blotting. Results: Compared with model group, the impaired performance on distance and latency parameters was mitigated in BYHWT 1 <b>d</b> <b>group,</b> BYHWT 3 <b>d</b> <b>group</b> and BYHWT 7 <b>d</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 01), the FDG uptake was decreased in BYHWT 3 <b>d</b> <b>group</b> and BYHWT 7 <b>d</b> <b>group,</b> the apoptotic cells and inflammatory cells were significantly decreased in BYHWT 3 <b>d</b> <b>group</b> and BYHWT 7 <b>d</b> <b>group,</b> and the expressions of JNK 1 /JNK 2 and TNF-α protein were significantly decreased in BYHWT 7 <b>d</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 05).

The temporal model of perceived control {{is concerned with}} the perception of control over stressful life events and differentiates between past, present, and future control (Frazier, Berman, & Steward, 2001). To date, present control {{has been found to be}} associated with a range of positive outcomes including lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress and higher levels of life satisfaction and physical health (e. g., Frazier, 2003; Frazier et al., 2011). The goal of the three studies presented here was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of an online intervention designed to increase present control in samples of undergraduate students coping with stress. In an initial pilot test (Study 1, N = 31), our online intervention increased present control in both within group (pre/post within intervention <b>group,</b> <b>d</b> =. 56) and between group (intervention group vs. stress-information only <b>group,</b> <b>d</b> =. 51) analyses. In Study 2 (N = 34), a refined intervention produced larger within-group increases in present control (d =. 79). Finally, Study 3 (N = 292) compared the present control intervention, the present control intervention plus feedback, and stress-information only groups and found that the two present control intervention groups had lower levels of stress, depression, and anxiety relative to the stress-information only group at posttest and 3 -week follow-up (mean between <b>group</b> <b>d</b> at follow-up = -. 35, mean within <b>group</b> <b>d</b> for intervention <b>groups</b> at follow-up = -. 46). Further, mediation analyses revealed that these effects were mediated by changes in present control. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

Methods: Sixty SD female rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, including 5 in the blank group, 5 in the sham operation group, 25 in the model group, and 25 in the fire needle treated group. Rats in the model group and the fire needle treated group were further divided into the 1 <b>d</b> <b>group,</b> the 3 <b>d</b> <b>group,</b> the 7 <b>d</b> <b>group,</b> the 10 <b>d</b> <b>group</b> and the 14 <b>d</b> <b>group,</b> respectively. Modified Allen’s method was applied to build SCI model, and serum in the abdominal aorta was collected at the indicated time and placed into NSCs culture dishes for 72 h. RT-PCR was applied to detect the expression of ERK 1 / 2. Results: According to the Basso, Beattie & Bresnahan scale (BBB scale), rats in the model group and the fire needle treated group scored 0 at first day, suggesting a success of modeling after treatment. The scores of the fire needle group were significantly higher than those in the model group (P < 0. 05).

Methods: Thirty-three adults ages > 65 y with MCI were randomized to receive a supplement rich in the long-chain ω- 3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 1. 67 g EPA + 0. 16 g docosahexaenoic acid DHA/d; n = 12) or DHA (1. 55 g DHA + 0. 40 g EPA/d; n = 12), versus ω- 6 PUFA linoleic acid (LA; 2. 2 g/d; n = 9) for 6 mo. Results: The intervention did not show an increase in telomere length with treatment and there was a trend toward telomere shortening during the intervention period. Linear mixed modeling produced a robust model although statistically underpowered. Telomere shortening was greatest in the LA <b>group</b> (<b>d</b> = 0. 21) than in the DHA (d = 0. 12) and EPA <b>groups</b> (<b>d</b> = 0. 06).

Methods: From 1990 to 1993, 111 patients with ulcerative proctisis in remission, limited to the rectum (less than or equal to 15 cm from anus), were enrolled.

The three groups were homogeneous as regards main demographic, diagnostic, and prognostic features. Results: The cumulative relapse rates at 12 months were 10 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0 - 21) in the mesalazine b. i. <b>d.</b> <b>group,</b> 32 % (95 % CI: 16 - 49) in the mesalazine u. i. <b>d.</b> <b>group,</b> and 47 % (95 % CI: 29 - 65) in the placebo group. The comparison between the mesalazine b. i. <b>d.</b> <b>group</b> and the mesalazine u. i. <b>d.</b> <b>group</b> cumulative relapse rates gave a p value of 0. 0334, whereas the corresponding comparison between the mesalazine b. i. <b>d.</b> <b>group</b> and the placebo group gave a p value of 0. 007 (log-rank test). The dose-response relationship was statistically significant (p = 0. 008 by Cox analysis). Two patients in the mesalazine b. i. <b>d.</b> <b>group,</b> two patients in the mesalazine u. i. <b>d.</b> <b>group,</b> and one patient in the placebo group withdrew from the study due to nonserious adverse events; four, three, and four patients per group, respectively, dropped out because of poor compliance. Two patients in the mesalazine u. i. <b>d.</b> <b>group</b> and two in the placebo group were lost to follow-up. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the therapeutic efficacy of mesalazine suppositories in the maintenance treatment of ulcerative proctitis. According to our experience the most effective therapeutic schedule is 500 mg mesalazine b. i. d...|$|R

At the first stage, the approximate age is calculated using a decision function f_ 0 (x [...]) defined {{on the basis of}} a regression constructed based on the training set G^l across the whole range of ages (y_,y_). At the second stage, this value is refined by means of a decision function f_d (x) generated {{on the basis of a}} regression constructed for a specific age <b>group</b> <b>d</b> that includes the value of age estimated at the first stage. As in the publication [8], we shall call the regression used at the first stage global and the one used at the second stage local.|$|R
