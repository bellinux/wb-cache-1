500|$|In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary {{to chair}} a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to {{replicate}} the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform. Unconvinced regarding {{the merits of the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority. The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>proposal</b> that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as [...] "Hillarycare" [...] and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress. Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{support from}} most staff {{and all three}} headteachers, the new Lincolnshire County Council voted to return the scheme for further {{consultation}} in January 1975, a move the Sleaford Standard called [...] "politically motivated". Two of the leading opponents, councillors Eric Fairchild and Reg Brealey, were governors at the secondary modern and Brealey was a former pupil. He proposed a three-school system, arguing it offered more choice: the secondary modern would be consolidated at Westholme as a single-site 11–16 school; Carre's and the High School would operate Sixth Forms. Fairchild argued {{that this would be}} more popular and cheaper. After the Government ordered the Council to submit a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>proposal</b> in 1977, it voted to submit the three-school system, which had become popular with parents and was championed by Brealey, who had become chairman of the Governors. But, the Labour Education Secretary, Shirley Williams, dismissed the proposals in 1978 on grounds that the Sixth Forms would be too small. The council then voted against the two-school system again.|$|E

2500|$|The principality was now {{faced with}} the {{ever-increasing}} Ottoman threat; in 1386, Balša's widow offered to cede Valona to Venice {{in exchange for a}}id, but the Republic refused, since Valona alone without her hinterland was indefensible. Following the decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the situation became yet more precarious. A similar offer in 1393 was also rejected by a Venice anxious not to antagonize the Ottomans, but another, more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>proposal,</b> followed two years later. Through the bishop of Albania, the widow offered to the handover of the entire principality in exchange for a lifelong pension for her and her family of some 7,000 ducats drawn, from the principality's revenue (estimated at 9,000 ducats). Negotiations faltered after the widow's death in 1396. She was succeeded by Ruđina, who in 1391 had married Mrkša Žarković. According to Italian sources, the principality was called the Kingdom of Serbia during Mrksa'a period. Threatened by Ottoman expansion, both Balša's widow and Mrkša repeatedly offered to surrender Valona and their principality to the Venetians, but they refused or procrastinated. After Mrkša's death in 1415, he was briefly succeeded by his widow Ruđina, until the Ottomans took the city in 1417.|$|E
