5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete blood count, <b>C-reactive</b> protein) and acute pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.|$|E
5|$|Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, {{computed}} tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis. Blood tests {{can also help}} identify the presence of infection: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the <b>C-reactive</b> protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as <b>C-reactive</b> protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count and elevated <b>C-reactive</b> protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised <b>C-reactive</b> protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive <b>C-reactive</b> protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, <b>C-reactive</b> protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E
25|$|<b>C-reactive</b> protein can be measured, with an {{elevated}} level being another indication of inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{levels of}} <b>C-reactive</b> protein are {{associated}} with a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|Tests for <b>C-reactive</b> {{protein and}} {{erythrocyte}} sedimentation rate are non-specific tests {{that can be done}} to corroborate the diagnosis of the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Serology: Elevated serum <b>C-reactive</b> protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) {{more than}} three months {{following}} arthroplasty are good screening tests.|$|E
25|$|An {{autoantibody}} screen, {{tests for}} rheumatoid factor, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and <b>C-reactive</b> protein, which may reveal specific causative illnesses or a generalised inflammatory process.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials found that green tea consumption {{was not significantly}} associated with lower plasma levels of <b>C-reactive</b> protein levels (a marker of inflammation).|$|E
25|$|<b>C-reactive</b> protein (CRP): A {{study of}} over 700 nurses showed {{that those in}} the highest {{quartile}} of trans fat consumption had blood levels of CRP that were 73% higher {{than those in the}} lowest quartile.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{parameters}} in {{the blood}} may be slightly raised (these include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, <b>C-reactive</b> protein and white blood cell count), but raised inflammatory markers are strong predictors of other more serious conditions such as septic arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Also, serum {{levels of}} <b>C-reactive</b> protein (CRP), {{a marker of}} {{inflammation}} and predictor of CHD (coronary heart disease) risk, are lower in moderate drinkers than in those who abstain from alcohol, suggesting that alcohol consumption in moderation might have anti-inflammatory effects.|$|E
25|$|For these reasons, {{invasive}} treatment {{should not be}} performed in the acute and active phases of the disease when inflammation is at its peak. The evaluation of disease’s activity is usually based on relapsing symptoms, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and serum levels of CRP (<b>C‐reactive</b> protein).|$|E
25|$|CRP is {{synthesized}} by {{the liver}} {{in response to}} factors released by macrophages and fat cells (adipocytes). It {{is a member of}} the pentraxin family of proteins. It is not related to C-peptide (insulin) or protein C (blood coagulation). <b>C-reactive</b> protein was the first pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to be identified.|$|E
25|$|CTSI's {{staging of}} acute {{pancreatitis}} severity {{has been shown}} {{by a number of}} studies to provide more accurate assessment than APACHE II, Ranson, and <b>C-reactive</b> protein (CRP) level. However, a few studies indicate that CTSI is not significantly associated with the prognosis of hospitalization in patients with pancreatic necrosis, nor is it an accurate predictor of AP severity.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with KLS, MRI and CT scans show normal brain morphology. When SPECT is performed, hypoperfusion {{can often be}} observed in the brain, particularly in the thalamic and frontotemporal areas. The hypoperfusion is significantly diminished between episodes. Serum biology, <b>c-reactive</b> proteins and leptins, the hormonal pituitary axis, and protein in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) are normal in KLS patients.|$|E
25|$|There is debate {{regarding}} whether obesity or {{insulin resistance}} {{is the cause}} of the metabolic syndrome or if they are consequences of a more far-reaching metabolic derangement. A number of markers of systemic inflammation, including <b>C-reactive</b> protein, are often increased, as are fibrinogen, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-α), and others. Some have pointed to a variety of causes, including increased uric acid levels caused by dietary fructose.|$|E
25|$|High-sensitivity <b>C-reactive</b> protein {{has been}} {{developed}} and used as a marker to predict coronary vascular diseases in metabolic syndrome, and it was recently used as a predictor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (steatohepatitis) in correlation with serum markers that indicated lipid and glucose metabolism. Fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis {{can be considered as}} manifestations of metabolic syndrome, indicative of abnormal energy storage as fat in ectopic distribution.|$|E
25|$|Other {{blood tests}} are usually done to {{differentiate}} from other causes of arthritis, like the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), <b>C-reactive</b> protein, full blood count, kidney function, liver enzymes and other immunological tests (e.g., antinuclear antibody/ANA) are all performed at this stage. Elevated ferritin levels can reveal hemochromatosis, a mimic of RA, or {{be a sign of}} Still's disease, a seronegative, usually juvenile, variant of rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|<b>C-reactive</b> protein (CRP) is an annular (ring-shaped), pentameric protein {{found in}} blood plasma, whose levels rise in {{response}} to inflammation. It is an acute-phase protein of hepatic origin that increases following interleukin-6 secretion by macrophages and T cells. Its physiological role is to bind to lysophosphatidylcholine expressed {{on the surface of}} dead or dying cells (and some types of bacteria) in order to activate the complement system via the C1Q complex.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{autoimmune}} disorders largely rests on accurate history and physical {{examination of the}} patient, and high index of suspicion {{against a backdrop of}} certain abnormalities in routine laboratory tests (example, elevated <b>C-reactive</b> protein). In several systemic disorders, serological assays which can detect specific autoantibodies can be employed. Localised disorders are best diagnosed by immunofluorescence of biopsy specimens. Autoantibodies are used to diagnose many autoimmune diseases. The levels of autoantibodies are measured to determine the progress of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Mild disease {{correlates}} {{with fewer than}} four stools daily, with or without blood, no systemic signs of toxicity, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or <b>C-reactive</b> protein (CRP). Mild abdominal pain or cramping may occur. Patients may believe they are constipated {{when in fact they}} are experiencing tenesmus, which is a constant feeling of the need to empty the bowel accompanied by involuntary straining efforts, pain, and cramping with little or no fecal output. Rectal pain is uncommon.|$|E
25|$|In Phase I {{clinical}} trials, curcumin had poor bioavailability, {{was rapidly}} metabolized, retained low levels in plasma and tissues, and was extensively and rapidly excreted, factors that make its in vivo bioactivity unlikely {{and difficult to}} accurately assess. Curcumin appears to reduce circulating <b>C-reactive</b> protein in human subjects, although no dose-response relationship was established. Factors that limit the bioactivity of curcumin or its analogs include chemical instability, water insolubility, absence of potent and selective target activity, low bioavailability, limited tissue distribution, extensive metabolism, and potential for toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Barrager {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} MSM for hay fever. Fifty-five subjects consumed 2.6g of MSM per day for 30 days. This study was not blinded and did not include controls; while an improvement in symptoms was observed compared to initial baseline, no significant changes were observed in two indicators of inflammation (<b>C-reactive</b> protein and immunoglobulin E levels). A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an MSM-containing throat spray to reduce snoring reported a severity decrease of 28% {{in the placebo group}} and 54% for the treated group. The difference was statistically significant.|$|E
25|$|Periodontitis {{has been}} linked to {{increased}} inflammation in the body, such as indicated by raised levels of <b>C-reactive</b> protein and interleukin-6. It is linked through this to increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis. It also linked in those over 60 years of age to impairments in delayed memory and calculation abilities. Individuals with impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus have higher degrees of periodontal inflammation, and often have difficulties with balancing their blood glucose level owing to the constant systemic inflammatory state, caused by the periodontal inflammation. Although no causal association was proven, a recent study showed correlation between chronic periodontitis and erectile dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Arterial damage {{results from}} {{white blood cell}} {{invasion}} and inflammation within the wall. CRP is a general marker for inflammation and infection, {{so it can be}} used as a very rough proxy for heart disease risk. Since many things can cause elevated CRP, this is not a very specific prognostic indicator. Nevertheless, a level above 2.4mg/L has been associated with a doubled risk of a coronary event compared to levels below 1mg/L; however, the study group in this case consisted of patients who had been diagnosed with unstable angina pectoris; whether elevated CRP has any predictive value of acute coronary events in the general population of all age ranges remains unclear. Currently, <b>C-reactive</b> protein is not recommended as a cardiovascular disease screening test for average-risk adults without symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Myocarditis is a {{sometimes}} fatal {{side effect of}} clozapine, which usually develops within {{the first month of}} commencement. First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically <b>C-reactive</b> protein (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, troponin, occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness. Signs of heart failure are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent case-control study found that the risk of clozapine-induced myocarditis is increased with increasing rate of clozapine dose titration, increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate.|$|E
25|$|In {{five percent}} of cases, {{advanced}} periodontitis or gum inflammation between {{the second and third}} molars precipitates the removal of wisdom teeth. Among patients with retained, asymptomatic wisdom teeth, roughly 25% have gum infections (periodontal disease). Teeth with periodontal pockets of greater than 5mm have tooth loss rates that start at 10 teeth lost per 1000 teeth per year at 5mm to a rate of 70 teeth lost per year per 1000 teeth at 11mm. The risk of periodontal disease and caries on third molars increases with age with a small minority (less than 2%) of adults age 65 years or older maintaining the teeth without caries or periodontal disease and 13% maintaining unimpacted wisdom teeth without caries or periodontal disease. Periodontal probing depths increase over time to greater than 4mm in a significant proportion of young adults with retained impacted wisdom teeth which is associated with increases in serum inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and <b>C-reactive</b> protein.|$|E
25|$|Tests for {{inflammation}} (<b>C-reactive</b> {{protein and}} the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are typically elevated, and abnormal liver enzymes may be seen. If the kidneys are involved, tests of renal function (such as urea and creatinine) are elevated. The {{complete blood count}} may show particularly high numbers of a type of white blood cell known as eosinophils (more than 0.5 billion per liter); this occurs in only 60-80% of cases, so normal eosinophil counts do {{not rule out the}} diagnosis. Examination of the urine may show red blood cells (occasionally in casts as seen under the microscope) and increased levels of protein; in a third of the cases with kidney involvement, eosinophils can also be detected in the urine. If vasculitis is suspected, complement levels may be determined as reduced levels are often encountered in vasculitis; complement is a group of proteins that forms part of the innate immune system. Complement levels are frequently reduced in cholesterol embolism, limiting the use of this test in the distinction between vasculitis and cholesterol embolism.|$|E
500|$|Some other {{possible}} roles of APOA5 variants have been discussed, but generally these reports comprise {{only one or}} two papers – and first original papers with positive findings are usually not confirmed in second publications. These papers focus on the possible effect of different APOA5 variants on maternal height, longer foetal birth length, putative associations with plasma levels of <b>C-reactive</b> protein, LDL particle size and haemostatic markers. [...] Despite the very low plasma concentration, variants within apolipoprotein A5 are potent determinants of plasma triglyceride levels. Minor alleles of three SNPs (rs662799, rs3135506, rs3135507) are associated with the higher risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
