5|$|In {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses from 2005 onwards, important {{groups of}} developmental genes {{show the same}} variety in cnidarians as in <b>chordates.</b> In fact cnidarians, and especially anthozoans (sea anemones and corals), retain some genes that are present in bacteria, protists, plants and fungi but not in bilaterians.|$|E
5|$|Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) are collectively called lophophorates, {{because all}} feed using lophophores. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and {{morphological}} features placed lophophorates among or as a sister {{group to the}} deuterostomes, a super-phylum that includes <b>chordates</b> and echinoderms. In the early development of their embryos, deuterostomes form the anus before the mouth, while protostomes form the mouth first.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to <b>chordates,</b> and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these {{can be stored in}} a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E

We describe the structure and gene content of the highly polymorphic {approx} 520 million base pair genome of the Florida lancelet Branchiostoma floridae, and analyze {{it in the context of}} <b>chordate</b> evolution. Whole genome comparisons illuminate the murky relationships among the three <b>chordate</b> groups (tunicates, lancelets, and vertebrates), and allow reconstruction of not only the gene complement of the last common <b>chordate</b> ancestor, but also a partial reconstruction of its genomic organization, as well as a description of two genome-wide duplications and subsequent reorganizations in the vertebrate lineage. These genome-scale events shaped the vertebrate genome and provided additional genetic variation for exploitation during vertebrate evolution...|$|R

On {{the basis of these}} findings, they constructed a new scenario for <b>chordate</b> evolution. Subsequently, Mallatt and Holland reconsidered Conway Morris and Caron's description, and concluded that many of the newly recognized characters are unique, already-divergent specializations that would not be helpful for establishing Pikaia as a basal <b>chordate.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied <b>chordates</b> that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed {{them to be more}} agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010 {{there are}} no indisputable body fossils of phoronids. There is good {{evidence}} that phoronids created trace fossils found in the Silurian, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and possibly in the Ordovician and Triassic. Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) have collectively been called lophophorates, because all use lophophores to feed. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and morphological features placed lophophorates among or as a sister group to the deuterostomes, a super-phylum which includes <b>chordates</b> and echinoderms. While a minority adhere to this view, most researchers now regard phoronids {{as members of the}} protostome super-phylum Lophotrochozoa. Although analysts using molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. Some analyses regard phoronids and brachiopods as sister-groups, while others place phoronids as a sub-group within brachiopoda.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. It is now clear the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and <b>chordates)</b> as was hypothesized earlier, but {{should be included in the}} Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid worms), in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the nucleotid sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe worms are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. For now, the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. Consequently, it has been suggested to included horseshoe worms in the Brachiopoda as a class named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains one class, which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional classification of brachiopods into inarticulate and articulate, two approaches appeared in the 1990s: one approach groups the inarticulate Craniida with articulate brachiopods, since both use the same material in the mineral layers of their shell; the other approach makes the Craniida a third group, as their outer organic layer {{is different from that}} in either of the other two. However, some taxonomists believe it is premature to suggest higher levels of classification such as order and recommend a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups. Traditionally, brachiopods have been regarded as members of, or as a sister group to, the deuterostomes, a superphylum that includes <b>chordates</b> and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the evolutionary relationships of brachiopods has always placed brachiopods as protostomes while another type has split between placing brachiopods among the protostomes or the deuterostomes.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} than 65,000 living species of <b>chordates,</b> about half are bony fish of the {{superclass}} Osteichthyes.

25|$|Attempts to {{work out}} the {{evolutionary}} relationships of the <b>chordates</b> have produced several hypotheses. The current consensus is that <b>chordates</b> are monophyletic, meaning that the Chordata include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, which is itself a chordate, and that craniates' nearest relatives are tunicates.|$|E

50|$|CYP19 {{is present}} in an early-diverging <b>chordate,</b> the cephalochordate {{amphioxus}} (the Florida lancelet, Branchiostoma floridae), {{but not in the}} earlier diverging tunicate Ciona intestinalis. Thus, the aromatase gene evolved early in <b>chordate</b> evolution and {{does not appear to be}} present in nonchordate invertebrates (e.g. insects, molluscs, echinoderms, sponges, corals). However, estrogens may be synthesized in some of these organisms, via other unknown pathways.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDevelopmental {{signaling}} by {{retinoic acid}} (RA) {{is thought to}} be an innovation essential for the origin of the <b>chordate</b> body plan. The larvacean urochordate Oikopleura dioica maintains a <b>chordate</b> body plan throughout life, and yet its genome appears to lack genes for RA synthesis, degradation, and reception. This suggests the hypothesis that the RA-machinery was lost during larvacean evolution, and predicts that Oikopleura development has become independent of RA-signaling. This prediction raises the problem that the anterior–posterior organization of a <b>chordate</b> body plan can be developed without the classical morphogenetic role of RA. To address this problem, we performed pharmacological treatments and analyses of developmental molecular markers to investigate whether RA acts in anterior–posterior axial patterning in Oikopleura embryos. Results revealed that RA does not cause homeotic posteriorization in Oikopleura as it does in vertebrates and cephalochordates, and showed that a <b>chordate</b> can develop the phylotypic body plan {{in the absence of the}} classical morphogenetic role of RA. A comparison of Oikopleura and ascidian evidence suggests that the lack of RA-induced homeotic posteriorization is a shared derived feature of urochordates. We discuss possible relationships of altered roles of RA in urochordate development to genomic events, such as rupture of the Hox-cluster, in the context of a new understanding of <b>chordate</b> phylogeny...|$|R

25|$|There {{is still}} much ongoing {{differential}} (DNA sequence based) comparison research {{that is trying to}} separate out the simplest forms of <b>chordates.</b> As some lineages of the 90% of species that lack a backbone or notochord might have lost these structures over time, this complicates the classification of <b>chordates.</b> Some chordate lineages may only be found by DNA analysis, when there is no physical trace of any chordate-like structures.|$|E

25|$|A {{chordate}} is {{an animal}} {{belonging to the}} phylum Chordata; they possess a notochord, a hollow dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, an endostyle, and a post-anal tail, {{for at least some}} period of their life cycle. <b>Chordates</b> are deuterostomes, as during the embryo development stage the anus forms before the mouth.
