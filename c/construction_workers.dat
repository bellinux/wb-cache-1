5|$|In {{addition}} to the township, {{there were a number}} of temporary camps established for <b>construction</b> <b>workers.</b> It was initially intended that the <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> should live off-site, but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers. <b>Construction</b> <b>workers</b> therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the trailer camp at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units. Another, at Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off, but they continued to be occupied in 1946.|$|E

50|$|Yat-ming and Smart are {{assigned}} to a case where a building <b>construction</b> <b>worker</b> was found unconscious at the construction site and later died from brain injuries. They must {{find out the truth}} on what happened in order for his family to collect on his worker compensation insurance. Yat-ming and Smart can't determine if the <b>construction</b> <b>worker</b> died from work related injuries but seeing how the <b>construction</b> <b>worker's</b> widow now has to raise two small children on her own, Yat-ming writes a report that is in the <b>constructions</b> <b>worker's</b> widow favor.|$|R

50|$|That night, a wall breaks {{open and}} a <b>construction</b> <b>worker's</b> corpse falls through. The worker pulls Terry into the wall, which seals behind him. Upstairs, Al notices a hazy image of the <b>construction</b> <b>worker</b> in her mirror before Glen bursts into her bedroom. Al throws a stereo at the <b>construction</b> <b>worker</b> and he disintegrates into dozens of little demons. Al holds the bedroom door shut while Glen races downstairs to find their father's gun. A demonic version of Terry appears, biting his hand before Al stabs Terry in the eye. Al and Glen hide in a closet, but the <b>construction</b> <b>worker</b> breaks through an {{interior}} wall and drags Al away.|$|R
5|$|Simultaneously, {{public opinion}} polls during {{the second week of}} May showed that 50 percent of the American public {{approved}} of President Nixon's actions. Fifty-eight percent blamed the students for what had occurred at Kent State. On both sides, emotions ran high. In one instance, in New York City on 8 May, pro-administration <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> rioted and attacked demonstrating students. Such violence, however, was an aberration. Most demonstrations, both pro- and anti-war, were peaceful. On 20 May 100,000 <b>construction</b> <b>workers,</b> tradesmen, and office workers marched peacefully through New York City in support of the president's policies.|$|E
5|$|While {{the freeway}} was under {{construction}} in 1983, {{it was discovered that}} it ran through Native American burial grounds in Deptford. This revelation led to unsuccessful lawsuits to cease construction of the route. After the lawsuits, a couple of incidents happened to <b>construction</b> <b>workers,</b> including a construction worker being run over by an asphalt truck, another being blown off a bridge by strong winds, and a van carrying five <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> randomly erupting into flames.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, he {{was elected}} {{secretary}} of the New York City Building Trades Council, the city federation of unions to represent <b>construction</b> <b>workers.</b> He won a court injunction against a lockout in 1927, then considered an innovative tactic, opposed {{by many of the}} older leaders, for a union.|$|E

5|$|The <b>{{construction}}</b> <b>workers</b> (who {{reached a}} peak of 44,900 in June 1944) lived in a construction camp near the old Hanford townsite. The administrators and engineers lived in the government town established at Richland Village, which eventually had accommodation in 4,300 family units and 25 dormitories.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, over 120 {{international}} artists urged {{a boycott}} of both the Louvre and Guggenheim museums over concerns regarding the abuse and exploitation of <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> employed to develop the complex. In December 2013, The Guardian reported that conditions for the workers at the construction sites amount to modern-day slavery.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Silverstein {{appeared}} {{at a rally}} of <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> and public officials outside an insurance industry conference. He highlighted {{what he describes as}} the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks. Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority is a cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} intended that the <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> should live off-site, but the poor {{condition of the}} roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn {{made it difficult to}} find and retain workers. <b>Construction</b> <b>workers</b> therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse and a cold storage plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946.|$|E

5|$|Monk calls Lieutenant Disher and {{explains}} {{what he thinks}} happened. Stefan and his mistress murdered Barbara and the mistress disguised herself as Barbara. Stefan, being a pilot, then used his valid identification card and its virtually unlimited access to hide the body at a construction site at the airport. The <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> poured concrete over the corpse, unwittingly destroying the evidence.|$|E
5|$|That night Quatermass {{travels with}} {{journalist}} Hugh Conrad to the prefab town where they meet with <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> {{who say that}} work has been suspended for all except the 'zombies' ('marked' people). They claim that the meteorites are only over-shots from the plant after one of them lands in a pub. These recent meteorites are falling in hundreds and being collected by special guard teams {{then returned to the}} plant. Quatermass steals a guard's uniform from a lorry to gain entry to the plant. As he does this Conrad returns to the pub to telephone his newspaper and reveal everything about the secret alien invasion, but he becomes 'marked' before he can finish. The <b>construction</b> <b>workers,</b> however, hear what he says and decide to take action. Meanwhile, Quatermass is inside a pressure dome, where he sees guards putting meteorites into the tanks of poisonous slime that killed Ward, where together, in the recreated atmosphere of a moon of Saturn, they combine and grow into the first of the enormous ammonid alien creatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{city walls}} have been {{preserved}} {{to the present}} day, {{not only because of}} the knowledge of the skilled <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed, but also because of the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Ragusa, which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Republic of Ragusa.|$|E

5|$|The mounted police {{took on a}} {{range of}} tasks {{associated}} with the new project. Teams of police escorted the construction teams as they moved across the Rocky Mountains, having been given special jurisdiction over the area along the line of the route. They enforced the liquor laws, and oversaw the itinerant service workers who accompanied the main construction teams. They defused many of the tensions involving the <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> and the company, including intervening to resolve cases where the workers had not been paid by the company as promised, but they also intervened to support the railway company. When the railway staff went on strike for higher wages in 1883, the mounted police guarded the company's trains, escorted in new drivers and, when necessary, drove the locomotives themselves; two years later the police broke up a protest over unpaid wages by over a thousand <b>construction</b> <b>workers,</b> arresting the main leaders. The head of the Canadian Pacific Railway, William Van Horne, thanked the force for its contribution to the final completion of the project.|$|E
5|$|The portion through Echo Canyon {{follows the}} {{historical}} routes of the Mormon Trail, US-30S, and the First Transcontinental Railroad.
