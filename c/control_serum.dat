40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) {{is a new}} {{signalling}} pathway in bone repair. Evidence {{exist that}} SHH pathway {{plays a significant role}} in vasculogenesis and limb development during embryogenesis. Some in vitro and animal studies has already proven its potential for bone regeneration. However, no data on the role of SHH in the human fracture healing have been published so far. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with long bone fractures were included into the study and divided in 2 groups. First group contained 69 patients with normal fracture healing. Four patients with impaired fracture healing formed the second group. 34 volunteers donated blood samples as <b>control.</b> <b>Serum</b> samples were collected over a period of 1 year following a standardized time schedule. In addition, SHH levels were measured in fracture haematoma and serum of 16 patients with bone fractures. RESULTS: Fracture haematoma and patients serum both contained lower SHH concentrations compared to <b>control</b> <b>serum.</b> The comparison between the patients' serum SHH level and the <b>control</b> <b>serum</b> revealed lower levels for the patients at all measurement time points. Significantly lower concentrations were observed at weeks 1 and 2 after fracture. SHH levels were slightly decreased in patients with impaired fracture healing without statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report local and systemic concentration of SHH in human fracture healing and SHH serum levels in healthy adults. A significant reduction of the SHH levels during the inflammatory phase of fracture healing was found. SHH concentrations in fracture haematoma and serum were lower than the concentration in <b>control</b> <b>serum</b> {{for the rest of the}} healing period. Our findings indicate that there is no relevant involvement of SHH in human fracture healing. Fracture repair process seem to reduce the SHH level in human.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals with a study of serum retinol and related factors in patients with epithelial tumours (cervical, endometrial, and bladder carcinoma) and non epithelial tumours (malignant melanomas and sarcomas). In addition, dietary retinol and beta carotene intakes were measured in the epithelial cancer studies. The patients with cervical cancer had significantly lower serum concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, retinol binding protein (RBP) and prealbumin (PA) and significantly higher serum copper concentrations than both healthy volunteers and hospital <b>controls.</b> <b>Serum</b> concentrations of the parameters measured were similar in patients with pre-malignant cervical changes and hospital controls. Dietary preformed retinol, total retinol and beta carotene intakes of patients with malignant and pre-malignant cervical disease {{were not significantly different}} from hospital <b>controls.</b> <b>Serum</b> concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, RBP and PA were significantly lower in patients with advanced cervical cancer than in patients with early disease. Dietary intake of retinol and beta carotene was not lower in patients with advanced disease. Notable differences in serum and dietary parameters were observed between hospital controls and volunteers, and for some parameters larger differences occurred between the two groups of controls than between hospital controls and cancer patients. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Serum concentrations of retinol, RBP, and copper were similar in endometrial cancer patients and hospital <b>controls.</b> <b>Serum</b> concentrations of carotenoids were significantly lower in endometrial cancer patients than in <b>controls.</b> <b>Serum</b> retinol and associated factors were very similar in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and in patients previously treated for bladder cancer; {{there were no significant differences}} between these two groups and the controls. Dietary intake in the three groups were also similar. In contrast to cervical cancer, the majority of patients with endometrial and bladder carcinoma had early disease. Serum concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, RBP and PA were significantly lower in patients with sarcomas when compared to hospital controls. In contrast, in patients with malignant melanoma the level of carotenoids and prealbumin in the serum were significantly lower than in controls while levels of retinol and RBP were similar to controls. Possible reasons for the lower levels of retinol and associated factors in some groups of cancer patients are discussed. The problems and limitations of estimates of dietary vitamin A intake are also discussed.

40|$|The resting O 2 {{consumption}} of alveolar and peritoneal macrophages obtained from rats at 4 and 24 h after thermal injury was unaltered from control values. However, when heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa or polystyrene latex particles {{were added to}} the cell suspensions to initiate phagocytosis, a significant depression in the respiratory burst accompanying the phagocytic event was demonstrated. The addition of phorbol myristate acetate, used to maximize the respiratory response, was ineffective in elevating, to control values, the respiratory burst of macrophages obtained from burned animals. The deficit was only, in part, serum mediated since the responses could not be restored to control values even when the cells from the burned animals were vigorously washed with <b>control</b> <b>serum</b> and incubated with <b>control</b> <b>serum.</b> The contribution of a burn serum factor, which was non-dialyzable, heat stable at 56 °C but not at 65 °C, and insensitive to pronase treatment, must be considered.

40|$|Introduction: Circulating {{cell-free}} DNA (cf-DNA) is {{a useful}} indicator of cell death, and {{it can also be}} used to predict outcomes in various clinical disorders. Several innate immune mechanisms are known to be involved in eliminating DNA and chromatin-related material as part of the inhibition of potentially harmful autoimmune responses. However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying the clearance of circulating cf-DNA is currently unclear. Methods: To examine the mechanisms <b>controlling</b> <b>serum</b> levels of cf-DNA, we carried out a genome-wide associatio...|$|R
