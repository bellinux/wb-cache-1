40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} analysis was carried out <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> viscoplastic deformation of solder joints in a ball grid array (BGA) package under temperature cycle. The effects of constraint on print circuit board (PCB) and stiffness of substrate on the deformation behaviour of the solder joints were also studied. A relative damage stress was adopted <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> potential failure sites in the solder joints. The results indicated that high inelastic strain and strain energy density were developed in <b>the</b> joints <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> package center. On the other hand, high constraint and high relative damage stress were associated with <b>the</b> joint <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> silicon chip. <b>The</b> joint <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> silicon chip was regarded as the most susceptible failure site if cavitation instability is the dominant failure mechanism. Increase the external constraint on the print circuit board (PCB) causes {{a slight increase in}} stress triaxiality (m/eq) and relative damage stress in <b>the</b> joint <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of silicon die. The relative damage stress is not sensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Young’s modulus of the substrate...|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} team was strongly criticised by the West Bay Coastguards in June 2014 for filming too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of East Cliff at West Bay. Severe weather and recent rockslides left the cliffs unstable, and a Coastguard volunteer said the {{production team}} should have used stakes, safety lines, harnesses, and helmets. A {{spokesperson for the}} Broadchurch production defended the film crew, noting that the production team received all necessary filming permits, visited the site numerous times to ensure safety, and took other reasonable health and safety precautions.|$|E
25|$|The M6 {{motorway}} {{runs from}} junction 19 of the M1 {{and from the}} beginning of A14 in Catthorpe near Rugby in central England, passes between Coventry and Nuneaton, through Birmingham, Walsall and Stafford and near the major cities of Wolverhampton and Stoke-on-Trent. The motorway has major junctions with the M56 and M62 at Warrington, giving access to Chester, Manchester and Liverpool. The M6 then heads north past Wigan, Preston and Lancaster. After the latter two cities it passes through Cumbria with some parts very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the Lake District with a short stretch within the national park boundaries and then passes Carlisle on its way to Gretna, before the motorway becomes the A74(M) a few hundred metres (yards) short of the Scottish border.|$|E
25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So if you decide to use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E

25|$|The {{tone quality}} {{can be altered}} without {{switching}} sticks or adjusting the tuning. For example, by playing <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge,</b> <b>the</b> sound becomes thinner. A more staccato sound can be produced by changing the velocity of the stroke or playing <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> center. There are many more variations in technique that a timpanist uses {{during the course of}} playing to produce subtle timbral differences.|$|R
30|$|The {{strength}} of the enhancement could also come from a scattering center. The scattering center is the nanofiber that anchors in microholes and is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> holes. These scattering centers decay the surface plasmon length.|$|R
25|$|The {{construction}} of the weir, according to the Council minutes, was designed by the Council's Civil Engineers Department which was a concrete and reinforced steel structure. The creation of this lake proved very popular with the community as many social functions were held as recorded in the newspapers. Those activities were swimming, canoeing, various games of sport and picnics. As part of this two small bathing boxes were erected as change rooms on the flat area <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the top of}} the bank. In 1931 a devastating flood in Enoggera Creek occurred under-mining the supporting earth bank at the west end of the concrete weir wall, reducing the water-retaining capacity of the wall and was not able to serve its design purpose – as well the bathing boxes were washed away and were not replaced. History has not recorded the outcome of the weir but it is believed within the community that the structure was dynamited and destroyed some time in the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} long-duration gamma-ray bursts {{produce a}} total energy output of about 1044 joules (as much energy as our Sun will produce in its entire life-time) {{but in a}} period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are approximately 50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation from high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leave the region of the event horizon of a newly formed black hole created during supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving at relativistic speeds are focused for a few tens of seconds by the magnetic field of the exploding hypernova. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the energetics of the process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be pointed toward the Earth, it shines at gamma ray frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected even at distances of up to 10 billion light years, which is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the visible universe.|$|E

30|$|Although {{gradients}} in the studied {{parameters are}} better {{resolved in the}} simulations compared with calculations from experiments, the result is still largely dependent on the mesh density. The gradients, and also the maximum value of the effective strain, will increase with smaller elements {{in contact with the}} tools and decrease with larger elements. Therefore, if the limitation in the digital image correlation technique <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> sheet is ignored, the mesh density in the finite element simulations can be matched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resolution in <b>the</b> measurements <b>to</b> obtain comparable results. This matching was initially done in the simulations, but the experimental results required filtering that reduced the effective resolution and the limitation in <b>the</b> measurements <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> was substantial. <b>The</b> measurements at <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> were also negatively influenced by the sample preparation as discussed by Gustafsson et al. (2016 b). In the present state, the experiments are best used if <b>the</b> data <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> are ignored and the remaining data are used for validation of a finite element model that later can provide the missing experimental data.|$|R
