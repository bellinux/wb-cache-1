50|$|The WA Parish Generating Station, is a {{power station}} in unincorporated Thompsons, Texas, the station {{occupies}} a 4,664-acre site nearby Smithers Lake southwest of Houston in Fort Bend County and consists of two four-unit plants; one natural gas and the other coal (2,697 MW).

50|$|In a <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> the DNC {{rating is}} simply the maximum rated output minus the power {{consumed}} onsite. It is sometimes termed the switchyard output, and takes no account of transmission losses in the grid, which may be considerable {{in the case of}} a remote hydro station for example. Most but not all quoted power station ratings are DNC ratings rather than the simple capacity of the alternators.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of a wind power station, the {{situation}} is more complex. The alternator of a wind turbine is normally specified to match the strongest wind in which the turbine is designed to operate. This is because most of the cost of a wind turbine is in the rotor and the tower and bearings that support it, rather than in the alternator. It makes no economic sense to restrict the size of the alternator to anything less than the maximum that the rotor will deliver. However, this means that, unlike a <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> a wind turbine rarely achieves its maximum rated output while operating.|$|E

Sediment from the Yokoyama Dam's reservoir was used as fill as well. In September 2006 initial filling of the reservoir behind the Tokuyama Dam began and by June 2008, the dam was complete. Filling was complete in September. In October of the same year, J-Power passed oversight of the power station construction to Chubu. The first generator, Unit 1, was commissioned on 15 May 2014.

40|$|Because {{of social}} and {{economic}} development, the demand for energy and particularly for electricity is growing rapidly in Turkey. The main indigenous energy resources are hydro and lignite. Turkey has no big oil and gas reserves. Almost all oil natural gas (NG) and high quality coal are imported. It has a large potential for renewable energies. Hydroelectricity is well established as one of the principal energy-producing technologies around world, providing some 20 % of the world’s electricity. In the developing countries, the proportion rises to around 40 - 50 %. The capacity of large hydroelectric schemes can be several times that of a <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> They are highly efficient, reliable, and long lasting. Turkey has an abundant hydropower potential to be used for generation of electricity and must increase hydropower production in the near future.

40|$|A {{floating}} solar chimney {{power station}} (FSCPS) has three major components: A circular solar collector A floating solar chimney {{in the center}} of the solar collector A set of air turbines geared to electric generators around the bottom of the solar chimney The efficiency of the FSCPSs is roughly proportional to the height of their floating solar chimneys. The floating solar chimneys (FSCs) are made by successive balloon tubes, that are filled with He or NH 3. This permits to the FSCs to float in the air and thus to have heights a few Kms. In the present paper the effect on the FSCPS's operation of the thermal storage, due to ground or water in plastic bags or closed plastic tubes, is examined. It is shown that the FSCPSs equipped with thermal storage can operate 24 hours per day 365 days per year with a minimum guaranteed power production. This means that the FSCPSs, although renewable by nature, have a similar operation to conventional power stations. Large FSCPSs (above 20 MW) can be very cost competitive to any <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> due to their low construction, maintenance and operation costs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{consideration}} of the contact between the steel spiral casing and the peripheral reinforced concrete, a nonlinear analysis for the combined bearing structure of the JinPing-I preloading filling spiral case has been made with ANSYS. Contrasts of {{the stress of the}} reinforcing bars, the biggest width of the crack and the outspread section of the crack has been made with the different parameters of preloading pressure and reinforcement scheme, resulting in a reasonable preloading pressure and reinforcement scheme. This conclusion has been applied to the spiral casing of JinPing-I hydropower station.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{parameters}} affecting {{the reliability of the}} renewable energy sources (RES) system, compared to the local <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> is the ability to forecast the RES availability for a few hours ahead. To this end, the main objective of this work is the prognosis of the mean, maximum and minimum hourly wind power (WP) 8 hours ahead. For this purpose, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) modeling is applied. For the appropriate training of the developed ANN models hourly meteorological data are used. These data have been recorded by a meteorological mast in Tilos Island, Greece. For the evaluation of the developed ANN forecasting models proper statistical evaluation indices are used. According to the results, the coefficient of the determination ranges from 0. 285 up to 0. 768 (mean hourly WP), from 0. 227 up to 0. 798 (maximum hourly WP) and from 0. 025 up to 0. 398 (minimum hourly WP). Furthermore, the proposed forecasting methodology shows that is able to give sufficient and adequate prognosis of WP by a wind turbine in a specific location 8 hours ahead. This will be a useful tool for the operator of a RES system in order to achieve a better monitoring and a better management of the whole system...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the field}} of power generation, aging assets and a desire for {{improved}} maintenance decision-making tools have led to growing interest in asset prognostics. Valve failures can account for 7 % or more of mechanical failures, and since a <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> will contain many hundreds of valves, this represents a significant asset base. This paper presents a prognostic approach for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of valves experiencing degradation, utilizing a similarity-based method. Case study data is generated through simulation of valves within a 400 MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine power station. High fidelity industrial simulators are often produced for operator training, to allow personnel to experience fault procedures and take corrective action in a safe, simulation environment, without endangering staff or equipment. This work repurposes such a high fidelity simulator to generate the type of condition monitoring data which would be produced {{in the presence of}} a fault. A first principles model of valve degradation was used to generate multiple run-to-failure events, at different degradation rates. The associated parameter data was collected to generate a library of failure cases. This set of cases was partitioned into training and test sets for prognostic modeling and the similarity based prognostic technique applied to calculate RUL. Results are presented of the technique’s accuracy, and conclusions are drawn about the applicability of the technique to this domain. 1...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{renewable}} energy sources (RES) have been established {{as one of the}} main solutions in coping with the future energy needs, without the negative effects caused by the use of fossil fuels. The exploitation of RES however, faces serious difficulties concerning the penetration limits in the electrical grid due to its stochastic and variable availability. One of the main parameters affecting the reliability of the RES system, compared to the local <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> is the ability to forecast the RES availability for a few hours ahead. The main goal of this work is the forecasting of global solar irradiation (GSI) on an horizontal plane, in hourly bases, 24 hours ahead based only on historical meteorological data and artificial neural networks (ANN) modeling techniques. For that purpose, appropriate meteorological data have been recorded on minute intervals by a meteorological mast installed in Tilos Island, Greece from 17 / 03 / 2015 up to 20 / 12 / 2015. According to the forecasting results, the coefficient of determination ranges between 0. 500 and 0. 851 as well as the root mean square error ranges between 0. 065 kWh/m 2 and 0. 105 kWh/m 2.
