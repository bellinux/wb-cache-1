5000|$|Ground {{continuity}} monitors are a {{means to}} provide protection to workers as part of OSHA regulations. [...] This OSHA regulation applies only to construction sites. (e.g. early stages of construction where access to a reliable ground might not exist or where portable generators might be used) The use of ground continuity monitors is one option in these environments. GFCI protected circuits are also one option under the OSHA standard. Specifically, the OSHA regulation specifies “The employer shall use either ground fault circuit interrupters … or an assured equipment grounding conductor program … to protect employees on construction sites.” The OSHA regulation also requires that each ground conductor and/or <b>cordset</b> shall be inspected each day, prior to use and after maintenance. The ground is required to be checked for electrical continuity and this test must be documented. The automatic cord mounted GCMs eliminate the need to test each cord or circuit, since the electrical impedance to ground is measured at the attached cord device and visibility indicated there via an LED. These inspections are required by the OSHA regulation on “receptacles which are {{not a part of}} the permanent wiring of the building”. [...] As discussed earlier, the permanent wiring of a building might not be established during the early stages of a construction site and therefore would necessitate some assurance of ground protection.|$|E

50|$|An ANS 500/132 may be {{upgraded}} to an ANS 500/200 by installing the 200 MHz processor accessory card. It {{is possible to}} upgrade an ANS 500 to an ANS 700 or to downgrade an ANS 700 to an ANS 500 simply by exchanging the power back panel and PSU(s), but {{it is necessary to}} completely disassemble the base of the ANS in order to accomplish such an upgrade or downgrade. An ANS 700 has but one input power connection, even though it has dual, independent PSUs. However, an ANS 700 may be easily converted into a dual primary power configuration (independent primary power, possibly, and desirably, from different power panels, one possibly backed up by an uninterruptible power supply) by removing the IEC input power connector and physically and electrically connecting two input power <b>cordsets,</b> one to each of the redundant PSUs. However, this modification probably invalidates the machine's UL Listing. Nevertheless, such a modification would implement a true N+1 redundancy configuration.|$|R
