50|$|The term {{photonic}} molecule {{has been}} also used since 1998 for an unrelated phenomenon involving electromagnetically-interacting optical microcavities. The properties of quantized confined photon states in optical micro- and nanocavities {{are very similar}} to those of <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> states in atoms. Owing to this similarity, optical microcavities can be termed ‘photonic atoms’. Taking this analogy even further, a cluster of several mutually-coupled photonic atoms forms a photonic molecule. When individual photonic atoms are brought into close proximity, their optical modes interact and give rise to a spectrum of hybridized super-modes of photonic molecules.|$|E

This scientific field is a prime example of a domain where two-dimensional physics and photoemission-based spectroscopic techniques have together set up the development of the story. The discovery of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system (2 DES) at interfaces of transition metal oxides has attracted an immense scientific interest due to new opportunities opened in the emerging field of oxide electronics. The subsequent paradigm shift from interfaces to the bare surfaces of TMOs made the <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> system accessible to surface-sensitive spectroscopic techniques and this new era is the focus of the present article. We describe how results by means of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) establish the presence of <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> carriers at the bare surface of SrTiO 3 (100), which exhibit complex physics phenomena such as orbital ordering, electron-phonon interactions and spin splitting. The key element behind the 2 DES generation is oxygen vacancies. Moreover, we review the experimental evidence on the generation of 2 DESs on surfaces with different orientation, as well as on different TMO substrates. The electronic structure of the <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> system responds to such changes, thereby providing external means for engineering its properties.

When such <b>confined</b> <b>electrons</b> are allowed to tunnel to metallicle ads a single electron transistor (SET) is created. This transistor turns on and off again every time one electron is added to the isolated region. Whereas we can understand conventional transistors using classical concepts, the SET is quantum mechanical in an essential way. In fact, there is a close analogy between the <b>confined</b> <b>electrons</b> inside an SET and an atom. In this review, the physics underlying the operation of SETs is explained, a brief history of its invention is presented, and issues of current interest are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The spin of a <b>confined</b> <b>electron,</b> when {{oriented}} originally in some direction, {{will lose}} {{memory of that}} orientation after some time. Physical mechanisms leading to this relaxation of spin memory typically involve either coupling of the electron spin to its orbital motion or to nuclear spins. Relaxation of <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> spin has been previously measured only for Zeeman or exchange split spin states, where spin-orbit effects dominate relaxation, while spin flips due to nuclei have been observed in optical spectroscopy studies. Using an isolated GaAs double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gates and direct time domain measurements, we investigate in detail spin relaxation for arbitrary splitting of spin states. Results demonstrate that electron spin flips are dominated by nuclear interactions and are slowed by several orders of magnitude when a magnetic field of a few millitesla is applied. These results have significant implications for spin-based information processing...|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} proposed that further improved functionals for density functional theory {{can be constructed}} based on the Armiento-Mattsson subsystem functional scheme if, {{in addition to the}} uniform electron gas and surface models used in the Armiento-Mattsson 2005 functional, a model for the strongly <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> gas is also added. However, of central importance for this scheme is an index that identifies regions in space where the correction provided by the <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> gas should be applied. The electron localization function (ELF) is a well-known indicator of strongly localized electrons. We use a model of a <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> gas based on the harmonic oscillator to show that regions with high ELF directly coincide with regions where common exchange energy functionals have large errors. This suggests that the harmonic oscillator model together with an index based on the ELF provides the crucial ingredients for future improved semi-local functionals. For a practical illustration of how the proposed scheme is intended to work for a physical system we discuss monoclinic cupric oxide, CuO. A thorough discussion of this system leads us to promote the cell geometry of CuO as a useful benchmark for future semi-local functionals. Very high ELF values are found in a shell around the O ions, and take its maximum value along the Cu–O directions. An estimate of the exchange functional error from the effect of electron confinement in these regions suggests a magnitude and sign that could account for the error in cell geometry...|$|E

The possibility to electrostatically <b>confine</b> <b>electrons</b> in a gate-defined ``quantum dot'' with finite-carrier density, surrounded by an undoped graphene sheet, strongly depends on the integrability of the electron dynamics in the quantum dot. With the present calculations we can quantitatively compare confinement in dots with integrable and chaotic dynamics, and verify the prediction that the Berry phase associated with the pseudospin leads to partial confinement in situations where no confinement is expected according to the arguments relying on the classical dynamics only.

40|$|The {{effect of}} wetting layers on the strain and {{electronic}} structure of InAs self-assembled quantum dots grown on GaAs is investigated with an atomistic valence-force-field model and an empirical tight-binding model. By comparing a dot {{with and without}} a wetting layer, {{we find that the}} inclusion of the wetting layer weakens the strain inside the dot by only 1 % relative change, while it reduces the energy gap between a <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> and hole level by as much as 10 %. The small change in the strain distribution indicates that strain relaxes only little through the thin wetting layer. The large reduction of the energy gap is attributed to the increase of the confining-potential width rather than the change of the potential height. First-order perturbation calculations or, alternatively, the addition of an InAs disk below the quantum dot confirm this conclusion. The effect of the wetting layer on the wave function is qualitatively different for the weakly <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> state and the strongly confined hole state. The electron wave function shifts from the buffer to the wetting layer, while the hole shifts from the dot to the wetting layer. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figures, and 3 table...|$|E

Experiments using a high field Gabor Lens have shown a correlation between the thermalisation of the enclosed electron cloud and the focussing quality. Especially a nonuniform energy distribution of the <b>confined</b> <b>electron</b> cloud leads to a Diocotron instability and therefore a change of the radial electron density profile. The resulting nonlinear focussing field forms the observed aberrations. A three segmented Gabor Lens was constructed recently for a more detailed investigation of the plasma parameters as function of the external fields.
