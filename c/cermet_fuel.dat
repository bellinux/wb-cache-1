Results from electron structure calculations {{within the framework}} of density functional theory are used to assess parameters in a rate theory model. The model is used to reproduce experimental desorption spectra, which, to a large degree of accuracy, coincide with experimental data in temperature regions relevant for nuclear fuel applications. The models indicate that produced helium will diffuse out into the fuel pin during operation. However, some helium will be trapped in molybdenum vacancies. The amount of trapped helium will largely depend on the fuel operational temperature.

The goal of the FY 12 - 14 project is to address critical NTP technology challenges and programmatic issues to establish confidence in the affordability and viability of an NTP system. A key enabling technology for an NCPS system is the fabrication of a stable high temperature nuclear fuel form.

Prototypical samples are being fabricated and tested in flowing hot hydrogen to understand processing and performance relationships.

Temperatures in the range 660 to 12950 F (350 to 1700 °C) and pressures from 10 to 350 mm Hg were investigated. Hydrogen to WF 6 ratios of 10 : 1 to 150 : 1 were utilized. Efforts were directed toward optimizing deposition process parameters to attain control of qualities such as coating thickness, uniformity, density, impurity content, and surface quality. Substrate penetration methods have been investigated {{in the interest of}} completely eliminating the interface between the fueled substrate and cladding. In addition, the effects of process parameters and post-cladding heat treatments on the fuel retention properties of clad composites at 4500 degrees F (2480 degrees C) in hydrogen for 2 hours have been evaluated.

40|$|Studies {{dating back}} to the late 1940 s {{performed}} by a number of different organizations and laboratories have established the major advantages of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) systems, particularly for manned missions. A number of NTP projects have been initiated since this time; none have had any sustained fuel development work that appreciably contributed to fuel fabrication or performance data from this era. As interest in these missions returns and previous space nuclear power researchers begin to retire, fuel fabrication technologies must be revisited, so that established technologies can be transferred to young researchers seamlessly and updated, more advanced processes can be employed to develop successful NTP fuels. CERMET fuels, specifically W-UO 2, are of particular interest to the next generation NTP plans since these fuels have shown significant advantages over other fuel types, such as relatively high burnup, no significant failures under severe transient conditions, capability of accommodating a large fission product inventory during irradiation and compatibility with flowing hot hydrogen. Examples of previous fabrication routes involved with CERMET fuels include hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) and press and sinter, whereas newer technologies, such as spark plasma sintering, combustion synthesis and microsphere fabrication might be well suited to produce high quality, effective fuel elements. These advanced technologies may address common issues with CERMET fuels, such as grain growth, ductile to brittle transition temperature and UO 2 stoichiometry, more effectively than the commonly accepted ‘traditional’ fabrication routes. Bonding of fuel elements, especially if the fabrication process demands production of smaller element segments, must be investigated.

40|$|Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) {{development}} {{efforts in the}} United States have demonstrated the technical viability and performance potential of NTP systems. For example, Project Rover (1955 - 1973) completed 22 high power rocket reactor tests. Peak performances included operating at an average hydrogen exhaust temperature of 2550 K and a peak fuel power density of 5200 MW/m 3 (Pewee test), operating at a thrust of 930 kN (Phoebus- 2 A test), and operating for 62. 7 minutes in a single burn (NRX-A 6 test). Results from Project Rover indicated that an NTP system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio and a specific impulse greater than 900 s would be feasible. Excellent results were also obtained by the former Soviet Union. Although historical programs had promising results, many factors would affect {{the development of a}} 21 st century nuclear thermal rocket (NTR). Test facilities built in the US during Project Rover no longer exist. However, advances in analytical techniques, the ability to utilize or adapt existing facilities and infrastructure, and the ability to develop a limited number of new test facilities may enable affordable development, qualification, and utilization of a Nuclear Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (NCPS). Bead-loaded graphite fuel was utilized throughout the Rover/NERVA program, and coated graphite composite fuel (tested in the Nuclear Furnace) and <b>cermet</b> <b>fuel</b> both show potential for even higher performance than that demonstrated in the Rover/NERVA engine tests [...] NASA's NCPS project was initiated in October, 2011, with the goal of assessing the affordability and viability of an NCPS. FY 2014 activities are focused on fabrication and test (non-nuclear) of both coated graphite composite fuel elements and <b>cermet</b> <b>fuel</b> elements. Additional activities include developing a pre-conceptual design of the NCPS stage and evaluating affordable strategies for NCPS development, qualification, and utilization. NCPS stage designs are focused on supporting human Mars missions. The NCPS is being designed to readily integrate with the Space Launch System (SLS). A wide range of strategies for enabling affordable NCPS development, qualification, and utilization should be considered. These include multiple test and demonstration strategies (both ground and in-space), multiple potential test sites, and multiple engine designs. Two potential NCPS fuels are currently under consideration - coated graphite composite fuel and tungsten <b>cermet</b> <b>fuel.</b> During 2014 a representative, partial length (approximately 16 ") coated graphite composite fuel element with prototypic depleted uranium loading is being fabricated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

At ITU, two <b>CERMET</b> composite <b>fuel</b> types are proposed, a zirconia based compound (Am,Pu,Zr) O 2 -x and a mixed oxide (Am,Pu) O 2 -x, which are mixed with Mo powder that acts as the fuel matrix. The fabrication process is based on particles containing the actinide phase produced by a combination of the sol gel external gelation, GSP, and the infiltration methods followed by compacting and sintering. At CEA, two CERCER composite oxide fuel types are manufactured by an oxalic co-conversion and by powder metallurgy. The resulting microstructure, performed by SEM, shows a good homogeneity and fissile repartition in the magnesia matrix. A cubic centred structure with O/M= 1. 66 and a face-centred cubic lattice with a O/M= 1. 93 are found for (Pu 0, 5 Am 0, 5) Ox-MgO(70 per cent vol) fuel. For the (Pu 0, 2 Am 0, 8) Ox-MgO(65 per cent vol) component a single monoclinic phase structure with O/ M= 1. 64 is measured. JRC. E. 4 -Nuclear fuel...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares {{material}} {{issues for}} <b>cermet</b> and graphite <b>fuel</b> elements. In particular, two issues in NTP fuel element performance are considered here: ductile to brittle transition {{in relation to}} crack propagation, and orificing individual coolant channels in fuel elements. Their relevance to fuel element performance is supported by considering material properties, experimental data, and results from multidisciplinary fluid/thermal/structural simulations. Ductile to brittle transition results in a fuel element region prone to brittle fracture under stress, while outside this region, stresses lead to deformation and resilience under stress. Poor coolant distribution between fuel element channels can increase stresses in certain channels. NERVA fuel element experimental {{results are consistent with}} this interpretation. An understanding of these mechanisms will help interpret fuel element testing results...|$|R
