2500|$|George Ravenscroft (1618–1681) was {{the first}} to produce clear lead crystal {{glassware}} on an industrial scale. The son of a merchant with close ties to Venice, Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, setting the basis from which England overtook Venice and Bohemia as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With the aid of Venetian glassmakers, especially da Costa, and {{under the auspices of the}} Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers of London, Ravenscroft sought to find an alternative to Venetian cristallo. His use of flint as the silica source has led to the term flint glass to describe these crystal glasses, despite his later switch to sand. At first, his glasses tended to <b>crizzle,</b> developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency, which was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt, up to 30%. Crizzling results from the destruction of the glass network by an excess of alkali, and may be caused by excess humidity as well as inherent defects in glass composition.

In 1676, having apparently overcome the crizzling problem, Ravenscroft was granted the use of a raven’s head seal as a guaranty of quality. In 1681, the year of his death, the patent expired and operations quickly developed among several firms, where by 1696 twenty-seven of the eighty-eight glasshouses in England, especially at London and Bristol, were producing flint glass containing 30–35% PbO.|$|E

5000|$|A very {{important}} advance in glass manufacture was {{the technique of}} adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved {{the appearance of the}} glass and made it easier to melt using sea-coal as a furnace fuel. This technique also increased the [...] "working period" [...] of the glass, making it easier to manipulate.

2500|$|The [...] "initial stage" [...] of <b>crizzling</b> {{occurs when}} alkali is {{present on the}} glass, giving the glass a cloudy or hazy appearance. [...] If neglected, crizzling's initial stage may occur within five or 10 years of the glass's manufacturing. Indications of <b>crizzling</b> {{may be seen as}} tiny {{droplets}} in high (above 55%) humidity or as fine crystals in low (below 40%) relative humidity. A feeling of slippery or slimy glass is another possible indication of stage one <b>crizzling.</b> The initial stage is treatable. Washing the glass removes the alkali and will keep the glass looking new.: ...|$|R
2500|$|Atmospheric deterioration, {{commonly}} referred to as <b>crizzling,</b> weeping or glass disease is primarily caused by a chemical imbalance in specific types of glass, though it can occur in almost any glass. [...] This form of deterioration is a basic defect in glass caused by incorrect proportions of ingredients, particularly an excess of alkali in the glass composite. <b>Crizzling</b> occurs in 5 main stages.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "fragmentation stage" [...] of <b>crizzling</b> is {{the final}} stage of {{deterioration}} and occurs when the structural integrity of the glass is no longer present causing the glass to separate into pieces.: ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Full-blown crizzling" [...] {{occurs when}} the fine cracks in the glass during stage two of {{deterioration}} have progressed and are {{visible to the naked}} eye. In some cases, the crazing also gains a more uniform appearance. [...] The deeper cracks are indicative of higher amounts of alkali leaching from the glass composition. <b>Crizzling</b> may not be uniform due to the creation of micro-climates on the glass. <b>Crizzling</b> is far more likely to occur in areas with restricted air-flow.

5000|$|Around 1663, George Ravenscroft {{developed}} flint glass, a colourless and {{translucent glass}} with many desirable working properties. [...] The original recipe {{was subject to}} <b>crizzling.</b> Later batches had the addition of lead oxide (PbO) which combatted this problem and produced a superior glass that was more suitable for to engraving and etching. Lead glass was widely adopted by the Glass seller’s guild when Ravenscroft’s patent expired.|$|R

Ravenscroft announced in 1676 that the [...] "crizzling" [...] problem had been resolved and that the new, improved glass vessels would bear a raven’s head seal to distinguish them from earlier, faulty pieces. A small number (less than twenty) of glass vessels bearing the raven’s head seal exist today, some of which have <b>crizzled</b> and some of which have not.|$|R
50|$|The {{materials}} used in their construction are often a clay body, and some times mixed with sand, shell, chalk, mica, and ground-up fired ceramics. The surface of these ceramic objects are finished with glaze and fired {{in a number of}} ways. Decorations with gold, paint or enamel are applied over the glaze. These overglaze decorations are susceptible to abrasions or chemical damage from cleaning and handling. A ceramic object is also vulnerable to weeping and <b>crizzling</b> from fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature.|$|R
50|$|Glass disease, {{also known}} as sick glass, is a {{degradation}} process encountered in art conservation. Glass disease is caused by an inherent fault in the chemical composition of the original glass formula. Usually, inadequate calcium oxide causes the alkalis in the glass to remain water-soluble at a low level. Exposure {{to higher levels of}} relative humidity during storage or display causes these salts to hydrate and leach out of the glass. Upon a reduction of relative humidity, these hydrated salts can then form a crust on the surface. This process causes a complex disintegration of the glass which can be identified through a variety of symptoms. One such sign is the aforementioned crusty deposits which can form a visible hard alkaline coating on the surface. Another symptom is a distinctive network of fine cracking, also called <b>crizzling,</b> which can reduce the transparency of the glass or even threaten the integrity of the structure.|$|R
