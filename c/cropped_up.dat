In May 1963, he formed a Panel Review Board, bringing together representatives of the many committees that aimed to coordinate work between NASA centers.

5|$|The {{issue of}} piracy <b>cropped</b> <b>up</b> when a news article {{published}} in The Indian Express exposed {{the dark side of}} the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another blemish was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's story had a striking resemblance to his parallel work on the novella.|$|E
5|$|In antiquity, {{symbolism}} involving sheep <b>cropped</b> <b>up</b> in religions in {{the ancient}} Near East, the Mideast, and the Mediterranean area: Çatalhöyük, ancient Egyptian religion, the Cana'anite and Phoenician tradition, Judaism, Greek religion, and others. Religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began {{with some of the}} first known faiths: Skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the Çatalhöyük settlement in 8,000 BCE. In Ancient Egyptian religion, the ram was the symbol of several gods: Khnum, Heryshaf and Amun (in his incarnation as a god of fertility). Other deities occasionally shown with ram features include the goddess Ishtar, the Phoenician god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes. In Madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{highlighted}} what {{he perceived}} as scenes in Red Rackham's Treasure which reflected common themes in The Adventures of Tintin. He {{pointed out that}} in being a stowaway aboard the ship, Calculus {{was one of many}} stowaways in the series, and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also <b>cropped</b> <b>up</b> in The Broken Ear, Tintin in the Congo, and The Castafiore Emerald. He noted Tintin's misreading of the parchments and stated this was {{one of a number of}} calculation mistakes that the character makes in the series. He suggested that a scene in which the shark submarine pushes between Haddock's buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing anal sex, highlighting similar innuendo in The Broken Ear and The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E
5|$|The changes paid off. In 1963, {{the team}} {{finished}} 10–4, and Jim Brown broke the NFL's single-season rushing record with 1,863 yards. Brown was also voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Cleveland, however, finished a game behind the New York Giants {{and did not}} reach the championship game. The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions <b>cropped</b> <b>up</b> within the team. Some black players believed white teammates were getting to play ahead of them because of their race. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Collier met with the team's leaders and told them the racism had to stop. After the season, he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue with those who remained to stamp out the tension.|$|E
5|$|The first {{election}} {{under the}} 1776 constitution {{took place in}} 1781, and the system would not change again until 1838. In the interim, {{a number of problems}} had <b>cropped</b> <b>up</b> in the appointment process, and the 1838 election saw the passage of a number of constitutional amendments that fundamentally changed how Senators were chosen. The electoral college was abolished, terms were lengthened to six years with rotating elections such that a third of the senate would be elected every two years, and a single Senator was chosen by direct election from each county and the City of Baltimore. The Senate no longer acted as the Governor's Council, although they would continue to confirm the Governor's appointments. Constitutional changes altered this new system slightly in 1851, when terms were shortened to four years, and 1864, when Baltimore City was given three Senate districts rather than one, but substantial change to the structure of the Senate did not come again until 1964.|$|E

Movie theaters rapidly <b>cropped</b> <b>up</b> in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry ramped up {{in the second half of}} the century, and with Uzak (2002) and My Father and My Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E
