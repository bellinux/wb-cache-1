2500|$|A {{color film}} {{is made up}} of many {{different}} layers that work together to create the color image. [...] Color negative films provide three main color layers: the blue record, green record, and red record; each made up of two separate layers containing silver halide crystals and dye-couplers.

2500|$|Photographic film is {{made for}} {{specific}} light sources (most commonly daylight film and tungsten film), and, used properly, will create a neutral color print.

If tungsten film is used indoors with incandescent lamps, the yellowish-orange light of the tungsten incandescent lamps will appear as white (3200K) in the photograph. [...] <b>Color</b> <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> is almost always daylight-balanced, since it is assumed that color can be adjusted in printing (with limitations, see above). [...] Color transparency film, being the final artefact in the process, has to be matched to the light source or filters must be used to correct color.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>color</b> <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> {{had many}} shortcomings, {{including}} {{the high cost}} of the film, processing and printing, the mediocre color quality, rapid fading and discoloration of highlights of some types of print that became noticeable after several years.

2500|$|In 1935, Kodachrome was introduced, {{followed}} by Agfacolor in 1936. They were intended primarily for amateur home movies and [...] "slides". These {{were the first}} films of the [...] "integral tripack" [...] type, coated with three layers of differently color-sensitive emulsion, which is usually {{what is meant by}} the words [...] "color film" [...] as commonly used. The few color films still being made in the 2010s are of this type. The first <b>color</b> <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> and corresponding print films were modified versions of these films. They were introduced around 1940 but only came into wide use for commercial motion picture production in the early 1950s. In the US, Eastman Kodak's Eastmancolor was the usual choice, but it was often re-branded with another trade name, such as [...] "WarnerColor", by the studio or the film processor.|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} studies were performed {{as a part}} of the serial study to elucidate structure of Lichtenberg figures and the process of their formation. In the experiments we used the <b>color</b> <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> were used instead of the reversal color hitherto used. The Lichtenberg figures on the usual black and white dry plates under various pressures were investigated by J. Stekolnikof and K. Riaschenzef and others. The <b>color</b> <b>negative</b> was newly used because of its sensitivity (ASA 32 ゜or 50 ゜) superior to the reversal color (ASA 12 ゜) hitherto used with the view of finding important phenomena otherwise overlooked. We not only observed color Lichtenberg figures produced by the impulse of definite wave form and crest voltage under various atmospheric pressures. Observation was made mainly under the reduced pressures and the variation due to pressure change, of the size, form and color of the figures was investigated. The size of the positive and negative figures grew as the pressure was reduced, and the color of streamers showed a tendency to grow thick and bluish violet tint (yellowish orange on <b>color</b> <b>negative</b> <b>films).</b> While in the gathering fan-shaped negative figures we found the same tendency, the rate of their growth due to pressure decrease was more remarkable than the positive, and their red streamers on the periphery (cyan-blue on the <b>color</b> <b>negative)</b> became more remarkable as the pressure was reduced. The red streamers which appeared only very slightly under a normal pressure became very distinct under reduced pressure. Besides, inferring from the multiple layer construction of color film and the color observed on the figures, it might be concluded that positive figures developed on the top layer of the emulsion only, while negative figures had such a structure that the prong of their streamers crept as far as to the bottom emulsion layer. As for the rate of their growth, the negative figures showed superiority to the positive when the pressures was remarkably reduced. Namely, we found a tendency of the ratio to approach from R^+/R^-* 2 under normal pressure to 1 or R^+*R^- as the pressure was reduced. We confirmed the fact that the effects of pressure reduction gave dominant effects on the extension of streamers of both figures. The tendency of J. Stekolnikof and K. Riaschenzef's curves was different from that of the writer's. The study on the color Lichtenberg figures under further decreased pressure was made to trace the relation among the pressures, the creat voltages and the variation of both figures. In these cases, the color of the streamers of both figures was very weak bluish violet, and we could not find any trace of red streamers on the tips of the negative figures. The critical pressure was estimated to be about 7 cm Hg, under 5. 5 kV of the crest voltage supplied. From these facts we might conclude that both Lichtenberg figures were formed in such a case only on the surface of emulsion layer...|$|R
