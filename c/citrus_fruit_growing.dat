40|$|Bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau) is a <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>growing</b> almost {{exclusively}} in the South of Italy. Its essential oil is obtained by cold pressing of the epicarp and, partly, of the mesocarp of the fresh fruit. Although this phytocomplex {{has been used for}} centuries, reputedly effectively, as a traditional medicine, there is very little verified scientific evidence to support this use. This paper reports original data on the systemic effects of the essential oil of bergamot (BEO) on gross behaviour and EEG activity recorded from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the rat. The Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) was used to analyse and quantify the energy in single frequency bands of the EEG spectrum. The results obtained indicate that systemic administration of increasing volumes of BEO produces dose-dependent increases in locomotor and exploratory activity that correlate with a predominant increase in the energy in the faster frequency bands of the EEG spectrum. These data contribute {{to our understanding of the}} neurobiological profile of BE...|$|E
40|$|Revival of {{the olive}} growing sector in Italy, which needs {{to focus on the}} {{development}} of native genetic resources and a reduction in production costs, must address the updating of nursery management. In the near future, this production sector will almost certainly be needed to satisfy demand – in a market which is increasingly globalized and diversified – with various types of plants suited to different environmental and growth conditions. Adopting a nursery management technique which would enable the nursery to meet sudden, high demand for certified plant material, as specified by EU (Dir CEE 92 / 34 e 93 / 48) and national (D. M. 20 / 11 / 2006) regulations, at sustainable costs, would certainly help towards revitalizing the whole olive industry. However, it is first necessary to develop plant production systems which are flexible and reliable, and which do not depend upon the traditional technique of grafting onto seedlings, often of uncertain genetic origin and in a state of unknown health. Improvements in the efficiency of self-rooting techniques (under mist or in vitro conditions) which, on a commercial level, currently only focus on cultivars, will most probably be extended to include clonal rootstocks, which, as occurred in other tree growing sectors (fruit growing, vine-growing, <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>growing)</b> will be chosen according to specific agronomic characteristics. Of fundamental technical important is the development of production lines of plant material grown on clearly-defined artificial substrates which are able to sustain plant growth in the nursery, withstand even long periods of transport, and overcome stress following planting in the field. It is essential these properties are maintained even when plants are grown in small containers; an aspect which helps lower the costs of production and transport but which can also lead to abiotic and biotic stress. In response to the abovementioned stress factors, today, an important opportunity is the adoption of sterile substrates, which are low cost and do not harm the environment, by exploiting natural symbiotic relationships. Mycorrhiza technologies can have a marked effect on tolerance levels to abiotic stress; a problem to which young plants are particularly susceptible when in the nursery and following planting into the field. This manual includes infrastructures and equipment which are essential for a nursery, and management practices a nursery needs to adopt in order to satisfy demand for certified plant material (genetic and health certification); demand which is constantly increasing on the world market.

The suspension containing 1 × 107 cfu/ml of Xcc was irradiated with different absorbed doses of X-irradiation ranging from 50 to 400 Gy.

40|$|Abstract — Main {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity using electrical impedance measurements. Furthermore, the measurements of electrical properties of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were conducted at various levels of pH and frequencies. This is done as a first step in order to evaluate the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity that does not damage it. The electrical parameters have significant response to acidity of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits.</b> The changes of acidity lead to changes in electrical properties of fruits. Resistance per weight, reactance per weight, inductance per weight, and impedance per weight of Garut citrus fuits declined when the pH is increased. While the capacitance per weight of the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> increases as pH increases. The correlations between pH and electrical parameters are estimated by using multiple regressions equation. Their correlation was highly linear at frequency of 1 MHz. Those estimation equations are the primary basis in nondestructive determining of Garut citrus acidity with electrical impedance measurements...|$|R
