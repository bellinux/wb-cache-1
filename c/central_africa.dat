5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of <b>Central</b> <b>Africa</b> in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of <b>Central</b> <b>Africa</b> in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E

5|$|While the subspecific {{status of}} the Asiatic lion (P. l. persica) is {{generally}} accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies; therefore, all sub-Saharan lions have sometimes been considered a single subspecies. However, a recent study revealed that lions from western and <b>central</b> <b>Africa</b> differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, West-Central African lions are {{more closely related to}} North African and Asian lions than to Southern or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and <b>central</b> <b>Africa,</b> and a subsequent recolonisation of these parts from Asia.|$|E
