40|$|We used gametocidal (Gc) {{chromosomes}} 2 C and 3 C[SAT] {{to dissect}} barley 2 H added to common wheat. The Gc chromosome induces chromosomal breakage resulting in chromosomal aberrations in the progeny of the 2 H addition line of common wheat carrying the monosomic Gc chromosome. We conducted {{in situ hybridization}} to select plants carrying structurally rearranged aberrant 2 H chromosomes and characterized them by sequential C-banding and in situ hybridization. We established 66 dissection lines of common wheat carrying single aberrant 2 H chromosomes. The aberrant 2 H chromosomes were of either deletion or translocation or complicated structural change. Their breakpoints were distributed in the short arm (2 HS), centromere (2 HC) and the long arm (2 HL) at a rough 2 HS/ 2 HC/ 2 HL ratio of 2 : 1 : 2. We conducted PCR analysis of the 66 dissection lines using 115 EST markers specific to chromosome 2 H. Based on the PCR result, we constructed a physical or <b>cytological</b> <b>map</b> of chromosome 2 H that were divided into 34 regions separated by the breakpoints of the aberrant 2 H chromosomes.

Best results are obtained when this technique is coupled with DAPI staining and digital recording of fluorescent signals.

We used quantitative deficiency complementation mapping to further resolve the locations of life span QTL within these regions. The Oregon and 2 b strains were each crossed to 47 deficiencies spanning cytological regions 32 F- 44 E and 64 C- 76 B, and quantitative failure of the QTL alleles to complement the deficiencies was assessed. We initially detected a minimum of five and four QTL in the chromosome 2 and 3 regions, respectively, illustrating that multiple linked factors contribute to each QTL detected by recombination mapping. The QTL locations inferred from deficiency mapping did not generally correspond to those of candidate genes affecting oxidative and thermal stress or glucose metabolism.

40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} plays an {{important}} part in metazoan development as well as in disease. The morphology of cells undergoing programmed cell death has been carefully defined and found to be conserved between a variety of species. A number of key regulators of this process were first identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and then found to be conserved in Drosophila and mammals. In addition to the conserved components of the programmed cell death pathway, Drosophila contains three currently novel regulators: reaper, head involution defective (hid), and grim. The C. elegans gene ced- 4 is necessary for the proper execution of programmed cell deaths during development. A mammalian homolog, Apaf- 1, has similar functions. Until recently, a Drosophila homolog for this component of the core cell death pathway had not been identified. We describe the cloning and characterization of a Drosophila ced- 4 /Apaf-l homolog, which we named hac- 1. HAC- 1, like CED- 4 and Apaf- 1 is required for some cell deaths during development, can help activate caspases in vitro, and appears to aid in the activation of procaspases overexpressed in the Drosophila eye. Interestingly, like reaper, hac- 1 transcription is rapidly upregulated in response to UV and X-irradiation. An essential regulator of programmed cell death in Drosophila is diap 1. Diap 1 is part of a conserved family of Inhibitor of Anoptosis proteins (IAPs) that were first described in baculovirus. Loss of diap 1 function results in widespread apoptosis during early embryonic development. In addition to the morphological features of apoptosis, caspases are activated and physiological caspase substrates are cleaved. We show that some of the morphological changes observed {{can be explained by the}} cleavage of two caspase substrates, nuclear Lamin Dffio and Armadillo. In order to identify additional components of the programmed cell death pathway and to further our understanding of how Reaper functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid interactor screen using Reaper as the bait. We isolated ten potential interactors for which we determined the sequence, expression pattern, and <b>cytological</b> <b>map</b> position.

However, a third of the genes of barley are largely inaccessible to conventional breeding programmes as crossovers are localised {{to the ends of the}} chromosomes. This work examines whether crossovers can be shifted to more proximal regions simply by elevating growth temperature.

We show that the length of synaptonemal complexes in male meiocytes increases in response to temperature. The results demonstrate that the distribution of crossover events are malleable and can be shifted to proximal regions by altering the growth temperature.

40|$|Background: Hybridogenesis (hemiclonal inheritance) {{is a kind}} of clonal {{reproduction}} {{in which}} hybrids between parental species are reproduced by crossing with one of the parental species. European water frogs (Pelophylax esculentus complex) represent an appropriate model for studying interspecies hybridization, processes of hemiclonal inheritance and polyploidization. P. esculentus complex consists of two parental species, P. ridibundus (the lake frog) and P. lessonae (the pool frog), and their hybridogenetic hybrid - P. esculentus (the edible frog). Parental and hybrid frogs can reproduce syntopically and form hemiclonal population systems. For studying mechanisms underlying the maintenance of water frog population systems it is required to characterize the karyotypes transmitted in gametes of parental and different hybrid animals of both sexes. Results: In order to obtain an instrument for characterization of oocyte karyotypes in hybrid female frogs, we constructed <b>cytological</b> <b>maps</b> of lampbrush chromosomes from oocytes of both parental species originating in Eastern Ukraine. We further identified certain molecular components of chromosomal marker structures and mapped coilin-rich spheres and granules, chromosome associated nucleoli and special loops accumulating splicing factors. We recorded the dissimilarities between P. ridibundus and P. lessonae lampbrush chromosomes in the length of orthologous chromosomes, number and location of marker structures and interstitial (TTAGGG) (n) -repeat sites as well as activity of nucleolus organizer.

Moreover, an integrated molecular cytogenetic map of cucumber chromosomes 2 was constructed by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) mapping of 11 fosmid clones together with the cucumber centromere-specific Type III sequence on meiotic pachytene chromosomes. The cytogenetic map was fully integrated with genetic linkage map since each fosmid clone was anchored by a genetically mapped simple sequence repeat marker (SSR). The relationship between the genetic and physical distances along chromosome was analyzed. Conclusions Recombination was not evenly distributed along the physical length of chromosome 2.

40|$|Genetic linkage maps {{reveal the}} order of markers based on the {{frequency}} of recombination between markers during meiosis. Because the rate of recombination varies along chromosomes, it {{has been difficult to}} relate linkage maps to chromosome structure. Here we use <b>cytological</b> <b>maps</b> of crossing over based on recombination nodules (RNs) to predict the physical position of genetic markers on each of the 10 chromosomes of maize. This is possible because (1). all 10 maize chromosomes can be individually identified from spreads of synaptonemal complexes, (2). each RN corresponds to one crossover, and (3). the frequency of RNs on defined chromosomal segments can be converted to centimorgan values. We tested our predictions for chromosome 9 using seven genetically mapped, single-copy markers that were independently mapped on pachytene chromosomes using in situ hybridization. The correlation between predicted and observed locations was very strong (r(2) = 0. 996), indicating a virtual 1 : 1 correspondence. Thus, this new, high-resolution, cytogenetic map enables one to predict the chromosomal location of any genetically mapped marker in maize {{with a high degree of}} accuracy.

The abundance and diversity of species within the genus Lilium offers numerous and rewarding possibilities to lily breeders. Species within the same section can be crossed by conventional hybridization and {{this has led to}} different hybrid groups of great commercial importance such as Longiflorum, Asiatic and Oriental lilies. On the other hand, the divergence of species between various taxonomic sections causes considerable difficulties for intersectional crosses. Such difficulties include crossing incompatibility barriers, embryo abortion, sterility and reduced fertility in intersectional hybrids.

Multi-BAC probe cocktails were constructed for each chromosome from the landed BACs, which were also preevaluated for FISH signal quality, relative position, and collective chromosome coverage. Comparison to the corresponding linkage map revealed full concordance of locus order between cytological and prior segregation analyses. The pericentromeric heterochromatin constituted a large quasi-uniform block in each bivalent and was especially large in the bivalent corresponding to LG- 08. Centromere positions in LG- 02 and LG- 08 were progressively delimited using FISH to identify landed BACs for which the FISH signals visibly flanked the centromere. Alignment of linkage and <b>cytological</b> <b>maps</b> revealed that pericentromeric heterochromatin of these sorghum chromosomes is largely devoid of recombination, which is mostly relegated to the more distal regions, which are largely euchromatic.

As a prelude to positional cloning of the fertility restorer, Rf 1, FISH of BAC clones flanking the Rf 1 locus was used to delimit the chromosomal position of the gene. FISH of BACs that contain the most proximal linkage markers enabled localization of Rf 1 to a ∼ 0. 4 -Mbp euchromatic region of LG- 08.

Mostly the BC progenies of LA hybrids consisted of both triploid (2 n = 3 x = 36) and diploid (2 n = 2 x = 24) with some aneuploid genotypes {{and those of}} OA hybrids consisted of triploid (2 n = 3 x = 36) and some aneuploid genotypes. In all cases, {{it was possible to}} identify the homoeologous recombinant chromosomes as well as accurately count the number of crossover points, which are called ¿recombination sites¿. Recombination sites were estimated in the BC progeny of 71 LA and 41 OA genotypes. In the case of BC progenies of LA hybrids, 248 recombination sites were cytologically localized on 12 different chromosomes of each genome (i. e., L and A). Similarly, 116 recombinant sites were localized on the 12 chromosomes each from the BC progenies of OA hybrids (O and A genomes). <b>Cytological</b> <b>maps</b> were constructed {{on the basis of the}} percentages of distances (micrometres) of the recombination sites from the centromeres. Since an Asiatic parent was involved in both hybrids, viz. LA and OA, two maps were constructed for the A genome that were indicated as Asiatic (L) and Asiatic (O). The other two maps were Longiflorum (A) and Oriental (A). Remarkably, the recombination sites were highly unevenly distributed among the different chromosomes of all four maps. Because the recombination sites can be unequivocally identified through GISH, they serve as reliable landmarks and pave the way for assigning molecular markers or desirable genes to chromosomes of Lilium and also monitor introgression of alien segment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Tephritidae {{family of}} insects {{includes}} {{the most important}} agricultural pests of fruits and vegetables, belonging mainly to four genera (Bactrocera, Ceratitis, Anastrepha and Rhagoletis). The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, is the major pest of the olive fruit. Currently, its control is based on chemical insecticides. Environmentally friendlier methods have been attempted in the past (Sterile Insect Technique), albeit with limited success. This was mainly attributed {{to the lack of}} knowledge on the insect's behaviour, ecology and genetic structure of natural populations. The development of molecular markers could facilitate the access in the genome and contribute to the solution of the aforementioned problems. We chose to focus on microsatellite markers due to their abundance in the genome, high degree of polymorphism and easiness of isolation. Results Fifty-eight microsatellite-containing clones were isolated from the olive fly, Bactrocera oleae, bearing a total of sixty-two discrete microsatellite motifs. Forty-two primer pairs were designed on the unique sequences flanking the microsatellite motif and thirty-one of them amplified a PCR product of the expected size. The level of polymorphism was evaluated against wild and laboratory flies and the majority of the markers (93. 5 %) proved highly polymorphic. Thirteen of them presented a unique position on the olive fly polytene chromosomes by in situ hybridization, which can serve as anchors to correlate future genetic and <b>cytological</b> <b>maps</b> of the species, as well as entry points to the genome. Cross-species amplification of these markers to eleven Tephritidae species and sequencing of thirty-one of the amplified products revealed a varying degree of conservation that declines outside the Bactrocera genus. Conclusion Microsatellite markers are very powerful tools for genetic and population analyses, particularly in species deprived of any other means of genetic analysis. The presented set of microsatellite markers possesses all features that would render them useful in such analyses. This could also prove helpful for species where SIT is a desired outcome, since the development of effective SIT can be aided by detailed knowledge at the genetic and molecular level. Furthermore, their presented efficacy in several other species of the Tephritidae family not only makes them useful for their analysis but also provides tools for phylogenetic comparisons among them. </p...|$|R

Major incongruences were found between phylogenetic relationships and morphological classification of the genus. Morphological and <b>cytological</b> traits were <b>mapped</b> onto the phylogeny. The most parsimonious reconstruction suggested an ancestral spiny state and a recurrent transition from spiny to spineless state.

The model assumes serial occurrence of chiasmata, visualized as a renewal process along the paired (or pairing) chromosomes. This process {{is described as}} an underlying Poisson {{process in which the}} 1 st, n + 1 th, 2 n + 1 th, etc., events are to be interpreted as realized chiasmata. Chromatid interference is described in terms of the probabilities that two successive chiasmata involve two, three or four different chromatids. Several characteristics of this model, e. g., the <b>cytological</b> and genetic <b>mapping</b> function and the density of chiasmata along the chromosomes, are discussed. Some aspects of other interference models are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Lilies (Lilium L.) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} ornamental bulbous crops for cut flower industry grown extensively in The Netherlands for last few decades. The genus Lilium consists of seven different sections with about 80 species. The species within genus Lilium (2 n = 2 x = 24) comprise a range of desirable and complementary characters. Besides being an important horticultural crop, lily (Lilium) also serves as an interesting model plant for molecular cytogenetic research and introgression breeding for several reasons like, i). Lily is a model crop for interspecific hybridization and it includes plants of different taxonomic species each of which possess valuable horticultural traits that need to be combined in the new cultivars. ii) Through careful selection n and 2 n gametes can be obtained in interspecific hybrids. iii) The genomes of different species are so well differentiated genetically that the parental chromosomes can be clearly identified in the F 1 hybrids as well as in the progenies through DNA in situ hybridization techniques. iv) The chromosomes are large enough and the number and position of homoeologous recombination sites can be clearly detected. v) The large and easily identified chromosomes in different lily species could be a potential source for the <b>cytological</b> <b>mapping</b> of the Lilium genomes. Taking advantage of these favourable attributes of lily, a molecular cytogenetic investigation was conducted to evaluate the amount of recombination and introgression of characters between Longiflorum - Asiatic (LA) and Oriental - Asiatic (OA) hybrids through the use of n and 2 n gametes. For this purpose different F 1 Longiflorum × Asiatic (LA) and Oriental × Asiatic (OA) hybrids were backcrossed with different Asiatic cultivars. Ovule and embryo rescue techniques were employed to get backcross (BC) progenies. Most of the F 1 LA appeared to be sterile but some hybrids were able to produce only 2 n gametes in considerable frequencies. However, in rare occasions it was also found that normal meiosis took place in few of the LA hybrids which resulted into the formation of normal n gametes. Ploidy level and intergenomic recombination was studied in LA interspecific hybrids in order to assess the possibility of functional n gametes and their potential use in introgression at diploid level in lily. A total of 104 BC 1 LA interspecific lily hybrids were obtained, 27 diploids (2 n = 2 x = 24), 73 triploids (2 n = 2 x = 36) and 4 aneuploids (2 x – 1, 2 x + 2 or 2 x + 3). Similarly, triploid BC 1 (LAA) plants were backcrossed to diploid Asiatic parents. As a result 14 diploid BC 2 progenies were produced. The intergenomic recombination and amount of introgression of respective genome (L and A) was assessed in these diploid genotypes through GISH (Genomic in situ Hybridization). Extensive intergenomic recombination was found among the chromosomes in LA hybrids. A large of amount of L- genome was transmitted from F 1 LA hybrids to their subsequent BC 1 progenies. However, very few segments of L- genome were introgressed from the BC 1 diploid and triploid (LAA) plants to the BC 2 progenies (Chapter 2). GISH identifies a considerable amount of recombination events amongst different interspecific lily hybrids (LA and OA) obtained from functional 2 n gametes. Based on recombination sites on different chromosomes identified by GISH, <b>cytological</b> <b>maps</b> of three genomes of Lilium were constructed. For this purpose, BC progenies of two diploid interspecific hybrids of lily, viz., Longiflorum × Asiatic (LA) and Oriental × Asiatic (OA) were used. The BC progenies of LA hybrids consisted of both triploid (2 n = 3 x = 36) and diploid (2 n = 2 x = 24) with some aneuploid genotypes and those of OA hybrids mostly consisted of triploid (2 n = 3 x = 36) and some aneuploid genotypes. In LA hybrids 248 recombination sites were cytologically localized on 12 different chromosomes of each genomes (i. e., L and A). Similarly, 116 recombinant sites were marked on 12 chromosomes each from the BC progenies of OA hybrids (O and A genomes). The distances of the recombination sites from the centromeres are measured (in micrometres). Based on these recombination sites four <b>cytological</b> <b>maps</b> were constructed. Since an Asiatic parent was involved in both hybrids, viz., LA and OA, two maps were constructed for A genome which were indicated as Asiatic (L) and Asiatic (O) and one each for Longiflorum (A) and Oriental (A) genomes (Chapter 3). With a view to generate genetic variation via homoeologous recombination in BC progenies of LA and OA hybrids the most logical approach was the use of 2 n gametes. 63 BC 1 LA (LA × AA or AA × LA) and 53 OA (AA × OA) progeny plants were obtained after unilateral sexual polyploidization. 16 genotypes from F 2 LA populations were obtained after bilateral sexual polyploidization through sib-mating of F 1 LA hybrids. GISH was employed for the identification of the parental genomes, mode of origin of these progenies and measurement of the introgression in different interspecific lily hybrids. Most of the BC 1 progeny plants (LA and OA) had originated through 2 n gametes by First Division Restitution (FDR) mechanism. However, there were 12 genotypes in LA hybrids and four genotypes in OA hybrids that originated through 2 n gametes formation as the result of Indeterminate Meiotic Restitution (IMR). A higher amount of recombination was found in LA hybrids as compared to OA hybrids. Intergenomic recombination was also determined in the sib-mated F 2 LA population. In this case both parents had contributed gametes with the somatic number of chromosomes (i. e., 2 n- 2 n) thus confirming the event of bilateral sexual polyploidization in interspecific LA hybrids. Based on these results, the relevance of interspecific lily hybrids obtained from uni- and bilateral sexual polyploidization leading to allotriploid and allotetraploid formation in interspecific lily hybrids is discussed in the context of introgression and mapping (Chapter 4). Molecular markers are an important tool for the construction of genetic linkage maps, as the first step in the genetic dissection of the required traits leading to crop improvement followed by the marker assisted breeding in different plants. Lilium has one of the largest genome in plant kingdom and genetic mapping in lilies is constrained by its large genome. DArT (Diversity Array Technology), a molecular marker technique can detect and type DNA variation at several hundred genomic loci in parallel without relying on genome sequence information. The DArT technique was developed for Longiflorum × Asiatic (LA) lily hybrids to enable an efficient and effective genetic mapping with the production of a large numbers of markers in microarrays-based assay. The restriction enzyme PstI + TaqI combination generated the largest frequency of polymorphic genomic representations for a genotyping array. Genomic representations from 88 F 1 LA plants were used to assemble a DArT genotyping microarray. A total of 687 DArT markers were developed and 382 polymorphic markers were mapped on 14 main linkage groups which is two more then the haploid chromosome number (i. e. n = 12). The resulting linkage map with 382 DArT markers spanned 1329 cM (3. 5 cM/marker on average). The results highlighted the potential of DArT as a genetic technique for genome profiling in the context of molecular breeding and genomics, especially in crops with large genome sizes where other techniques proved to be less useful (Chapter 5). The results of the present investigation are of practical implication. These results show the advantages of the n gametes and their subsequent progenies which opened a new approach of lily breeding ‘the analytic breeding’ in the allopolyploids. It also shows the possibility of using certain triploid hybrids for further breeding. A comparison has been made between different types of interspecific crosses, the amount of intergenomic recombination and introgressions of chromosomal segments obtained after unilateral sexual polyploidization. Furthermore, bilateral sexually polyploidization via sib-mated F 1 hybrids producing 2 n gametes has been proven. The use of allotetraploids obtained from bilateral sexual polyploidization could be a novel approach in the breeding of LA-hybrids. These allotetraploid with recombinant chromosomal segment may be a potential source to generate genetic variation in subsequent progenies. The molecular cytogenetic GISH and FISH techniques proved to be a powerful tool useful for the construction of cytogenetic maps in interspecific crosses in crops with large genomes sizes like lily. These techniques are also used for the identification and integration of genetic maps with chromosome maps. FISH also helps to monitor the introgressed chromosome segment or marker of interest in the subsequent progenies. Application of the DArT technique proved to be an effective method to construct genetic linkage maps especially crops (like Lilium) with large genome sizes where other techniques might be less useful...|$|R
40|$|In most eukaryotes, the {{prospective}} chromosomal positions of meiotic crossovers are marked during meiotic prophase by protein complexes called late recombination nodules (LNs). In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a <b>cytological</b> recombination <b>map</b> has been constructed based on LN positions. We {{demonstrate that the}} mismatch repair protein MLH 1 occurs in LNs. We determined the positions of MLH 1 foci along the 12 tomato chromosome pairs (bivalents) during meiotic prophase and compared the map of MLH 1 focus positions with that of LN positions. On all 12 bivalents, the number of MLH 1 foci was ∼ 70 % {{of the number of}} LNs. Bivalents with zero MLH 1 foci were rare, which argues against random failure of detecting MLH 1 in the LNs. We inferred that {{there are two types of}} LNs, MLH 1 -positive and MLH 1 -negative LNs, and that each bivalent gets an obligate MLH 1 -positive LN. The two LN types are differently distributed along the bivalents. Furthermore, cytological interference among MLH 1 foci was much stronger than interference among LNs, implying that MLH 1 marks the positions of a subset of strongly interfering crossovers. Based on the distances between MLH 1 foci or LNs, we propose that MLH 1 -positive and MLH 1 -negative LNs stem from the same population of weakly interfering precursors...|$|R
40|$|Linkage maps {{constructed}} from genetic analysis of gene order and crossover frequency provide few {{clues to the}} basis of genomewide distribution of meiotic recombination, such as chromosome structure, that influences meiotic recombination. To bridge this gap, we have generated the first <b>cytological</b> recombination <b>map</b> that identifies individual autosomes in the male mouse. We prepared meiotic chromosome (synaptonemal complex [SC]) spreads from 110 mouse spermatocytes, identified each autosome by multicolor {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} of chromosome-specific DNA libraries, and mapped > 2, 000 sites of recombination along individual autosomes, using immunolocalization of MLH 1, a mismatch repair protein that marks crossover sites. We show that SC length is strongly correlated with crossover frequency and distribution. Although the length of most SCs corresponds to that predicted from their mitotic chromosome length rank, several SCs are longer or shorter than expected, with corresponding increases and decreases in MLH 1 frequency. Although all bivalents share certain general recombination features, such as few crossovers near the centromeres and a high rate of distal recombination, individual bivalents have unique patterns of crossover distribution along their length. In addition to SC length, other, as-yet-unidentified, factors influence crossover distribution leading to hot regions on individual chromosomes, with recombination frequencies as much as six times higher than average, as well as cold spots with no recombination. By reprobing the SC spreads with genetically mapped BACs, we demonstrate a robust strategy for integrating genetic linkage and physical contig maps with mitotic and meiotic chromosome structure...|$|R
