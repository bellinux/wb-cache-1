50|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{reveals that}} the reaction of platinum with aqua regia is considerably more complex. The initial reactions produce a mixture of <b>chloroplatinous</b> <b>acid</b> (H2PtCl4) and nitrosoplatinic chloride ((NO)2PtCl4). The nitrosoplatinic chloride is a solid product. If full dissolution of the platinum is desired, repeated extractions of the residual solids with concentrated hydrochloric acid must be performed.|$|E
