40|$|Background: The Swedish {{resident}} <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> {{limit is}} regulated by Swedish and European legal frameworks. With a maximum average of 40 working hours per week, the Swedish <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> regulation {{is one of}} the most restrictive in the world. At the same time, the effects of resident <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> limits have been neither debated nor researched in the Swedish context. As a result, little is known about the Swedish conceptual framework for resident <b>duty</b> <b>hours,</b> their restriction, or their outcomes: we call this “the Swedish <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> enigma. ” This situation poses a further question: How do Swedish residents themselves construct a conceptual framework for <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions? Methods: A case study was conducted at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm – an urban, research-intensive hospital setting. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 34 residents currently in training in 6 specialties. The empirical data analysis relied on theoretical propositions and was conducted thematically using a pattern-matching technique. The interview guide was based on four main topics: the perceived effect of <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions on (1) patient care, (2) resident education, (3) resident well-being, and (4) research. Results: The residents did not perceive the volume of <b>duty</b> <b>hours</b> to be the main determinant of success or failure in the four contextual domains of patient care, resident education, resident well-being, and research.

The literature provides an inconsistent picture of the impact of <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions on faculty. While some studies have reported a significant increase in faculty workload, others suggest that the impact of <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions has been minimal. Some papers suggest that <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions may fundamentally change the nature of resident–teacher interactions and, as a result, will necessitate significant changes to the way education is delivered. Overall, the majority of issues of concern relate to one of the following: volume and composition of work, impact on faculty career choice, evolving perceptions of residents as learners, and the need to find an appropriate balance between learning and the quality and quantity of patient care. In describing these themes we identify some potential solutions and future directions for reconciling <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions with faculty perceptions, anxieties, and desired outcomes...|$|R

40|$|In 2003, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education defined for {{the first}} time an upper limit on the number of hours that {{residents}} can work. This initial reduction in work hours was made with the goal of improving patient safety, resident education, and resident well-being. Now, 8 years later, further <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions are slated to take effect July 1, 2011. These new reductions are largely a response to growing public concern about the effects of sleep deprivation on residents. Educators and residents alike have mixed opinions about the effects of prior and future <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions on resident education. 3 The potential effects of resident <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions on medical student education have received less attention. Changes to graduate medical education have the potential to affect medical students’ experiences and learning during their clerkships. With further <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions imminent, now is the ideal time to learn from past <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions and predict the likely effects of further resident <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions on medical students. A forward-looking approach to the new <b>duty</b> <b>hours</b> regulations allows medical educators to anticipate, and potentially prevent, negative effects while providing an opportunity to capitalize on potential benefits. This article provides an overview of the current knowledge of the effects of <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions on medical student education to guide educators in planning for consequences of further resident <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions. A literature review was conducted using the MeSH subheadings “internship and residency” and “students, medical. ” These reviews were then combined with separate key word searches using the terms “duty hours” and “work hours. ” For articles deemed relevant to this topic, a related article search was conducted in PubMed and included articles’ references were reviewed for relevance. The authors of this article include clerkship directors and medical educators, and many have published previously on this topic. This article was reviewed and endorsed by the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine Council in January 2011. A narrative review of the literature demonstrates that most of the concerns regarding resident <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions and medical student education address 4 key areas. These areas include teaching, discontinuity, team structure, and educational climate. Teaching concerns relate to residents’ role as educator and rounds {{and the role of the}} attending. Discontinuity concerns relate to shift work and handoffs. For each area, we have summarized the current literature and interpreted the effects of these changes on medical student education.

This paper examines, and assesses the impact of, organizational interventions that were a direct response to these <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> reforms. Methods: The academic literature was searched through the SCOPUS database using the search terms “resident <b>duty</b> <b>hours</b> ” and “European Working Time Directive, ” together with terms related to organizational factors. The search was limited to English-language literature published between January 2003 and January 2012. Studies were included if they reported an organizational intervention and measured an organizational outcome. Results: Twenty-five articles were included from the United States (n = 18), the United Kingdom (n = 5), Hong Kong (n = 1), and Australia (n = 1). They all described single-site projects; the majority used post-intervention surveys (n = 15) and audit techniques (n = 4). The studies assessed organizational measures, including relationships among staff, work satisfaction, continuity of care, workflow, compliance, workload, and cost. Interventions included using new technologies to improve handovers and communications, changing staff mixes, and introducing new shift structures, all of which had varying effects on the organizational measures listed previously.

After several mandated changes in <b>duty</b> <b>hours,</b> {{it is important to}} understand how residents spend their time before proposing and implementing future changes. Time-motion methodology may provide reliable information on what residents do while on duty. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to review all available literature pertaining to time-motion studies of internal medicine residents while on a medicine service and to understand how much of their time is apportioned to various categories of tasks, and also to determine the effects of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) -mandated <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> changes on resident workflow in North America. Methods: Electronic bibliographic databases were searched for articles in English between 1941 and April 2013 reporting time-motion studies of internal medicine residents rotating through a general medicine service. Results: Eight articles were included. Residents spent 41. 8 % of time in patient care activities, 18. 1 % communicating, 13. 8 % in educational activities, 19. 7 % in personal/other, and 6. 6 % in transit. North American data showed the following changes after the implementation of the ACGME 2003 <b>duty</b> <b>hours</b> standard: patient care activities from 41. 8 % to 40. 8 %, communication activities from 19. 0 % to 22. 3 %, educational activities from 17. 7 % to 11. 6 %, and personal/other activities from 21. 5 % to 17. 1 %. Conclusion: There was a paucity of time-motion data. There was great variability in the operational definitions of task categories reported in the studies. Implementation of the ACGME <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> standards did not have a significant effect on the percentage of time spent in particular tasks. There are conflicting reports on how <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> changes have affected patient safety. A low proportion of time spent in educational activities deserves further study and may point to a review of the educational models used.

To better inform resident <b>duty</b> <b>hour</b> policy in Canada, we set out to prepare a set of recommendations that would draw upon evidence reported in the literature and reflect the experiences of resident members of the Canadian Association of Internes and Residents (CAIR). A survey was prepared and distributed electronically to all resident members of CAIR. A total of 1796 eligible residents participated in the survey. Of those who responded, 38 % (601) reported that they felt they could safely provide care for up to 16 continuous hours, and 20 % (315) said that 12 continuous hours was the maximum period during which they could safely provide care (n = 1592).
