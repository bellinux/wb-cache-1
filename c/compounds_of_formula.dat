50|$|Development of {{selective}} ATR agonists and antagonists aided {{the discovery of}} ATRs' functional roles within the nervous system. 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo4,5-pyridine derivatives were the first compounds described to have antagonizing properties at the AT2 receptors. Inventors at Warner-Lambert Company LLC substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline with various functional groups to create numerous <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>formula</b> I that had improved affinity for ATR. EMA400, the racemate drug to EMA401, was originally Compound 6, one of the 48 <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>formula</b> I. Compound 6 had higher binding affinity for ATR, {{compared to the other}} 48 compounds, with an IC value of 2.8 nM in a rabbit uterus binding assay. It was also inactive in the ATR binding assay at concentrations of 10-5 M, suggesting high selectivity for ATR. Example 47, the S-enantiomer of Compound 6 and later named EMA401, was at the time an unanalyzed compound of formula I. Compound 6, under the name PD-126,055, and five other ATR antagonists (PD-123,319, L-159,686, PD-121,981, L-161,638 and L-163,579) were reported to have previously unknown analgesic properties by investigators from the University of Queensland. Greater understanding of the pathobiology of neuropathic pain had been and still is of high demand, as is better neuropathic pain relief medication. By 2020, the neuropathic pain treatment market is projected to reach $3.6 billion USD. The report on those six drugs was the first to clearly elucidate the role of angiotensin II type 2 receptors in neuropathic pain and implicated ATR antagonists as potential drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
