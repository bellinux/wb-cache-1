60|$|I pricked up my ears at this--for {{when one}} has nothing but some <b>clasp</b> <b>knives,</b> spears {{are not to}} be despised--and ordered him to lead on. In another minute we were walking uphill through the awful wood where the gloom at this hour of {{approaching}} night was that of an English fog.|$|E

60|$|Calling each by name, Minnie {{gave the}} {{presents}} out, accompanying each presentation with some happy remark that {{added to the}} glee. There were trade watches, <b>clasp</b> <b>knives,</b> amazing assortments of fish-hooks in packages, plug tobacco, matches, and gorgeous strips of cotton for loincloths all around. That Boyd Duncan was liked by them was evidenced by the roars of laughter with which they greeted his slightest joking allusion.|$|E
60|$|The thoughtfulness of Mynheer von Duyk's {{housekeeper}} {{had placed}} two candles {{in the basket}} together with two drinking glasses; and the former were soon lighted, and by {{the aid of a}} drop or two of their own grease, fixed upright on the rough table. Then a splendid pie was produced; the neck was knocked off a bottle; the lads drew out their <b>clasp</b> <b>knives,</b> and set to work.|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked back}} at the misshapen, starved, sick, {{stumbling}} hulks of men who trod the dreary round of the windlass. Mr. Pike was right. These were not the brisk, devilish, able-bodied men who manned the ships of the old clipper-ship days; who fought their officers, who had the points of their sheath-knives broken off, who killed and were killed, but who did their work as men. These men, these shambling carcasses at the windlass--I looked, and looked, and vainly I strove to conjure the vision of them swinging aloft in rack and storm, [...] "clearing the raffle," [...] as Kipling puts it, [...] "with their <b>clasp</b> <b>knives</b> in their teeth." [...] Why didn't they sing a chanty as they hove the anchor up? In the old days, as I had read, the anchor always came up to the rollicking sailor songs of sea-chested men.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A {{wide range}} of foreign bodies has been {{retrieved}} from the gut and reported. The presentation {{may be in the}} form of complications like intestinal obstruction, perforation and formation of abscesses etc but there is no case report of a half open <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> being retrieved from the ileum, the patient having thrived, in spite of its presence for a period of eight months. Case presentation A 30 -year-old administrative clerk had undergone emergency abdominal surgery eight months previously under mysterious circumstances at a remote district hospital and had recovered completely. Later the blade of a knife was accidentally detected when an X ray of the abdomen was done during a routine follow-up visit to his family physician. Surgery revealed a <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> in the ileum, which was retrieved. The presence of an entero-enteric fistula short circuiting the loop was the secret of his earlier survival. Conclusions To the best of our information this is the first case-report of a <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> in the gut and of the patient thriving in spite of its presence. We report here the dramatic sequence of events. </p...|$|R

50|$|In Australia, {{soldiers}} belong foremost to a Corps which {{defines a}} common function or employment across the army. The Australian Army has {{a system of}} coloured lanyards, which each identify a soldier {{as part of a}} specific Corps (or sometimes individual battalion). This lanyard is a woven piece of cord which is worn on ceremonial uniforms and dates back to the issue of <b>clasp</b> <b>knives</b> in the early 20th century which were secured to the uniform by a length of cord.|$|E
50|$|I do {{not think}} we left behind us £200 worth of stuff worth having. I got away all my guns and {{ammunition}} and we even destroyed the sandbags which {{we had to leave}} in the parapets by ripping them with bayonets or <b>clasp</b> <b>knives</b> to make them useless. The withdrawal was apparently a complete surprise for the Turks, for nothing happened on either night beyond the usual sniping and firing. In a way I could not help feeling a little sorry that they did not find us out, for my division had two strongly prepared lines, each with an excellent field of fire to fall back upon, and if they had only come on we should have given them a real good dressing.|$|E
60|$|Through the {{drifting}} clouds {{there was}} just enough light {{to enable them to}} perceive the dark forms of the melons lying side by side upon their vines. The agent took out his big <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> and recklessly slashed one of them open.|$|R

5000|$|... 9. The {{instrument}} {{must have}} been a strong knife at least six inches long, very sharp, pointed at the top and about an inch in width. It may have been a <b>clasp</b> <b>knife,</b> a butcher's knife or a surgeon's knife. I think it was no doubt a straight knife.|$|R
40|$|CLASP OR POCKET KNIVES: Small folding knives, {{better known}} as pocket knives or <b>clasp</b> <b>knives,</b> became an {{important}} trade item in the mid and late Colonial period.

60|$|But I had not a shot left, nor did {{either of}} us have a <b>clasp</b> <b>knife.</b> We stood there while the doe gasped and quivered. The {{peculiar}} sound, probably made by the intake of air through the laceration of the throat, {{on the spur of the}} moment seemed pitifully human.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To the {{bottomless}} pit {{with your}} plans!' replied his accomplice; 'you have planned {{me out of}} ship, cargo, and life; and I dreamt this moment that Meg Merrilies dragged you here by the hair and gave me the long <b>clasped</b> <b>knife</b> she used to wear; you don't know what she said. Sturmwetter! it will be your wisdom not to tempt me!' ...|$|R
60|$|He dragg'd his {{guardian}} to {{the earth}} and fell crushingly upon him, choking the shriek the poor victim but just began to utter. Then, with monstrous imprecations, he twisted a tight knot around the gasping creature's neck, drew a <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> from his pocket, and touching the spring, the long sharp blade, too eager for its bloody work, flew open.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986 The {{site of the}} Demun's {{trading post}} was {{discovered}} and excavated by the University of Wisconsin. It was located on a bluff above the Sugar river near Monroe, Wisconsin. Fire Steels, ceramics, a <b>clasp</b> <b>knife,</b> and parts of a trap were found there. Charred logs found at {{the perimeter of the}} cabin indicate it was probably burned in The Black Hawk War (April 1832.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Winter {{approached}} {{the entrance to}} the White House, which civilians were allowed to do at the time.

A few minutes later he repeated his attempt, though by this time the White House police chief and several officers were ready; they detained and searched him. An [...] "ugly looking" [...] <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> was found inside one of his pockets.|$|R
50|$|This reflex is {{observed}} {{in patients with}} upper motor neuron lesions. It is frequently attributed to {{the action of the}} golgi tendon organ, likely because of early studies showing that tendon organs are activated by strong muscle stretch and inhibit motoroneurons of the stretched muscle. It was thought that this was a protective reflex, preventing application of so much force that muscles become damaged. More recent work strongly suggests that tendon organs are not involved in the <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> reflex, but that other sensory receptors in muscles are responsible.|$|R
60|$|And down {{he leaps}} from {{his horse and}} into the water after me, and {{together}} we landed a three-pound bass, thereby drenching his snuff-coloured suit. When the big fish lay shining in the basket, the dominie smiled grimly at William and me as we stood sheepishly by, and without a word he drew his <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> and cut a stout switch from the willow near, and then and there he gave us such a thrashing as we remembered for many a day after. And we both had another when we reached home.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not forget}} to arm himself quite {{to the teeth}} with his pop-gun, his bow, and his air-pistol. He had a burnt cork in his pocket to blacken his moustache, and a red cock's feather to put in his cap to make himself look fierce. He had besides in his trouser pocket a <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> with a bone handle, {{to cut off the}} ears of the wolves as soon as he had killed them, for {{he thought it would be}} cruel to do that while they were still living.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I saw that," [...] {{continued}} Parkhurst, {{more rapidly}} and coherently, [...] "I {{saw that there}} was a crack above the hole where the water came through--as if it had been the old channel of the spring. I widened it a little with my <b>clasp</b> <b>knife,</b> and then--in a little pouch or pocket of decomposed quartz--I found that! Not only that, boys," [...] he continued, rising, with a shout, [...] "but the whole slope above the spring is a mass of seepage underneath, as if you'd played a hydraulic hose on it, and it's ready to tumble and is just rotten with quartz!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Randolph, {{pushing a}} cigar toward him. But the captain put it aside, drew {{from his pocket}} a short black clay pipe, stuffed it with black [...] "Cavendish plug," [...] which he had first chipped off {{in the palm of}} his hand with a large <b>clasp</b> <b>knife,</b> lighted it, and took a few meditative whiffs. Then, glancing at Randolph's papers, he said, [...] "I'm not keeping you from your work, lad?" [...] and {{receiving}} a reply in the negative, puffed at his pipe and once more settled himself comfortably in his chair, with his dark, bearded profile toward Randolph.|$|R
500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 14, 1842, Colt and Henshaw were married in the prison at a small {{ceremony}} conducted by Rev Henry Anthon, an Episcopal Minister, and witnessed by Samuel Colt and John Howard Payne. [...] After the ceremony and {{a few hours before}} the scheduled execution, a fire broke out in the Tombs. After the fire was extinguished, Colt's body was found in his cell. [...] He had stabbed himself in the heart with a <b>clasp</b> <b>knife,</b> believed to have been smuggled to him by a family member. [...] His body was taken by Rev Anthon and buried in the churchyard of St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery.|$|R
5000|$|The facón {{is both a}} {{fighting}} knife and a utility knife, and is widely used in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. [...] The knife is typically worn at the back and tucked into the gaucho's belt {{to allow it to}} be quickly drawn with the right hand. As {{a fighting}} knife, the facón is the main article of combat in an indigenous style of knife fighting known as escrima criolla ("Creole fencing") [...] When used in this context, one hand holds the knife, and a poncho or coat is wrapped about the opposite arm to absorb cuts and stabs in a manner reminiscent of traditional Andalusian knife fighting styles using the long-bladed Spanish <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> or navaja sevillana.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was found}} {{on the eve of the}} day on which she was told that she was to depart that she had in truth armed herself with a dagger or <b>clasp</b> <b>knife.</b> She {{actually}} displayed it when her uncle told her to come away from the chest on which she was sitting. She declared that she would defend herself there to the last gasp of her life; but of course the knife fell from her hand the first moment that she was touched. [...] "I did think once that she was going to make a poke at me," [...] Mr. Crump said afterwards; [...] "but she had screamed herself so weak that she couldn't do it." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the night}} of the storm, {{described}} in the last chapter, the only individual in old Jeph's hovel was old Jeph himself. He was seated at the inner end of it on a low chest near the stove, the light of which shone brightly on his thin old face and long white locks, and threw a gigantic black shadow on the wall behind. The old man was busily engaged in forming a model boat out of a piece of wood with a <b>clasp</b> <b>knife.</b> He muttered to himself as he went on with his work, occasionally pausing to glance towards the door, the upper half of which was open and revealed the dark storm raging without.|$|R
60|$|Let the world's {{sharpness}} like a <b>clasping</b> <b>knife</b> Shut in {{upon itself}} and {{do no harm}} In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm, And let us hear no sound of human strife After the click of the shutting. Life to life-- I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm, And feel as safe as guarded by a charm Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife Are weak to injure. Very whitely still The lilies of our lives may reassure Their blossoms from their roots, accessible Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer; Growing straight, out of man's reach, on the hill. God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{nothing to}} show who he was," [...] said Lestrade. [...] "You shall see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet {{does not appear to}} be a labourer. A horn-handled <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> was lying in a pool of blood beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple, some string, a {{shilling}} map of London, and a photograph. Here it is." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lock-blade knives {{have been}} dated to the 15th century. In Spain, one early lock-blade design was the Andalusian <b>clasp</b> <b>knife</b> popularly {{referred}} to as the navaja. [...] Opinel knives use a twist lock, consisting of a metal ferrule or barrel ring that is rotated to lock the blade either open or closed. In the late 20th century lock-blade pocket knives were popularized and marketed on a wider scale. Companies such as Buck Knives, Camillus, Case, and Gerber, created a wide range of products with locks of various types. The most popular form, the lockback knife, was popularized by Buck Knives in the 1960s, so much that the eponymous term [...] "buck knife" [...] was used to refer to lockback knives that were not manufactured by Buck.|$|R
