5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shock,</b> where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shock,</b> or cardiac arrest.|$|E

40|$|Background: Rapid Ultrasound in Shock (RUSH) is a {{recently}} reported emergency ultrasound protocol {{designed to help}} clinicians better recognize distinctive shock etiologies in a short time. We tried to evaluate the accuracy of early RUSH protocol performed by emergency physicians to predict the shock type in critically ill patients. Materials and Methods: Our prospective study {{was approved by the}} ethics committee of trauma research center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Science, Iran. We enrolled 52 patients with shock state in the emergency department from April 2013 to October 2013. We performed early bed-side sonographic examination for participants based on RUSH protocol. Patients received all needed standard therapeutic and diagnostic interventions without delay and were followed to document their final diagnosis. Agreement (Kappa index) of initial impression provided by RUSH with final diagnosis, and also sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of RUSH for diagnosis of each shock type were calculated. Results: Fifty-two patients were enrolled in our study. Kappa index was 0. 7 (P value = 0. 000), reflecting acceptable general agreement between initial impression and final diagnosis. For hypovolemic and obstructive shocks, the protocol had sensitivity of 100 % but had lower PPV. For shocks with distributive or mixed etiology, RUSH showed PPV of 100 % but had low sensitivity. For <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shocks,</b> all reliability indices were above 90 %. Conclusion: We highlight the role of RUSH examination {{in the hands of an}} emergency physician in making a rapid diagnosis of shock etiology, especially in ruling out obstructive, cardiogenic, and hypovolemic types...|$|R
30|$|The {{demographic}} and baseline {{characteristics of the}} 35 patients in the confirmatory cohort are listed in Table  1 : 28 had septic (80 %) and 7 <b>cardiogenic</b> (20 %) <b>shock.</b> Eighteen patients died in the ICU (51 %).

40|$|Dopamine is {{frequently}} administered in the ICU to critically-ill patients. The {{widespread use of}} dopamine does not only involve states of distributive and <b>cardiogenic</b> (imminent) <b>shock,</b> but also prophylaxis for deterioration and/or improvement of kidney- and bowel perfusion. Although many studies have shown an increase of renal- and (in some studies) improvement of splanchnic circulation, well controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a better outcome with respect to renal function and/or survival of prophylactic dopamine administration. Furthermore, evidence exists that norepinephrine is more efficacious in fluid resuscitated septic shock patients to restore blood pressure than dopamine, without jeopardizing the renal function. It is concluded that {{the widespread use of}} dopamine in the ICU should be reassessed...|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} markers used for risk {{stratification}} {{and these are}} also independent predictors of adverse outcome. These include hypotension, <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shock,</b> syncope, evidence of right heart dysfunction, and elevated cardiac enzymes. Some ECG changes including S1Q3T3 also correlate with worse short-term prognosis. There have been other patient-related factors such as COPD and chronic heart failure thought to {{also play a role}} in prognosis.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August 2009, in Putrajaya another {{death was}} {{confirmed}} involving a 57-year-old pensioner {{who was a}} diabetic and suffered from hypertension.

25|$|Individuals with WPW have an {{accessory}} pathway that communicates between the atria and the ventricles, {{in addition to}} the AV node. This accessory pathway is known as the bundle of Kent. This accessory pathway does not share the rate-slowing properties of the AV node, and may conduct electrical activity at a significantly higher rate than the AV node. For instance, in the example above, if an individual had an atrial rate of 300 beats per minute, the accessory bundle may conduct all the electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract at 300 beats per minute. Extremely rapid heart rates such as this may result in hemodynamic instability or <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shock.</b> In some cases, the combination of {{an accessory}} pathway and abnormal heart rhythms can trigger ventricular fibrillation, a leading cause of sudden cardiac death.|$|E
30|$|Patients with <b>cardiogenic</b> or septic <b>shock</b> {{were treated}} {{according}} to standardized protocols [37, 39]. Intravenous fluid administration {{as well as}} vasopressor therapy was initiated in patients meeting shock criteria aiming to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of > 65  mmHg. Early initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was performed according standardized protocols [39]. Antimicrobial therapy was adapted to culture results. Dialysis was performed in patients with renal failure and/or metabolic acidosis.|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo {{assess the}} results of {{first-line}} percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty (PABV) in high-risk patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) Methods: Of 253 high-risk patients referred for TAVI between October 2006 and September 2009, 41 were considered transiently unsuitable for either aortic valve replacement (AVR) or TAVI and underwent PABV as potential bridge to intervention. In the others, primary TAVI or AVR was performed in 140 cases, and medical therapy alone in 72. ResultsIndications for PABV were: unstable haemodynamic condition (n= 27, of whom 12 <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shocks),</b> TAVI not immediately available for logistic reasons (n= 6), associated cancer requiring further explorations (n= 4), therapeutic test for contentious presentation (n= 3), combined acute coronary syndrome requiring urgent percutaneous revascularization (n= 1). No death occurred during PABV. Twenty-three patients actually underwent secondary TAVI (n= 19) or AVR (n= 4) (bridge PABV), while 18 did not undergo further intervention (PABV alone) because of technical (n= 10) or general (n= 5) contraindications, death before intervention (n= 2) or patient's refusal (n= 1). The main baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of the different subgroups are presented in the Table. There {{was no significant difference}} in one-year survival between the primary TAVI/AVR and bridge PABV groups (p= 0. 08), and between the medical treatment and PABV alone groups (p= 0. 36). ConclusionIn very high-risk patients with aortic stenosis and temporary contraindications to AVR or TAVI, 1) PABV may be used as a bridge to intervention with good mid-term outcomes, 2) PABV alone can be safely performed but is associated with a poor mid-term outcome.

Setting: A tertiary intensive care unit in a university hospital. Participants: Twenty patients with <b>cardiogenic</b> or septic <b>shock</b> requiring a pulmonary artery catheter and inotropic support. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The central venous oxygen saturation overestimated the mixed venous oxygen saturation by a mean bias (or an absolute difference) of 6. 9 %, and the 95 % limits of agreement were large (- 5. 0 % to 18. 8 %). The difference between central and mixed venous oxygen saturation appeared to be more significant when mixed venous oxygen saturation was < 70 %. The changes in central and mixed venous oxygen saturation did not follow the line of perfect agreement closely in different clinical conditions. The central or mixed venous oxygen saturation had a significant ability to predict the status of cardiac output state, but this ability was reduced when the effect of hyperoxia was not considered.

2500|$|Emergency {{bypass surgery}} for the {{treatment}} of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is less common than PCI or thrombolysis. From 1995 to 2004, the percentage of people with <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shock</b> treated with primary PCI rose from 27.4% to 54.4%, while the increase in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) was only from 2.1% to 3.2%. [...] Emergency CABG is usually undertaken to simultaneously treat a mechanical complication, such as a ruptured papillary muscle, or a ventricular septal defect, with ensuing <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shock.</b> In uncomplicated MI, the mortality rate can be high when the surgery is performed immediately following the infarction. If this option is entertained, the patient should be stabilized prior to surgery, with supportive interventions {{such as the use of}} an intra-aortic balloon pump. In patients developing <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shock</b> after a myocardial infarction, both PCI and CABG are satisfactory treatment options, with similar survival rates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{symptoms}} {{associated with}} MI {{are dependent on}} which phase of the disease process the individual is in.

Some advanced paramedics may also be permitted to perform rapid sequence induction; a rapid way of obtaining an advanced airway with the use of paralytics and sedatives, using such medications as Versed, Ativan, or Etomidate, and paralytics such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, or vecuronium. Paramedics in some jurisdictions may also be permitted to sedate combative patients using antipsychotics like Haldol or Geodon. The use of medications for treating respiratory conditions such as, albuterol, atrovent, and methylprednisolone is common. Paramedics may also be permitted to administer medications such as those that relieve pain or decrease nausea and vomiting. Nitroglycerin, baby aspirin, and morphine sulfate may be administered for chest pain. Paramedics may also use other medications and antiarrhythmics like amiodarone to treat cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation not responding to defibrillation. Paramedics also treat for severe pain, i.e. burns or fractures, with narcotics like morphine sulfate, pethidine, fentanyl and in some jurisdictions, ketorolac.

However, there is lack of data regarding the clinical relevance of early hepatic dysfunction by means of altered serum BA levels and composition in different disease entities in critically patients.

40|$|Purpose Stroke volume (SV) is a {{parameter}} that {{is being}} recognized as an endpoint in fluid resuscitation algorithms. Its role is now being realized as an important variable in hemodynamic assessment in various clinical scenarios such as septic and <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>shocks.</b> Direct measurement of stroke volume (SV) and its novel corollary, stroke volume variation (SVV) derived by proprietary software, are preferred over mean cardiac output (CO) measurements because they render a more accurate reflection of hemodynamic status independent of heart rate. Flotrac-Vigileo monitor (FTV) (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) {{is a system that}} uses a complex algorithm analyzing arterial waveform to calculate SV, SVV, and CO. We assessed the feasibility of obtaining SV measurements with a portable echocardiogram and validated its accuracy with the FTV system in mechanically ventilated patients in our intensive care unit (ICU). Furthermore, we emphasized the importance of hemodynamic measurements and familiarity with critical care echocardiography for the intensivists. Methods Ten patients who were on mechanical ventilation were studied. A femoral arterial line was connected to the FTV system monitoring SV and CO. A portable echocardiogram (M-Turbo; Sonosite, Bothell, WA) was used to measure SV. CO was calculated by multiplying SV by heart rate. No patient had arrhythmia. We used biplane Simpson's method of discs to calculate SV in which subtraction of end-systolic volume from end-diastolic volume yields the SV Results The comparison of simultaneous SV and CO measurements by echocardiography with FTV showed a strong correlation between the 2. (For SV, y = 0. 9545 x + 3. 3, R 2 = 0. 98 and for CO, y = 0. 9104 x + 7. 7074, R 2 = 0. 97). Conclusions In our small cohort, the SV and CO measured by a portable echocardiogram (Sonosite M-Turbo) appears to be closely correlated with their respective values measured by FTV. Portable echocardiography is a reliable noninvasive tool for the hemodynamic assessment of the critically ill. Its results need further validation with gold standard measures in a larger cohort of patients. However, our results suggest portable echocardiography could be an attractive tool in assessment of different hemodynamic scenarios in the critically ill...|$|R

30|$|It {{is not an}} {{accidental}} quirk of nature that the body produces lactate during stress states. The proportion of lactate uptake by the myocardium and its use a metabolic fuel increases during exercise, β-adrenergic stimulation and shock [96]–[98]. During shock the heart undergoes {{a major shift in}} substrate utilization such that it oxidizes lactate for the majority of its energy needs [98]. Revelly and coworkers demonstrated that an infusion of sodium lactate increased cardiac performance in patients with both <b>cardiogenic</b> and septic <b>shock</b> [99]. Similarly, during increased demand on brain metabolism, lactate is increasingly utilized as an energy substrate [100]–[102].
