40|$|Capacity {{improvement}} from transmitter {{and receiver}} cooperation is investigated in a two-transmitter, two-receiver network with phase fading and full channel state information (CSI) available at all terminals. The transmitters cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel,</b> then encoding jointly with dirty-paper coding. The receivers cooperate by using Wyner–Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous orthogonal receiver <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel.</b> To account {{for the cost of}} cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and cooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over noncooperative transmission under most operating conditions when the <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel</b> is strong. However, a weak <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel</b> limits the transmitter cooperation rate; in this case, receiver cooperation is more advantageous.

40|$|Abstract — The {{cooperative}} dirty paper coding (DPC) rate {{region is}} investigated in a two-transmitter two-receiver network with full channel state information available at all terminals. The transmitters cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel,</b> then they mimic a broadcast channel (BC) and jointly perform DPC {{to send to}} the two independent receivers. The allocation of network power and bandwidth between the data and the <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel</b> is studied to characterize the cooperative DPC rate region. First, the optimal sum power allocation for a multiple access channel (MAC) is presented. Then through an application of the MAC-BC capacity duality, the cooperative DPC rate region is evaluated under different bandwidth allocation assumptions. Cooperative DPC outperforms non-cooperative time-division (TD) only when the <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel</b> is strong, since the joint-encoding capacity gain is negated by the overhead of message exchanges in a weak <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel.</b> Moreover, the cooperative capacity advantage over TD is more pronounced at the maximum sum rate point than when the rate vector is skewed {{toward one of the}} users.

40|$|Conference PaperIn this paper, we derive a new {{achievable}} rate {{region for}} the user <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel,</b> which exceeds {{the best known}} result for this channel [Wil 83]. Since the user <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel</b> includes many other known channels as a special case, the new rate region provides an improved achievable rates {{for many of the}} special cases (discussed later). The most notable example is that of the Gaussian relay channel [CG 79], for which we present a new closed form inner bound higher than the only known result (Theorem 5 in [CG 79]). The basic idea of the proposed encoding and decoding scheme is easier to grasp for a simpler case, the relay channel, by keeping in mind the following Markovian scheme from [CG 79]. In Markovian encoding, the relay decodes everything in the current block and uses it to establish a basis for common information sent from the transmitter and relay in the next block. The fact that Markovian coding does not achieve capacity depends on to two inter-related facts: (a) the relay decodes each codeword completely, and (b) discards the residual after decoding; this limits the relay channel capacity to the capacity between the source and the relay. Our proposed encoding does not require the relay to necessarily decode the whole codeword from the transmitter. In addition, the relay " encodes the whole received signal some implicit embedding of with the decoded information. Note that the signal transmitted by the relay is not separable into a source code and a channel code. For the user <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel,</b> the above operation is performed by both users for each others' signal...|$|E
40|$|Virtual {{multiple}}-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems {{using multiple}} antennas at the transmitter {{and a single}} antenna {{at each of the}} receivers have recently emerged as an alternative to point-to-point MIMO systems. This paper investigates the relationship between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) for a virtual-MIMO system that has one destination and one relay using compress-and-forward (CF) cooperation. To capture the cost of cooperation, the power allocation (between the transmitter and the relay) and the bandwidth allocation (between the data and cooperation channels) are studied. This paper derives a tight upper bound for the overall system EE as a function of SE, which exhibits good accuracy {{for a wide range of}} SE values. The EE upper bound is used to formulate an EE optimization problem. Given a target SE, the optimal power and bandwidth allocation can be derived such that the overall EE is maximized. Results indicate that the EE performance of virtual-MIMO is sensitive to many factors, including resource-allocation schemes and channel characteristics. When an out-of-band <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel</b> is considered, the performance of virtual-MIMO is close to that of the MIMO case in terms of EE. Considering a shared-band <b>cooperation</b> <b>channel,</b> virtual-MIMO with optimal power and bandwidth allocation is more energy efficient than the noncooperation case under most SE values...|$|E

In contrast to the literature, we prove that the opportunistic behavior of the retailer does not necessarily lower channel performance and social welfare. Indeed, a downward misrepresentation of the retail cost, which one obtains when the price elasticity of demand is not very price elastic, increases channel performance and social welfare.

In this scenario, we propose a novel interference alignment (IA) technique exploiting user cooperation.

40|$|Capacity {{gain from}} {{transmitter}} and receiver cooperation are compared in a relay network where the cooperating nodes are close together. Under quasi-static channels, when all nodes have equal average transmit power along with full channel state information (CSI), it is shown that transmitter cooperation outperforms receiver cooperation, whereas {{the opposite is true}} when power is optimally allocated among the cooperating nodes but only CSI at the receiver (CSIR) is available. When the nodes have equal power with CSIR only, cooperative schemes are shown to offer no capacity improvement over non-cooperation under the same network power constraint. When the system is under optimal power allocation with full CSI, the decode-and-forward transmitter cooperation rate is close to its cut-set capacity upper bound, and outperforms compress-and-forward receiver cooperation. Under Rayleigh fading in the high SNR regime, similar conclusions follow. Cooperative systems provide resilience to channel fading; however, capacity becomes more sensitive to power allocation, and the cooperating nodes need to be closer together for the decode-and-forward scheme to be capacity-achieving. Moreover, to realize capacity improvement, full CSI is necessary in transmitter cooperation, while in receiver cooperation optimal power allocation is essential.

40|$|International audienceCooperation in {{cellular}} networks {{has been}} recently suggested as a promising scheme to improve system performance, especially for cell-edge users. In this work, we use stochastic geometry to analyze cooperation models where {{the positions of}} Base Stations (BSs) follow a Poisson point process distribution and where Voronoi cells define the planar areas associated with them. For the service of each user, either one or two BSs are involved. If two, these cooperate by exchange of user data and channel related information with conferencing over some backhaul link. Our framework generally allows variable levels of channel information at the transmitters. In this paper we investigate the case of limited channel state information for <b>cooperation</b> (<b>channel</b> phase, second neighbour interference), but not the fully adaptive case which would require considerable feedback. The total per-user transmission power is further split between the two transmitters and a common message is encoded. The decision for a user to choose service with or without cooperation is directed by a family of geometric policies depending on its relative position to its two closest base stations. An exact expression of the network coverage probability is derived. Numerical evaluation allows one to analyze significant coverage benefits compared to the non-cooperative case. As a conclusion, cooperation schemes can improve system performance without exploitation of extra network resources...|$|E
