No mere intellect, no mere worldly success could, in this age of bold inquiry, have sustained that tremendous claim; long ago we should have stricken CÃ¦sar and dethroned Napoleon. But these glories and these sacrifices did not seem too much to celebrate a hardworking human nature; they were possible because at the heart of our Empire was nothing but a defiant humility. If the Queen had stood for any novel or fantastic imperial claims, the whole would have seemed a nightmare; the whole was successful because she stood, and no one could deny that she stood, for the humblest, the shortest and the most indestructible of human gospels, that when all troubles and troublemongers have had their say, our work can be done till sunset, our life can be lived till death.|$|E

In addition, the effect of filling the structure with foam is studied. The well-known crashworthiness parameters {{are being used to}} compare the different configurations. In addition, 2 new parameters (crush load stability and springback coefficient) are introduced to assess both the difference between the peak and the average <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> and the stability during the post crushing stage as well as the capability of the structure to retain its original height after crushing.

Thus, not so many researches has been investigated the effect of sulfuric acid erosion on concrete containing PET particles, this study represents the laboratory investigation of different values of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % of PET particles as an alternative aggregate on erosion caused by sulfuric acid in concrete. All samples were cured during 28 days, 3 samples from each mix design were tested, finally.

The results showed that by increasing in amount of PET particles as an alternative aggregates in concrete, there is less reduction in values of <b>crushing</b> <b>load,</b> weight loss and ultrasonic wave velocity.

For comparison, empty Al, empty composite and empty hybrid tubes were also tested. Empty composite and empty hybrid tubes crushed predominantly in progressive crushing mode, without applying any triggering mechanism. Foam filling {{was found to}} be ineffective in increasing the crushing loads of the composite tubes over the sum of the crushing loads of empty composite tube and foam. However, foam filling stabilized the composite progressive crushing mode. In empty hybrid tubes, the deformation mode of the inner Al tube {{was found to be}} a more complex form of the diamond mode of deformation of empty Al tube, leading to higher <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> values than the sum of the <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> values of empty composite tube and empty metal tube. The foam filling of hybrid tubes however resulted in axial splitting of the outer composite tube due to the resistance imposed by the foam filler to Al tube inward folding and hence it was ineffective in increasing <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> and SAE values over those of empty hybrid tubes.

40|$|Experimental {{evaluation}} of a multifunctional crashworthy pi-joint/sandwich structure is described herein. The energy absorbing sandwich webs were bonded into a representative pi-joint, thereby, producing a load carrying joint that also functions as a constraint during crushing. Ply-drop triggers were incorporated into both face sheets of the sandwich web to initiate a controlled failure leading to a progressive crushing failure mode. The energy absorbing structure was evaluated under quasi-static and dynamic loading rates. Stable progressive crushing was observed for all specimens, demonstrating the robustness of the developed configuration. The steady state <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> recorded during dynamic testing was 11. 5 % lower than the same configuration evaluated quasi-statically. The reduction in steady state <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> was attributed {{to a change in}} the failure mode (brittle fracture) compared to the lamina bending (splaying) failure mode observed during quasi-static testing.

40|$|A {{challenge}} in numerical simulation of crashworthiness {{study is to}} be able to predict the crush damage modes, their evolution during crushing and the energy absorption in any composite structure from elementary material characterisation data. Therefore, it is important to know the behavior of one ply subjected to <b>crushing</b> <b>load,</b> and especially to determine the mean crushing stress that could be used for simulation. For that purpose, quasi-static crushing tests are performed for different configurations of two CFRP materials, UD and fabrics to determine the mean crushing stress of plies alone and inside a laminate. This study shows there is a linear relationship between <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> and the contact surface of the plies being crushed on a metallic base which enables actually to define a mean crushing stress for a ply. The method to calculate this value is presented in this paper, based on image analysis of specific crushing tests.

Tubes and fillers used in the experiments were prepared using the tube rolling and foaming from powder compacts methods, respectively. The composite was prepared using E-glass fiber fabric (2 x 2 twill fiber construction of 165 g/m 2 areal density) and polyester matrix with a 45 / 45 fiber angle to the tube axis. The quasi-static crush tests were conducted axially on the empty, hybrid and foam filled tubes at 25 mm/min crosshead speed. The deformation sequences of the tubes were further recorded during the tests in order to identify the crushing modes of the tubes. Two failure mechanisms literally known as progressive crushing and catastrophic failure (compression shear) were observed during the crushing of empty composite tubes. The progressive crushing mode leaded to higher <b>crushing</b> <b>loads</b> hence Specific Absorbed Energies (SAE). The predominant progressive crushing mode of empty tubes of thinner wall section was attributed to the surface end defects introduced during sectioning of the tubes. In hybrid tubes, the deformation mode of Al tube was found to be a more complex form of the diamond mode of deformation, leading to higher SAE values than the sum of the SAEs of empty composite and empty metal tube. The increased load and SAE values ofhybrid tubes were attributed to the constraining effect of the composite to the metal tube folding. Results further showed that when the progressive crushing mode was taken into account hybrid tubes had lower SAE values than those of empty composite tubes. The foam filling of the composite tubes however showed two different results. It increased the foam filled tube <b>crush</b> <b>loads</b> over the sum of the <b>crush</b> <b>loads</b> of empty composite tube and foam.
