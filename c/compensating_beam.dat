40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Use {{of solid}} compensators {{is a very}} {{effective}} means of implementing IMRT on any linear accelerator. The standard practice has been IMRT delivery using accelerators equipped with multi-leaf collimators (MLC’s). Truth is the addition of MLC’s to an accelerator is quite expensive. Previous studies have shown solid compensators to have better dose conformance, easier implementation, and more cost effective than MLC IMRT. On the other hand, the addition of these commercially available brass compensators changes the beam characteristics {{and needs to be}} taken into account. The treatment planning system must be modeled to represent the dose accordingly. Many previous data suggest a 5 % dose agreement to be acceptable for treatment. With sufficient study of the beam characteristics of the <b>compensated</b> <b>beam</b> and proper modeling of the treatment planning system one should achieve greater dose agreement.

40|$|The {{concept to}} use a slab as active element, working in zig-zag geometry, and also as Fresnel rhomb, seems to be rather attractive. However, in this case {{different}} depolarization effects in active element arc of crucial importance. We have carried out the estimations of depolarization effects arising both due to mechanical loading of an active element at its fastening and due to thermooptical distortions. To check up these rigid requirements to depolarization (0. 1 % - 0. 01 %) careful measurements of depolarization effects and their sources are being carried out. Mechanical loading gives {{one of the main}} contributions in depolarization at fastening of active element.

This paper {{shows that the}} modulation transfer functions of a cavity detuned to <b>compensate</b> <b>beam</b> loading serve to increase the emittance growth rate. The effect of fast feedback on the transfer function is also discussed. 1 Introduction The effect of noise in synchrotron longitudinal phasespace is to produce diffusion of particle trajectories toward the separatrix. Given that storage rings at CERN routinely hold beam for many hours, it might be thought noise will be of no consequence to the KAON Factory[1] given that the storage time is at most 100 ms. However, life-time (in the presence of noise) varies as the inverse square of the synchrotron frequency f s. At CERN f s is typically ¸ 10 2 Hz, whereas f s is greater than 10 4 Hz at KAON. This difference is enough to cancel, partially, the inequality in storage times. The noise tolerances are different at the cavity gap and rf [...] ...|$|R

40|$|To fulfil the {{requirements}} of ESS on beam transmission and emittance growth a detailed knowledge of the physics of beam formation {{as well as the}} interaction of the H- with the residual gas is substantial. Space charge <b>compensated</b> <b>beam</b> transport using solenoids for ion optics is in favour for the Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) between ion source and the first RFQ. Space charge compensation reduces the electrical self fields and beam radii and therefore emittance growth due to aberrations and redistribution. Transport of H- near the ion source is negatively influenced by the dipole fields required for beam extraction and e [...] dumping and the high gas pressure. The destruction of the rotational symmetry together with the space charge forces causes emittance growth and particle losses within the extraction system. High residual gas pressure near the extractor together with the high cross section for stripping will influence the transmission as well as space charge compensation. Therefore a detailed knowledge of the interaction of the residual gas with the beam and the influence of the external fields on the distribution of the compensation particles is necessary to reduce particle losses and emittance growth. Preliminary experiments using positive hydrogen ions for reference already show the influence of dipole fields on beam emittance. First measurements with H- confirm these results. Additional information on the interactions of the residual gas with the beam ions have been gained from the measurements using the momentum and energy analyser...|$|R
