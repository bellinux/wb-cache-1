5000|$|The idea of de Rham cohomology is to {{classify}} {{the different types}} of <b>closed</b> <b>forms</b> on a manifold.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to array-based dependence testing in the presence of nonlinear and nonclosed array index expressions and pointer references. Conventional data dependence testing requires induction variable substitution to replace recurrences with <b>closed</b> <b>forms.</b> We take a radically different approach to dependence testing by turning the analysis problem up-side-down. We convert <b>closed</b> <b>forms</b> to recurrences for dependence analysis. Because the set of functions defined by recurrences is a superset of functions with <b>closed</b> <b>forms,</b> we show that more dependence problems can be successfully analyzed by rephrasing the array-based dependence analysis as a search problem for a solution to a system of recurrences.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} the analysis of mem-ory reference sets addressed by induction variables without <b>closed</b> <b>forms.</b> This framework relies on a new data structure, the value evolution graph(VEG), which models the global flow of values taken by induction variable with and with-out <b>closed</b> <b>forms.</b> We describe the application of our frame-work to array data-flow analysis, privatization, and depen-dence analysis. This results in the automatic parallelization of loops that contain arrays addressed by induction vari-ables without <b>closed</b> <b>forms.</b> We implemented this framework in the Polaris research compiler.

Simultaneous diagonalization, Jacobi iterations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, structured eigenvalue problem. AMS subject classifications. 65 F 15, 65 - 04. Introduction. Simultaneous diagonalization of several commuting matrices has been recently considered in [1], mainly motivated by stability and convergence concerns. Exact or approximate simultaneous diagonalization was also independently introduced {{as a solution to}} a statistical identification problem [2] (see [3] for a later paper in English). The simultaneous diagonalization algorithm described in these papers is an extension of the Jacobi technique: a joint diagonality criterion is iteratively optimized under plane rotations.
