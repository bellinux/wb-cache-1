2500|$|Later, {{during the}} reign of Emperor Xuānzong's son Emperor Yizong, when the former {{chancellor}} Linghu Tao served successively as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xuanwu (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) and then Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), Wang served as Linghu's secretary. [...] Wang was subsequently recalled to Chang'an to serve as You Shiyi (右拾遺), a low-level advisory official at the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng), and it was said that while serving there, he submitted petitions making 23 suggestions, causing people to respect him for his insight. [...] When the chancellor Xu Shang also served as the director of salt and iron monopolies, he invited Wang to serve as an assistant. [...] Later, after Xu was relieved of his chancellor post and made the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), he wanted Wang to serve under him, but did not dare to ask, as he did not know whether Wang would be willing to leave the capital again. [...] Wang heard about this, and he stated to Xu, [...] "When I had just passed the Jinshi examination, it was you, Lord, who regarded me well. [...] Now that you, Lord, will be receiving a seal and a military command, how <b>can</b> <b>your</b> subordinate not follow you?" [...] Xu was pleased, and he had Wang made his assistant.|$|E
2500|$|According to Muslim commentators, after Ibrahim {{survived the}} great fire, notoriety in society grew bigger after this event. Nimrod, {{who was the}} King of Babylon felt that his throne was in danger, {{and that he was}} losing power because upon {{witnessing}} Ibrahim coming out of the fire unharmed, a large part of society started believing in Allah and Ibrahim being a prophet of Allah. Up until this point, Nimrod was pretending that he himself was a God. Nimrod wanted to debate with him and show his people that he, the king is indeed the god and that Ibrahim was a liar. Nimrod asked Ibrahim, [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>your</b> God do that I cannot?" [...] Ibrahim replied, [...] "My Lord is He who gives life and death." [...] Nimrod then shouted, [...] "I give life and death! I can bring a person from the street and have him executed, and I can grant my pardon to a person who was sentenced to death and save his life." [...] Ibrahim replied, [...] "Well, my lord Allah makes the sun rise from the East. Can you make it rise from the West?" [...] Nimrod was confounded. He was beaten at his own game, on his own territory and in front of his own people. Prophet Ibrahim left him there speechless and went back to his important mission, calling people to worship the one and only God, Allah.|$|E
2500|$|Hammond {{was made}} captain of England in 1938 when he {{achieved}} amateur status through {{being given a}} top job in a tyre company. This was {{the age of the}} [...] "Shamateur", when cricketers were given lucrative posts so that they would qualify for amateur status and captaincy of their county and country. He was with the RAF in South Africa during the war, but returned to play in 1945 and in the first full county season in 1946 made 1,783 runs (84.90) including six centuries in seven innings, making him easily the best batsman in England. Though the [...] at the MCC disliked having an ex-professional as England captain Hammond had no rivals to the post. On his arrival in Australia the news broke that he was divorcing his wife of 17 years to marry a South African beauty queen and the press had a field day. Hammond made centuries in his first two innings on the tour, 131 off Northam (with 19 fours and 4 sixes) and 208 against Western Australia, but suffered from fibrositis and let Yardley captain most of the early tour games. Hammond proved to be aloof and distant and at 43 was a generation older than the rest of his team, who held in him awe. Amateur captains used to readily consult their senior professional, but Hammond the ex-pro rarely sought anybody's advice, and [...] "sphinx-like marched from slip at one end to slip at the other, apparently, as Plum Warner wrote of him 'just letting the game go on'". He ordered his batsmen to stay in their crease and not attack the bowling and had his best bowlers running around the outfield between overs. In the Tests his highest Test score was only 37 and simply failed to concentrate as he used to; [...] "When I consider the hours I have spent against men like Grimmett and O'Reilly, never taking the slightest chance and patiently waiting for the loose ball to come along, I cannot understand why in 1946 I tried to hit spin bowlers off their length before I had been at the wicket ten minutes". Although averse to public speaking Hammond was very popular with the Australian public and was cheered whenever he appeared. One newspaper told its readers [...] "See him while you <b>can.</b> <b>Your</b> grandsons will feel you have let them down if you haven't seen him on their behalf". However, Hammond came [...] "as a cricket god, only to leave a failure both as a batsman and a captain". He retired on his return to England and moved to South Africa, where he remained detached from cricket until he took to the habit of visiting M.J.K. Smith's touring team just before he died in a car accident in 1965.|$|E
