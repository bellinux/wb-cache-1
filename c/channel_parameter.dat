40|$|Abstract—In Wyner-Ziv (WZ) video coding, or coding {{of video}} with decoder side {{information}} (SI), {{the correlation between}} the source and its SI at the decoder side is modeled as a virtual correlation channel, and decoding of the quantized source requires the estimation of the correlation <b>channel</b> <b>parameter.</b> In this paper, we present a joint decoding and correlation <b>channel</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation approach. In the approach, starting from an initial correlation <b>channel</b> <b>parameter,</b> channel decoding and correlation <b>channel</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation are carried out iteratively. In each iteration, channel decoding of a bit plane of the quantized source is carried out first. The probability that a channel output bit is different from the corresponding one in the SI is then collected. The correlation <b>channel</b> <b>parameter</b> is numerically estimated afterwards by solving the equation between the probability collected and another probability calculated with the SI, the already decoded bit planes of the quantized source, and the correlation <b>channel</b> <b>parameter.</b> The process is repeated till a bit plane of the quantized source is correctly decoded. Simulation results show that the proposed approach obtains very promising results. Keywords-Wyner-Ziv video coding; side information; correlation channel; parameter estimation I...|$|E

This partitioning of the <b>channel</b> <b>parameter</b> space provides two key results: 1) Given a nominal (vector) <b>channel</b> <b>parameter,</b> one can easily gauge the robustness of the decoding as a function of deviations from this nominal parameter; 2) Rather than obtaining one decoding for a single parametrization, one can obtain a list of decodings for a family of channel parametrizations at the decoder.
