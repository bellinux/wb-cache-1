25|$|Historically, PAHs contributed {{substantially}} to {{our understanding}} of adverse health effects from exposures to environmental contaminants, including <b>chemical</b> <b>carcinogenesis.</b> In 1775, Percivall Pott, a surgeon at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, observed that scrotal cancer was unusually common in chimney sweepers and proposed the cause as occupational exposure to soot. A century later, Richard von Volkmann reported increased skin cancers in workers of the coal tar industry of Germany, and by the early 1900s increased rates of cancer from exposure to soot and coal tar was widely accepted. In 1915, Yamigawa and Ichicawa were the first to experimentally produce cancers, specifically of the skin, by topically applying coal tar to rabbit ears.|$|E
25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{amount of}} Bửu Hội's contributions {{are in the}} field of <b>chemical</b> <b>carcinogenesis</b> and the synthesis of related organic chemical compounds. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he had extensive collaborations with the quantum chemistry personnel of the Radium Institute on various aspects of the electronic theory of carcinogenesis. Bửu Hội was the first to propose the involvement of noncovalent forces. Together with Lacassagne and Rudali, in the 1940s he became the first to describe the phenomena of synergisma and antagonism between carcinogens. He demonstrated this by using hydrocarbons on the skin of mice and later extended this to hepatic and other carcinogens. Starting in 1947, he collaborated with François Zajdela and Lacassagne in exploring the relationships between the structure and carcinogenic activity of polynuclear compounds. The study spanned a groundbreaking scale and depth.|$|E
25|$|He {{contributed to}} {{studies on the}} {{carcinogenicity}} of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide derivatives, the production of plant tumors by a nitrosamine. He also studied metabolism and protein binding of polynuclears {{and the effect of}} the binding o DNA replication and transcription, testing the effect of various carcinogens on the hatching of shrimp eggs. From the mid-1960s onwards, Bửu Hội increasingly turned his focus to the structural facets of polynuclears which determine their ability to induce microsomal enzyme synthesis, in particular involving zoxazolamine and dicoumarol hydroxylation. Aside from his study of fundamental organic chemistry, <b>chemical</b> <b>carcinogenesis</b> and chemotherapy of leprosy and tuberculosis, Bửu Hội's team also conducted research into {{a wide range of issues}} of biological and therapeutic interest. These included the synthesis and testing anti-inflammatory non-steroid compounds, substituted sex hormones, anti-coagulant substances and their potentiation, antidiabetic agents, treatment of hypertension by methyl-DOPA, antioxidants and the chemophylaxy of aging and the toxicity of dioxine among others.|$|E

40|$|The Slug {{transcription}} factor {{plays an important}} role in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) -induced skin carcinogenesis, particularly in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurring during tumor progression. In the present studies, we investigated the role of Slug in two-stage <b>chemical</b> skin <b>carcinogenesis.</b> Slug and the related {{transcription factor}} Snail were expressed at high levels in skin tumors induced by 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[α]anthracene application followed by 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) treatment. TPA-induced transient elevation of Slug and Snail proteins in normal mouse epidermis and studies in Slug transgenic mice indicated that Slug modulates TPA-induced epidermal hyperplasia and cutaneous inflammation. Although Snail family factors have been linked to inflammation via interactions with the cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) pathway, a pathway that also {{plays an important role}} in skin carcinogenesis, transient TPA induction of Slug and Snail appeared unrelated to COX- 2 expression. In cultured human keratinocytes, TPA induced Snail mRNA expression while suppressing Slug expression, and this differential regulation was due specifically to activation of the TPA receptor.

40|$|PURPOSE: To test an {{experimental}} model of <b>chemical</b> mammary <b>carcinogenesis</b> induction in rats.

Afterwards, at 8 and 13 weeks, their mammary glands were examined. At {{the end of}} the experiment, the animals were sacrificed, and the mammary tumors were measured and weighed.

40|$|The roles {{played by}} the {{endogenous}} angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) {{in the early stages}} of multi-step carcinogenesis and in the control of hematogenous versus lymphatic metastasis are unknown. To investigate these issues we compared tumor development in normal mice and in transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of TSP- 1 in the epidermis following a standard two-step <b>chemical</b> skin <b>carcinogenesis</b> regimen. Overexpression of TSP- 1 resulted in delayed and reduced development of premalignant epithelial hyperplasias, but did not inhibit the malignant conversion to squamous cell carcinomas.

Concomitant with these results, we found that the endothelial TSP- 1 receptor CD 36 was mostly absent from cutaneous lymphatic vessels.

40|$|The angiogenic switch during {{tumorigenesis}} {{is thought}} to be induced by a change in the balance of pro- angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. To elucidate the biological role of the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin- 2 (TSP- 2) during multistep carcinogenesis, we subjected TSP- 2 -deficient and wild-type mice to a <b>chemical</b> skin <b>carcinogenesis</b> regimen. Surprisingly, TSP- 2 expression was strongly upregulated in the mesenchymal stroma of wild-type mice throughout the consecutive stages of tumorigenesis whereas the angiogenesis factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, was induced predominantly in tumor cells. TSP- 2 deficiency dramatically enhanced susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis and resulted in accelerated and increased tumor formation. The angiogenic switch occurred in early stages of pre-malignant tumor formation, and tumor angiogenesis was significantly enhanced in TSP- 2 -deficient mice. While TSP- 2 deficiency did not affect tumor differentiation or proliferation, tumor cell apoptosis was signific antly reduced. These results reveal upregulation of an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor during multi step tumorigenesis and identify enhanced stromal TSP- 2 expression as a novel host anti-tumor defense mechanism...|$|R

Exposure of Grhl 1 (-/-) mice to a standard <b>chemical</b> skin <b>carcinogenesis</b> protocol results in development of fewer papillomas than in wild type control animals, but with a rate of conversion to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that is strikingly higher than in normal littermates.

To determine the precise biological function of Ahnak/Desmoyokin, we generated a null mutation in ES cells and mice. The resultant Ahnak/Desmoyokin-deficient ES cells normally differentiated into embryoid bodies and neural cells. The mutant mice were viable and fertile and showed no gross developmental defects. Electron microscopic examination of skin sections demonstrated that the ultrastructure of epidermal intercellular junctions, including desmosomes, of the mutant mice was indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice. Two-stage <b>chemical</b> skin <b>carcinogenesis</b> experiments showed no difference in frequency or onset of cutaneous tumor formation between wild-type and mutant mice.

40|$|Protein kinase D (PKD) is {{a family}} of stress-responsive serine/threonine kinases implicated in the {{regulation}} of diverse cellular functions including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell motility.

We recently identified a critical role for PKD 1 during reversal of keratinocyte differentiation in culture, suggesting a potential proproliferative role in epidermal adaptive responses. Here, we generated mice with targeted deletion of PKD 1 in the epidermis to evaluate the significance of PKD 1 in normal and hyperplastic conditions. These mice displayed a normal skin phenotype, indicating that PKD 1 is dispensable for skin development and homeostasis. Upon wounding, however, PKD 1 -deficient mice exhibited delayed wound re-epithelialization correlated with a reduced proliferation and migration of keratinocytes at the wound edge. In addition, the hyperplastic and inflammatory responses to topical phorbol ester were significantly suppressed, suggesting involvement of PKD 1 in tumor promotion.
