The technique is fundamentally different to, and does the reverse of, the well-known third harmonic injection techniques utilized to increase the AC output voltage in three-phase converter systems for a given DC link voltage. In the proposed scheme, the number of inserted SMs in each <b>converter</b> <b>leg</b> {{is greater than the}} number of SMs per arm, whence the MMC can operate with a higher DC link voltage while the SM number per arm and their capacitor voltages remain unchanged. This lowers the DC current and the DC transmission loss is significantly reduced by 22 %. Station conduction losses with the operational scheme are lowered by 2. 4 %. The semiconductor current stresses are also lowered due to the reduced DC component of arm currents.

The PPWM is employed in Voltage Source Converter for getting better current control and the SPWM is employed in Diode assisted Buck-Boost VSI for attaining better voltage regulation.

40|$|Semi bridge {{converters}} {{are formed}} by the removal of upper (or alternatively, lower) phase leg semiconductor switching devices of their full bridge counterparts. They offer substantial advantages over a complete full bridge arrangement, because of their reduced controlled switch count and shoot through free phase leg structure. However, {{in contrast to the}} bidirectional capability of a full bridge converter, a semi bridge structure can only transfer energy in one specific direction, which limits its use to unity power factor rectification only, and even then with an identifiable level of degradation of its input current harmonic performance. The first objective of this thesis is to quantify the impact that the intrinsic topological constraint of a semi bridge rectifier has on its input current quality. A detailed analytical expression is developed for the input current under this restriction, incorporating second order effects such as supply voltage harmonics and semiconductor voltage drops. The result is used to identify the theoretical input current total harmonic distortion limits for the semi bridge rectifier as converter parameters and working conditions are varied. The second objective is to mitigate the intrinsic limitation of semi bridge rectifiers using multilevel arrangements, because of their ability to reduce the filter inductance for a given operating switching frequency. For a semi bridge rectifier, the input current harmonic performance is directly proportional to the size of filter inductance, so that the smaller filter size allowed by a multilevel converter reduces the inherent low frequency input current distortion. Two novel multilevel semi bridge rectifier structures, and the specific pulse width modulation technique for the correct carrier harmonics cancelling in these topologies, are devised and extensively validated. Finally, the third objective is to broaden the application of semi bridge converters to operate at any power factor. Recent work presents an alternative multilevel approach via the inclusion of a coupled inductor into the <b>converter</b> phase <b>leg,</b> between the upper and lower switching devices. This concept, initially conceived for the H bridge topology, was later extended to the diode clamped converter architecture. In the first instance, both these coupled inductor arrangements appear to be new inverter structures. However, more detailed analysis identifies that they are in fact the parallel connection of two complementary semi bridge <b>converter</b> phase <b>legs.</b> Although the two individual semi bridge phase legs offer unidirectional power flow only, when operating within this topological arrangement, this intrinsic limitation is overcome and the converter output offers bidirectional regenerative capability. This recognition led to a number of benefits. Firstly, a third family member is readily derived, based on a flying capacitor multilevel structure. Secondly, it becomes straightforward to identify how to best modulate and control this family of topologically reduced converters, since there is a wealth of established knowledge about how to best control their full bridge counterparts. Finally, at least for the IGBT based variants, the identification of their common semi bridge origin allows additional unnecessary diodes to be removed from the reduced topologies, minimizing their silicon device count to exactly match their full bridge counterparts.

The <b>converter</b> fourth <b>leg</b> is used to provide a path for the zero sequence components when feeding unbalanced or non-linear loads. A high bandwidth controller is required to regulate the output voltage of Matrix Converter with a 400 Hz output frequency. However, the controller bandwidth is limited due to the reduced ratio between the converter switching frequency and the fundamental frequency. In this case undesirable, periodic errors and distortion will exist in the output voltage above all {{in the presence of}} a non-linear or unbalanced load.

The proposed five-level four-switch per phase converter has nL=nS= 5 / 4 which {{is by far the}} best relationship among the converters presented in technical literature. A comprehensive literature review on existing five-level converter topologies is done to compare the proposed topology with conventional multilevel converters. The most important characteristics of the proposed configuration are: (i) reduced number of semiconductor devices, while keeping a high number of levels at the output converter side, (ii) only one DC source without any need to balance capacitor voltages, (iii) high efficiency, (iv) there is no dead-time requirement for the <b>converters</b> operation, (v) <b>leg</b> isolation procedure with lower stress for the DC-link capacitor. Single-phase and three-phase version of the proposed converter is presented in this thesis. Details regarding the operation of the configuration and modulation strategy are presented, as well as the comparison between the proposed converter and the conventional ones. Simulated results are presented to validate the theoretical expectations. In addition a fault tolerant converter based on proposed topology for micro-grid systems is presented. A hybrid pulse-width-modulation for the pre-fault operation and transition from the pre-fault to post-fault operation will be discussed. Selected steady-state and transient results are demonstrated to validate the theoretical modeling...|$|R
