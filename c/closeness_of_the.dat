5|$|Boise State {{committed}} four turnovers, {{compared with}} East Carolina's one. The Broncos fumbled {{the ball away}} twice and threw two interceptions. Despite the disparity in turnover margin, the teams were strikingly similar in several statistical categories, indicating the <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game: Each team earned seven points off the turnovers. Both teams committed 50yards in penalties; the Pirates had seven penalties to the Broncos' four. In addition, both teams earned 22 firstdowns.|$|E
5|$|Tabram {{was killed}} on 7 August 1888; she had {{suffered}} 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and the <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date {{to those of the}} later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen, and many experts do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.|$|E
5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms or groups, resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E

He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, set his sights on a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.|$|E
5|$|For {{the inauguration}} of the CCP, a gala opening of the Golden Salakot, a pageant-drama of {{a story about the}} {{prehistory}} of the Philippines, occurred on September 8, 1969. The United States of America's President Nixon was invited but instead Ronald Reagan, California's Governor, along with his wife, flew to the country using the Air Force One for the event. There were accounts that the First Lady attempted to bring other celebrities through getting them tickets to ride the Air Force one but she was denied of this luxury by President Nixon.

5|$|In the 8th century BC, {{after the}} end of the {{so-called}} Greek Dark Ages, Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, the greatest of all being that of the Trojan Epic Cycle. In general, the Greeks of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods and material wealth. The legends of Homer's Epics were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. At this time, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of Mycenae in 1876. Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of the Iliad by identifying the places described by Homer.|$|E

5|$|In the 9th {{century the}} Polish lands {{were still on}} the {{peripheries}} of medieval Europe as regards its major powers and events, but a measure of progress did take place in levels of civilization, as evidenced by the number of gords built, kurgans raised and movable equipment used. The tribal elites must have been influenced by the relative <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carolingian Empire; objects crafted there have occasionally been found. Poland was populated by many tribes of various sizes.

5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we report}} on {{progress}} made in the construction and characterization of a two-channel, two-stage interferometric downconverter made for interferometric radar applications. The downconverters are constructed with a high-degree <b>of</b> symmetry between <b>the</b> two channels for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> forming {{a balance between the}} two interferometric signal pathways, and therefore, to maximize phase tracking as a function of temperature changes. This high degree <b>of</b> symmetry, and <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> proximity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two channels however, has the potential to increase channel cross-talk, hence a balance must be found between maintaining a thermal balance between the two channels, and maximizing the channels separation from one another.

5|$|The Japanese had {{developed}} the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas {{up until that}} point they had usually withdrawn {{in the face of}} the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to the <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting, along with some 37mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support to overwhelm the Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the indirect method that would characterise their operations during this phase of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving up a steep slope that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was able to deliver a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position early in the evening.|$|E
5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Florida outcome {{led to a}} recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v.

The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266).
