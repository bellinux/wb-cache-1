5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> (<b>mitigation</b> of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E
25|$|<b>Climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>mitigation</b> {{consists}} of actions {{to limit the}} magnitude or rate of long-term climate change. <b>Climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>mitigation</b> generally involves reductions in human (anthropogenic) {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs). Mitigation may also be achieved by increasing the capacity of carbon sinks, e.g., through reforestation. Mitigation policies can substantially reduce the risks associated with human-induced global warming.|$|E

25|$|The {{two main}} policy {{responses}} {{to global warming}} are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (<b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>mitigation)</b> and {{to adapt to the}} impacts of global warming (e.g., by building levees in response to sea level rise).

25|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increased}} interest in energy consumption reduction based on behavioural change, be it for reasons of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>mitigation</b> or energy security. The application of behavioural change theories {{in the field of}} energy consumption behaviour yields interesting insights.

25|$|Governments {{have taken}} action to reduce GHG {{emissions}} (<b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>mitigation).</b> Assessments of policy effectiveness have included {{work by the}} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, International Energy Agency, and United Nations Environment Programme.

25|$|To create lasting <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>mitigation,</b> the {{replacement}} of high carbon emission intensity power sources, such as conventional fossil fuels—oil, coal and natural gas—with low-carbon power sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with {{the vast majority of}} our energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources. Both hydroelectricity and nuclear power together provide the majority of the generated low-carbon power fraction of global total power consumption.|$|E

40|$|Adaptation to <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and <b>mitigation</b> of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> are policy substitutes, as both {{reduce the}} impacts of <b>climate</b> <b>change.</b> Adaptation and <b>mitigation</b> should {{therefore}} be analysed together, as they indeed are, albeit in a rudimentary way, in cost-benefit analyses of emission abatement. However, adaptation and mitigation are done by different people operating at different spatial and temporal scales. This hampers analysis of the trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation. An exception is facilitative adaptation (enhancing adaptive capacity), which, like mitigation, requires long-term policies at macro level. Facilitative adaptation and mitigation not only both reduce impacts, but they also compete for resources. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|In August 2016, {{the local}} {{government}} of Prince Edward Island (PEI) with Dunsky Energy Consulting developed a 10-year strategy to reduce energy use, establish cleaner and locally produced energy sources, and moderate future energy prices. The Prince Edward Island Energy Strategy is aligned with Canada's energy policy, Provincial <b>Climate</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Mitigation</b> Recommendation. The PEI Energy Strategy was formed based on the recommendations from Dunsky Energy Consulting and extensive consultation with individuals, businesses, and organizations. This strategy was formed on three pillars: reducing greenhouse gas emissions; implementing cost-effective actions and decisions; and creating local economic opportunities.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{strategy}} {{that is based on}} risk is portfolio theory. This suggests that a reasonable response to uncertainty is to have a wide portfolio of possible responses. In the case of <b>climate</b> <b>change,</b> <b>mitigation</b> can be viewed as an effort to reduce the chance of climate change impacts (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.24). Adaptation acts as insurance against the chance that unfavourable impacts occur. The risk associated with these impacts can also be spread. As part of a policy portfolio, climate research can help when making future decisions. Technology research can help to lower future costs.|$|E
