5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

25|$|Rapid automatized naming: The {{ability to}} say quickly {{the names of}} letters, objects and colors predicts an individual's ability to read.

40|$|Single {{doses of}} phenobarbitone {{decreased}} the turnover rate of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) {{and increased the}} whole brain levels of 5 - hydroxytryptamine (5 -RT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Habituation to phenobarbitone increased the levels of DA in striata and midbrain and decreased that of <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres,</b> leaving the total amount unchanged. Habituation resisted the depletion otherwise caused by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-m. p. t.) in the striata for DA and in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres</b> for both DA and NA. Withdrawal of phenobarbitone decreased the levels of DA in the striata and both catecholamines in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> Withdrawal increased the depletion of DA in the striata and <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres</b> and that of NA in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres</b> and midbrain caused by alpha-m. p. t. Withdrawal convulsions increased the levels of DA in the striata and decreased it in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres,</b> leaving the total amount unchanged. NA was less in this group {{than it was in}} controls. Alpha-m. p. t. protected animals from convulsions. This group showed less DA in the striata and in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres</b> and less NA in midbrain. Habituation to phenobarbitone increased the levels of 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA. Withdraiwal returned both levels to control values. While withdrawal convulsions decreased the levels of 5 -HT, 5 -HIAA levels were increased. Single doses of phenytoin increased the levels of DA in striata and NA in midbrain. It also increased the l levels of 5 -HIAA in whole brain and decreased the depletion of 5 -HIAA caused by p-chlorophenylalanine (p-c. p. a.) or pargyline. Long term administration of phenytoin increa sed the levels of dopamine in the striata and the midbrain and decreased that of the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> It also produced an increase in the level s of NA in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> Similar effects were observed after alpha-m. p. t. Whole brain levels of 5 -HT and 5 - HIAA were increased after long term treatment with phentoin. Single doses of carbamazepine increased the levels of NA in the midbrain and decreased the depletion of 5 -HIAA after p-c. p. a. and pargyline. The long term treatment with carbamazepine increased the total brain levels of 5 - HT and 5 -HIAA and those of DA in the striata and <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres</b> and for NA in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres</b> and midbrain. The same effect was seen after alpha-m. p. t. While NA and GABA levels were decreased in the primary focal area oneweek after cobalt implantation, 5 -HIAA levels were increased. The same effect was seen for NA and 5 -HIAA levels two weeks after cobalt implantation...|$|R
25|$|The {{secondary}} neurons in each pathway decussate (cross {{the spinal}} cord or brainstem), because {{the spinal cord}} develops in segments. Decussated fibers later reach and connect these segments with the higher centers. The optic chiasm is {{the primary cause of}} decussation; nasal fibers of the optic nerve cross (so each <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemisphere</b> receives contralateral—opposite—vision) to keep the interneuronal connections responsible for processing information short. All sensory and motor pathways converge and diverge to the contralateral hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|In a 1976 {{published}} essay, the psychiatrists Colin Martindale, Nancy Hasenfus, and Dwight Hines (University of Maine) {{suggested that}} Hitler had {{suffered from a}} sub-function of the left hemisphere of the brain. They referred to the tremor of his left limbs, his tendency for leftward eye movements and the alleged missing of the left testicle. They believed that Hitler’s behavior was dominated by his right <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> a situation that resulted in symptoms such as a tendency to the irrational, auditory hallucinations, and uncontrolled outbursts. Martindale, Hasenfus and Hines even suspected that {{the dominance of the}} right hemisphere contributed to the two basic elements of Hitlers political ideology: antisemitism and Lebensraum ideology.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} varying states of visual {{deprivation}} {{on the development}} of the optic lobes and <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres</b> has been studied in the chick where the visual pathways are totally crossed over. Unilateral eye extirpation of the new hatched chick resulted in arrested development of the contralateral but not ipsilateral lobe, as measured by weight, protein content and acetylcholinesterase activity. Similar effects but of smaller magnitude were observed in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> Histologic and enzymic evidence revealed the absence of significant degeneration in the optic lobe contralateral to an eye removed 17 days previously. These results were observed in the optic lobes of operated animals maintained either in light of in darkness between 3 and 17 days after hatch. However, in the inpaired <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres,</b> differences could only be detected in birds kept the light. The effects of unilateral eyelid suturing {{on the development of}} chick brain regions were also examined. In this group, all asymmetrical differences observed within paired brain regions were totally light dependent and confined to the <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> The hemisphere contralateral to the sutured eye weighed less and had less acetylcholinesterase activity than its paired <b>hemisphere.</b> The <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres</b> of monocularly treated birds manifested effects of similar magnitude whether the treatment was enucleation or suturing. This suggests that the complete development of the associative centers in avian <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemispheres</b> is dependent on both intact innervation and on the information content of the visual input. © 1969...|$|R

25|$|The same {{situation}} is in evidence in everyday life, however, whenever attention is fixated {{with a question}} or an experience of the amazing, the unusual, or anything that holds a person's interest. At such moments people experience the common everyday trance; they tend to gaze {{off to the right}} or left, depending upon which <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemisphere</b> is most dominant (Baleen, 1969) and get that faraway or blank look. Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...|$|E
25|$|Rossi (1977) {{suggests}} that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may enable us to locate the archetypes in the right <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, {{and that of the}} right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, information processor while the right hemisphere operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that the right hemisphere is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in the right hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|Unihemispheric sleep {{refers to}} {{sleeping}} {{with only a}} single <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> The phenomenon has been observed in birds and aquatic mammals, {{as well as in}} several reptilian species (the latter being disputed: many reptiles behave in a way which could be construed as unihemispheric sleeping, but EEG studies have given contradictory results). Reasons for the development of unihemispheric sleep are likely that it enables the sleeping animal to receive stimuli—threats, for instance—from its environment, and that it enables the animal to fly or periodically surface to breathe when immersed in water. Only NREM sleep exists unihemispherically, and there seems to exist a continuum in unihemispheric sleep regarding the differences in the hemispheres: in animals exhibiting unihemispheric sleep, conditions range from one hemisphere being in deep sleep with the other hemisphere being awake to one hemisphere sleeping lightly with the other hemisphere being awake. If one hemisphere is selectively deprived of sleep in an animal exhibiting unihemispheric sleep (one hemisphere is allowed to sleep freely but the other is awoken whenever it falls asleep), the amount of deep sleep will selectively increase in the hemisphere that was deprived of sleep when both hemispheres are allowed to sleep freely.|$|E
25|$|Birds do not {{necessarily}} exhibit sleep debt, but a peculiarity that birds share with aquatic mammals, and possibly also with certain species of lizards (opinions differ about that last point), is the ability for unihemispheric sleep. That {{is the ability to}} sleep with one <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemisphere</b> at a time, while the other hemisphere is awake (Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep). When only one hemisphere is sleeping, only the contralateral eye will be shut; that is, when the right hemisphere is asleep the left eye will be shut, and vice versa. The distribution of sleep between the two hemispheres and the amount of unihemispheric sleep are determined both by which part of the brain has been the most active during the previous period of wake—that part will sleep the deepest—and it is also determined by the risk of attacks from predators. Ducks near the perimeter of the flock are likely to be the ones that first will detect predator attacks. These ducks have significantly more unihemispheric sleep than those who sleep {{in the middle of the}} flock, and they react to threatening stimuli seen by the open eye.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{bilateral}} symmetry the brain has a hippocampus in each <b>cerebral</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> If {{damage to the}} hippocampus occurs in only one hemisphere, leaving the structure intact in the other hemisphere, the brain can retain near-normal memory functioning. [...] Severe damage to the hippocampi in both hemispheres results in profound difficulties in forming new memories (anterograde amnesia) and often also affects memories formed before the damage occurred (retrograde amnesia). Although the retrograde effect normally extends many years back before the brain damage, in some cases older memories remain. This retention of older memories leads {{to the idea that}} consolidation over time involves the transfer of memories out of the hippocampus {{to other parts of the}} brain. Experiments using intrahippocampal transplantation of hippocampal cells in primates with neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus have shown that the hippocampus is required for the formation and recall, but not the storage, of memories.|$|E
