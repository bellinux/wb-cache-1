40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the integrated or programmatic approaches at both the European and national level, which are used {{as a tool to}} attain environmental quality standards. These approaches leave much room for flexibility with respect to the choice of measures to be adopted in order to achieve the quality standards. However, difficulties can arise while implementing the integrated or programmatic approach. Instruments or measures which are laid down in other relevant EU legislation can for instance restrict flexibility in the choice of measures. Furthermore, the polluter pays principle requires a fair allocation of costs in situations where multiple polluters have contributed to the pollution. In the Netherlands the principle of égalité devant les <b>charges</b> <b>publiques</b> applies. In principle, polluters will not have a right to compensation for the costs of environmental measures. However, in special circumstances, liability in damages based on a breach of égalité could be an issue. environmental quality standards; programmatic approach; air quality; the polluter pays principle; égalité devant les charges publiques; best available technique...|$|E

40|$|Flood risk {{management}} is an eminent {{example of a}} policy field in which the distribution of burdens and benefits takes place. Flood risks are distributed unequally among society and measures that reduce or prevent flood risks also distribute burdens and benefits. Flood {{risk management}} measures may infringe property rights that are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (art. 17 in conjunction with art. 52 (3) and European Convention on Human Rights (art. 1 First Protocol). The Charter and the Convention are a safety net for these infringements and form a basic demand of the domestic compensation regimes. The underlying principle of these European, but also domestic compensation regimes {{can be found in}} the French principle égalité devant les <b>charges</b> <b>publiques</b> [equality before public burdens]. A compensation regime can mitigate adverse effects of flood risk management. This paper scrutinises the domestic compensation regimes of the Netherlands, Flanders and France for loss caused by flood prevention and flood protection and flood recovery measures. It shows that burdens are unequally distributed, not only between the three jurisdictions, but also within the jurisdictions. It also shows that the égalité principle is not applied in a consistent way...|$|E
