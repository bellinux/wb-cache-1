40|$|Nowadays, {{functional}} additives {{represented by}} multiple classes of substances and compounds, including polymers of different origin, {{are available for}} introduction into dry mixtures based on gypsum binders. However, their impact onto the growth and formation of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> (CaSO∙ 2 HO) crystals generated {{in the course of}} hardening of gypsum binders is not quite clear. Therefore, the objective of the research was to analyze the processes of growth and formation of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> crystals caused by functional additives based on polymers of different origin. The analysis was composed of three stages. At the first stage, both pure and modified <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> crystals were synthesized. Super plasticizers based on sulfonated melamine-formaldehyde resin, methylcellulose (MC) and redispersible polymer powder based on copolymer of vinyl acetate, ethylene and vinyl chloride (VAEVC) were applied as additives. At the second stage, the objective was to identify the influence of polymer additives on the shape and size of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> crystals; therefore, an X-ray analysis of synthesized crystals was performed. Following the X-ray analysis data {{and with the help of}} a special software programme, possible combinations of simple forms of CaSO∙ 2 HO were simulated, and the habitus of generated crystals was also studied. At the third stage, the objective was to validate the models of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> crystals by means of an electron-microscopic analysis. The following conclusions were made upon completion of the research: A.

The presence of the super plasticizer based on sulfonated melamine-formaldehyde resin, methylcellulose and redispersible polymer powder based on a copolymer of vinyl acetate, ethylene and vinyl chloride, causes reduction of the size of crystals, while the crystals turn elongated. The crystal-to-crystal contact area increases; therefore, it is likely that the strength of the hardening agent goes up. B.

Twenty-four mice (Rattus norvegicus) received subcutaneously polyethylene tubes filled with Portland cement clinker with or without 2 % or 5 % <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> and MTA. After 15, 30 and 60 days of implantation, the animals were killed and specimens were prepared for microscopic analysis. For evaluation of the setting time, each material was analyzed using Gilmore needles weighing 113. 5 g and 456. 5 g, according to the ASTM specification Number C 266 - 08 guideline. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test for setting time and Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn test for biocompatibility at 5 % significance level. Histologic observation showed {{no statistically significant difference}} of biocompatibility (p> 0. 05) among the materials in the subcutaneous tissues. For the setting time, clinker without <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> showed the shortest initial and final setting times (6. 18 s/ 21. 48 s), followed by clinker with 2 % <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> (9. 22 s/ 25. 33 s), clinker with 5 % <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> (10. 06 s/ 42. 46 s) and MTA (15. 01 s/ 42. 46 s). All the tested materials showed biocompatibility and the <b>calcium</b> <b>sulfate</b> absence shortened the initial and final setting times of the white Portland cement clinke...|$|R
