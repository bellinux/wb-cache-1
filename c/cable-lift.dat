5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and sugar substitute (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and zoom lens (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the cordless telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and camcorder, among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented <b>cable-lift</b> elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time phased array imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of the tractor beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just, are also NYU alumni.|$|E
50|$|James Wood, {{fabricated}} {{the steel}} cables for the Brooklyn Bridge, making <b>cable-lift</b> elevators possible. He {{also contributed to}} the inventions of lockmaking, submarine, A/C generator, electric motors, transformer and the design of the modern refrigerator. He held 240 patents.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} {{scheduled}} to be closed for replacement starting in early 2013, but problems with the temporary <b>cable-lift</b> draw bridge have delayed the project significantly. (On June 3, 2013 a hinge failed on the temporary draw span during what {{was supposed to have been}} final testing.) The temporary bridge was finally opened on Nov. 9, 2013, and the 1912 span is likely now closed permanently. (On Nov. 12 2013 the temporary bridge was stuck in the open position for many hours, so it is unclear if the 1912 bridge is truly ready for demolition.) ...|$|E
50|$|James J. Wood was an {{engineer}} {{who contributed to}} the development of lockmaking, the development of the submarine, the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, and the design of the modern refrigerator. He fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge, the first suspension bridge. These same cables changed the skylines of every major city by making <b>cable-lift</b> elevators possible. He also designed the electric’s of the internal combustion engine for John Holland’s submarine and the first modern refrigerator. Some of his innovations {{can be found in the}} A/C generator, electric motors, and transformer. He held over 240 patents. He graduated from the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute as a mechanical engineer.|$|E
5000|$|Large, multi-ton mining shovels {{still use}} the <b>cable-lift</b> shovel arrangement. In the 1950s and 1960s Marion Shovel built massive {{stripping}} shovels for coal {{operations in the}} Eastern US. Shovels of note were the Marion 360, the Marion 5900, and the largest shovel ever built, Marion 6360 The Captain [...] - [...] with a [...] bucket [...] - [...] while Bucyrus constructed {{one of the most}} famous monsters: the Big Brutus, the largest still in existence. The GEM of Egypt (GEM standing for [...] "Giant Excavating Machine" [...] and Egypt referring to the Egypt Valley in Belmont County, eastern Ohio where it was first put to use), which operated from 1967 to 1988, was of comparable size; it has since been dismantled. Although these big machines are still called steam shovels, they are more correctly known as power shovels since they use electricity to wind their winches.|$|E
50|$|The {{school has}} been {{affiliated}} with some major inventions and innovations including: the Panama Canal locks; lockmaking; the Brooklyn Bridge cables; <b>cable-lift</b> elevators; cordless phones; ATM machines; bar codes; laser; radar; penicillin; polymers; elevator brakes; lightweight, ultra durable automotive brake rotor; light beer; cardiac defibrillator; artificial cardiac pacemaker; RFID; contact lenses; zoom lens; first telephone handset; commercial television; non-stick coating as an application of Teflon; suspension system for the largest radio telescope; microwave technology; Apollo Lunar Module, the first, and to date only, manned spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space; X-ray crystallography; structure of the DNA molecule; submarine; modern refrigerator; A/C generator; electric motors; transformer; submarine communications facilities; development of the artificial sweetener aspartame; development of nontoxic processes to create food colorings and remove caffeine from coffee; the quasi-complementary (transistor) amplifier circuit; lateral transistor; the wireless microphone; as well as Eugene Kleiner’s first semiconductor (and much of the Silicon Valley), and Spencer Trask's investing and supporting of Thomas Edison's invention of the electric light bulb.|$|E
