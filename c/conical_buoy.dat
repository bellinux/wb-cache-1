50|$|The channel {{over the}} bar and into the harbour changes {{from time to time}} {{although}} the established buoyage system on the channel can usually be relied on to stay constant. A look out should be made for temporary pellet buoys and beacons to show changes in the channel. 175 degrees in from the leading buoy is a large <b>conical</b> <b>buoy</b> Number 1 flashing green and the large red Number 2, can buoy flashing red on the bar itself are both visible in most weather conditions. It is advisable to make good a course between these buoys until the smaller buoys of the channel become visible, after which it is better to favour the starboard side because there is a considerable east going tidal stream across the harbour entrance from approximately two hours before every high water. From the starboard buoy No.9 known as the 'Knock', the channel bends away towards the South East into considerably quieter waters. The wide sweep to the eastward just past the lifeboat house must be made with the red beacons close to port as the channel is quite narrow at this point. On passing the green buoy named the 'Pool', turn to the South West and follow the buoys to the last red can buoy (Number 14) then arc back Easterly close to the marsh edge and follow the red beacons to the Quayside.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the impact of {{vertical}} slamming on floating point absorber systems and the associated pressures that might be expected when these phenomena occur. In a first part it will be shown how the occurrence probability of slamming can be reduced by implementing a slamming restriction, i. e. by controlling the motion of the point absorber. The impact of these slamming restrictions on power absorption will be discussed. Secondly an investigation is made of the pressures that occur when the buoys are subject to vertical bottom slamming. Analytical results are presented, which give a pressure prediction of an impacting body with conical and hemispherical shape, using Wagner theory. Laboratory experiments have been carried out at Ghent University. Impact pressures were measured during drop tests with both hemispherical and <b>conical</b> <b>buoy</b> shapes. These pressures were measured by ICP pressure sensors with a range LIP to 345 kPa with small membrane and very high resonance frequency (> 250 kHz). Analytical and physical results are compared and conclusions are drawn...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} meet future energy demand, a more {{sustainable}} energy society is essential because fossil fuel reserves are depleting while the total energy consumption worldwide increases. One type of renewable energy which {{can play a role}} is ocean energy having the theoretical potential to exceed both current and future human energy needs. This study researches the feasibility of a hybrid system using two sources of ocean energy, namely offshore wind and wave energy. It is concluded that a single horizontal floating wind turbine sharing a foundation with a wave energy converter is most interesting to research. The main {{reason for this is that}} offshore wind energy is still limited to relative shallow depths and thus only limited locations are suitable. At further depths, floating foundations become more important. By sharing the mooring system, electrical infrastructure and other structure components with a wave energy converter, costs can be reduced while increasing energy yield in comparison to two separate systems. A classification of existing concepts within the same category is made. By comparing these different concepts based on platform motions and energy production, it is chosen to look into the combination of a WindFloat with a buoy point absorber. Motivation for this combination is the technical stage at which the WindFloat currently is. In addition, it has good overall stability and minimal heave motions which were found through numerical simulations in the time domain when comparing different floating wind turbines under similar wind and wave conditions using state of art software. Furthermore, a point absorber is used since minimal changes would be necessary to the WindFloat platform. In addition, the power take off system can be placed outside the water making contingent operation and maintenance easier to fulfill. The point absorber is modeled as a mass spring damper system with a power take off system relative to both a fixed and a floating platform. For both cases it is concluded that the relative heave oscillation between the WEC and platform should be maximized and thus the natural frequency of the system should match the peak frequency of the sea state. The steady state behavior of the hybrid system is investigated in eight sea states, which is modeled using the JONSWAP wave spectrum. Different buoy shapes are investigated which eventually leads to an optimal <b>conical</b> shaped <b>buoy</b> with a diameter of 5 meter. Hydrodynamic parameters of this buoy are found in literature and validated using state of art software. The power production of the WindFloat is found by introducing aerodynamic theory coupled to a wind wave relationship based on the Sverdrup-Munk-Bretschneider nomogram. Now that both response and power production of both subsystems are known they are coupled to see its effect. The wave energy converter will have no effect on the WindFloat motions due to the relatively low forces interacting between the power take off system and the platform. It can be concluded that the coupling results in a very low impact of wave energy on the total increase in energy production. Absorbed wave energy is between 0. 75 and 73. 07 [kW] which is in terms of contribution is respectively 0. 07 and 1. 44 [%]. Increasing the buoy size up to 25 meter shows the potential of wave energy contribution which can go up to 10. 7 [%] for strong wave environment.
