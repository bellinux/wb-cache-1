500|$|Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, in {{reference}} to Hannah Montana, commented, [...] "Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing." [...] Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma, commenting that she portrayed superstar authority, but failed because she was {{unable or unwilling to}} [...] "give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means. For all its eye-popping detail, the concert offered nothing that viewers of her TV show or buyers of her records don't already know about her." [...] Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated, [...] "Cyrus' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today. She's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch, but her show's choreography barely provides a moment for her to <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and she's still able to deliver." [...] Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert, praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults. He continued, [...] "Good as the best songs are, though, they take a backseat to the staging [...] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change. It's a tacky moment and doesn't reflect the attention to detail that makes the rest of it a laugh-out-loud delight." [...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said, [...] "Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience." [...] Loewenstein deemed the concert a mission accomplished because of inevitable hits and Cyrus' charisma, drive, spunk, and a merely-limited vocal range. Erik Ensrst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised the show, stating that it was [...] "a pure visual spectacle", but commented that producers forgot a place for Cyrus' personality.|$|E

60|$|A sudden wave of scarlet {{swept over}} Eliza's face. She rose quickly to her feet, with an impetuous gesture {{that made her}} visitor <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E

60|$|I {{gave her}} a look that made <b>her</b> <b>catch</b> <b>'er</b> <b>breath,</b> and I was just {{stepping}} through the wicket, when she laid hold of my coat and tried to hold me back.|$|R
6000|$|He didn't say so then--even {{with the}} {{opportunity}} given him of her stopping once more to <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> He said instead: [...] "Oh, my dear--oh, oh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor Nelly was sadly frightened; {{but before}} she could <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to ask what was to happen, the King said, in a loud voice, [...] "Remember!" [...] and let her drop.|$|E
60|$|Once {{free of the}} Emerald City the Sawhorse dashed away at {{tremendous}} speed. Indeed, he went so {{fast that}} Aunt Em had hard work to <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and Uncle Henry held fast to {{the seat of the}} red wagon.|$|E
60|$|The callousness {{with which}} Christy names the reprobate jars {{on the moral}} sense of the family. Uncle William shakes his head slowly and repeatedly. Mrs. Titus <b>catches</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> convulsively through <b>her</b> nose. Her husband speaks.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him quickly. There was a little <b>catch</b> in <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R

6000|$|His {{answer was}} a chirp which sent Marc half-way {{to the gate}} before Bettie could <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> The reins {{stiffened}} in his hands. Bettie clung to him, shrieking at every turn in the road. [...] "Milton Jennings, if you tip us over, I'll"---- ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned the}} small oval plate {{over in her}} lap, with its face down, and I thought I saw her <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> a little, {{as if she had}} had a strain or an escape. This however did not prevent her saying in a moment, [...] "You would buy a {{likeness}} of a person you don't know, by an artist who has no reputation?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then all the {{strength}} seemed {{to leave the}} girl. Moving shakily, with her hand on Eveline Annersly's arm, she turned towards the house, as the pearly greyness crept into the eastern sky. Eveline Annersly said nothing, for she could feel that her companion was trembling, and hear her <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> Carrie stopped {{when they reached the}} homestead, and looked eastward with tear-dimmed eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{it really}} true," [...] she asked, {{with a quick}} pant and a <b>catch</b> of <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] "that Mr. Dimsdale is engaged to be married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Carrie laughed softly, with {{a little}} <b>catch</b> of <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "Bend your head a little, Charley," [...] she said, [...] "I have {{something}} to tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped with}} a quick <b>catch</b> in <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and the {{darkness}} round them seemed to become luminous with the light of hope that broke upon him within.|$|R
60|$|All three {{got into}} the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins, though Jim needed no {{guidance}} of any sort. The horse was still smarting from the sharp claws of the invisible bears, {{and as soon as}} he was on land and headed toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsome creatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along in a way that made Dorothy <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hard riding was not {{possible}} on this ridge crest, a fact that gave Helen time to <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> At length, coming out upon the very summit of the mountain, Dale heard the hound. Helen's eyes feasted afar upon a wild scene of rugged grandeur, before she looked down on this western slope at her feet to see bare, gradual descent, leading down to sparsely wooded bench and on to deep-green canuon.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon she's your brother's {{best friend}} out here." [...] Madeline {{kept pace with}} the cowboy {{for a few moments}} longer, and then she stopped. It was as much from {{necessity}} to <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> as it was from recurring fear. All at once she realized what little use her training had been for such an experience as this. The cowboy, missing her, came back the few intervening steps. Then he waited, still silent, looming beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--I didn't {{think it}} was you! I didn't--Oh, Jude!" [...] A hysterical <b>catch</b> in <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> ended in a {{succession}} of them. He advanced, but she quickly recovered and went back.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was shocked}} to hear of your accident, but it was some time ago, and you are recovering," [...] she remarked, trying to speak hopefully, but with a <b>catch</b> in <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|Eustacia made {{no reply}} {{beyond that of}} a slight <b>catch</b> in <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> as of one who fain would speak but could not; and Humphrey, declining her {{invitation}} to come in, went away.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain, {{springing}} up: [...] "I knew it! I {{knew that}} it was this Christmas giving that was making you morbid again. Can't you shake it off and be cheerful--like me? I'm sure I have to bear twice {{as much of it as}} you have. I've been shopping the whole week, and you've been just this one afternoon." [...] She begins to <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and fails in searching for her handkerchief in the folds of her dress under the bath-robe.|$|E
60|$|This little speech {{had cost}} the blunt bowman much pains and planning; {{but he might}} have spared his breath, for the lady was quite as much absorbed as her lord in the letter, which they held between them, a hand on either corner, {{spelling}} it out very slowly, with drawn brows and muttering lips. As they read it, Alleyne, who stood with Hordle John a few paces back from their comrade, saw the lady <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> while the knight laughed softly to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{pursued the}} girl, {{in the same}} dreary monotone, [...] "he thinks I couldn't {{appreciate}} {{him because he was}} old. He thinks that I cared for his not being handsome! Perhaps--perhaps----" [...] She began to <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> in the effort to keep back the sobs that were coming. [...] "Oh, I can't bear it! I would rather die than let him think it--such a thing as that!" [...] She bent her head aside, and cried upon the two hands with which she clutched the top of her chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "You rammucky lurden," [...] she was howling, with a blow {{between each}} <b>catch</b> of <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] "you shammocking, yaping, over-long good-for-nought. I will teach thee! I will baste thee! Aye, by my faith!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she said, with {{a little}} <b>catch</b> of <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] "is there {{no such thing as}} oblivion? Is there a place in the world that is not haunted? I am cursed with memory." ...|$|R
6000|$|When he ceased speaking, {{the girl}} came to {{herself with a}} <b>catch</b> of <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> He heard <b>her</b> voice, the varied charm of which he thought he knew so well, saying with an {{unfamiliar}} intonation: ...|$|R
60|$|As {{she opened}} the door, {{a puff of smoke}} made her <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> then run to throw open the window before she turned to look for the fallen brand. A fire had been kindled in this room a short time before, and, to Abby's dismay, the sudden draught fanned the {{smouldering}} sparks which had crept from a fallen log to the mop-board and thence around the wooden mantel-piece. A suspicious crackling was heard, little tongues of flame darted from the cracks, and the air was full of smoke.|$|E
60|$|She {{was awakened}} by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed {{she might have been}} hurt. As it was, the jar made her <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright {{sunshine}} came in at the window, flooding the little room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.|$|E
6000|$|Disappointed is {{not just}} the word, for the ladies did not really expect him to do what he said. They pretended to believe him when he promised, but at the bottom of their hearts they never did or could. He was gentle-mannered and soft-spoken, and when he set his head on one side, and said that a coat would be ready on Wednesday, or a dress on Saturday, and {{repeated}} his promise upon the same lady's expressed doubt, she would <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and say that now she absolutely must have it on the day named, for otherwise she would not have a thing to put on. Then he would become very grave, and his soft tenor would deepen to a bass of unimpeachable veracity, and he would say, [...] "Sure, lady, you have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She hesitated with a <b>catch</b> of <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "Reggie," [...] she said, [...] "do {{you suppose}} that, {{even if you}} had courage enough to suggest it, {{anything}} would induce me to leave my husband because--you--asked me to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean?" [...] she cried, a <b>catch</b> in <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> Had she guessed--as I, without {{sight of}} her face, had guessed--what was to follow? My gorge was rising fast. I clenched my hands, and by an effort I {{restrained}} myself to learn that I had guessed aright.|$|R
