5|$|A revival can be {{identified}} by {{the dedication of the}} first new monument in a <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with Caracol in Belize. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the acropolis, including the building of the site's first ballcourt.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of his}} favourites, Hazlitt places Cymbeline {{first in}} his discussions of Shakespeare's plays, {{according}} it extensive treatment. This includes his personal impressions of individual characters—as the book's title would lead us to expect—but also the kind of broader consideration for which {{he would not be}} credited for at least a <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b>|$|E

5|$|For over a <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> Montreal was the {{industrial}} and financial centre of Canada. This legacy {{has left a}} variety of buildings including factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries, that today provide an invaluable insight into the city's history, especially {{in the downtown area}} and the Old Port area. There are 50 National Historic Sites of Canada, more than any other city.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{outdated}} {{but remained}} {{vital to the}} defense of Kamianets and nearby trade routes; as a result, the voivode of Kraków, Spytek of Melsztyn, began modernizing the complex {{at the turn of the}} 15th century. During the reconstruction, the old towers were renovated and ten new towers were added. A <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> later, the castle was updated again, this time by military engineer and architect , who built the New Western and Eastern Towers, the castle's eastern wall and an underground gallery, as well as the Full Gates and housing for the town's starosta community.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, roads in the region deteriorated. Only the Via Sclavonica is known to have existed in the region by year 1030. It was an eastwest route {{spanning}} from Pazin to Poreč. Road transport in the region lost significance after the peninsula was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice. From 18091813, the TriestePula route was rebuilt by the First French Empire, after the French captured the entire region from Venice and the Habsburgs. Upgrades to the regional road network continued after the Austrian Empire acquired Istria at the 18141815 Congress of Vienna. By 1830, the road network in Istria had expanded to a degree that would not change for a <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> The only significant improvement of region's roads was paving of the TriestePula road in 1930s.|$|E
50|$|The County of Novellara and Bagnolo (Italian: Contea di Novellara e Bagnolo) was an {{independent}} state which existed in Northern Italy from 1371 to 1728.

60|$|Let us trust, then, that, {{in spite}} of the prophecies of De Pauw, and the doubts of Mr. Thornton, there is a {{reasonable}} hope of the redemption of a race of men, who, whatever may be the errors of their religion and policy, have been amply punished by three <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of captivity.|$|R
50|$|After Bularchus we {{encounter}} a gap of upwards of two <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{in the history}} of Greek painting. It appears, however, that it was practised on the island of Rhodes, at the time of Anacreon, who lived about 600 years before Christ. That poet, in his twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth Odes, mentions the practice of encaustic painting.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} textual {{reference to}} the hoodening tradition comes from {{the first half of}} the eighteenth century. A number of scattered references to it appeared over the next <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> many of which considered it to be a declining tradition that had become extinct in many parts of Kent. Aware of this decline, in the early twentieth century the folklorist and historian Percy Maylam documented what survived of the tradition and traced its appearances in historical documents, publishing his findings as The Hooden Horse in 1909. Although deemed extinct at the time of the First World War, the custom was revived in an altered form during the mid-twentieth century, when the use of the hooden horse was incorporated into a number of modern Kentish folk traditions.|$|E
5|$|Yamhad was {{an ancient}} Semitic kingdom {{centered}} on Ḥalab (Aleppo), Syria. The kingdom emerged {{at the end}} of the 19th century BC, and was ruled by the Yamhadite dynasty kings, who counted on both military and diplomacy to expand their realm. From the beginning of its establishment, the kingdom withstood the aggressions of its neighbors Mari, Qatna and Assyria, and was turned into the most powerful Syrian kingdom of its era through the actions of its king Yarim-Lim I. By the middle of the 18th century BC, most of Syria minus the south came under the authority of Yamhad, either as a direct possession or through vassalage, and for nearly a <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> Yamhad dominated northern, northwestern and eastern Syria, and had influence over small kingdoms in Mesopotamia at the borders of Elam. The kingdom was eventually destroyed by the Hittites, then annexed by Mitanni in the 16th centuryBC.|$|E
5|$|In the 11th century, the earls of Orkney were at {{the height}} of their power. The Earl of Orkney, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, also ruled Caithness and Sutherland, and seems to have {{controlled}} the western seaboard of Scotland, and the Hebrides. Historian Magnús Stefánsson described the political situation of the Hebrides and the Isle of Man during the 11th and early 12th century as being unstable, and suffering from the rivalries of petty kings and chieftains. In 1079, the Hebridean warlord Gofraidh Crobhán was able to unite the Hebrides and the Isle of Man into an effective independent kingdom. In 10989, the Norwegian king Magnús Óláfsson invaded the Hebrides, and asserted his right over the islands; he did so again in 11023. He is thought to have planned to unite Orkney, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Mann, under the control of his son. In 1103, Magnús was slain in Ireland, and no Norwegian king set foot in the islands for over a <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> With Magnús' death, the Outer Hebrides were brought back {{under the control of the}} Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, whose kings tactfully recognised Norwegian sovereignty. In 1156, the kingdom was partitioned following an inconclusive sea battle between the warlord Somhairle mac Gille Brighde, and the Manx king Gofraidh mac Amhlaibh: the Outer Hebrides remained under the control of Gofraidh, but the Inner Hebrides were ruled separately by Somhairle. Two years later, Somhairle successfully invaded the Isle of Man, took the throne, and ruled the entire Kingdom of Mann and the Isles until his death in 1164.|$|E
60|$|Two <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{have passed}} away since Battell told his {{stories about the}} 'greater' and the 'lesser monsters' to Purchas, and it has taken nearly that time {{to arrive at the}} clear result that there are four {{distinct}} kinds of Anthropoids--in Eastern Asia, the Gibbons and the Orangs; in Western Africa, the Chimpanzees and the Gorilla.|$|R
50|$|Ibn Battuta, <b>a</b> famous {{traveler}} <b>and</b> <b>an</b> authentic historian, {{visited the}} Kingdom of Granada in 1350. He {{described it as}} <b>a</b> powerful <b>and</b> self-sufficient kingdom in its own right, although frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the Kingdom of Castile. If {{it was really a}} vassal state, it was contrary to the policy of the Reconquista to allow it to flourish for almost two <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> after the fall of Sevilla in 1248.|$|R

5000|$|An {{article in}} the New England Magazine in December 1889 {{entitled}} [...] "Two <b>Centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Half</b> in Guilford, Connecticut" [...] mentioned that, [...] "Between 1727 and 1752 Mr. Sam.

But I assure you it relates entirely to events and persons removed to the distance of two <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> I have experienced too much evil from the violent unsettlement {{of the country in}} which I was born, to be a rash labourer in the work of innovation in that of my ancestors." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, there {{occurred}} two major changes of international orders which followed respectively {{the end of}} <b>a</b> colonialism <b>and</b> {{the beginning of a}} collective security system. Colonialism remained the basis of European expansion and domination for more than four <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> until the middle of the twentieth century, when it was put to an end. Collective security was first institutionalized by the League of Nations and then succeeded and developed by the United Nations.

50|$|In the {{eleventh}} century Pope Nicholas II, who in 1060 had tried to abolish the Mozarabic Rite, wished also to attack the Ambrosian, and was aided by St. Peter Damian, but he was unsuccessful, and Pope Alexander II, his successor, himself a Milanese, reversed his policy in this respect. St. Gregory VII made another attempt, and Le Brun (Explication de la Messe, III, art. I, § 8) conjectures that Landulf's miraculous narrative was written with a purpose about that time. Having weathered these storms, the Ambrosian Rite had peace for some three <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "As {{they are}} now universally allowed to be spurious, it will be {{unnecessary}} to state at length the grounds of their condemnation. It is sufficient {{to say that the}} letters are inane and unworthy throughout; that the style of either correspondent is unlike his genuine writings; that the relations between the two, as there represented, are highly improbable; and lastly, that the chronological notices (which however are absent in some important MSS) are wrong in almost every instance. Thus, independently of the unbroken silence of three <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> about this correspondence, internal evidence alone is sufficient to condemn them hopelessly." ...|$|R

60|$|We {{have some}} history {{north of the}} Bay. Nearly three <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> ago, that doughty pirate and explorer, Sir Francis Drake, combing the Pacific for Spanish galleons, {{anchored}} in the bight formed by Point Reyes, on which to-day {{is one of the}} richest dairy regions in the world. Here, less than two decades after Drake, Sebastien Carmenon piled up on the rocks with a silk-laden galleon from the Philippines. And in this same bay of Drake, long afterward, the Russian fur-poachers rendezvous'd their bidarkas and stole in through the Golden Gate to the forbidden waters of San Francisco Bay.|$|R
5000|$|James Wilton Brooks {{writes in}} History of the Court of common pleas {{of the city}} and county of New York (1896) that:The Court of Common Pleas, founded in 1686, in the City of New York, {{extended}} in 1691 throughout the State, restricted again in 1846 to the City of New York, and finally, in accordance with the amended State Constitution of 1894, passing out of existence on the thirty-first of December, 1895, was the oldest judicial tribunal in the state of New York. It succeeded [...] "The Worshipful Court of the Schout, Burgomasters and Schepens", which was established in 1653 and may thus be said to have had a continuous existence of nearly two <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b>|$|R
60|$|This plot got rid of, and Sir Walter Raleigh safely shut {{up in the}} Tower, his Sowship held a great {{dispute with}} the Puritans on their {{presenting}} a petition to him, and had it all his own way--not so very wonderful, as he would talk continually, and would not hear anybody else--and filled the Bishops with admiration. It was comfortably settled that {{there was to be}} only one form of religion, and that all men were to think exactly alike. But, although this was arranged two <b>centuries</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> ago, <b>and</b> although the arrangement was supported by much fining and imprisonment, I do not find that it is quite successful, even yet.|$|R
