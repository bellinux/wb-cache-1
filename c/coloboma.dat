Tests should also include those for thyroidism and clearances for other known eye diseases like colobomas, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal folds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} sign of CEA is the {{presence}} of an area of undeveloped choroid (appearing as a pale spot) lateral to the optic disc. [...] The choroid is a collection of blood vessels supplying the retina. [...] CEA can also cause retinal or scleral <b>coloboma,</b> <b>coloboma</b> of the optic disc, retinal detachment, or intraocular hemorrhage.

40|$|The PAX 2 gene is mutated in {{patients}} with ocular <b>colobomas,</b> vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and kidney anomalies (renal-coloboma syndrome, OMIM 120330). The three abnormalities which make up this syndrome also occur in isolation, but the causal genes are not known. PAX 2 encodes a transcription factor of the paired box class of DNA binding proteins, important {{for the development of}} the urogenital tract, optic nerve and adjacent retina, inner ear, and CNS. In this paper we have investigated the prevalence of PAX 2 mutations {{in patients}} with ocular <b>colobomas,</b> microphthalmos, or retinal anomalies, either in isolation or with associated urogenital anomalies. Using PCR-SSCP, most or all exons of PAX 2 were examined in blood DNA from 99 patients who have either ocular anomalies alone or a combination of ocular and urogenital conditions. PAX 2 mutations were not detected {{in patients with}} ocular <b>colobomas,</b> either in isolation or with associated abnormalities, except in one patient with typical renal-coloboma syndrome. We conclude that PAX 2 mutations are unlikely to be common in patients with ocular <b>colobomas</b> in isolation or in patients with ocular <b>colobomas</b> and associated anomalies, except for patients with typical renal-coloboma syndrome where PAX 2 is known to be the aetiological cause. status: publishe...|$|R
2500|$|CEA {{is caused}} by {{improper}} development of the eye. [...] Failure of {{the cells of the}} posterior portion of the optic vesicles to express growth hormone affects the differentiation of other cells of the eye. [...] The choroid, especially lateral to the optic disc, is hypoplastic (underdeveloped). [...] A <b>coloboma,</b> or hole, may form in or near the optic disc due to a failed closure of embryonic tissue. [...] The degree of these abnormalities varies between individual dogs, and even between the same dog's eyes. [...] CEA is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait that has a penetrance reaching 100 percent, and has been localized to canine chromosome 37.|$|E

50|$|A <b>coloboma</b> (from the Greek koloboma, meaning defect) is {{a hole in}} one of the {{structures}} of the eye, such as the iris, retina, choroid, or optic disc.

The classical description in medical literature is of a key-hole shaped defect. A <b>coloboma</b> can occur in one eye (unilateral) or both eyes (bilateral).

40|$|Purpose: In colobomatous eyes, {{the risk}} of retinal {{detachment}} increases with age. This study elucidates the anatomic conditions and pathologic process of retinal detachment associated with <b>colobomas.</b> Methods: The records, including histologic slides, of 14 children (1 day to 17 months old) and 7 adults (17 to 78 years old) with <b>colobomas</b> were examined. Results: In children, <b>colobomas</b> were associated with lethal malformations. The extracolobomatous inner retinal layers extended centrally, forming the intercalary membrane. Duplication of the outer retinal layers and a horizontal shift of Müllerian glia created a triangle and a locus minoris resistentiae adjacent to the laterally displaced pigment epithelium. Part of the locus was an incomplete layer of photoreceptors excluding Müllerian glia. In adults, atrophy of the intercalary membrane, manifested as central schisis, thinning of the neuroepithelium, and hole formation, was related to a paucity of blood vessels within and underneath the intercalary membrane {{and the size of}} <b>colobomas.</b> The margins featured blood vessels, pigment epithelial hypertrophy, and choroidal and scleral thickening in a compact, intertwined arrangement. Conclusions: Glial atrophy, schisis, and hole formation in the intercalary membrane and separation of the locus minoris resistentiae from the pigment epithelium can disrupt barriers to fluid flow and set the stage for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. That process is exacerbated by scleral ectasia, increasing vitreous traction at the margin, and retinovascular ischemia within the intercalary membrane. A vascularized, compact margin resembling a laser barrier, found predominantly in adults, may protect against retinal detachment. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc 2005; 103 : 457 - 47...|$|R

The optic disc originates from the optic cup when the optic vesicle invaginates and forms an embryonic fissure (or groove).
