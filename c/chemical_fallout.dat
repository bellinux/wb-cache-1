50|$|Following {{a breakup}} with her fiancé, Michelle leaves New Orleans. Driving through rural Louisiana that night, she hears radio news reports of blackouts in major cities. Distracted by her phone, her car is {{suddenly}} struck and rolls off the road. She awakes chained {{to a wall}} in a concrete room. A man named Howard unlocks the door and says {{he is going to}} keep her alive. After she unsuccessfully tries to ambush him, he explains that he saved her life by bringing her to his underground bunker because there has been a massive attack − possibly by Russians, North Koreans, or Martians − and everyone is dead. He tells a doubtful Michelle that she cannot leave because the nuclear or <b>chemical</b> <b>fallout</b> has poisoned the air for one or two years.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The Gulf War {{oil well}} fires lasted over eight months in 1991. The {{subsequent}} environmental contamination has had real, yet poorly documented impacts, on Kuwait health. The <b>chemical</b> <b>fallout</b> {{from the war}} makes it a unique case study of conflict, environmental degradation and health. The life course approach serves as the conceptual basis for this dissertation. By developing a modified ethnographic approach suitable for Kuwait, I was able to collect and procure qualitative and quantitative data in a site-specific, systematic manner. From the cancer registry data, we notice a significant shift in breast cancer rates which began around 1999, increases 7 - 10 additional cases/ 100, 000, and continues until present. Leukemia and thyroid cancers are also increasing more rapidly than in other Arab countries not affected by the war. From the clinical case-control study, we identified an association between stress {{and the appearance of}} breast cancer in Kuwaiti women. Also, women who self-identified as trauma victims {{were more likely to have}} breast cancer than healthy women. From the qualitative study, we learn about the environmental health community's concerns around breast cancer. One woman stated that "it's like the flu [...] . every family has it. " Since the late 1990 s breast cancer has become a common occurrence in Kuwaiti households. Many of the participants felt that their voices had not been heard by the government. In fact, they felt that the government was actively downplaying the role of the residual Gulf War pollution on the development of cancer in Kuwait. It is suggested that the government carry out further monitoring and surveillance of leukemia and breast cancer in Kuwait in addition to executing a full clean-up of the Kuwaiti desert...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} unpack {{the nature of}} ecology within architecture, not as a neutral science, but a legitimizing construct, {{building}} a future and transforming the ethics of the present towards very deliberate ideological ends, and contingent on certain practices of alienation which themselves have historically {{laid the groundwork for}} later environmental and social crisis. The thesis asks the question, what do we mean when we call an architecture ecological, and what sort of reality are we advocating within that practice. The project is not staged explicitly as a critique of ecology, but rather a challenge to the overwhelming neutrality with which the ecological project is entertained within architectural discourses, under the premise that an ecological awareness must first entail an awareness of the means by which ecology constructs unreal realities in order to work for us. The project takes place in Almeria Spain, which in the last forty-five years has gone from the poorest region in Spain to one of the richest, through the wide scale application of greenhouse urbanism. Almeria is currently the largest intensive agriculture site in the world (80, 000 acres) and supplies the majority of winter produce to Europe. But Almeria is also, in many ways, an accelerated microcosm of larger contemporary ecological paradigms, what Keller Easterling called an autonomous world, Almeria is a place in which the apparent neutrality of ecological ideologies are consistently leveraged towards technological transformations of the landscape precipitating widespread environmental and social fallout conditions. In Almeria, Ecological ideologies consistently serve as the legitimizing platforms by which transformation after transformation (each promising an ideal future) compound the effects of peripheral disaster all under the guise of a seemingly neutral science. The thesis argues that within a condition in which neutral ecology is leveraged to legitimize specific ideological and economic positions, it may actually be the task of an ecological architecture to irrigate radical alternatives, not as ideal futures, but as provisional presents, alternate ecological life rafts within contested environmental conditions. This thesis proposes one such alternate present. It interjects itself within the most recent technoecological shift from chemically applied agricultural practices which are rapidly being replaced with the promise of a genetically engineered future, a 'clean' Almeria in the wake of widespread <b>chemical</b> <b>fallout.</b> The alternative is formed from a seemingly simple question, what if we merely doubt that Almeria's genetic turn won't precipitate alternate forms of fallout equal to its chemically contested state. by Curtis Roth.

50|$|A surface burst generates {{large amounts}} of {{particulate}} matter, composed of particles from less than 100 nm to several millimeters in diameter—in addition to very fine particles that contribute to worldwide fallout. The larger particles spill out of the stem and cascade down {{the outside of the}} fireball in a downdraft even as the cloud rises, so fallout begins to arrive near ground zero within an hour. More than half the total bomb debris lands on the ground within about 24 hours as local <b>fallout.</b> <b>Chemical</b> properties of the elements in the fallout control the rate at which they are deposited on the ground. Less volatile elements deposit first.|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the results of}} the environmental protection program at Argonne National Laboratory-East (ANL) for 1994. To evaluate the effects of ANL operations on the environment, samples of environmental media collected on the site, at the site boundary, and off the ANL site were analyzed and compared to applicable guidelines and standards. A variety of radionuclides was measured in air, surface water, groundwater, soil, grass, and bottom sediment samples. In addition, chemical constituents in surface water, groundwater, and ANL effluent water were analyzed. External penetrating radiation doses were measured and the potential for radiation exposure to off-site population groups was estimated. The results of the surveillance program are interpreted in terms of the origin of the radioactive and <b>chemical</b> substances (natural, <b>fallout,</b> ANL, and other) and are compared with applicable environmental quality standards. A US Department of Energy (DOE) dose calculation methodology, based on International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommendations and the CAP- 88 version of the EPA-AIRDOSE/RADRISK COMPUTER CODE, is used in this report. The status of ANL environmental protection activities with respect to the various laws and regulations which govern waste handling and disposal is discussed. This report also discusses progress being made on environmental corrective actions and restoration projects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{mobility}} and bioavailability of radionuclides of accidental origin {{is determined by}} an initial ratio of their <b>chemical</b> fomis in <b>fallout,</b> kinetics of transformation processes and environmental characteristics influential in transfer and distribution of radionuclides between environmental compartments. The objective of {{the paper is the}} development and validation of dynamic process-level model FORSUN to describe radiocaesium transfer from soil to plants and fungi in forest ecosystems. The following specific aims were pursued: 1) investigation of mechanisms of radiocaesium plant uptake, in particular, analysis of a possible role of fungi mycelium as a mediator in its transfer from soil to plant; 2) qualitative and quantitative description of long-term changes of radiocaesium content in understorey compartments of forest ecosystems; 3) prediction of n 7 C s activity concentrations in berries and mushrooms {{on the basis of a}} minimum of fitting parameters. A distinctive feature of model is taking into consideration vertical redistribution of radionuclide in a root layer of soil as governing factor of changes of the soil-understorey concentration ratios during first 10 - 30 years after the accident. The model uses parameterization of soil-plant concentration ratio through the key physico-chemical characteristics of soils determining its biological availability: a steady state portion of exchangeable caesium in soil and content of exchangeable calcium. The method for calculating radiocaesium accumulation parameters in forest fungi by soil properties is proposed based on the potassium contents in specific fungi and soil, and also steady-state portion of exchangeable caesium in soil. 1...|$|R
40|$|The 1980 eruptions of Mount St. Helens in {{southeast}} Washington {{resulted in a}} pronounced effect {{on the surface and}} ground water resources of the state. In response to the volcanic activity, the U. S. Geological Survey intensified statewide surface and ground water sampling programs to determine the nature and magnitude of the volcanic-induced variations. Streams to the east of Mount St. Helens received the major ash <b>fallout.</b> <b>Chemical</b> effects were best noted in smaller streams sampled 60 to 70 miles northeast of Mount St. Helens. The chemical variations observed were pronounced but short lived. Sulfate and chloride increases in anionic composition were prevalent immediately following the eruption; however, the original bicarbonate predominance was again attained within several days. Suspended iron and aluminum concentrations were similarly elevated during the period of greatest ash deposition (highest turbidity); however, the dissolved concentrations remained relatively constant. Depressions of pH were minor and short lived. Streams draining to the south, tributaries to the Columbia river, showed little observable changes in water chemistry. Streams draining to the west (Toutle river and its tributaries) were compositionally affected by the various volcanic activities. Chloride and sulfate anion percentage exceeded the bicarbonate percentage up to one month following the eruption period. Streams and lakes sampled in the immediate vicinity of Mount St. Helens, in addition to trace metals, contained organic compounds derived from decomposing wood buried in the debris deposits. This organic material may constitute a significant source of organic compounds to surface and ground water for some time to come...|$|R
40|$|An ash layer, about 1 cm thick, {{has been}} found during a reinvestigation of the upper Messinian-Zanclean {{succession}} exposed at Serredi Quarry (Fine Basin, Northern Apennines), {{one of the best}} known Neogene Tuscan sections. The Serredi Quarry succession (about 175 m thick) has been subdivided into three intervals: the lower (18 m thick) and middle (132 m thick) ones are separated by an unconformity and are both referable to the Messinian post-evaporitic phase, whereas the upper interval (25 m thick) represents marl deposition following the Pliocene transgression. The lower interval consists of relatively deep-lacustrine, anoxic, thinly laminated mudstones with subordinate sands, whereas the middle one includes lacustrine mudstones (occasionally with pedogenic features) with sands, diagenetic gypsum-rich mudstones, limestones, gravels and selenite gypsum draped by gypsarenites. These lithofacies are typically arranged into marginal-lake, cyclical stacking patterns. The ash layer is located in the lower interval. It is faintly laminated and composed of almost pure fine-grained glass shards and rare pumices. These characteristics suggest a primary deposition from a pyroclastic <b>fallout.</b> <b>Chemical</b> analyses were carried out on well preserved pumices and glass shards were used for fission-tracks dating, which provided an age of 5. 35 + 0. 32 Ma. Nevertheless, its age can be further constrained by the fact that i) the ash layer is about 145 m below the Miocene-Pliocene boundary, and ii) the intervening deposits mainly consist of mudstones with occasional pedogenic features, which are likely to comprise sedimentary hiatuses. Accordingly, the ash layer probably emplaced in the older part of the determined age interval. On the whole, the geochronology, geochemistry and the stratigraphic framework of the first ash layer found in the post-evaporitic deposits of Tuscany could represent valuable tools for regional stratigraphic studies on the Lago Mare phase and long-distance correlation...|$|R
