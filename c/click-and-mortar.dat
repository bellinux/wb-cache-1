50|$|To avoid {{a channel}} {{conflict}} in a <b>click-and-mortar</b> business, {{it is necessary}} to ensure that both traditional and online channels are fully integrated. This reduces possible confusion with customers while providing the business benefits of a dual channel.|$|E
50|$|According to Forrester Research and Gartner from 2007, {{despite the}} rapid growth of online commerce, an {{estimated}} 90 percent of manufacturers did not sell their products online. Of these, 66 percent identified channel conflict as their single biggest issue. However, results from a survey show that <b>click-and-mortar</b> businesses have an 80% greater chance of sustaining a business model during a three-year period than those operating just in one of the two channels.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to trace the {{emergence}} and formation of small dot-corns to understand how they come into being and are made to work or not. The SME e-business literature emphasises post-organisation and post-technology formation phases, paying less attention to the early phases of innovation development such as opportunity emergence and formation. The e-entrepreneurship literature, on its part, investigates such early phases to some extent but emphasises the personality of entrepreneurs and organisation development, paying less attention to technology and its development. Moreover, commonly used theories in both research lines are largely based on deterministic, reductionist and dualist approaches. As a result, the complex sociotechnical nature of SME e-business and e-entrepreneurship phenomena is less accounted for. In response, this study extends the existing knowledge in SME e-business and eentrepreneurship research by drawing on IS interpretive case study approach and actornetwork theory (ANT) combined with contextualism to trace the emergence and formation of four small dot-corns in the emerging digital economy of Ghana, a developing country context. The findings show that the early phases of dot-corn innovation, from emergence to formation, are non-deterministic, non-linear, complex, and heterogeneously interwoven. Moreover, such processes are created through the collective efforts of human and non-human actors across physical and virtual environments as well as developed and developing countries. By employing ANT combined with contextualism, the study offers a novel theorisation of dot-corn innovation processes. For this reason, it is argued that ANT can be extended with contextualism to offer explanations for unmet expectations of actors and actants beyond an actor-world. The study also advises entrepreneurs to pay attention not only to the virtual world but also to the physical world which together support dot-corn emergence, formation, and operation. Finally, in addition to other recommendations, the study calls for further research into the early phases of other forms of e-business such as <b>click-and-mortars</b> and virtual organisations.

40|$|After {{the tide}} of the Internet and impact of the Internet bubbled, E-Commerce {{business}} models have moved toward the <b>click-and-mortar</b> business models which could improve the revenue for keeping survival. This study is to explore {{the relationship between the}} <b>click-and-mortar</b> model and its performance based on the innovation approach. From the innovation perspective, three dimensions of the <b>click-and-mortar,</b> innovative service, channel integration and new market opportunity, are proposed; and its performance, including customer lock-in and new customer attraction, are measured. There are 95 samples are selected from the list of Trusted E-Commerce Stores in Taiwan, and 31 valid samples for analysis. The results show that <b>click-and-mortar</b> business models indeed generate benefits for the E-Commerce business, but channel conflict will affect the difficulties of adoption of the <b>click-and-mortar</b> and generates the negative effects to its performance. The <b>click–and-mortar</b> provides the convenient way for transaction online and solves the problem of payment and distribution offline, reciprocally. Besides, innovative service such as customization or personalization has more precise targeting to the customers with adding value of information. As to the price conflict on channel, the <b>click-and-mortar</b> business model could provide solution of bundling gifts, product differentiation, dynamic pricing strategy, or better service to the customers.

40|$|The <b>click-and-mortar</b> {{issue has}} {{attracted}} considerable attention in recent years. Many diverse arguments and viewpoints {{have been proposed}} to reinforce comprehension of seamless integration, {{but there has been}} little empirical research on how to develop an effective seamless strategy for consolidating the <b>click-and-mortar</b> environment. It is known that business capital is often scarce and different types of industries have different seamless strategy considerations; however, how to posit their expenditures in the right place {{on the basis of a}} priority method is seldom discussed. In order to provide a deeper view of the <b>click-and-mortar</b> decision making, this research divides the conceptual discussion into a proposed framework using the Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) to gain an integrated perspective to assist managers in placing business capital problems. It is argued that three types of support (logistics, technical and service) should be further extended and considered from seven seamless criteria for <b>click-and-mortar</b> evaluation. Two popular <b>click-and-mortar</b> bookstores in Taiwan were selected as the object. This framework generated several values for the enterprise to decide whether these seamless strategies should be adopted on the basis of its industrial characteristics. The research results can have practical implications for managers as they direct limited resources toward integrating and converging existing brick-and-mortar operations with a coherent and complementary Internet strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{developments}} of Electronic Commerce applications origins {{back to the}} early 1970 s and were primarily used within the financial sector. As the potential of E-commerce was recognized its use also reached into other sectors. The trend according of intensively, in-creasing sales is persistent and areas such as music, books and tickets are predicted to have the largest increase. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how traditional companies, as we call <b>click-and-mortar</b> corporations, perceive threats and opportunities of E-commerce. We will also investigate how pure internet firms, what we call Virtual corporations, view the same threats and opportunities of e-commerce. We will also try to find changes made by both of our research groups in different strategic directions. To obtain new data in the extremely fast changing e-commerce area, semi-structured quali-tative interviews with four respondents within a specific industry was conducted. What we can conclude after interviewing two <b>click-and-mortar</b> corporations and two vir-tual or “pure” internet corporations is that they take different strategic positions. Virtual 1 is closer to the market and Virtual 2, who is owned by a larger corporation, cannot act as fast but has a better financial support. Traditional 1 ’s position is closer to their core compe-tence such as more complex and tailor-made products and Traditional 2 seams to be more innovative and channel integrated. Regarding price differences, the theories states that online pricing is generally lower, which our empirical results confirm, with the anomaly of Traditional 1 ’s pricing. The theories also say that the price differences may cause conflicts for <b>click-and-mortar</b> corporations. These theories concurred with our empirical study where the interviewed <b>click-and-mortar</b> corporations did experience some channel con-flicts. Further neither of the traditional corporations considers competition from pure e-commerce as a major threat. The explanation given is due to different customer groups, more customized products and that competition is more about products, range and price. The pure e-commerce corporation does not consider traditional and <b>click-and-mortar</b> cor-porations as major threat. Competition comes more from the charter industry going online and also that competition is more about prices, product range and brand recognition. The Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and the use of price comparison pages are tools to meet competition. None of our four corporations has any plans on adding or reducing physical stores as opposed by the theories. The traditional corporations do feel competition or confusion between the sales channels and {{that it is important to}} communicate a deeper understanding of the positive synergy effects...|$|E

These new tools generate the transition from marketplace to market-space, by eliminating physical distances and allowing access to products and services on a global scale. The term ‘click-and-mortar’ denotes an integrated distribution system in which traditional distribution elements (physical stores, warehouses, stocks, information systems for distribution cycle management) are supported by tools made available by the new telecommunication technologies (online shopping, information platforms for distribution management, partnerships to run ‘virtual’ warehouses). <b>Click-and-mortar</b> businesses are often {{the combination of a}} traditional retail business (brick-and-mortar) and an online start-up company...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of electronic commerce complexes raises important questions regarding competence building and leveraging, both for practitioners and strategy scholars. Competences of brick-and-mortar incumbents (large and mature players) are {{being challenged by}} new entrants' <b>click-and-mortar</b> or click-and-click business models. The implications of this challenge for the financial services industry - as for many other industries - are only starting to become clear. In this paper we contribute to these initial understandings by developing a conceptual framework that considers which strategies incumbents and new entrants might adopt to improve their competitiveness. We identify four relevant organizational types in the emerging on-line financial services complex. For each of these types we outline how ties to sponsoring organizations {{can be used as}} a buffer against environmental turbulence and as a bridge towards changing stakeholder perspectives. legitimacy;e-commerce;co-evolution;competence building and leveraging;on-line financial services complex...|$|E
30|$|Helping denotes {{customers}} behavior {{aimed at}} supporting other customers [37]. In a service co-creation process, customers usually exhibit helping behavior toward other customers other than toward employees because other customers in a service encounter may need help from those with {{consistent with their}} expected roles [53]. In addition, customers’ roles are less defined and role-scripted, as {{compared with those of}} employees’; thus, customers generally need spontaneous help from peer customers [53]. Rosenbaum and Massiah [58] noted that customers have the tendency to recall their own difficult experiences and build a strong sense of empathy and social responsibility to help other customers facing similar difficulties. Just like electronic commerce (EC) taking several forms depending on the degree of digitalization, such as brick-and-mortar, <b>click-and-mortar,</b> and pure-play organizations, the customer citizenship behavior is extended beyond VCEs to physical world, such as get-together and lending a helpful hand.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{traditional}} brick-and-mortar businesses {{supplement their}} physical out-lets with e-commerce capabilities on the Web, {{but there has}} been lit tle empirical research on the underlying dynamics of the “click-and-mortar ” business approach. This paper de-velops a conceptual framework that highlights the four types of synergies obtained by integrating e-commerce with physical infrastructures: cost savings, improved differentia-tion, enhanced trust, and market extension. Case studies of <b>click-and-mortar</b> enterprises provide concrete examples of these synergy benefits and of the managerial actions needed to prevent channel conflicts. KEY WORDS AND PHRASES: Case studies, channel conflict, competitive strategy, e-commerce business models, electronic retailing. After a slow start in Web-based retailing, many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers now have electronic commerce channels in place.

40|$|All {{companies}} {{operate and}} compete on the cybermarket {{according to a}} <b>click-and-mortar</b> or pure-play business model. This alternative can {{be recognized as a}} factor in their competitiveness. The principal problem which requires a more in-depth treatment is how to explain the marginal theory in the cybermarket environment, where the law of diminishing returns does not apply, while growing revenues are a reality. Also, a network externality is a controversial issue, which is perceived as an impact factor affecting the competitive processes between all the players of the cybermarket. Network externalities are related to endeavours by companies for the standardisation of network goods, which is also perceived as a barrier to cybermarket competitiveness. The aim {{of this paper is to}} consider how competitiveness processes, e. g. entry of new market players, operate in markets with network externalities and how such processes determine the competitiveness of these markets...|$|E
40|$|With {{the boom}} in e-business, several {{corporations}} have emerged in the late 1990 s that have primarily conducted their business through the Internet and the Web. They {{have come to be}} known as the dotcoms or <b>click-and-mortar</b> corporations. The success of these companies has been short lived. This research is an investigation of the burst of the dotcom bubble from a financial perspective. Data from the financial statements of several survived and failed dotcom companies is used to compute financial ratios, which are analyzed using three classification techniques-discriminant analysis, neural networks, and support vector machines to find out whether they can predict the financial fate of companies. Neural networks perform the task better than other techniques. Using discriminant analysis and neural networks, the key financial ratios that play a major role in the process of prediction are identified. Statistical tests are conducted to validate the findings. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This study will explore factors affecting women shopper shopping purchase intention, specifically for cosmetic product purchase in the cyberspace. This study consist of four independent variables which are trust, attitude, brand awareness and consumer online purchase experiences. 250 set of questionnaires were distributed to collect the primary data from female respondents who are internet savvy and with online purchase experiences. The date was then analyze by using the correlation and multiple regression analysis. A surprising result shows that brand awareness does not have significant relationship with purchase intention while the other variables have a significant relationship with purchase intention.

40|$|The {{conversion}} from brick-and-mortar retailing to {{the hybrid}} <b>click-and-mortar</b> business model is studied {{from the perspective}} of logistics. The retailer addressed in this study runs chain stores—designated as brick-and-mortar stores—and warehouses to meet the demand of walk-in customers. When the retailer decides to go online, its brick-and-mortar stores are converted to <b>click-and-mortar</b> stores with the capability of processing online orders. Such facilities both appeal to walk-in customers and sell goods on the Web to online customers with different service requirements. While the distance between home and the nearest open store is assumed as the primary preference metric for walk-in customers, a quality of service guarantee for online customers is mostly about the delivery time of orders to their residences. ^ This conversion primarily affects logistics and distribution operations of a retailing business. A new service system has to be designed and integrated into the ongoing operations. In doing this, the retailer will be confronted with competing cost and distance considerations. We propose an integrated mathematical optimization model to determine a strategy for the retailer 2 ̆ 7 s logistics and distributions. The model unifies several objective functions into a single comprehensive objective function in which each component is expressed in dollars and cents. A composite Lagrangian relaxation approach is followed to bracket the model 2 ̆ 7 s true optimal objective value between a lower and upper bound. The best feasible solution that gives an upper bound reveals the best mix of bricks and clicks as well as the best delivery plan for online orders. This solution represents a favorable location of stores and an allocation of both types of customers to them. Quality of service guarantees of online customers are strictly satisfied. However, a walk-in customer 2 ̆ 7 s demand is considered lost if there is no open store within a maximum distance from her residence. The performance of our Lagrangian-based approach has been tested on a number of randomly generated problems. We also obtain an efficient frontier of competing cost objectives, on which each point represents a heuristically nondominated (efficient) mix of bricks and clicks in service. Several methods employed in the Lagrangian relaxation to improve feasible solutions are also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Challenging the sceptical {{view that}} {{consumers}} would not buy apparel and accessories without feeling the fabric and testing for size and look, online fashion sales is growing fast. Yet, {{the myriad of}} recent business model developments in the sector depicts a disorderly environment lacking frameworks and typologies to facilitate understanding and explain different business propositions. In this paper, we report the preliminary findings of a work-in-progress study being developed in the fashion retail sector. Initial analysis showed a regular presence of relationship-based functionalities in current business models emerged in the electronic fashion retailing context. It is also possible to notice a widespread adoption of relationship-based functionalities across different business models in the sector. The models are presented under a conceptual framework developed to support and facilitate understanding of the core functionalities they implement. Furthermore, the study also identified <b>click-and-mortar</b> initiatives where fashion retailers integrate online relationship-based functionalities into their conventional brick-and-mortar operations. An interesting aspect observed in the study is the augmented scope of the relationships that fashion retailers {{are now able to}} explore.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel hybrid intelligent {{system in the}} framework of soft computing to predict the failure of dotcom companies. The hybrid intelligent system comprises the techniques such as a Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART). The dataset collected from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) consists of 240 dotcom companies (also known as <b>click-and-mortar</b> companies), of which 120 are failed and 120 are healthy. Ten-fold cross validation is performed on the data set for all the techniques considered in their stand-alone mode. Further, two hybrid techniques viz., ensembling and boosting are employed to improve the accuracies. Moreover, t-statistic is performed on the dataset for feature selection purpose and the reduced feature subset with 10 features is extracted. The reduced feature subset is tested with all the techniques and then ensembling and boosting is also done for the reduced feature subset. Results supported by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve indicate that the important features extracted by the t-statistic based feature subset selection yielded very high accuracies for all the techniques. Furthermore, the results are superior to those reported in previous studies on the same data set. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A firm 2 ̆ 019 s {{business}} model describes {{the way in}} which it creates, delivers, and appropriates value. In the debate about the ongoing demise of several e-commerce ventures, only a few analysts have looked at the relative sanity of innovative e-business Models, relying mostly on static environmental variables and the inherent economic logic of each industry. Our study sheds new light on this debate by concentrating on a set of more complex factors, namely the relative difficulty to build new capabilities, whether by creating or acquiring them. We interviewed 60 e-commerce ventures between 2 and 3 years old, both independent and corporate ones, in order to measure their performance, the innovativeness of their e-{{business model}}, their obstacles to capability building, and their exploitable resource base. By performing cluster, discriminant, and regression analyses, we demonstrate that a number of typical obstacles to capability building can significantly affect the relative success or failure of innovative e-business models, but that a richer resource base may alleviate this relationship.

40|$|Meaningful, memorable {{and unique}} {{customer}} experiences are proved to influence customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, creating value for companies. However, due to changing multichannel {{environment and the}} lack of common understanding of customer experience phenomenon, many retailers struggle to provide their customers with exceptional experiences. This study took on a challenge to conceptualise customer buying experience in multichannel context. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore what relevance experience of the multichannel customer during his/her transitions between online and offline retail channels has in customer buying experience. The focus was placed on customer interactions with <b>click-and-mortar</b> furniture and interior design retailers. Multi-method qualitative research design was chosen to explore the phenomena and seek the support for the conceptual framework developed in the literature review. Qualitative data was collected through ten individual semi-structured interviews with consumers and two consumer focus groups, which resulted in 7 hours 12 minutes of audio material. Despite the challenges of approaching such an intangible topic, both data collection methods gave useful insights into the topic of customer buying experience formation. The data was mainly in line with the suggested theoretical model, but also succeeded to develop the model further, bringing the components of customer buying experience closer to service quality components, and emphasising even more the role of channel integration and omnichannel strategies. Basing on the results of this study, several hypotheses for future quantitative research can be proposed. The managerial implications of this study may be useful in the field of specialised multichannel retailing...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} {{multichannel}} retail strategy implementation within SMEs, and to specifically {{understand how the}} interrelated constructs of intra-organisational structures and managerial processes shape this practice over time. The study adopts a unique strategy-as-practice theoretical point-of-view on the multichannel retailing phenomenon {{in order to examine}} the daily work of managers in multichannel companies. This allows the thesis to uncover central structures and meaning-making processes of key strategy practitioners, as well as to outline twelve managerial suggestions for practice. The study conducted a qualitative intensive comparative case study analysis on two Finnish SMEs, operating in the clothing and design industries respectively. The primary data collection included two pre-interviews with experts and five case study interviews with middle and senior managers. The researcher conducted these interviews as in-depth semi-structured interviews. The research utilized also complementary secondary resources, such as press releases, newspaper and magazine articles, to form an overall understanding of the case companies' strategy implementation during the past years. A constructionist research philosophy and an abductive research logic underlined the case study analysis. In line with this approach, the study developed a flexible guiding theoretical framework. The thesis endeavours to provide an in-depth description on the case companies' idiosyncrasies and commonalities. The findings suggest that multichannel retail strategy implementation represents an ongoing and complex practice. Intra-organisational structures and managerial processes may either enable or hinder this endeavour. Structures represent the backbone of multichannel retailing, while, processes emerge as the differentiating factor of sales management in a <b>click-and-mortar</b> business. A lack of resource allocation, strategic focus and organisation-wide commitment may lead to a viscous strategy implementation circle. Moreover, appropriate IT-systems, enabling cross-channel data integration and multichannel performance measurement metrics, form the foundation for efficient multichannel retail operations. Effective multichannel retailing also seems to hinge on daily precise coordinating skills, optimistic strategy championing and continuous diplomatic communication across sales channels. This study also sheds light on emergent sensemaking mechanisms such as demystification and simplification, affecting managerial evaluations of suitable multichannel retail strategy tactics. Finally, the research indicates that multichannel retail strategy development becomes on a tactical level an individual learning journey and a context-specific practice for SMEs...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Companies {{have for}} decades built up their {{business}} around the traditional brick-and-mortar channel. The {{rise of the}} Internet and the surging popularity of online shopping have offered rapid growth in e-commerce and embodied the emerging <b>click-and-mortar</b> (e. g. Target. com) or solely online business model (e. g. Amazon. com). As the focus of market moves away from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce, companies have sought to adapt best digital marketing strategies to obtain competitive advantage over their rivals. Meanwhile, the prevalence of user-generated content has given consumers unprecedented power to influence the market performance of various products and services. Such transformation has created many opportunities and challenges for modern e-businesses. It has opened several new pages for IS literature as well. In my dissertation, I intend to study the impact of digital marketing on firms' pricing strategy {{as well as on}} consumers' intrinsic behaviors in the post-Internet era. In the first study, I examine a novel hybrid pricing model, featuring both online advertising and digital promotion. Endogenizing product prices as a decision variable, I explicitly consider the implementation costs and the distribution effectiveness associated with the underlying mechanism. From consumers' perspective, cashback shopping provides an attractive saving opportunity as the prices they pay are perceived lower. Surprisingly, under some conditions the "low" post-cashback price is actually "high", relative to the level in the absence of cashback mechanism. As a consequence, the introduction of cashback may reduce consumer surplus and social welfare. In the second essay, I investigate a fundamental question: Under what conditions are consumers more likely to post product ratings voluntarily? Unlike existing literature, I follow an established theory and propose a novel approach, decomposing consumer satisfaction into product quality and quality disconfirmation. I find that the discrepancy between a consumer's expected and realized product quality has a significant impact on her propensity to share product experience. Such intension to contribute is subject to the crowding-out effect, meaning that the underlying propensity declines as more peer consumers have already shared their opinions. Furthermore, the more credible a consumer perceives the online review system, the less prone she would be to interact with the system. A series of simulations are designed to further understand: (1) the association between product evaluation and lurking behavior, (2) the evolution pattern of product ratings, and (3) the effect of review manipulation on subsequent rating activities. In sum, these investigations provide {{a better understanding of how}} information systems and IT-enabled marketing methods reshape merchants' competitive strategy and consumers' decision-making processes. I briefly introduce the background, motivate the research questions of my interest, and summarize the main findings of this dissertation in the first chapter. In the following two chapters, I review related literature and highlight the contribution of my work from both academic and managerial perspectives for each of two studies. Then, I discuss model development and setting, describe research design and methodologies, and summarize main findings and implications of those two studies...|$|E
