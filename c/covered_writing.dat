40|$|Abstract [...] Steganography {{is defined}} as <b>covered</b> <b>writing</b> {{and it has been}} used to achieve confidentiality. Most of {{research}} in this domain has focused in just sending plain data. In this paper we use steganography as a way to spread ex-ecutable code instead of just communicating a secret message. The application of our proposal may contrast, could be using for spreading malicious code or for protecting software copyright like a water marking alive. We present our implementation of this scheme with a developed tool and hence look in a direc-tion that has not looked at detail so far. ...|$|E

It is derived from the Greek word ‘’Steganos’ ’ which means <b>covered</b> <b>writing,</b> a science of secret communication. It is a tool for hiding information in a medium so that the information does not appear to exist. For hiding secret information in images there exists a large variety of steganographic techniques, some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. The edges of an image can be used very efficiently for hiding data. In this paper we performed a thorough investigation in comparing the different edge detection techniques and hence evaluate which technique is better for image steganograph...|$|E

In the subsequent paper we go over some general concepts and thoughts that are appropriate toward steganography. Specifically we found a structure and define idea of security for a steganography system and illustrate how conventional definitions do not really sufficiently cover image steganography and an offer alternating definitions. Also review on some of the latest image steganography techniques. In this paper we discuss about the how to secure image steganography (<b>Covered</b> <b>Writing)</b> technique to hide a secret image using the key. The covert image itself is not secret, instead a key is generated and the key is hidden in the cover image. Using the key the secret image can be extracted. So it is very safe and robust because no one can recognize the hidden information and it cannot be vanished due to noise or any signal processing operations...|$|E

In this paper, we proposed a technique called RGB intensity based steganography model as RGB model is the technique used in this field to hide the data.

From this they conclude that the net short commercial interest in silver on the COMEX, allegedly naked, must further be increased by adding the amount of unbacked silver certificates and phony storage, which they conservatively estimate at one billion ounces. Analysts and the 22, 000 owners of silver certificates ask the wrong question.

40|$|The Hash Based Least Significant Bit Technique For Video Steganography {{deals with}} hiding secret message or {{information}} within a video. Steganography {{is nothing but}} the <b>covered</b> <b>writing</b> it includes process that conceals information within other data and also conceals {{the fact that a}} secret message is being sent. Steganography is the art of secret communication or the science of invisible communication. In this paper a Hash based least significant bit technique for video steganography has been proposed whose main goal is to embed a secret information in a particular video file and then extract it using a stego key or password. In this Least Significant Bit insertion method is used for steganography so as to embed data in cover video with change in the lower bit. This LSB insertion is not visible. Data hidding is the process of embedding information in a video without changing its perceptual quality. The proposed method involve with two terms that are Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the Mean Square Error (MSE). This two terms measured between the original video files and steganographic video files from all video frames where a distortion is measured using PSNR. A hash function is used to select the particular position for insertion of bits of secret message in LSB bits. ...|$|E

40|$|Steganography {{is derived}} from the Greek for <b>covered</b> <b>writing</b> and {{essentially}} means “to hide in plainsight”. Steganography is the art of inconspicuously hiding data within data. The main goal of steganography is tohide information well. In other words Steganography is the science that involves communicating secret data in anappropriate multimedia carrier, e. g., image, audio, and video files. The aim is to conceal the very existence of theembedded data. In today's world the art of sending & displaying the hidden information especially in public places,has received more attention and faced many challenges. Steganography's ultimate objectives, which areundetectability, robustness (resistance to various image processing methods and compression) and capacity of thehidden data, are the main factors that separate it from related techniques such as watermarking and cryptography. It is well known that encryption provides secure channels for communicating entities. However, due tolack of covertness on these channels, an unauthorized user can easily identify encrypted streams through statisticaltests and capture them for further cryptanalysis. In cryptography, the individuals notice the information by seeingthe coded information but {{they will not be able}} to comprehend the information. However, in steganography, theexistence of the information in the sources will not be noticed at all. Most steganography jobs have been carried outon images, video clips,texts, music and sounds. Therefore, different methods have been proposed so far for hiding information in different cover media. This method can be used for displaying a secret message in public domains which are accessed by any body...|$|E

In the LSB approach, the basic idea is to replace the Least Signicant Bits (LSB) of the cover image with the Most Signicant Bits (MSB) of the messages to be hidden without destroying the property of the cover image signicantly. The LSB-based technique is the most challenging one as it is dicult to dierentiate between the cover-object and stego- object if few LSB bits of the cover object are replaced. In Pseudo-Random technique, a random-key is used as seed for the Pseudo-Random Number Generator is needed in the embedding process [19]. Both the techniques used a stego-key while embedding messages inside the cover image. By using the key, the chance of getting attacked by the third party is reduced...|$|E

AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE STUDENTS’ WRITING SKILLS THROUGH CONTEXTUAL APPROACH: A CLASSROOM ACTION RESEARCH AT CLASS VIIIA OF JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 3 ARJOSARI PACITAN REGENCY. Thesis: The Graduate Program in Indonesian Language Education. Postgraduate Program. Sebelas Maret University. Surakarta. Objective of this research: 1) {{improve the}} quality of the {{learning}} process of writing skills class VIII A SMP Negeri 3 Arjosari Pacitan with contextual approach, 2) improve writing skills class VIII A SMP Negeri 3 Arjosari Pacitan with contextual approach. This research is a classroom action research. It can also be called as a collaborative classroom action research. The research was conducted at Grade VIIIA of State Junior High School 3 Arjosari Pacitan Regency and was conducted in three cycles. The lesson plan for each cycle was arranged by the class teacher and the researcher. Every class room action consisted of four stages, namely: 1) planning, 2) action, 3) observation, 4) reflection. This results of the reflection were used as the bases for arranging action plan. The class teacher of the students in Grade VIII A was intensively guided on the application of contextual approach so as to improve the writing skill of the students in Grade VIII A. which is stil low. The subjectts of the research and the data sources of the research were the students in Grade VIII A of Junior High School 3 Arjosari Pacitan Regency and teacher. The data of the research <b>covered</b> <b>writing</b> interest and writing skill of the students in Grade VIIIA. The data were gathered through questionnaire, observation, in-depth interview, discussion, content analysis (document analysis), and test. The data were validated by using a data triangulation technique. They were then analyzed by using critical and comparative techniques of analysis. Conclusion of this research as follows: firstly, the application of contextual approach can improve the students’ writing interest as indicated by facts following the action that the students make writing plan prior to writing, select the writing, revise the writing, use EYD (perfected spelling system), and are eager to practice writing more despite the absence of assignment from their teacher. Secondly, the application of contextual approach can improve the average scores of their writing from 64 to 75. 41.
