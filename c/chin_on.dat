25|$|The {{characteristics}} of the lower jaw are therefore {{the lack of a}} <b>chin</b> <b>on</b> the one hand and on the other it is the considerable size of the lower jaw bone, on which, behind the wisdom tooth a fourth premolar would easily have had space to develop. Since the third molar (the wisdom tooth) is present and its dentin exposed - although only in a few places - the age of death is estimated to be about 20 to 30 years.|$|E

25|$|The {{depiction}} of the Indigenous warrior in the painting—kneeling with his <b>chin</b> <b>on</b> his fist, looking at General Wolfe—has been analyzed in various ways. In art, the touching of one's face with one's hand {{is a sign of}} deep thought and intelligence (thus Rodin's The Thinker). Some consider it an idealization inspired by the noble savage concept (Fryd, 75). Original items of clothing that were used as a model for portraying the warrior in the painting {{can be found in the}} British Museum's collection (as well as additional First Nation artefacts used in other paintings by West).|$|E
500|$|Pudús are solitary {{and only}} come {{together}} for rut. Mating season is in the Southern Hemisphere autumn, from April to May. Pudú DNA is arranged into 70 chromosomes. To mate, the pudú male rests his <b>chin</b> <b>on</b> the female's back, then sniffs her rear before mounting her from behind, holding her with his fore legs. The gestation period ranges from 202 to 223days (around 7months) with the average being 210days. A single offspring or sometimes twins are born in austral spring, from November to January. Newborns weigh [...] with the average birth weight being [...] Newborns less than [...] or more than [...] die. Females and males weigh the same at birth. Fawns have reddish-brown fur and southern pudú fawns have white spots running the length of their backs. Young are weaned after 2months. Females mature sexually in 6months, while males mature in 8–12months. Fawns are fully grown in 3months, but may stay with their mothers for 8 to 12months.|$|E
500|$|The Ducks {{opened their}} 2009 {{season with a}} 19–8 loss to the Boise State Broncos. Blount ended the game with {{negative}} yardage (−5) on eight carries. Blount had been interviewed by a Sports Illustrated reporter earlier {{in the summer and}} was asked about the excessive late hits in the 2008 game in Eugene between Oregon and Boise State. He had been quoted that because of the way Boise State beat Oregon in Eugene they [...] "owed them an ass-whoopin'." [...] In the 2008 game, Oregon quarterback Jeremiah Masoli was forced to leave the game after taking a helmet to the <b>chin</b> <b>on</b> a late hit by a Boise State defender. Oregon lost that game but the late hits were a topic of discussion as the teams prepared for the season opener against each other. Shortly after the game's end, Boise State defensive player Byron Hout came up to Blount during the team's handshakes and said, [...] "How's that for an ass-whoopin'?" [...] Blount punched Hout, knocking him to the ground. Blount then hit teammate Garrett Embry, who was attempting to restrain him, in the helmet.|$|E

500|$|Another rivalry {{heading into}} the event was Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon versus Shawn Michaels and God. This feud started on December 26, 2005, when Vince McMahon made note of Bret Hart's DVD, {{claiming}} that he [...] "tricked" [...] Hart in the hours of his match at Survivor Series 1997, where Hart lost the WWE Championship to Shawn Michaels. At the event, Michaels applied Hart's own finisher, the Sharpshooter, and McMahon called for the bell, in an event known as the [...] "Montreal Screwjob". Michaels interrupted McMahon {{and told him to}} [...] "let it go" [...] and [...] "move on" [...] from the events of Survivor Series. In reply McMahon told Michaels that he indeed screwed Bret Hart and added, [...] "Shawn, do not make me screw you." [...] At the Royal Rumble, Shane McMahon made a surprising appearance when he eliminated Michaels from the Rumble match, though Shane was not a participant. McMahon informed Michaels that he would face his son Shane on the March 18, 2006, edition of Saturday Night's Main Event in a No Holds Barred match. At the event, Vince interfered throughout the match on his son's behalf, by stopping the referee's count, after Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music, a move which sees the wrestler use the sole of the foot to strike an opponent's head or <b>chin</b> <b>on</b> Shane, an enraged Michaels grabbed McMahon but before he could do anything, Shane hit Michaels with a low blow. McMahon ordered Shane to apply the Sharpshooter on Michaels, and, after he executed the submission move, McMahon called for the bell, similar to the 1997 Survivor Series match. Mr. McMahon booked himself and Michaels in a No Holds Barred match at WrestleMania 22. At WrestleMania, the Spirit Squad and Shane McMahon interfered on McMahon's behalf, but Michaels defeated Vince McMahon after he performed Sweet Chin Music and captured the pinfall victory. The next night on Raw, The McMahons confronted Michaels and informed him that his win at WrestleMania was [...] "an act of God," [...] therefore setting up the tag team match at Backlash that would have The McMahons facing Michaels and God.|$|E

Knowing her idiosyncratic tendency to drop her <b>chin</b> <b>on</b> low notes and throw back her head on high ones, Mozart filled her showpiece aria Come scoglio with constant leaps from low to high and high to low {{in order to make}} Ferrarese's head [...] "bob like a chicken" [...] onstage.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{things seemed}} to be getting better for the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's {{demeanor}} onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his <b>chin</b> <b>on</b> the microphone during performances. The so-called [...] "endless tour"—the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions—had taken its toll.|$|E

It was necessary for an adult to accompany a juvenile into the theater. When I succeeded I'd give him my ten cents—that's all it cost—and I'd go {{up to the top of}} the balcony where I'd put my <b>chin</b> <b>on</b> the rail and watch, spellbound, from the first act to the last.
