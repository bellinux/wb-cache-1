50|$|Epigenetic change (secondary processes) may be {{arranged}} under {{a number of}} headings, {{each of which is}} typical of a group of rocks or rock-forming minerals, though usually more than one of these alterations is in progress in the same rock. Silicification, the replacement of the minerals by crystalline or crypto-crystalline silica, is most common in felsic rocks, such as rhyolite, but is also found in serpentine, etc. Kaolinization is the decomposition of the feldspars, which are the most common minerals in igneous rocks, into kaolin (along with quartz and other clay minerals); it is best shown by granites and syenites. Serpentinization is the alteration of olivine to serpentine (with magnetite); it is typical of peridotites, but occurs in most of the mafic rocks. In uralitization, secondary hornblende replaces augite; <b>chloritization</b> is the alteration of augite (biotite or hornblende) to chlorite, and is seen in many diabases, diorites and greenstones.

Major intrusive rocks of Nezam-Abad are quartz diorite and minor amount of granodiorite. Leucogranitic, pegmatite dykes and quartz-tourmaline veins were intruded the quartz diorite. Quartz diorites are mainly composed of plagioclase, hornblende, biotite, quartz and pyroxene as major minerals. Major minerals of leucogranite are microcline, orthoclase, albite, quartz, biotite and muscovite. Accessory minerals consist of apatite, zircon, sphene, epidote, allanite, tourmaline and opaque. The presence of hydrous minerals like hornblende and biotite in these rocks indicate that the corresponding magma initially contained > 3 wt% H 2 O (wet magma). The occurrences of garnet and andalusite minerals suggest assimilation process. Primary textures in these rocks are granular, granophyre, and poikilitic. Secondary textures are perthite, myrmekite, sericitization, <b>chloritization</b> and kaolinitization.

40|$|We {{have studied}} textural {{relationships}} and compositions of phyllosilicate minerals in the mafic– ultramafic-hosted massive-sulfide deposit of Ivanovka (Main Uralian Fault Zone, southern Urals). The main hydrothermal phyllosilicate minerals are Mg-rich chlorite, variably ferroan talc, (Mg, Si) -rich and (Ca, Na, K) -poor saponite (stevensite), and serpentine. These minerals occur both as alteration products after mafic volcanics and ultramafic protoliths and, except serpentine, as hydrothermal vein and seafloor mound-like precipitates associated with variable amounts of (Ca, Mg, Fe) -carbonates, quartz and Fe and Cu (Co, Ni) sulfides. Brecciated mafic lithologies underwent pervasive <b>chloritization,</b> while interlayered gabbro sills underwent partial alteration to chlorite + illite ± actinolite ± saponite ± talc-bearing assemblages and later localized deeper alteration to chlorite ± saponite. Ultramafic and mixed ultramafic–mafic breccias were altered to talc-rich rocks with variable amounts of chlorite, carbonate and quartz. <b>Chloritization,</b> locally accompanied by formation of disseminated sulfides, required a high contribution of Mg-rich seawater to the hydrothermal fluid, {{which could be}} achieved in a highly permeable, breccia-dominated seafloor. More evolved hydrothermal fluids produced addition of silica, carbonates and further sulfides, and led to local development of saponite after chlorite and widespread replacement of serpentine by talc.

These alterations appear as narrow (few cm thick) bleached margins beside thin veins, and broad alteration bands along thick veins where detailed epidotization and <b>chloritization</b> of the adjacent rock are recognizable. Based on petrographic and mineralogical examination of the altered wallrocks, metasomatic zones with characteristic mineral paragenesis can be distinguished: Zone 1 (ab + ttn ± ep), Zone 2 (ep + chl+ ttn + ab ± ser), Zone 3 (chl + ep + ser + rt ± ttn), Zone 4 (ser ± chl). Bulk rock chemical analyses were made from the different metasomatic zones. The results show that fluid circulated in the propylitic veins caused metasomatic alteration of the wall-rock, with transport of considerable amount of Ca 2 + toward the adjacent rocks.

We present new data on clay mineral assemblages, clay and whole rock chemistry and clay mineral strontium and oxygen isotopic compositions of altered rocks from a site of diffuse low-temperature venting (Snowcap, Site 1188) and a site of high-temperature venting (Roman Ruins, Site 1189) in order to investigate the water-rock reactions and associated elemental exchanges. The volcanic succession at Snowcap has been hydrothermally altered, producing five alteration zones: (1) chlorite +/- illite-cristobalite-plagioclase alteration apparently overprinted locally by pyrophyllite bleaching at temperatures of 260 - 310 degreesC; (2) chlorite +/- mixed-layer clay alteration at temperatures of 230 degreesC; (3) chlorite and illite alteration; (4) illite and chlorite +/- illite mixed-layer alteration at temperatures of 250 - 260 degreesC; and (5) illite +/- chlorite alteration at 290 - 300 degreesC. Felsic rocks recovered from two holes (1189 A and 1189 B) at Roman Ruins, although very close together, show differing alteration features. Hole 1189 A is characterized by a uniform chlorite-illite alteration formed at similar to 250 degreesC, overprinted by quartz veining at 350 degreesC. In contrast, four alteration zones occur in Hole 1189 B: (1) illite chlorite alteration formed at similar to 300 degreesC; (2) chlorite +/- illite alteration at 235 degreesC; (3) chlorite illite and. mixed layer clay alteration; and (4) chlorite illite alteration at 220 degreesC. Mass balance calculations indicate that the <b>chloritization,</b> illitization and bleaching (silica-pyrophyllite assemblages) alteration stages are accompanied by different chemical changes relative to a calculated pristine precursor lava. The element Cr appears to have a general enrichment in the altered samples from PACMANUS. The clay concentrate data show that Cr and Cu are predominantly present in the pyrophyllites. Illite shows a significant enrichment for Cs and Cu relative to the bulk altered samples. Considerations of mineral stability allow us to place some constraints on fluid chemistry. Hydrothermal fluid pH for the <b>chloritization</b> and illitization was neutral to slightly acidic and relatively acidic for the pyrophyllite alteration. In general the fluids, especially from Roman Ruins and at intermediate depths below Snowcap, show only a small proportion of seawater mixing (< 10 %). Fluids in shallow and deep parts of the Snowcap holes, in contrast, show stronger seawater influence. Copyright (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
