5|$|Harper's Cabinet was {{defeated}} in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after being found in <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the Governor General to call a general election. This was the first occurrence in Commonwealth history of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing {{the confidence of the}} lower house on the grounds of <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> parliament. The no-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion and 145 against.|$|E
5|$|Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution {{provides}} that Parliament may restrict {{the right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression to provide against <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> court.

They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and {{his chief of}} staff Kyle Sampson, Gonzales' liaison to the White House Monica Goodling, aide to the president Karl Rove and his senior aide Sara Taylor. In addition, legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten were both found in <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> Congress.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln rarely raised {{objections}} in the courtroom; {{but in an}} 1859 case, {{where he}} defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, {{who was accused of}} stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.|$|E

40|$|Guided by {{a social}} {{function}} of emotions perspective, the authors examined {{a model of}} the psychological, interpersonal, and performance consequences <b>of</b> <b>contempt</b> in a series of 3 experi-ments that tested the outcomes of being a recipient <b>of</b> <b>contempt</b> in the work domain. In these experiments, participants engaged in a business strategy simulation with a virtual partner—a computer programmed to give contemptuous and other types of feedback. In Study 1, which examined the task performance and interpersonal outcomes <b>of</b> <b>contempt,</b> recipients <b>of</b> <b>contempt</b> had significantly better task performance but also significantly more interpersonal aggressiveness toward their virtual partners compared with recipients of failure, angry, or neutral feedback. Study 2 examined 3 psychological outcomes mediating the contempt–task performance/aggression relation-ship: self-esteem, returned feelings <b>of</b> <b>contempt,</b> and activation levels. Lowered levels of implicit self-esteem and greater levels of activation significantly mediated the relationship between receiving contempt and task performance, whereas the contempt–aggression relationship was mediated by lowered implicit self-esteem and increased feelings <b>of</b> returned <b>contempt.</b> Study 3 examined status as a moderator of these relationships. Low-status recipients had significantly better task performance than did equal-status recipients, who performed significantly better than did the high-status recip-ients <b>of</b> <b>contempt.</b> In addition, low-status recipients displayed significantly lower levels of aggres-sion in response to contempt than did equal-status and high-status recipients...|$|R
5|$|Unique to Article 14(2)(a) is an {{addendum}} {{stating that}} the right to freedom of speech and expression may be curtailed by restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament, or to provide against <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> court, defamation or incitement to any offence. The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds.|$|E

5|$|Depending on the {{authorized}} {{and actual}} sentence, upon demand, a criminal defendant {{has a right}} to trial by jury. The defendant does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution. If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the defendant {{has a right to}} a jury. Further, the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> court).|$|E
5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of old-age pensions, {{free trade and}} several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke {{in support of the}} children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E

5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|In March 1904 Neild {{attacked}} the government's military {{policy and the}} commander of the military forces, Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, who had long wished to dismiss Neild from the citizen army. Neild had incited a near mutiny by destroying a well-known sergeant's military career, and was suspended from duty; Neild responded by accusing Hutton of intimidation and infringing a Senator's right of freedom of expression. In April 1904 the Senate formed a committee to investigate alleged <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> Parliament by Hutton, which found that Neild had not been intimidated. In 1905 Neild retired from the militia.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} Fall and a {{relative}} {{had received a}} total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases. Fall was ultimately convicted in 1929 for accepting bribes and, in 1931, became the first U.S. cabinet member to be imprisoned for crimes committed while in office. Sinclair was convicted only of <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> court for jury tampering. Doheny was brought to trial before a jury in April 1930 for giving the bribe Fall had been convicted of accepting, but he was acquitted.|$|E
40|$|While {{philosophers}} {{have discussed}} the emotion <b>of</b> <b>contempt</b> from antiquity to the present day, contempt has received less attention in psychological research. We review the defining features <b>of</b> <b>contempt,</b> both as a short-term emotion and as a more long lasting sentiment. Contempt is similar to anger in that it may occur after (repeated) social or moral transgressions, but it differs from anger in its appraisals, actions and emotivational goals. Unlike anger, contempt arises when a person’s or group’s character is appraised as bad and unresponsive to change, leading to attempts to socially exclude the target. We discuss associative, self-regulatory and social distancing functions <b>of</b> <b>contempt</b> and present a dynamic social model <b>of</b> <b>contempt</b> versus anger...|$|R
