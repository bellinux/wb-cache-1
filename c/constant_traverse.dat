The results showed that friction stir processed NAB alloy microhardness was increased as the rotation rate increased. During friction stir processing, martensite nanotwins could be formed due to high strain rates and peculiar martensitic structures of NAB alloys. A rotation rate increase, increased peak temperatures and strain rates in friction stir processed NAB alloys, leading to {{a significant amount of}} martensite nanotwins formation. As rotation rates increased from 600 rpm to 1200 rpm, in addition to grain refinement effects, the strengthening mechanism of friction stir processed NAB alloys gradually changed from secondary phase strengthening to solid solution, dislocations and nanotwin strengthening.

40|$|Abstract—AA 5083 {{aluminium}} alloy has gathered wide acceptance in the fabrication of light weight structures requiring a high {{strength to weight}} ratio. Compared to the fusion welding processes that are routinely used for joining structural {{aluminium alloy}}s, friction stir welding (FSW) process is an emerging solid state joining {{process in which the}} material that is being welded does not melt and recast. This process uses a non-consumable tool to generate frictional heat in the abutting surfaces. The welding parameters and tool pin profile play major roles in deciding the weld quality. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to understand the effect of tool speed (rpm) and tool pin profile on Friction Stir Processing (FSP) zone formation in AA 5083 aluminium alloy. Friction stir welding between 5083 aluminium alloy plates with a thickness of 2. 5 mm was performed. Five different tool pin profiles (straight cylindrical, tapered cylindrical, triangular, square and cone) have been used to fabricate the joints at three different rotational speeds i. e. 900, 1400 and 1800 rpm under a <b>constant</b> <b>traverse</b> speed of 16 mm/min. The formation of FSP zone has been analysed macroscopically. Tensile properties of the joints have been evaluated and correlated with the FSP zone formation. From this investigation it has been found that the tool pin profiled designs had little effect on heat input and tensile properties, weld properties were dominated by thermal input rather than the mechanical deformation by the tool for the plate thickness of 2. 5 mm. straight cylindrical pin profiled tool produces mechanically sound and metallurgically defect free welds compared to other tool pin profiles.

Thermal and mechanical {{behavior of the}} material which are mutually dependent are coupled together to simulate the FSW process model similar to the real time to evaluate the peak temperature and flow stress. The heat generation is governed by friction between tool and workpiece, plastic deformation and the temperature imposed subsequently on the material. The temperature distribution in the workpiece during FSW process of butt joining of aluminum alloy 6061 -T 6 is experimentally measured from the devised thermocouple layout at different locations on the workpiece in the welding direction. The temperature history and normal force predicted from simulated model is {{compared with that of}} experimental values and is found to be in good agreement validating the numerical model. Parametric study {{to determine the effects of}} tool rotational and traverse speed on the performance of weld is carried out by predicting peak temperatures, flow stress, strain rate and normal force. The peak temperature during welding is found to be increase as tool rotation speed is increased at <b>constant</b> <b>traverse</b> speed leading to formation of defects due to lower flow stress and high strain rate. On the other hand as the tool traverse rate is increased the total heat input decreased which decreases weld temperature at constant rotational speed increasing the flow stress leading to formation of defects. This provides better insight about the peak temperature, flow stress and strain rate developed at different tool speeds by numerical modeling without conducting costlier experiments. The results predicted from the numerical modeling leads to the better understanding of effect of flow stress and strain rate on normal force which can be measured during FSW to aid the assessment of weld performance...|$|E

Different welded specimens were produced by employing a <b>constant</b> tool <b>traverse</b> speed of 120 mm/min and by varying rotating speeds from 800 to 3000 rpm. The welded joints were characterized by its appearances, microstructural and mechanical properties at room temperature. The measurement of different forces acted on the tool during the FSW of AA 5052 -O plates provided a significant insight to determine {{the quality of the}} welded joints. From the appearances of the welded joints it was evident that, except the tool rotational speed of 3000 rpm all other rotational speeds produced sound welded joints with smooth surface. The joint produced at 1000 rpm yielded a maximum tensile strength of 132 MPa which was 74 % of the base material strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses on the stir zone suggested that, beta-Mg 2 Al 3 intermetallic phases of the base material were mechanically fractured, smeared and mixed to different geometries due to tool stirring. The dissolution and redistribution of beta-Mg 2 Al 3 second phase particles in the stir zone had a considerable effect on the reduction of the tensile strength of the welded joints. The reduction in hardness at the nugget zone (NZ) of the welded joints under different tool rotational speeds could be attributed to the dislocation of Mg-rich phases and segregation of Mg solute atoms at grain boundaries, which drew solute Mg atoms away from the alpha-aluminum matrix.

Here he paused; for a light, proceeding from a fire of red-hot charcoal, permitted him to see the interior of the cave, and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of its inhabitant, by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished, being concealed by the shadow of the rock. What he observed would by no means have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task which he had undertaken.|$|R
50|$|During Irwin's {{period in}} charge the colony {{experienced}} difficulty in {{its relations with}} the Aboriginal people, and both colonists and Aboriginals were killed in different encounters such as the Pinjarra Massacre. After the killing of several settlers Irwin placed a bounty on the heads of the most aggressive Noongar warriors, including Yagan and Midgegooroo. This was to be among the most controversial of Irwin's initiatives during his tenure in the Swan River Colony. According to his account, immediately after a series of skirmishes Irwin conferred with his Executive Council ‘to take such steps for a prompt and summary retaliation, as the means at my disposal admitted.’ A proclamation was issued and published in the Perth Gazette offering a reward of 30 pounds for the capture ‘dead or alive’ of Yagan, and 20 pounds of ‘Midgigooroo’ and Munday. The proclamation declared Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws ‘deprived of the protection of British laws, and I do hereby authorize and command all and every His Majesty’s subjects residents in any part of this colony to capture, or aid or assist in capturing the body of the said ‘Egan’ DEAD OR ALIVE, and to produce the said body forthwith before the nearest Justice of the Peace.’ Frederick Irwin rationalized his actions to the Secretary of State in the following terms: This pecuniary stimulus has had the hoped for effect, by bringing forward some efficient volunteers among the Settlers whose ----- and occupations have necessarily given them a more intimate knowledge of the haunts of the natives in the neighbourhood of the settled district than is possessed by the Military, but no volunteers have received permission to act unless headed by a Magistrate or a Constable. Parties of the Military have also been in <b>constant</b> movement, <b>traversing</b> the bush is such directions as reports or conjecture rendered most likely to lead to a discovery of the lurking place of the offending tribes. These parties have all received express instructions to attempt the lives of no other than the three outlaws, unless hostility on the part of others of the tribe should render it necessary in self defense. I am happy to say these measures have already been attended with considerable effect. The whole of this hostile tribe have been harassed by the constant succession of parties sent against them, and in some instances have been hotly pursued to a considerable distance in different directions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Laser forming is a {{non-contact}} thermal {{forming process}} that can shape metallic components {{as a means of}} rapid prototyping and as a method of distortion correction, adjusting and alignment. The process utilises a defocused laser beam to introduce thermal stresses, without melting, that cause plastic deformation resulting in controlled deformation. To advance this process further for realistic forming applications in a manufacturing industry, it is necessary to consider controlled 3 D laser forming. The work presented in this paper uses a predictive and adaptive approach to control the 3 D laser forming of aluminium alloy 5251. Key to the control of the process has been the development of a predictive Matlab based model. This model calculates scan strategies derived from the required geometry. Scan lines are determined using lines of <b>constant</b> angle and <b>traverse</b> speed by considering the change in angle between these lines. The rate of forming and distribution of the magnitude of forming across the surface are controlled by the number of scan lines. When the geometry is not formed within one pass, an incremental adaptive approach is used for subsequent passes, utilising the error between the current and desired geometry to give a new scan strategy, By this means, any unwanted distortion due to material variability can be accounted for. Results are presented that demonstrate the controlled laser forming of a 3 D semi-developable shape in an accurate and repeatable way on both large and small scale components. The data presented represents a significant step towards a realistic laser forming system for the manufacturing environment. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the strengths and limitations of existing and emerging geophysical tools for landform studies. The objectives are to discuss recent technical developments and to provide a review of relevant recent literature, with a focus on propagating field methods with terrestrial applications. For various methods in this category, including ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity (ER), seismics, and electromagnetic (EM) induction, the technical backgrounds are introduced, followed by section on novel developments relevant to landform characterization. For several decades, GPR has been popular for characterization of the shallow subsurface and in particular sedimentary systems. Novel developments in GPR include the use of multi-offset systems to improve signal-to-noise ratios and data collection efficiency, amongst others, and the increased use of 3 D data. Multi-electrode ER systems have become popular in recent years as they allow for relatively fast and detailed mapping. Novel developments include time-lapse monitoring of dynamic processes as well as the use of capacitively-coupled systems for fast, non-invasive surveys. EM induction methods are especially popular for fast mapping of spatial variation, but {{can also be used to}} obtain information on the vertical variation in subsurface electrical conductivity. In recent years several examples of the use of plane wave EM for characterization of landforms have been published. Seismic methods for landform characterization include seismic reflection and refraction techniques and the use of surface waves. A recent development is the use of passive sensing approaches. The use of multiple geophysical methods, which can benefit from the sensitivity to different subsurface parameters, is becoming more common. Strategies for coupled and joint inversion of complementary datasets will, once more widely available, benefit the geophysical study of landforms. Three cases studies are presented on the use of electrical and GPR methods for characterization of landforms in the range of meters to 100. s of meters in dimension. In a study of polygonal patterned ground in the Saginaw Lowlands, Michigan, USA, electrical resistivity tomography was used to characterize differences in subsurface texture and water content associated with polygon-swale topography. Also, a sand-filled thermokarst feature was identified using electrical resistivity data. The second example is on the use of <b>constant</b> spread <b>traversing</b> (CST) for characterization of large-scale glaciotectonic deformation in the Ludington Ridge, Michigan. Multiple CST surveys parallel to an ~. 60. m high cliff, where broad (~. 100. m) synclines and narrow clay-rich anticlines are visible, illustrated that at least one of the narrow structures extended inland. A third case study discusses internal structures of an eolian dune on a coastal spit in New Zealand. Both 35 and 200. MHz GPR data, which clearly identified a paleosol and internal sedimentary structures of the dune, were used to improve understanding of the development of the dune, which may shed light on paleo-wind directions...|$|R
