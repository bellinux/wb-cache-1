5|$|The {{image of}} St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first {{appeared}} in the Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I. Following the death of King Alexander III in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the seal of the Guardians of Scotland who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent interregnum. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century. Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the Union Flag. There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the thistle, the nation's floral emblem (celebrated in the song, The Thistle o' Scotland), the Declaration of Arbroath, incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern tartan that often signifies a particular Scottish clan and the royal Lion Rampant flag. Highlanders <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, for the repeal in 1782 of the Act of 1747 prohibiting the wearing of tartans.|$|E
25|$|Three escapees giddily {{reach the}} outside, but Arden catches Shelley, who had distracted a patrolling {{attendant}} by performing oral sex on him. Grace, Kit, and Lana discuss {{heading for the}} main road where Lana is told she will be on her own at that point. In the dayroom, Thredson notices and reports the empty chairs. The Raspers, who are revealed to be humanoid, force the three escapees to return inside the asylum tunnel, where they stumble upon the dead Mexican and other corpses. Mary Eunice fetches a sobering Jude to tell her of the escape. Jude shuts the movie, and any other future group events, down, telling the group they <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> the missing sexual deviant, the Mexican, and Pepper (Naomi Grossman) for the disruption. Lana, Grace, and Kit, although shivering and wet, have returned to their seats.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between both clubs had become strained, {{not least because}} of Chelsea's financial advantage; the club was owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich. The day after Chelsea announced losses of £80million for 2005–06, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger expressed concern over his opponent's conduct: [...] "I have said many times that all the clubs should be balanced with their natural resources. That means they can only spend what they earn." [...] Chelsea manager José Mourinho refused to respond to Wenger's comments in his UEFA Champions League pre-match press conference, but made reference to his record in the competition in contrast to his counterpart: [...] "Many great managers {{in the world have}} never won it. The big example is not far from us; Arsène Wenger is a top manager in the world. He's a big manager in the world of football and he never did it so when I did it once, I <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> God for that. I have that." ...|$|E

50|$|By 1936 Schmidt's {{had become}} the 7th largest brewery in the country. It decided to offer City Club in {{flat-top}} cans like Hamm's.

Roosevelt, Schmidt's was granted a contract from the government to supply beer to the troops.|$|R
500|$|The Scandinavian Volunteer Corps (Skandinaviska Kåren) {{was not a}} true corps {{but rather}} a unit {{the size of a}} company, {{consisting}} of foreign volunteers. [...] Approximately half of the Corps (refer to the Order of battle) was ordered to hold a forward position in the gap between the high ground held by Cronje and De la Rey's forces during the night of 10–11 December. The rest of the force was entrenched in defensive positions some [...] further north-east. In {{the early morning hours of}} 11December, General Cronje ordered Commandant Tolly de Beer to abandon the outpost, but the order did not reach the Scandinavian section, which was left on its own. Save for seven men, this section was destroyed while holding back the attack of the Seaforth Highlanders, who were in the process denied access between the hills and prevented from reaching the Boer guns. Cronje understood the significance of this stand, and said in a subsequent letter to Kruger that [...] "next to God we <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> the Scandinavians for our victory".|$|E
2500|$|Bäckman {{regards the}} Taistoists {{movement}} of the 1970s, the hardline pro-Soviet faction in the Communist Party of Finland, as [...] "the best thing {{that happened in the}} history of Finland", [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> the Taistoists for high-quality science, art and culture we enjoy today", claims Bäckman. Bäckman was an independent candidate for European Parliament election in 2009 on the Workers Party of Finland list. He got 554 votes and was not allocated a seat.|$|E
2500|$|In a September 15, 2013 opinion {{piece in}} the New York Post {{entitled}} [...] "Obamacare will question your sex life", McCaughey wrote: [...] "Are you sexually active?

[...] Be ready {{to answer those questions}} and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether it's the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why you're seeking medical help.

2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely {{due to the fact that}} I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fishermen's prayers {{may have}} been {{answered}} in 1989, as a record tuna catch brought an infusion of prosperity to San Pedro's fishermen and also to Mary Star of the Sea. [...] The catch that year included 767 of the biggest Pacific blue fin tuna ever taken by a commercial fishing fleet, each fish weighing 300 to 1,000 pounds—a size never seen or caught before. [...] The giant tuna generated [...] "the biggest excitement in years for San Pedro's fishing fleet." [...] One San Pedro fisherman referred to the unusual catch as [...] "God's gift to the San Pedro fishermen," [...] and another called it [...] "a miracle." [...] At the time, the Los Angeles Times did a feature article on the giant fish, focusing on the tight relationship between the fishermen and Mary Star of the Sea. [...] The article noted that the fishermen and cannery workers of San Pedro had provided most of the funding to build the new Mary Star of the Sea Catholic Church in the 1950s. [...] Msgr. Gallagher, interviewed by the Times, noted that the church, too, had benefited from the fishermen's good fortune: [...] "Our collections {{the last couple of}} months are noticeably higher than usual. I think you <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> those big fish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirchner {{was then}} {{admitted}} to The Bellevue Sanatorium, run by Ludwig Binswanger, in Kreuzlingen where {{he continued to}} produce paintings and woodcuts. In 1918, Kirchner was given a residence permit and he moved to [...] "In den Lärchen" [...] in Frauenkirch Davos where he rented a room {{on the first floor}} and eventually the above rooms in 1919, which he decorated with furniture that he carved. He wrote of the house to Henry van de Velde: [...] "I’m living in a beautiful old Grisons house with a kitchen that looks like Rembrandt’s studio". Kirchner overcame his illness and, although he was still dependent on morphine, his doctor was slowly decreasing his doses. He also writes [...] "A Painter's Credo" [...] where he states: [...] "There is an intellectual guardianship over the world, it is man…. This is the last judgement, before them you stand….. They help you when you work. You <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> them only through work. When you want to die, they sometimes appear to you. When you are completely empty and completely open, you belong to them". Erna Schilling, his life partner, visited him periodically in Frauenkirch, while also maintaining a residence in Berlin to take care of Kirchner's business there.|$|E

2500|$|Villumsen {{rode the}} New Zealand National Time Trial Championships in January before backing off until June. She rode the Giro Rosa and won La Route de France {{and the time}} trial at the Tour Cycliste Féminin International de l'Ardèche before heading to World Championships. [...] "It was a {{different}} year for me but a good year." [...] She said in an interview. [...] "I started late and with a different approach. I trained more at home and then did race after race. I enjoyed it. I was still there on the podium so I <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> my team for helping me this far." [...] Villumsen, a former a Danish national road race champion, switched her nationality in 2010 from Danish to New Zealandish. It was her fifth straight podium {{at the world championships}} in the time trial. She took her first bronze in 2009, 2010 and 2012, and won silver in her former home county in 2011. [...] "It's not bad luck." [...] Villumsen said. [...] "If someone is better, they deserve to win. Ellen van Dijk has been riding very well all throughout the year, she has won all kinds of time trials, short ones, long ones. She really deserved to win. A place on the podium is still nice. I go close every year but something is missing. I'll try to work it out and {{go all the way to}} the top perhaps next year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Informal logic as a {{distinguished}} enterprise under this name emerged roughly {{in the late}} 1970s as a sub-field of philosophy. The naming of the field was preceded {{by the appearance of}} a number of textbooks that rejected the symbolic approach to logic on pedagogical grounds as inappropriate and unhelpful for introductory textbooks on logic for a general audience, for example Howard Kahane's Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric, subtitled [...] "The Use of Reason in Everyday Life", first published in 1971. Kahane's textbook was described on the notice of his death in the Proceedings And Addresses of the American Philosophical Association (2002) as [...] "a text in informal logic, [...] was intended to enable students to cope with the misleading rhetoric one frequently finds in the media and in political discourse. It was organized around a discussion of fallacies, and {{was meant to be a}} practical instrument for dealing with the problems of everyday life. ... gone through many editions; ... still in print; and the thousands upon thousands of students who have taken courses in which his text ... used <b>can</b> <b>thank</b> Howard for contributing to their ability to dissect arguments and avoid the deceptions of deceitful rhetoric. He tried to put into practice the ideal of discourse that aims at truth rather than merely at persuasion. (Hausman et al. 2002)" [...] Other textbooks from the era taking this approach were Michael Scriven's Reasoning (Edgepress, 1976) and Logical Self-Defense by Ralph Johnson and J. Anthony Blair, first published in 1977. Earlier precursors in this tradition can be considered Monroe Beardsley's Practical Logic (1950) and Stephen Toulmin's The Uses of Argument (1958).|$|E
