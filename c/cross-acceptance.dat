30|$|The key {{to solving}} the central problem for <b>cross-acceptance</b> and {{interchangeability}} of certified systems and components produced by different European suppliers is to agree on safety standards and their approval model at the European level. By means of this, the European market can be opened for all products certified by national or even local authorities.|$|E
30|$|The {{example of}} the {{railways}} shows that the cross acceptance of certified vehicles has started. On {{the basis of the}} three railway packages after a long time of negotiations the first step for the Railways was done on 16 th April, 2008 by French and German authorities signing a contract to simplify the <b>cross-acceptance</b> of Railway vehicles of both countries. By means of this, the costs for certification of railway vehicles in the respective countries, France or Germany, will be reduced by 70 % [15].|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} for track loading limits {{are one of}} the main barriers to simple <b>cross-acceptance</b> of vehicles where rolling stock that is already operating successfully in one (or more) networks has to be retested before it can be approved for operation on another network. DynoTRAIN Work Package 4 studied this area in order to determine whether the additional requirements were justified, or if the process could be made much cheaper and simpler without increasing the risk of track deterioration for the networks. The review of national requirements identified modified criteria and limit values for track forces in some member states; however, these can be obtained from additional analysis of the normal test results with no new tests required. The influence of design rail inclination has also been found not to be significant, provided a realistic range of wheel–rail contact conditions are included in the tests. For line speeds {{greater than or equal to}} 160 [*]km/h, the current standards for track construction across the member states appear to be similar. On lower speed lines in some countries, a ‘weaker’ track condition may require a lower limit on one of the vehicle assessment parameters. Track dynamics modelling has shown that the vehicle assessment parameters used in international standards are suitable for use in <b>cross-acceptance</b> for track forces. The use of multiple regression analysis allows the estimated maximum value for relevant parameters to be evaluated for different target conditions and then compared with the appropriate limit value, or with values for existing, comparable vehicles. Guidance has also been provided on the relevant parameters to consider when developing operating controls for different types of track deterioration...|$|E
40|$|Using {{the idea}} of regime {{formation}} and cooperation in international political economy as a guide, this paper assesses the first stage (Cross-cceptance) of implementing the New Jersey stateplanning process {{as an attempt to}} construct a base of mutually shared norms and interests between state and local governments in the area of land use planning. The conclusion is that the first round of implementation was instrumental in building norms and consensus-especially in the face of strong resistance to state planning from the policy environment. The main reason for the effectiveness of the <b>Cross-Acceptance</b> process was that it brought local, county and state officials to a forum where they were able to discuss areas of consensus and discord.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the work performed in Work Package 6 of the European project DynoTRAIN. Its {{task was to}} investigate the effects that uncertainties present within the track and running conditions have on the simulated behaviour of a railway vehicle. Methodologies and frameworks for using virtual simulation and statistical tools, in order to reduce both the cost and time required for the certification of new or modified railway vehicles, were proposed. In particular, the project developed a virtual test track (VTT) toolkit that is capable of both generating a series of test tracks based on measurements, which can be used in vehicle virtual testing using computer simulation models, and also automatically handling the output results. The toolkit is compliant with prEN 14363 : 2013. The VTT was used as an experimental tool to analyse cross-correlations between track data (input) and matching vehicle response (output) based on data recorded using a test train. This paper discusses the issues encountered in the process and suggests avenues for future developments and potential use in the context of European <b>cross-acceptance.</b> The VTT offers benefits to the areas of design development and regulatory certificatio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMODSafe – Modular Urban Transport Safety and Security Analysis – {{is one of}} {{the latest}} {{projects}} in the European Transport sector under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7) for Research and Technological Development of the European Union. CThe purpose of the MODSafe project is to undertake research of major steps of the Safety Life Cycle of urban guided transport systems in Europe. Even if the rail safety landscape in urban guided transport is highly diversified, the sector will benefit from some kind of harmonization. Furthermore, security items are considered more and more as vital for the urban transport sector. The 22 partners are from industry, associations, R&D organisations, consultants and operators. VThe MODSafe project successfully started in 2008 with state of the art evaluations and initial models. Hazard analyses, safety requirements as well as functional and object models have been developed in the safety sector, while a life cycle approach proposal and an approval approach were established in the process sector. For the security sector, the existing means and technologies for security systems have been analysed, forming the base for a model reference under development. As an outlook to the project closure in August 2012, one can expect reasonable suggestions for the future, aiming to contribute to the European drive for harmonize and to simplify the upgrade/modernization or new construction of urban guided transport systems. <b>Cross-Acceptance</b> {{is one of the}} key attempts to the benefit of all parties involved, be it the manufacturers and suppliers, the operators or the safety authorities. This paper briefly presents the MODSafe key findings and results...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo date, {{the railway}} {{application}} standards EN 50126 ff series - being transferred to international IEC level - {{have reached a}} mature state and are implemented in practically every new rail technology project. These standards do not only apply to heavy rail systems - as their heading ‘Railway applications’ may imply, but also to light rail and urban mass transportation including metro and people mover systems. The standard 50126 requires a “Safety Plan”, covering – beyond others – planning for Independent Safety Assessment. The Independent Safety Assessor's role is to verify, that the required level of safety and quality is achieved by all actors concerned to ensure a safe implementation of the project to the required safety standards. It {{is the goal of}} an Independent Safety Assessment to put the Safety Authority into a position to grant the allowance for operations (licensing) after the finalisation of all necessary evaluations, examinations, analyses, inspections, tests, etc. The license can be issued for single modes or sub-modes of operation. Independent Safety Assessment is to the clear benefit of all parties involved. Manufacturers and System Suppliers can take credit of the third party opinion on their supply and of the application of <b>cross-acceptance</b> (with the re-use of assessor generic product/generic application certificates), Operators are given increased confidence independent from potential supplier constraints and the responsible Safety Authorities can limit their resources and activities to the legal responsibility. A description of proven assessment processes and methodologies and selected examples of complex railway systems – including driverless operation and new technologies – underline these benefits...|$|E
