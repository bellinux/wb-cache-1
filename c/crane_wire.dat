40|$|Abstract—The {{reliable}} and safe use of wire rope {{is crucial for}} crane operations. Wire rope is a very useful and long lasting structural element when properly used and maintained. Therefore, wire rope safety is (or should be) a constant concern of wire rope operators and safety authorities. Safe use of the <b>crane</b> <b>wire</b> ropes depends directly on the rope condition, and on the in-time and reliable rope inspection. This study {{is focused on the}} failure analysis of <b>crane</b> <b>wire</b> ropes in service in Morocco. Wire defects and condition of a lifting rope have been studied and presented in this paper. Special attention is given to conditions that can lead to internal damage such as broken wires, wear as well as corrosion. Various nondestructive tests methods have been used in this application for wire ropes control such as visual inspection, radiographic and electromagnetic. The results of the nondestructive testing have made it possible to determine the safety status of a rope and establish preventive maintenance procedures to extend the useful life of a rope. It is concluded that maintenance, inspection and discard policy must be determined in recognition of the degradation mechanisms that operate in different rope applications.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyRiserless light well {{intervention}} technology (RLWI) is {{the latest}} addition to the subsea light well intervention market. Beginning operation in mid 2005, the technology {{has the advantage of}} utilizing a special subsea lubricator to perform intervention activities in water depths of up to 1200 m without the need for marine risers. Utilizing the technology, oil companies have been able to save up to 50 % on intervention costs. Nonetheless, RLWI has its own draw backs. In the last 4 years, it has seen up to 25 % downtime due to waiting on weather (WOW). A look at the weather criteria of one of the RLWI vessels, Island Wellserver, indicates module deployment and retrieval to be the weather limiting operation. In this thesis work, it is attempted to identify the critical elements of the module deployment system and analyze their significance in the objective of raising the operational weather limit. Hence the module handling system was carefully studied. Critical failure modes were found to be failure of <b>crane</b> <b>wire</b> due to excess loading, failure of lower cursor system due to impact loading and clashing of module to moonpool walls. Analysis of the module deployment system against these failure modes was ensued. Orcaflex simulation software was selected. System guide wires, <b>crane</b> <b>wire,</b> vessel and moonpool were modelled. DNV recommended practice with appropriate calibration was utilized to calculate hydrodynamic coefficients for the module. Asgard field data was selected, 1 -year unrestricted current condition was employed, regular wave analysis for module in moonpool and irregular wave analysis for module beneath moonpool was performed. Finally, sensitivity of the failure parameters to the system particulars was studied. The results showed the moonpool sea-state to be a defining parameter, as would be expected. However, surprisingly enough, the study found that the vessel length is not directly related to the moonpool sea-state and a longer vessel does not necessarily mean a better platform for the module deployment operation. For the rest of the particulars studied, higher guide wires tensions, wider moonpool and active heave compensation all have a positive effect in handling the environmental loads. Although, changing moonpool dimensions affect hydrodynamics positively, their significance is small due to dependency on vessel’s breadth. Based on these results and available data for analysis, a recommended system particulars was tested. Significance improvement, up to 45 %, in lowering the risk of failure was observed. A design weather limit for the recommended system was found to be less than HS = 2. 5 m. This attributes to a 28 % waiting on weather per operation with an operation reference period of TR = 13 h. However, estimation of complex hydrodynamic coefficients proved to be challenging and was taken conservatively. Model tests of module is recommended for this purpose. Further, a better software package like SIMO would be preferred to Orcaflex for such types of analysis...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringLarge {{competition}} in the offshore industry requires innovative solutions to satisfy the demand. A new concept of spool installations is considered where three large spools are lifted in an integrated protection structure designed to support the spools during the lift and protect them from impact loads associated with fishing activities and dropped objects after installation. By integrating the spool and protection structure, the time needed for the installation will be significantly reduced. Installation of subsea structures and equipment involves a lifting operation where the object is exposed to large hydrodynamic forces when entering the oscillating sea-surface. The largest load during the structures lifetime may occur during the installation and could be snap forces after slack, or overload due to dynamic forces when the structure is lifted from the vessel and into the water, {{which is why the}} lifting analysis is considered in this thesis. The purpose of this report is to verify the structural integrity of the new concept, designed as a complex framework structure and determine the maximum allowable sea state in which the structure can be installed safely. A static analysis is performed where all structural parts are checked according to Eurocode 3 ensuring that no parts of the framework (or spools) are overloaded during the lift. The dynamic forces associated with the lift was accounted for using a dynamic amplification factor to magnify the static force and represent loads occurring during lift off from deck until the structure is fully submerged. From the static analysis, the assumed dynamic forces in slings and <b>crane</b> <b>wire</b> are obtained and compared to associated forces from the dynamic analysis. A dynamic analysis is performed by creating a simplified model in a marine dynamics program where the structure was analyzed in different sea states characterized by the JONSWAP spectra. The tension in slings and <b>crane</b> <b>wire</b> are considered {{to make sure that they}} are not subjected to slack or larger forces than the structure can withstand which is represented by the dynamic amplification factor defined in the static analysis. Time domain analysis is performed comparing deterministic (extreme) and stochastic (most probable) values to obtain the limiting sea state for different wave headings, wave periods and significant wave heights which characterize the sea state in which the structure will be installed. The forces on the “real structure” can be obtained with a scale factor that is obtained assuming that the hydrodynamic forces are proportional to the largest relative increase in mass or solid projected area with respect to the simplified model. The assumption is appropriate since the simplified model has the same structural properties as the “real structure” with less structural members. According to the dynamic analysis, the structure could be installed in irregular waves characterized by the JONSWAP spectra with significant wave heights equal or less than 2. 5 meter (not including uncertainties in weather forecast). The associated max utilized member with respect to design loads had a utilization ratio of 80 % (no 100 % utilized members) to account for uncertainties in the structural design that must be finalized before the installation of the spools is performed...|$|E
40|$|A typical {{installation}} of a subsea structure with mono hull offshore construction vessel is studied. Focus {{has been on the}} vessel motions, lifting arrangement and the planning of this operation. The behaviour of vessel motions are studied with the available transfer functions of the vessel at centre of gravity. The key transfer functions for Heave, Pitch and Roll are discussed when the wave propagates in head and beam seas. The transfer functions used are qualitatively verified for their correctness and usage in this study. Then, the heave motion at two different points far away from the CoG of the vessel are studied to see the difference in heave motion. Transfer functions at cranetip are derived, as this is the main excitation for the dynamics on the <b>crane</b> <b>wire.</b> The derived transfer function at the crane tip is verified against the results from SIMA software. In the lifting arrangement study, transfer functions for the vertical motion of the suspended load are derived by assuming linear relationship between crane tip motion and motion of the mass. Then, using that transfer function, the transfer function for the dynamic tension on the <b>crane</b> <b>wire</b> is derived for the wave in head sea and beam sea. To improve the lifting arrangement system, the heave compensation system is introduced with a discussion about its efficiency. To obtain the limiting sea state for this operation, a deterministic and a stochastic approach have been followed. In the stochastic method, JONSWAP spectrum is used for the total sea case which propagated in head sea and beam sea respectively. Then, combined sea spectrum i. e. double peak spectrum for the wind sea with head sea direction introduced and swell sea which here is simplified to always propagate between the direction of head and beam seas, is used to obtain limiting sea state accounting the effect of crossing sea approximately. Respective response spectrum is then derived based on linearity of the response and assumption that response of swell sea is not effected by the wind sea from a different direction and vice versa. The discussion is made about the comparison of the approaches followed to obtain the limiting sea state. Sensitivity study on the probability of exceedance of critical response is shown as well. For planning of this operation, 60 years of hindcast data are used. The hindcast data taken are corrected based on the wind speed measurement available. And the discrete values of the spectral peak period in the data are uniformly distributed. After randomization of Tp, annual and monthly scatter tables of Hs and Tp, and plots have been produced to see the percentage of times available for a sea state during a year and monthly. Likewise, for Hs ≤ 2 m, the average percentages of non-exceedance of this sea state are produced for various months. Since the scatter table do not give any info regarding the duration of the sea state, the average durations of sea state for Hs ≤ 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m are calculated. Then, since number of available windows are useful for planning an operation, the average number of windows available for Hs ≤ 2 m, and duration 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours are screened through the hindcast data and presented. Finally, dividing an operation into smaller phases, here 72 hours operations divided into 48 + 24 hours, 24 + 24 + 24 hours, are studied and discussed about the change in percentage of successful operation and average number of days to complete that operation, in a month using the 60 years of hindcast data...|$|E
40|$|There are 22 {{construction}} {{support vessels}} in the DOF Group that have active heave compensated cranes with lifting capacity of above 50 tonnes. The Brazilian flagged Skandi Salvador was chosen to represent the fleet in terms of specifications, since she {{was close to the}} average numbers for size, age and capacity. She has a NOV crane with SWL of 140 t. There are two main types of maintenance; preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance. Fault distributions can be used to evaluate which type of maintenance that should be performed, and in which intervals. Maintenance management should be a process of continuous improvement, with focus on planning, execution, reporting and analysis in order to establish and revise resource needs, goals and requirements, and the maintenance program itself. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Risk Based Inspection (RBI) are useful methods to establish an optimal maintenance and inspection program, based on functional demands, functional faults, and prevention of these functional faults. The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) concept and the ?Newsboy? model are mathematical decision models {{that can be used to}} decide number of spares to be ordered, order point, safety level, and investments in capital spare parts. Seven areas of improvement for the maintenance practice in the DOF Group were proposed: 1. 	Informal experience to be made formal. 2. 	Formalize the maintenance management processes. 3. 	Introduce scientific methods like Reliability Centered Maintenance and Risk Based Inspection to establish maintenance program. 4. 	Introduce scientific methods for spare parts management. 5. 	Introduce a fleet-oriented philosophy for all aspects of the maintenance practice, especially for spare parts management. 6. 	Bring the users closer to decisions regarding the MMS 7. 	Increase practical usability of critical equipment classification. The main objective of spare parts management is to find the optimal numbers, types and locations for spare parts needed to perform the desired tasks with as high uptime as possible. In effect, to have spare parts available when they are needed, but to avoid stocking spare parts that are not needed. At the heart of the proposed spare parts management philosophy lie fleet orientation, formalization, and scientific methods. A spare part evaluation work process is proposed, consisting of 6 phases: 1. 	Basic input. Where the actor responsible collects the data necessary for making the evaluation. 2. 	Spare part categorization. The spare parts are categorized in three categories, based on given criteria. 3. 	Risk assessment. A consequence classification is carried out to decide the desired probability of having a spare available during procurement lead time for operational spares and consumables. 4. 	Decision tools. Two different decision tools are utilized to make optimal decisions for the spare parts considered. 5. 	Output. The decisions are summarized and carried out. Information related to the capital spare parts decisions are entered into a newly established capital spare parts experience register. 6. 	MMS. The results from the spare part evaluations are inserted in the maintenance management system. An important part of the proposed spare parts management philosophy is the ability to make optimal decisions in changing environments. If the evaluation process is not dynamic, the actors responsible will soon revert to the former, subjective methods for making decisions. So, whenever a change in the operation of a vessel is planned or registered, the project/vessel manager should ask himself how this change might affect the input parameters of the decision tools. This forms the basis for the proposed dynamic spare part evaluation work process. The decision tool for capital spares is built around the relation between the expected cost of holding a spare part and not needing it, versus the expected cost of not having it when you need it. When basing the evaluation on significantly lower delivery times than estimated by the manufacturer, the optimal capital spare parts investment decisions for the offshore crane on Skandi Salvador were to purchase all the recommended parts, except the largest <b>crane</b> <b>wire.</b> Using the estimated delivery times from the manufacturer, the optimal decisions were clearly to purchase all the recommended spare parts. At the delivery time of Skandi Salvador, the DOF Group chose to only purchase four of the items on the list of recommended capital spare parts. The capital spare parts investment decisions taken by the DOF Group at the delivery time of the vessel are therefore considered sub-optimal compared to the findings in this thesis, and the DOF Group is advised to purchase the remaining capital spare parts on the list of recommended spare parts. The decision tool for operational spares and consumables finds the optimal order quantity, order point and safety stock. An important input parameter is the desired probability of having enough spare during procurement lead time. This parameter is set based on the consequence classification for the part. The decision tool was used to make decisions for optimal order quantity, order point and safety stock for a list of recommended spare parts for the offshore crane on Skandi Salvador...|$|E

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} has become more challenging the past years and marine operations must be performed in smarter and more cost-effective ways. Waiting on weather should be minimised and design and planning will be of high importance. A marine operation shall be designed to bring an object from one safe condition to another safe condition. A subsea lift consists of different phases that should be evaluated during the planning process, where the through splash zone phase is usually most critical. In order to account for uncertainty in weather forecast, the operation's design criterion is reduced by an alpha-factor. Installations of protection covers are common offshore operations, but only a few hydrodynamic investigations have been performed on such objects. This Master Thesis describes a study aimed at finding as high operational criterion as possible for an installation of a GRP pipeline protection cover. Further investigations were performed on the differences in use of numerical simulations and DNV GL's Simplified Method. The operation's operability was investigated for the two different operational criteria. For a light lift operation, the occurrence of slack in slings are critical and does usually determine the maximum operational sea state. Slack arises when the total hydrodynamic force acting on the object exceeds 90 % of its submerged weight. The lift was simulated for the splash zone phase in the non-linear time domain simulation program, SIMA. The minimum tension that arose in the slings for each wave condition with random seed number, were used to develop a Gumbel distribution. The sea state was categorised as operational if the 10 % quantile, found by an inversed Gumbel CDF, was above the slack requirement. The lifting system consisted of the vessel s crane tip, a <b>crane</b> <b>wire,</b> a hook, a hook winch, four slings, a spreader bar and the cover. The cover was implemented as slender elements in SIMA, were each slender element was given depth dependent added mass and drag. The implemented hydrodynamic parameters were estimated by CFD-analyses. The cover was lifted with an angle of 68 degrees, and the short-term environmental conditions were characterised by short-crested JONSWAP wave spectra. The installation was defined as a weather restricted level B marine operation. The total hydrodynamic force was manually estimated by the Simplified Method. The respective added mass and drag were calculated by use of tabulated coefficients for rectangular flat plates, in two directions; longitudinal and perpendicular to the cover flanges. The total added mass for a rotated cover was found by summing the vertical components of the longitudinal and perpendicular added mass. The largest tension variations occurred right after the cover was fully submerged, hence slamming and varying buoyancy forces could be omitted. The inertia and drag forces were dependent on the most probable largest crane tip motion, found by the crane tip and vessel COG locations. The maximum sea state was assessed by use of linear scaling. The average manually estimated design criterion was 1. 64 m and constant for all peak periods. Hence with an alpha-factor of 0. 76 the operational criterion was 1. 25 m. For each wave condition, 20 - 30 lowering simulations were performed with random seed numbers. The average winch speed was 0. 2 m/s and the cover was lowered to a depth of approximately 33 m. Both the spreader bar and the cover experienced large motions in air. The motions diminished when the cover entered the water. The tension variation in the lifting system increased when the cover entered the splash zone and calmed down when the cover was lowered to 20 meter depth. The simulated design criteria were found by investigating the tension in the lifting slings. No large snap forces were observed after a slack condition. The simulated design criteria were dependent on both significant wave heights and peak periods. The average design criterion was independent of peak periods and determined to be 2. 5 m. Hence with an alpha-factor of 0. 81 the operational criterion was 2 m. The operation can take place if the wave conditions are below the operational criteria over a longer duration than the operation's reference period. The operability was investigated for two fields; Heidrun and Tanzania Block 2. The reference periods were dependent on the water depth, and thus determined to be 2. 5 hours and 9. 3 hours for the two fields respectively. The operability and actual duration of operation with a random start were heavily season dependent, and were studied for both the manually estimated and simulated operational criteria. When the operational criterion increased from 1. 25 m to 2 m the operability increased with 30 - 50 % at both fields. At the same time the actual duration of operation with a random start decreased with up to 80 % at Heidrun. That is, for a given reference period, the waiting on weather decreased with the corresponding. Generally, at both fields the reason of waiting on weather was due to storm periods, where the wave conditions were above the operational criterion. The operational limit was determined by several factors; the installation method, the environmental conditions, the crane tip motion, the alpha-factor and the tension airing in the slings. According to this one can say that an operation should be short {{in order to be able}} to take place often. For increased operational criteria the operability increased and waiting on weather decreased. If the operation should take place at a random time, the risk of waiting on weather will increase. Usually, a marine operation is planned ahead of execution and is based on weather forecasts. Such planning will with a high probability reduce waiting on weather and increase the operation efficiency. In order to determine the highest operational sea state as possible in such a way that waiting on weather can be reduced, simulations should be performed prior to installations of pipeline protection covers. Hence operational costs, engine idling and pollution can be significantly reduced compared to only relying on the simplified method...|$|E

The first part focuses on the {{identification}} and modeling of a Bosch Rexroth variable piston pump in both frequency and time domain. The second part presents a hydraulic load circuit which is mounted inside a test container. The load circuit is used to test the pump in a suitable load situation which represents a small scale Active Heave Compensation (AHC) scenario. The considered pump is named A 4 VSG, and the internal swash plate angle is controlled with a hydraulically driven control system delivered by Bosch Rexroth. Several frequency response tests have been carried out to identify the swash plate angle dynamics. In the time domain, a stochastic input signal have been used to evaluate and verify the time domain response of the internal pump states. In addition to the traditional frequency response test, a proposed method to identify the swash plate dynamics using a single chirp signal test is presented. The chirp signal is a multi-cycle sine wave with a linearly increasing frequency with time. The chirp test analysis have proven promising results, and should be investigated further in other system identification applications. The two main pump modeling techniques proposed are; a Black box model using a linear transfer function and a non-linear Grey box model, where all the unknown model parameters have been identified through non-linear optimization in MATLAB. The accuracy of the proposed models are quantified using the mean and maximum deviation between measured and simulated response in both time and frequency domain. An accurate Grey box model have been identified through non-linear parameter optimization, and a corresponding SimulationX model is created. The simulation model also includes a simplified ripple flow. The simplified ripple flow is found through a mechanical study of the internal piston movements. To quantify the ripple flow effect on the surrounding hydraulic components, two system simulations have been studied and discussed. The second part of the thesis proposes a hydraulic load circuit using a 4 / 3 -way directional servo valve to control the load pressure across a variable displacement piston motor. The motor is connected to a secondary motor using a mechanical coupling. The secondary motor is placed in a closed hydraulic loop which is controlled using the A 4 VSG pump described in the first part. The load circuit’s purpose is to apply a load torque at the mechanical coupling as the A 4 VSG’s output flow controls the rotational velocity of the coupling. The couplings velocity reference signal is supposed to represent an offshore <b>crane’s</b> <b>wire</b> drum motion during AHC. The two control systems controlling the load pressure and the shaft speed respectively, are designed based on linear control theory. The controllers were tuned using MATLAB’s controller tuning toolbox. In order to use this tool, the systems were described using linearized transfer functions. The resulting controllers have been implemented using a National Instruments LabVIEW program. In the end the friction torque in both motors combined have been modeled using a non-linear friction model. This model have been used to represent both the stiction and Coulomb friction in the SimulationX model representing the load circuit.

40|$|HeeremaMarine Contractors (HMC) {{owns and}} {{operates}} several semi-submersible crane vessels (SSCV) used for offshore heavy lift operations. Throughout the engineering phase of a (dual crane) heavy lift, dynamic lift models are generated by combining bodies with their hydrodynamic properties, inertia and spring-dashpot elements. The models represent the mass-spring system of a heavy lift over the different lift stages during a topside installation. These stages characterize the free floating, load transfer, free hanging and set down phases. Hook load fluctuations are governed by the relative vertical motion of the load and the crane boom tip. At the load transfer phase this motion is governed by both {{the motion of the}} vessel and the barge, whereas for the free hanging phase it is mostly effected by the motion of the vessel. To achieve safe and successful projects, an accurate prediction of the load and motion responses is essential while advising offshore personnel about the lift to perform. At the moment an inconsistency exists between predicted load fluctuations and offshore crane measurements. This is the main reason for this research. Until now a simplified spring-damper system is used to incorporate the hoist wire reeving system of a crane. This simplification is not fully justified and three goals are set up to model this in a more detailed manner. Firstly, the driving parameters of the load-crane-vessel system are assessed. Secondly the dynamic behavior of the wire reeving system is captured in a numerical model in Simulink. Finally, the dynamic load fluctuations of the model are compared with offshore measurements to both validate the model and analyze the results. The dynamical model of the load-crane-vessel system is solved in the time domain and it consists of two parts. The first part considers the sheave and wire system of the crane. An equation of motion is derived for each sheave where dry friction is taken into account and leads to a stick-slip effect. This friction originates from the sheave bearings and from the bending friction of the steel wire rope that runs over it. When a load is raised, the stress in each rope part increases from the winch to the dead end. With a lowering operation the effect is the opposite. Due to stick-slip this force difference remains in the <b>crane</b> <b>wires</b> after the operation. The friction factors of the sheaves in the numerical model are tuned with steps observed in offshore load measurements during crane operations. The second part of the model imposes the measured vessel motions to calculate the motion of both crane boom tips and the topside. This is performed by applying their influences as external forces on the free bodies. With the relativemotion the response of the hoist wire forces is determined. A coupling of these two parts can be made by removing the element of the hoist wire in the imposed motion model and replacing it by a pair of two nonlinear forces determined fromthe sheave wire model. These forces have an opposite sign and are equal in absolutemagnitude and phase. The effect of friction on dynamic hook load fluctuations is also consideredwith inputs of different amplitudes and frequencies. The hook load fluctuations at the measuring sheave are lower than applied fluctuations in the model when friction is taken into account. The simulated force at the measuring sheave is better represented with higher load fluctuations as the stick condition is exceeded earlier. Offshore and Dredging Engineerin...|$|R

Any training under safer circumstances is therefore veryvaluable, enter the need for ship simulators. Ship simulators today incorporate manyfeatures, such as <b>cranes,</b> anchors, <b>wires,</b> and state of the art physics. However, theinclusion of ice is very rare due to the complexity of simulating the feedback from theice breaking progress. The purpose of this project is to build a model and numerical methods to simulate icefracture in real-time, which is to be used in ship simulators. The model presented inthis project is implemented {{with the use of the}} physics engine AgX Multiphysics madeby Algoryx Simulation ABThe method represents the ice sheet as a non-homogeneous mesh. A collision with thehull of the ship injects deformation energy into the ice. The energy from the inelasticimpact is distributed on the ice sheet according to a quasi-static crack propagationmodel that is dened on a static mesh. The cracks are guided using stress elds thatapproximate the strain in each vertex. The distribution of the strain is done by a simplemodel which allows for breaking ice in non-uniform fragments. This is more realisticthan fracture in predened shapes which is the main contribution of this project. Thefragments become unbreakable rigid body ice oes that interact with the ship's hull bycollision and friction. The implementation of the ice model is tested by using a trimesh model of the TorViking II icebreaker using approximated buoyancy calculations, damping equations,and engine forces. Real-time performance is not achieved yet in the general case, but this is due to thechoice of collision geometry and the oe creation. Unstable force spikes from thecontacts between the ship and the ice is detected, but the overall global ice resistanceshows few abnormalities. Replacing the collision geometry and the rigid body oes isnecessary for the implementation to be able to run in real-time. Further experimentsto compare with real model data is needed to be able to validate the model...|$|R

The statue was unveiled on 5 May 1958, the Japanese Children's Day holiday. Sadako Sasaki, who died of an atomic bomb disease radiation poisoning is immortalized {{at the top of}} the statue, where she holds a <b>wire</b> <b>crane</b> above her head. Shortly before she passed, she had a vision to create a thousand cranes. Japanese tradition says that if one creates a thousand cranes, they are granted one wish. Sadako's wish was to have a world without nuclear weapons. Thousands of origami cranes from all over the world are offered around the monument. They serve as a sign that the children who make them and those who visit the statue desire a world without nuclear war, having been tied to the statue by the story that Sadako died from radiation-induced leukemia after folding just under a thousand cranes, wishing for world peace. However, an exhibit which appeared in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum stated that by the end of August 1955, Sadako had achieved her goal and continued to fold more cranes. Unfortunately, her wish was not granted and she died of the leukemia on October 25, 1955. Her main reason of death was from the radiation poisoning from the atomic bomb Little Boy.|$|R
