However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will do what they <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E

Total Films review gave War of the Worlds 4 out of 5 stars, considering that [...] "Spielberg finds fresh juice in a tale already adapted for film, TV, stage, radio and record", and describing the film as having many [...] "startling images", comparing the first Tripod attack to the Omaha Beach landing from Saving Private Ryan.|$|E

500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it a bit to expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God gave me my body, you know. I'm just doing what I <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it look good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, to show that you have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E

The plaintiffs opposed allowing the groups or the City to intervene. On August 19, Judge Walker denied the legal groups' motions to intervene but granted the City's, albeit in a limited capacity. Despite the other groups' failed attempt {{to intervene in}} the lawsuit, they offered support to the legal team litigating the case, with James Esseks of the ACLU saying: [...] "e are interested in doing whatever we <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure their case is as successful as possible".|$|E

For that, Valve takes the concept of [...] "Valve Time" [...] as a compliment, and that [...] "having customers consistently looking at our property or something you've done and saying, can you give me more" [...] is evidence that they are making the right decisions with their game releases, according to Holtman. The company does try to avoid unintentional delays of their projects, and believes that the earlier occurrences of [...] "Valve Time" [...] delays, primarily from Half-Life development, has helped them improve their release schedules.|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} {{wisdom of}} removing the dam has been frequently questioned. Some observers, such as Carl Pope (Director of the Sierra Club), stated that Hodel had political motives [...] in proposing the study. The imputed motive was {{to divide the}} environmental movement: to see residents of the strongly Democratic city of San Francisco coming out against an environmental issue. Dianne Feinstein, the mayor of San Francisco at the time, said in a Los Angeles Times story in 1987: [...] "All this is for an expanded campground?... It's dumb, dumb, dumb." [...] Hodel, now retired, is still a strong proponent of restoring Hetch Hetchy Valley and now-Senator Feinstein is still strongly against restoration. The George W. Bush administration proposed allocating $7 million to studying {{the removal of the}} dam in the 2007 National Park Service budget. Dianne Feinstein opposed this allocation, saying, [...] "I will do all I <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure it isn't included in the final bill.
