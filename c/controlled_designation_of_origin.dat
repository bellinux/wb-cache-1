40|$|Grapevine {{cultivation}} is {{an age-old}} {{tradition in the}} Veneto region of Italy where many ancient cultivars are still grown. Some of these cultivars are recognised as producing important <b>Controlled</b> <b>Designations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> (D. O. C.) wines, while other local types have been lost through substitution by international cultivars. Despite {{the large number of}} ancient cultivars present in the Veneto region, many are not registered in the Italian Ampelographic Catalogue and therefore risk extinction. Moreover, synonyms and homonyms have often become popular at local level, thus rendering correct varietal identification tricky. Our aim was to characterize ancient local cultivars to preserve the germoplasm and investigate their genetic relationships. Genetic variability was assessed in 18 local varieties using nuclear simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to identify the most similar groups and verify if these groupings are in agreement with the known history of the cultivars...|$|R

40|$|Grapevine cultivars {{diversity}} is vast {{and full of}} synonyms and homonyms. Up to few decades ago characterization of grapevine was based on morphological characters. In the last decades, molecular markers were developed and {{have been used as}} tools to study genetic diversity in a range of different plant species. Fifty-six Portuguese accessions representative of ‘Vinhos Verdes’ and ‘Douro’ <b>Controlled</b> <b>Designations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> (DOC) were analysed through DNA fingerprints generated by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR). The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of RAPD and ISSR molecular techniques in the detection of synonyms, homonyms and misnames. RAPD and ISSR analysis enabled the detection of 36 different band patterns, reducing in about 36 % the initial material. Several accessions grown under different names, between and within collections, were confirmed as the same genotype, namely Gouveio/Verdelho, Sousão Douro/Vinhão and Arinto Oeste/Pedernã. Similarly, some homonyms/misnames were also identified, namely within Azal Tinto and Rabigato accessions. RAPD and ISSR markers revealed to be adequate molecular techniques for grapevine varieties fingerprinting with advantages over other molecular procedures, contributing for a good management of grapevine collections...|$|R

DOC wines {{must have been}} IGP wines for at least 5 years. They generally come from smaller regions, within a certain IGP territory, that are particularly vocated for their climatic and geological characteristics and for the quality and originality of the local winemaking traditions. They also must follow stricter production regulations than IGP wines. A DOC wine can be promoted to DOCG if {{it has been a}} DOC for at least 10 years. In addition to fulfilling the requisites for DOC wines (since that's the category they come from), before commercialization DOCG wines must pass stricter analyses, including a tasting by a specifically appointed committee.

40|$|Prosecco, one of {{the most}} popular {{sparkling}} wines in the world, is produced in Italy. For this reason, it is important to develop a scientific method for determining geographic origin in order to prevent fraudulent labelling. To establish the relationship between geochemistry of vineyard soil and chemical composition of grape, a geochemical characterization of “Glera”, a Vitis vinifera cultivar from Italian Region, Veneto was undertaken. We evaluated the relationship between major and trace elements in soil and their concentrations in “Glera” grape berries in vineyards belonging to five localities in the Veneto alluvial plain, all included in the <b>Controlled</b> <b>Designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> (DOC) area of Prosecco. A statistically significant correspondence between the soil and grape was observed for Sr. Multivariate analysis (LDA) allowed discrimination of samples of soil and grape berries from each single winery according to the geographic origin.

We evaluated the relationship among the concentrations of rare earth elements (REE) in soil and in “Glera” grape berries in vineyards belonging to five different localities in the Veneto alluvial plain, all included in the DOC area of Prosecco. The concentration of REE in samples of soil and juice or solid residues of grape berries was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and the index of bioaccumulation was calculated to define the specific assimilation of these elements from soil to grape berries. The concentration of REE in soil samples allowed an identification of each locality examined, and REE were mostly detected in solid grape berry residues in comparison to juice. These data may be useful to associate REE distribution in soil and grape berries to a specific geographical origin, in order to prevent fraudulent use of wine denomination labels...|$|E

40|$|The uptake {{of major}} and trace {{elements}} in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) can {{be influenced by}} soil, climate, geographic origin, and rootstock type. Rootstocks were mainly selected to resist phylloxera and for specific tolerance to lime, mineral uptake, drought, and salinity. The relationship among concentrations of major, trace, and rare earth elements was studied in soil and leaves from two Italian grapevine cultivars, BCabernet Sauvignon^ and BCorvina,^ employed to produce renowned <b>controlled</b> <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (DOC) wines.

The related index of bioaccumulation was calculated to define the specific assimilation of the elements from soil to leaves. A statistically significant correspondence between soil and leaf samples was observed for Mg, Sm, V, and Zr. The results allowed to discriminate soil and leaf samples of the two cultivars according to geographical provenance, possibly providing geochemical markers (fingerprints) useful against fraudulent use of DOC wine labels...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{highlight}} the wine-growing and wine-making potential of Alba County and the way it can be valorised. Alba county has a rich winegrowing and wine-making heritage, a fact which is due to the long-standing tradition of winegrowing on these area, as well as to the characteristics of the natural factors (relief, geology, climate, soil), favourable for obtaining high-quality wines, the reputation of which has been acquired at national and international competitions. In order to render useful the wine tourism resources, the development of a specific infrastructure is needed, as well as the creation of complex tourist products, able to satisfy a wide range of tourist motivations. An efficient instrument to make productive the wine potential of a region is the „Wine Road" – a tourist trail which includes the tourist attractions of a delimited area, usually with a <b>controlled</b> <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> and also a diverse range of tourist services (transportation, accommodation, catering leisure etc.).

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{consumer}} behaviour knowledge, {{it is very important}} to collect information about consumer characteristics and preferences. This is made possible at events such as “Civintas”, an Italian quality food show that promotes production linked to a specific territory, such as DOC (<b>Controlled</b> <b>Designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin)</b> wines. The 1997 - 2000 editions gave us the opportunity to gather information through interviews with participants. This analysis allowed us to understand the demand market configuration. We should underline that the study was also used to give the consumer product information, so as to improve their perception of quality. Interviewees were asked to respond to questions regarding socio-economic characteristics and wine preferences. The responses were used to create consumer profiles. We analysed data in three statistical stages: univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. We used a homogeneity analysis to examine data during the last stage. We also applied a hedonic analysis model to identify the implicit prices in relation to wine quality. After conducting this study, we discovered that wine consumption was characterised by a wide variety of consumer behaviours and preferences. This information will be useful in indicating effective market segmentation criteria so as to develop sustainable differentiation and positioning strategies to satisfy consumer preferences...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} twenty-years, the {{increasing}} demand of Prosecco in the international commerce has required more control {{in order to avoid}} falsification and incorrect use of denomination labels. The geographical indication is based on the relationship between the characteristic of the wine and the concept of Terroir. The Terroir, indeed, describes a particular grape variety with specific organoleptic characteristics of the wine, linked to a precise climate area, a geologic setting and a particular wine district or wine region. Considering that, the main {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the correspondence among geo-lithological features of the area, geochemistry of vineyard soil and chemical composition of grape (juice and solid residue). This research led on to identify the characteristic territorial markers of Glera cultivar. The analysed vineyards belong to ten distinct wineries, which are located in Veneto-Friuli Region alluvial plain and included in DOC (<b>Controlled</b> <b>Designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin)</b> area of Prosecco wine. The detection of major and trace elements contents in soil was carried out by means of XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence spectroscopy), whereas the grape samples were analysed by using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry). Moreover, the heavy metal content in soil, grape and in wine was determined to evaluate a possible human activity, such as the use of fertilizer and pesticide. For each vineyard, in addition, the assimilation coefficient was calculated in order to assess the uptake of minerals in the grape (juice and solid residue) and in the wine, as fingerprints of their own specific content in soil. Through geochemical analysis and statistical approaches (LDA, PCA), the vineyard soils were discriminated according to the geo-lithological characteristic of the area and the trace elements were individuated in grape. Finally, the results of this research are useful to identified the correct relationship between the winery district and the Glera cultivar, demonstrating as some trace and ultra-trace elements could be considered as possible marker for geographical origin...|$|E
40|$|The Liguria region (NW Italy) is {{characterized}} by a wide geodiversity, which is strictly correlated with a huge variety of landscapes. This article reports and discusses the results of a multidisciplinary research performed by the University of Genova (DAD and DISTAV), the University of Milano (DISAA) together with the Spin-off society Geospectra s. r. l. and in collaboration with the Associazione Italiana Sommelier (AIS). The main focus of the research was to investigate the relationships among the “geological fingerprint” of soils and the quality of wines (and more in general of agro-food products) going beyond the classical italian quality labels, such as the DOC (<b>Controlled</b> <b>Designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin),</b> the DOP (Protected Designation of Origin) and the IGP (Protected Geographical Indication) labels. We applied an innovative multidisciplinary approach which involved the investigation of the geological, geomorphological, geochemical, mineralogical, ecological and vegetational features of selected vineyards occurring in the ligurian terraced landscape. The analytical protocol included routine pedological and minero-petrographical investigations and innovative geochemical analyses by means of field portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (FP-EDXRF). Geomorphological evaluation as well as analysis of structural condition of the terraced vineyard were also performed. In the recent past, the same approach was applied by the authors to several other agri-food products (such as apples, olives and olive oils) as well as to wild mushrooms (Boletus edulis) demonstrating the close relationships between the “geological fingerprint” of an area and the organoleptic properties of agricultural products. The preliminary results of this research evidenced that phenotypic differences can be observed in the same vineyard and even in a same cultivar (same genotypes) as a response to local variation of the geo-pedological and ecological features. These results might be the key {{for the protection of the}} uniqueness of high-quality local wines and can contrast the outsourcing of these typical agricultural products. The valorization of local production should be also one of the necessary strategies for the protection and the conservation of the ligurian terraced landscape. In fact, most of the abandoned ligurian agricultural terraces are nowadays characterized by an advanced state of deterioration and by high hydrogeological vulnerability. Finally, the high quality wines can become an effective promotional tool for the different ligurian landscapes. Besides being a marketing tool, the “geological label of the wine” might tell us the history and the geography of the terraced landscape of Liguria, thus representing an important instrument for the territorial safeguard, promotion, and valorization...|$|E
