50|$|They fed these captive dormice walnuts, <b>chestnuts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>acorns</b> for fattening. The dormice {{were served}} by either {{roasting}} them and dipping them in honey or stuffing {{them with a}} mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. It was, however, very important to upper-class Romans that the dormice be separated from other products of the hunt, like the large game, for presentation purposes.|$|R
50|$|Most seeds {{come from}} fruits that {{naturally}} free {{themselves from the}} shell, unlike nuts such as hazelnuts, <b>chestnuts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>acorns,</b> which have hard shell walls and originate from a compound ovary. The general and original usage of the term is less restrictive, and many nuts (in the culinary sense), such as almonds, pecans, pistachios, walnuts, and Brazil nuts, are not nuts in a botanical sense. Common usage of the term often refers to any hard-walled, edible kernel as a nut.|$|R

Their Rabits are not so good as ours in England; they have great plenty of Patridges, which are larger and finer feather'd than ours. They have but little Beef in Spain, {{because there is no}} Grass, but they have plenty of Mutton, and exceeding good, because their Sheep feed only upon wild Potherbs; their Pork is delicious, their Hogs feeding only upon <b>Chestnuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Acorns.</b>|$|R
500|$|At least 89 {{species of}} rodent, mostly Hystricomorpha such as guinea pigs, agoutis and capybaras, are eaten by humans; in 1985, {{there were at}} least 42 {{different}} societies in which people eat rats. Guinea pigs were first raised for food around 2500 B.C. and by 1500 B.C. had become the main source of meat for the Inca Empire. Dormice were raised by the Romans in special pots called [...] "gliraria", or in large outdoor enclosures, where they were fattened on walnuts, <b>chestnuts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>acorns.</b> The dormice were also caught from the wild in autumn when they were fattest, and either roasted and dipped into honey or baked while stuffed with a mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. Researchers found that in Amazonia, where large mammals were scarce, pacas and common agoutis accounted for around 40 percent of the annual game taken by the indigenous people, but in forested areas where larger mammals were abundant, these rodents constituted only about 3 percent of the take.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Flours of wheat, <b>chestnut,</b> <b>acorn</b> <b>and</b> lupin were {{evaluated}} {{in relation to}} phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, and oxalate content. At the chemical level the results show some variability between samples by type of flour, and the sample of chestnut flour presented the higher value of oxalate (0. 00348 mg/ 100 g) {{when compared to the}} other samples in the study. Considering the content of phenolic compounds, the sample that stood out was the acorn flour, having a high value of 0. 812 g AGE/ 100 g. All the samples presented intermediate content of antioxidant activity and the sample that showed a slightly higher value was the wheat flour with a value of 0. 746 mM TRE/g sample...|$|R

50|$|Within the archipelago, the {{vegetation}} was {{transformed by the}} end of the Ice Age. In southwestern Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, broadleaf evergreen trees dominated the forests, whereas broadleaf deciduous trees and conifers were common in northeastern Honshu and southern Hokkaido. Many native tree species, such as beeches, buckeyes, <b>chestnuts,</b> <b>and</b> oaks produced edible nuts <b>and</b> <b>acorns.</b> These provided abundant sources of food for humans and for animals.|$|R
5000|$|Research {{has shown}} {{that a number of}} {{low-cost}} additives are capable of accelerating SODIS and that additives might make SODIS more rapid and effective in both sunny and cloudy weather, developments that could help make the technology more effective and acceptable to users. [...] A 2008 study showed that powdered seeds of five natural legumes (peas, beans and lentils)—Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), Phaseolus mungo (black lentil), Glycine max (soybean), Pisum sativum (green pea), and Arachis hypogaea (peanut)—when evaluated as natural flocculants for the removal of turbidity, were as effective as commercial alum and even superior for clarification in that the optimum dosage was low (1 g/L), flocculation was rapid (7-25 minutes, depending on the seed used) and the water hardness and pH was essentially unaltered. Later studies have used <b>chestnuts,</b> oak <b>acorns,</b> <b>and</b> Moringa oleifera (drumstick tree) for the same purpose.|$|R
40|$|Predation {{on large}} woody plant seeds; <b>chestnuts,</b> <b>acorns</b> <b>and</b> sloe kernels, was studied in {{deciduous}} forests of two size classes: small woodlots (&lt; 1 ha) and large woods (at least 25 ha) in southern Sweden. Seeds {{used for the}} study were artificially distributed on the forest ground and seed predation measured as seed removal. Predation rate was similar in both types of woods. However, rodent density was higher in small woodlots and a correction for differences in rodent density showed that predation rate per individual rodent was higher in the large woods. This suggests that the small woodlots (including the border zone) and their adjacent fields have more rodent food per area unit. A small woodlot cannot be considered {{a representative sample of}} a large continuous forest, even if the habitats appear similar. There was a strong effect of rodent density on seed predation rate. This suggests that rodents are major seed predators in this habitat...|$|R
50|$|Cydia splendana, the {{chestnut}} tortrix, is a moth of the Tortricidae family. It {{is found}} in Europe. It {{is also known as}} the <b>acorn</b> <b>moth,</b> but this can also refer to Blastobasis glandulella from North America, which belongs to the more primitive family Blastobasidae.|$|R

50|$|While woodrats forage on many {{different}} food items, they are they are largely depended on cached <b>acorns</b> <b>and</b> nuts during winter. Eruptions of the gypsy moth {{in the basin}} of the Lower Mississippi River in 1964 and 1965 resulted in poor <b>acorn</b> <b>and</b> <b>chestnut</b> crops <b>and</b> subsequently in increased mortality in eastern woodrats in the area.|$|R

Songpyeon can be made into many unique colors and flavors using natural ingredients. The shape, size and ingredients may vary by region. Common in Seoul are smaller bite-sized songpyeon, while in other regions, such as Gangwon Province, potatoes <b>and</b> <b>acorn</b> powder are more common because the Gang won Province is known for growing these two. Other ingredients that {{can be added to}} songpyeon are soybeans, cowpeas, chestnuts, bean powder, jujubes, sesame and honey.|$|R
5000|$|In Hungary, {{the most}} common moth {{threatening}} chestnut trees is the <b>acorn</b> <b>moth</b> (Laspeyreisa splendana) <b>and</b> its subspecies. Its grayish-yellow larvae cause similar damage {{to that of the}} chestnut weevil, but they spin characteristic webs among the nutchips and larval excrement. This moth causes about 5-41% of the damage that occurs in western Hungary's plantations. Plantations need regular protection against these moths, the occurrence of which does not decrease.|$|R
40|$|Identification {{of the sex}} {{pheromone}} of Cydia splendana (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) by pheromone gland analysis {{followed by}} field trapping with synthetic compounds shows the occurrence of two pheromone races. <b>Acorn</b> <b>moth</b> females from Sweden, where oak Quercus robur is the only host plant, use a blend of the E,Z and E,E isomers of 8, 10 -dodecadien- 1 -yl acetate. In Central and Southern Europe, where C. splendana feeds on <b>chestnut</b> Castanea sativa <b>and</b> several species of oak, males respond to another isomer blend, E,E and Z,E. The distribution of the two pheromone races of C. splendana overlaps in Northern France, where they share oak as plant host. Differences in sex communication signals between these populations of C. splendana corroborate the role of specific mate recognition in speciation events...|$|R
