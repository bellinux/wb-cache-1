5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the {{minimum spanning tree}} allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a <b>Cartesian</b> tree. The root of the <b>Cartesian</b> tree represents the heaviest minimum spanning tree edge, {{and the children of}} the root are <b>Cartesian</b> trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the minimum spanning tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the <b>Cartesian</b> tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals the weight of the <b>Cartesian</b> tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum spanning tree edges have been sorted, this <b>Cartesian</b> tree can be constructed in linear time.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} at Harvard, Whitehead {{produced}} his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote Science and the Modern World, which was immediately hailed {{as an alternative to}} the <b>Cartesian</b> dualism that plagued popular science. Lectures from 1927–28, were published in 1929 as a book named Process and Reality, which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.|$|E
5|$|The {{reference}} point (analogous to {{the origin of}} a <b>Cartesian</b> coordinate system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth.|$|E
5|$|The book covers many topics {{including}} {{the effects of}} scale on the shape of animals and plants, large ones necessarily being relatively thick in shape; the effects of surface tension in shaping soap films and similar structures such as cells; the logarithmic spiral as seen in mollusc shells and ruminant horns; the arrangement of leaves and other plant parts (phyllotaxis); and Thompson's own method of transformations, showing the changes in shape of animal skulls and other structures on a <b>Cartesian</b> grid.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, the Kurdoğlus and <b>Cartesian</b> {{utilized}} the additional capital {{to enter into}} an joint franchise agreement with Burger King to open 1000+ new locations in China over a five- to seven-year period. This agreement is the largest single franchise agreement {{in the history of}} Burger King and will make the new Chinese venture the largest BK franchise in the world. The agreement gives the new franchise group control of the existing 63 locations in the country. The expansion has both pluses and minuses for Burger King, as a minor player in the market it yet to truly establish a brand identity as McDonald's and Yum! This position could allow Burger King to position itself as a more upscale competitor akin to Starbucks.|$|E
5|$|The {{opportunity}} for Durkheim to a receive major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by {{his approach to}} society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, {{in sharp contrast to}} the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the <b>Cartesian</b> method. By 1886, as part of his doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his The Division of Labour in Society, and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.|$|E
25|$|The {{relations}} between the above coordinate systems, and also <b>Cartesian</b> coordinates are not presented here. The transformation between geodetic and <b>Cartesian</b> coordinates {{may be found in}} Geographic coordinate conversion. The relation of <b>Cartesian</b> and spherical polars is given in Spherical coordinate system. The relation of <b>Cartesian</b> and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in Torge.|$|E
25|$|Because Cantor {{space is}} homeomorphic to any finite <b>Cartesian</b> power of itself, and Baire space is homeomorphic to any finite <b>Cartesian</b> power of itself, the {{analytical}} hierarchy applies equally well to finite <b>Cartesian</b> power {{of one of}} these spaces.|$|E

25|$|The {{technically}} most {{flexible and}} economical definition of fibred categories {{is based on}} the concept of <b>cartesian</b> morphisms. It is equivalent to a definition in terms of cleavages, the latter definition being actually the original one presented in Grothendieck (1959); the definition in terms of <b>cartesian</b> morphisms was introduced in Grothendieck (1971) in 1960–1961.|$|E
25|$|Given {{any family}} of nonempty sets, their <b>Cartesian</b> product is a nonempty set.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{identify}} locations of points in (or outside) a triangle {{is to place}} the triangle in an arbitrary location and orientation in the <b>Cartesian</b> plane, and to use <b>Cartesian</b> coordinates. While convenient for many purposes, this approach has the disadvantage of all points' coordinate values being dependent on the arbitrary placement in the plane.|$|E

25|$|Bogen (1992) {{points out}} that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical. That being the case, if <b>Cartesian</b> materialism is true, there might be two <b>Cartesian</b> theatres, so {{arguments}} against only one are flawed. Velmans (1992) argues that the phi effect and the cutaneous rabbit illusion demonstrate that there is a delay whilst modelling occurs and that this delay was discovered by Libet.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cartesian</b> dualism {{holds that}} the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of {{consciousness}} and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under <b>cartesian</b> dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).|$|E
25|$|In trigonometry, a unit {{circle is}} {{the circle of}} radius one {{centered}} at the origin (0, 0) in the <b>Cartesian</b> coordinate system.|$|E

25|$|One can use {{the same}} {{principle}} to specify the position of any point in three-dimensional space by three <b>Cartesian</b> coordinates, its signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines). In general, n <b>Cartesian</b> coordinates (an element of real n-space) specify the point in an n-dimensional Euclidean space for any dimension n. These coordinates are equal, up to sign, to distances from the point to n mutually perpendicular hyperplanes.|$|E
25|$|Linear polarizers can {{be divided}} into two general categories: {{absorptive}} polarizers, where the unwanted polarization states are absorbed by the device, and beam-splitting polarizers, where the unpolarized beam is split into two beams with opposite polarization states. Polarizers which maintain the same axes of polarization with varying angles of incidence are often called <b>Cartesian</b> polarizers, since the polarization vectors can be described with simple <b>Cartesian</b> coordinates (for example, horizontal vs. vertical) independent from the orientation of the polarizer surface. When the two polarization states are relative to the direction of a surface (usually found with Fresnel reflection), they are usually termed s and p. This distinction between <b>Cartesian</b> and s–p polarization can be negligible in many cases, but it becomes significant for achieving high contrast and with wide angular spreads of the incident light.|$|E
25|$|In topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the <b>Cartesian</b> {{product of}} two circles: S1×S1, {{and the latter}} is taken to be the {{definition}} in that context. It is a compact 2-manifold of genus 1. The ring torus {{is one way to}} embed this space into three-dimensional Euclidean space, but another {{way to do this is}} the <b>Cartesian</b> product of the embedding of S1 in the plane. This produces a geometric object called the Clifford torus, a surface in 4-space.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} {{generalized}} coordinates θi i=1, 2 provides {{an alternative to the}} <b>Cartesian</b> formulation of the dynamics of the double pendulum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cartesian</b> {{coordinates}} are {{the foundation}} of analytic geometry, and provide enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of mathematics, such as linear algebra, complex analysis, differential geometry, multivariate calculus, group theory and more. A familiar example {{is the concept of}} the graph of a function. <b>Cartesian</b> coordinates are also essential tools for most applied disciplines that deal with geometry, including astronomy, physics, engineering and many more. They are the most common coordinate system used in computer graphics, computer-aided geometric design and other geometry-related data processing.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} with vectors, the graphical representation {{may be too}} cumbersome. Vectors in an n-dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as coordinate vectors in a <b>Cartesian</b> coordinate system. The endpoint of a vector can be identified with an ordered list of n real numbers (n-tuple). These numbers are the coordinates of the endpoint of the vector, {{with respect to a}} given <b>Cartesian</b> coordinate system, and are typically called the scalar components (or scalar projections) of the vector on the axes of the coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|In this approach, a {{point on}} a plane is {{represented}} by its <b>Cartesian</b> (x, y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Cartesian</b> oval {{is a set}} {{of points}} such that a {{weighted}} sum of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points (foci) is a constant. An ellipse is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a <b>Cartesian</b> oval in which one of the weights is zero.|$|E
25|$|An E {{category}} φ: F → E is a fibred category (or a fibred E-category, or {{a category}} fibred over E) if each morphism f of E whose codomain {{is in the}} range of projection has at least one inverse image, and moreover the composition m ∘ n of any two <b>cartesian</b> morphisms m,n in F is always <b>cartesian.</b> In other words, an E-category is a fibred category if inverse images always exist (for morphisms whose codomains are {{in the range of}} projection) and are transitive.|$|E
