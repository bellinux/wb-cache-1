40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the cost-effectiveness of treatments {{for women with}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who ovulate on clomiphene citrate but do not conceive after six cycles. A decision-analytic framework was developed for six scenarios: (1) three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF; (2) continuation of clomiphene citrate for six cycles, followed by three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF in case of no birth; (3) six <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> gonadotrophins and three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF; (4) 12 <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> gonadotrophins and three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF; (5) continuation of clomiphene citrate for six <b>cycles,</b> six <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> gonadotrophins and three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF; (6) continuation of clomiphene citrate for six <b>cycles,</b> 12 <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> gonadotrophins and three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF. Two-year cumulative birth rates were 58 %, 74 %, 89 %, 97 %, 93 % and 98 % and costs per couple were € 9518, € 7530, € 9711, € 9764, € 7651 and € 7684 for scenarios 1 - 6, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the ways the}} <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is revealed and its effect to the speaker. I am interested in finding out how the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is revealed and what effects <b>of</b> the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief toward the speaker are. In my thesis, I use literary approach. Furthermore, I use the elements of poetry as the tools to reveal the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief and its effects to the speaker. I also use the mythological background as the supporting concept. Through the analysis, I {{found out that the}} <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is revealed through Proserpine?s figure and through the elements of poetry. I found out that Proserpine is mentioned through paradoxes and symbols in the beginning, {{and the end of the}} poem to reveal the paradoxical role of Proserpine. The speaker uses Proserpine to represent the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief. The <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is also revealed through the elements of poetry. The use of metaphor of the sea describes the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief and in this sea paganism and Christianity rise and sink by turns. The use of simile describes the situation of the people and the gods in the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief and the power <b>of</b> the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief. The speaker also describes how the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief happens through the dictions, and he uses allusion, symbol and paradox to describe pagan gods, Christ, and Mary. I found that the transition from ancient Rome to Christianity has brought some effects to the speaker. He experiences loss and sadness. In his pain, he reproaches Christ and Mary and shows his refusal toward Christ. Through this analysis, I learn that a change is not always an improvement to all people in society...|$|R
