40|$|The {{experiences}} {{and the practice}} of many countries show that countertrade could be used as the significant method for incensement of the export {{as well as for the}} promotion of the foreign investments even in the period of deep financial crises. Contemporary governments' pro-active countertrade orientation in USA, Israel, Sweden, Norway, Japan and other developed countries highlights the inadequacy of the obsolete and stereotypical concept of the countertrade as the <b>compensation</b> <b>transaction</b> based on the 'trade without money' concept. Besides this, the practices proved that countertrade transactions are the consequence and the indicator of economic shocks. Therefore, the study of the special legal issues that may arise in countertrade transactions will be very important not only for the domestic legal doctrine but also for the commercial practice. As national laws do not contain provisions specific for countertrade, it is of particular importance to analyze legal question such as structuring and drafting of countertrade arrangements as well as to study the question of the legal nature of the contractual link between legal instruments which form multicontractual mechanism of countertrade transactions. The character of the legal connection among the legal instruments in countertrade arrangement, as well as the legal nature of the countertrade commitment, strongly influence the countertrade agreement's legal nature. The economic reality of a group of contracts joined by the common goal of the transaction (consideration) and the countertrade commitment has to be followed by the legal reality which will recognize the legal interdependence of the obligation deriving from the legally independent countertrade arrangement...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} about human {{resource}} management, internal labor markets, and assorted theories of wage behavior. A stereotype of managerial activities and policies is sketched {{out in the}} first section, which, although reflecting a parochial (U. S.) orientation, is intended to approximate a set of real-world conditions to which analyses of labor market behavior should presumably relate. In the second section, we consider "institutionalist" interpretations, which either. supplement or challenge standard market analysis by appeal to the historical record, the behavioral sciences, or even the consensus of expert behavior. In particular, the importance of "conventional" forces, based heavily on perceptions of equity, interpersonal preferences, and custom and practice, is revealed by the scholarship and insights of Henry Phelps Brown. Next (section II) are assessed the claims and contributions of a sample of theories based on the assumption of individualistic utility maximization in competitive markets: the theories of equalizing wage differentials, human capital, deferred <b>compensation,</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, implicit contracts, and (least conventional) efficiency wages. None is found to be lacking in interpretive value or relevance to one or more attributes of the stereotype, and all help to relate it to a wider family of markets and to economic behavior. In general, however, this group is less satisfactory in explaining why wages should be high enough—in a present value sense and relative to market-clearing levels—to contribute to the relative insulation of internal labor markets and to restrict employment. An exception is provided by efficiency wage theory, in particular by one of its older variants which, because it is based on group (rather than individualistic) psychology and behavior, is discussed in the following section (V) ...|$|E

40|$|One {{fundamental}} {{issue that has}} yet to be adequately addressed in loosely couple distributed systems is long duration transactions — maintaining integrity of the system in the presense of both failures and concurrent activities for processes that last from seconds to years. This issue is of particular importance to both business to business integration (B 2 Bi) and enterprise application integration (EAI) applications such as e-procurement. Numerous transaction models have been proposed in the past to address this issue. They include transactions with ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) properties designed for short duration transactions — milli-seconds in duration — <b>compensation</b> <b>transactions</b> and other advanced/extended transaction models. For varying reasons such as performances, expressiveness and appropriateness, existing transaction models do not meet general requirements for long duration transactions in loosely coupled distributed systems especially B 2 Bi and EAI applications. This paper is a position paper with two main objectives. First, we describe an application that is based on a real eprocurement scenario and discuss its transactional requirements. In the discussion, we highlight why some existing advanced/extended transaction model fail to provide adequate transactional support for this particular application.

In this paper, we present several extensions to existing notions of <b>compensation</b> for business <b>transactions.</b> The extensions are described using a business process modeling language called StAC (Structured Activity Compensation) but are also placed in the context of IBM’s BPBeans (Business Process Beans) enterprise technology. The meaning of the compensation mechanisms is made precise, as are issues of compensation scoping in multilevel <b>transactions.</b> The <b>compensation</b> extensions result in flexible and powerful mechanisms for modeling and implementing long-running business transactions. To compensate is “to make amends for, to make up for. ” 1 In the context of business <b>transactions,</b> a <b>compensation</b> is an action taken when something goes wrong or when there is a change of plan. For example, when an airline has overbooked a flight and too many passengers turn up at the gate, something has gone wrong. The airline needs to take corrective action to resolve the problem. In this case, the airline will typically attempt to encourage some passengers to delay their journey by offering monetary payments. The payments and the rebooking of the flight are a compensation for the inability to seat these passengers on this flight.

40|$|In {{web service}} environments, long {{transactions}} need to lock resources - often database services - {{for a long}} time during their long execution duration. This would bring down the performance of transaction processing systems. The <b>transaction</b> <b>compensation</b> is a feasible solution through allowing sub-transactions to independently commit, however, it is not able to speed up the transaction processing. This paper proposes a novel pipeline-based transaction processing (PLbTP) model for Serial Long Transactions (SLTs), which parallelises the transaction processing to reduce the transaction execution duration. Furthermore, we design a time-stamp-based deadlock prevention mechanism for the control of multiple concurrent transactions. The simulation results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve performance of SLTs without the aid of compensating transactions.

Long running business <b>transactions</b> use <b>compensation</b> to cope with exceptions. StAC supports sequential and parallel behaviour as well as exception and compensation handling. We also show how the B notation may be combined with StAC to specify the data aspects of transactions. The combination of StAC and B provides a rich formal notation which allows for succinct and precise specification of business transactions. BPEL is an industry standard language for specifying business <b>transactions</b> and includes <b>compensation</b> constructs.

40|$|An {{interest}} charge {{is made up}} of an award for waiting known as the real rate of interest, a premium for risk and <b>compensation</b> for <b>transaction</b> costs. Where inflation exists the lender seeks further compensation. In order to understand the composition and evolution of different versions of the usury prohibition it is necessary to ask which components of an {{interest charge}} are prohibited by each version. The Judaic prohibition has two aspects which are of particular interest to business historians and students of usury. First, the general rule is that a reward for waiting is prohibited. This focuses on the time-based part of interest charge. Second, interest is prohibited because it amounts to placing a stumbling block before the blind. This focuses on the typical gullibility of the borrower confronted by a more expert, better funded lender. Economics confirms and enriches our understanding of these important aspects of the prohibition. They achieve this by increasing our understanding of two facts: first, that the borrower is a gullible individual subject to irrational and inconsistent behaviour; and, second, that this behaviour relates to the waiting aspect of interest which is proscribed in the prohibition. How far these insights apply to other civilisations' prohibition, particularly those which derive from the Judaic prohibition, merits further study; so also do the ethical lessons of the Mosaic rules for a globalised society based on capitalism.

However, challenges arise {{when we try to}} apply them to novel computing paradigms such as ActiveXML (AXML) systems. AXML provides an elegant platform to integrate the power of XML, Web services and Peer to Peer (P 2 P) paradigms by allowing (active) Web services calls to be embedded within XML documents. We propose a transactional framework which provides relaxed ACID properties to AXML systems. Relaxed atomicity is usually provided with the help of compensation. However, current compensation based models assume the existence of a pre-defined compensating operation. Also, compensation is assumed to be more or less peer (or service provider) dependent, i. e., the original and compensating services are provided by the same peer. We show how <b>compensation</b> for AXML <b>transactions</b> can be constructed dynamically at run-time and achieved in a peer independent manner. Finally, we consider the issue of peer disconnection, an inherent trait of P 2 P systems, and propose an innovative solution based on peer “chaining”. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three interrelated essays. The first essay focuses on the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread. A regime switching model applied to the trading process leads to a parsimonious model of the time-series evolution of the bid-ask spread in which market participants use trade data {{to answer the following}} question: Is there currently private information {{in the market for a}} given stock? If there is a high probability of private information in the market, this leads contemporaneously to a greater revision in beliefs about the true price. Together with <b>compensation</b> for <b>transactions</b> costs, this leads to a greater revision in transaction price. Using TSE 35 trade and quote data for March and May 1996, the pooled cross-section and time series results support this view. The second essay examines the costs of adverse information and order processing in light of transaction size, type of trader and type of trading method. Specifically, it is found that adverse selection increases with the trade size (consistent with numerous empirical studies relating trade size and the cost components of the bid-ask spread). However, whether the trade was undertaken by the designated market maker, by a principal trader or by an individual belonging to neither of these two categories is also of importance. In addition, we show that trades consummated within the investment dealer's firm have a lower adverse information cost component than trades executed externally. For order processing, it is found that the single most important determinant of cost is whether the transaction is internal or external to the investment dealer firm, with internal trades being more costly. The third essay examines the robustness of the Huang and Stoll (1997) model estimates to the use of different clustering methods and to a minimum quotation increment reduction (MQIR) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. We find that adequate reversal of trade flow is a necessary but not sufficient condition for model performance. We also find that model estimates are quite sensitive to the data clustering method selected. In addition, we show that this model fails to provide adequate cost component estimates of the spread in the post-MQIR period due to a fundamental change in market-maker behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of linear infrastructure such as {{roads and railways}} is a major global driver of cumulative biodiversity loss. One strategy for reducing habitat loss associated with development is to encourage linear infrastructure providers and users to share infrastructure networks. We quantified the reductions in biodiversity impact and capital costs under linear infrastructure sharing {{of a range of}} potential mine to port transportation links for 47 mine locations operated by 28 separate companies in the Upper Spencer Gulf Region of South Australia. We mapped transport links based on least-cost pathways for different levels of linear-infrastructure sharing and used expert-elicited impacts of linear infrastructure to estimate the consequences for biodiversity. Capital costs were calculated based on estimates of construction costs, <b>compensation</b> payments, and <b>transaction</b> costs. We evaluated proposed mine-port links by comparing biodiversity impacts and capital costs across 3 scenarios: an independent scenario, where no infrastructure is shared; a restricted-access scenario, where the largest mining companies share infrastructure but exclude smaller mining companies from sharing; and a shared scenario where all mining companies share linear infrastructure. Fully shared development of linear infrastructure reduced overall biodiversity impacts by 76 % and reduced capital costs by 64 % compared with the independent scenario. However, there was considerable variation among companies. Our restricted-access scenario showed only modest biodiversity benefits relative to the independent scenario, indicating that reductions are likely to be limited if the dominant mining companies restrict access to infrastructure, which often occurs without policies that promote sharing of infrastructure. Our research helps illuminate the circumstances under which infrastructure sharing can minimize the biodiversity impacts of development...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{topics of}} optimal meter placement and transaction-based loss allocation in deregulated power system operation are investigated. Firstly, Chapter II introduces {{the basic idea}} of candidate measurement identification, which is the selection of candidate measurement sets, each of which will make the system observable under a given contingency (loss of measurements and network topology changes). A new method is then developed for optimal meter placement, which is {{the choice of the}} optimal combination out of the selected candidate measurement sets in order to ensure the entire system observability under any one of the contingencies. A new method, which allows a natural separation of losses among individual transactions in a multiple-transaction setting is proposed in Chapter III. The proposed method does not use any approximations such as a D. C. power flow, avoiding method induced inaccuracies. The power network losses are expressed in terms of individual power transactions. A transaction-loss matrix, which illustrates the breakdown of losses introduced by each individual transaction and interactions between any two transactions, is created. The network losses can then be allocated to each transaction based on the transaction-loss matrix entries. The conventional power flow analysis is extended in Chapter IV to combine with the transaction loss allocation. A systematic solution procedure is formed in order to adjust generation while simultaneously allocating losses to the generators designated by individual transactions. Furthermore, Chapter V presents an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm to optimize the loss <b>compensation</b> if some <b>transactions</b> elect to purchase the loss service from the Independent System Operator (ISO) and accordingly the incurred losses are fairly allocated back to individual transactions. IEEE test systems have been used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{government}} aid agencies {{and international organizations}} have increased their financial commitments to controlling and eliminating malaria from the planet. This renewed emphasis on elimination is reminiscent of a previous worldwide campaign to eradicate malaria in the 1960 s, a campaign which ultimately failed. To avoid {{a repeat of the}} past, mechanisms must be developed to sustain effective malaria control programs. A number of sociobehavioral, economic, and biophysical challenges exist for sustainable malaria control, particularly in high-burden areas such as sub-Saharan Africa. Sociobehavioral challenges include maintaining high long-term levels of support for and participation in malaria control programs, at all levels of society. Reasons for the failure of the previous eradication campaign included a decline in donor, governmental, community, and household-level support for control programs, as malaria prevalence ebbed due in part to early successes of these programs. Biophysical challenges for the sustainability of national malaria control programs (NMCPs) encompass evolutionary challenges in controlling the protozoan parasite and the mosquito vector, as well as volatile transmission dynamics which can lead to epidemics. Evolutionary challenges are particularly daunting due to the rapid generational turnover of both the parasites and the vectors: The reliance on a handful of insecticides and antimalarial drugs in NMCPs has placed significant selection pressures on vectors and parasites respectively, leading to a high prevalence of genetic mutations conferring resistance to these biocides. The renewed global financing of malaria control makes research into how to effectively surmount these challenges arguably more salient now than ever. Economics has proven useful for addressing the sociobehavioral and biophysical challenges for malaria control. A necessary next step is the careful, detailed, and timely integration of economics with the natural sciences to maximize and sustain the impact of this financing. In this dissertation, I focus on 4 of the challenges identified above: In the first chapter, I use optimal control and dynamic programming techniques to focus on the problem of insecticide resistance in malaria control, and to understand how different models of mosquito evolution can affect our policy prescriptions for dealing with the problem of insecticide resistance. I identify specific details of the biological model [...] the mechanisms for so-called "fitness costs" in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes [...] that affect the qualitative properties of the optimal control path. These qualitative differences carry over to large impacts on the economic costs of a given control plan. In the 2 nd chapter, I consider the interaction of parasite resistance to drugs and mosquito resistance to insecticides, and analyze cost-effective malaria control portfolios that balance these 2 dynamics. I construct a mathematical model of malaria transmission and evolutionary dynamics, and calibrate the model to baseline data from a rural Tanzanian district. Four interventions are jointly considered in the model: Insecticide-spraying, insecticide-treated net distribution, and the distribution of 2 antimalarial drugs [...] sulfadoxine pyramethamine (SP) and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Strategies which coordinate vector controls and treatment protocols should provide significant gains, in part due to the issues of insecticide and drug resistance. In particular, conventional vector control and ACT use should be highly complementary, economically and in terms of disease reductions. The ongoing debate concerning the cost-effectiveness of ACTs should thus consider prevailing (and future) levels of conventional vector control methods, such as ITN and IRS: If the cost-effectiveness of widespread ACT distribution is called into question in a given locale, scaling up IRS and/or ITNs probably tilts the scale in favor of distributing ACTs. In the 3 rd chapter, I analyze results from a survey of northern Ugandan households I oversaw in November 2009. The aim of this survey was to assess respondents' perceptions about malaria risks, and mass indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides that had been done there by government-sponsored health workers. Using stated preference methods [...] specifically, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) [...] I evaluate: (a) the elasticity of household participation levels in IRS programs with respect to malaria risk, and (b) households' perceived value of programs aimed at reducing malaria risk, such as IRS. Econometric results imply that the average respondent in the survey would be willing to forego a $ 10 increase in her assets for a permanent 1 % reduction in malaria risk. Participation in previous IRS significantly increased the stated willingness to participate in future IRS programs. However, I also find that at least 20 % of households in the region perceive significant transactions costs from IRS. One implication of this finding is that <b>compensation</b> for these <b>transactions</b> costs may be necessary to correct theorized public good aspects of malaria prevention via vector control. In the 4 th chapter, I further study these public goods aspects. To do so, I estimate a welfare-maximizing system of cash incentives. Using the econometric models estimated in the 3 rd chapter, in conjunction with {{a modified version of the}} malaria transmission models developed and utilized in the first 2 chapters, I calculate village-specific incentives aimed at correcting under-provision of a public good [...] namely, malaria prevention. This under-provision arises from incentives for individual malaria prevention behavior [...] in this case the decision whether or not to participate in a given IRS round. The magnitude of this inefficiency is determined by the epidemiological model, which dictates the extent to which households' prevention decisions have spillover effects on neighbors. I therefore compute the efficient incentives in a number of epidemiological contexts. I find that non-negligible monetary incentives for participating in IRS programs are warranted in situations where policymakers are confident that IRS can effectively reduce the incidence of malaria cases, and not just exposure rates. In these cases, I conclude that the use of economic incentives could reduce the incidence of malaria episodes by 5 % [...] 10 %. Depending on the costs of implementing a system of incentives for IRS participation, such a system could provide an additional tool in the arsenal of malaria controls. Dissertatio...|$|R
