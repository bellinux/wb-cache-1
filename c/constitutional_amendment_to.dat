5|$|During his term, Marshall focused {{primarily}} on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated {{the passage of a}} child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various {{proposals}} for Reconstruction. Some of these called for a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio. Representative James F. Wilson of Iowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, the central issue. Beshear favored holding a referendum on a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> allow expanded casino gambling in the state, while Fletcher maintained that expanded gambling would bring an increase in crime and societal ills. The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher {{by a vote of}} 619,686 to 435,895.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{the federal}} {{constitutional}} initiative allows citizens {{to put a}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months. The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference {{on the ballot in}} case both proposals are accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.|$|E
5|$|Beshear called another special {{legislative}} session in June 2009 to address another $1 billion shortfall {{in the state}} budget. Later, Beshear amended the call to include the economic incentives package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, a measure to expand gambling in the state by statute. With the threshold lowered from 60 votes for a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote. The amended budget and the economic incentives bills both passed in the 10-day session.|$|E
5|$|Much of the 1964 {{session was}} devoted to a bill to desegregate public {{accommodations}} in Kentucky. A rally {{in favor of the}} bill was held in March and was attended by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Reverend Ralph Abernathy, and baseball player Jackie Robinson. Despite this, the bill did not make it out of legislative committee. As a member of the Southern Governors Conference in October 1964, Breathitt was one of three governors to oppose George Wallace's proposed <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> give states and state courts sole jurisdiction over their public schools, preventing a federal law to integrate them. Breathitt's opposition helped prevent the Conference's endorsement of the amendment, since endorsement required a unanimous vote.|$|E

5|$|Per , {{state and}} union governments, as duty, shall make further {{detailed}} policies and laws for implementation considering DPSPs as fundamental policy. In contrary to Article 37, many {{policies have been}} implemented by state and union governments which go against the DPSPs such as using intoxicating drinks as source of major tax revenue instead of implementing prohibition for better health of people, separation of judiciary from executive, uniform civil code for the citizen, etc. When the union government feels that a DPSP is no longer useful to the nation, it shall be deleted from Constitution by bringing a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> remove ambiguity in policy making / direction. Judiciary can repeal any policy/law devised by the government which is diametrically opposite to any DPSP.|$|E
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained {{a majority in the}} Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was less}} {{involved}} with the legislative process than previous governors. For example, he {{did not attempt to}} influence the choice of legislative leadership, while most previous governors had practically hand-selected the presiding officers in each house. During one of the two legislative sessions of his term, he went on vacation. Consequently, many of his legislative recommendations were not enacted. Among his failed proposals were a multi-county banking law, a flat rate income tax, professional negotiations for teachers, and a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> allow a governor to be elected to successive terms. In all, Brown was out of the state – leaving Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor – for more than five hundred days during his four-year term. As noted by Kentucky historian Lowell H. Harrison, Brown's hands-off approach allowed the legislature to gain power relative to the governor {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history, a trend which continued into the terms of his successors.|$|E

5|$|The casino {{legislation}} was not called {{to a vote}} in the Democratic controlled Kentucky House of Representatives, where 60 votes out of 100 would have been required for passage. Beshear announced that his proposal for a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> allow for casinos was dead for the regular session on March 27, 2008. Among the other proposals favored by Beshear that failed to pass in the session were an ethics reform measure Beshear proposed {{in the wake of the}} investigation of the Fletcher administration, a plan to reduce the projected shortfall in the state's pension system, and a proposed 70-cent-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. Besides the state budget, major legislation passed during the session included incentives for homeowners and businesses to utilize energy efficiency measures, anti-bullying legislation, and increased penalties for animal cruelty.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} that arose after the incapacity of President Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived {{the national debate}} {{on the process of}} presidential succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The constitutional flaws in the process of presidential succession had been known since the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
5|$|President Carlos Menem {{sought a}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> allow his re-election, and Alfonsín opposed it. The {{victory in the}} 1993 midterm {{elections}} strengthened the PJ, which approved the bill in the Senate. Menem proposed {{a referendum on the}} amendment, to force the radical deputies to support it. He also proposed a bill for a law that would allow a constitutional amendment with a simple majority of the Congress. As a result, Alfonsín made the Pact of Olivos with him. With this agreement, the UCR would support Menem's proposal, but with further amendments that would reduce presidential power. The Council of Magistrates of the Nation reduced the influence of the executive power over the judiciary, the city of Buenos Aires would become an autonomous territory allowed to elect its own mayor, and the presidential term of office would be reduced to four years. The presidential elections would include the two-round system, and the electoral college would be abolished. Alfonsín was elected to the constituent assembly that worked for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. A faction of the UCR, led by Fernando delaRúa, opposed the pact, but the party as a whole supported Alfonsín. The UCR got only 19% of the vote in the elections, attaining third position in the 1995 presidential elections behind the Frepaso, when Menem was re-elected. Alfonsín resigned the presidency of the party in that year.|$|E
