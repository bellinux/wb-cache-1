5|$|Larter defined <b>Clear</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> girl who's {{suffered}} numerous {{losses in}} her life, has fallen into herself, {{and has made}} a life within that. She broadened her description as an estranged artist who's holding to her grip for what the world has given her. In the original screenplay of James Wong and Glen Morgan, she is described as the loner in the group who wears dark colors to hide her sex appeal, something she's insecure about. Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original blonde hair colour for the film's ending.|$|E
5|$|Paschal fled when Henry and Matilda arrived, and in {{his absence}} the papal envoy Maurice Bourdin, later the Antipope Gregory VIII, crowned the pair at St. Peter's Basilica, {{probably}} that Easter and certainly by Pentecost. Matilda used these ceremonies to claim {{the title of the}} Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire was governed by elected monarchs who, like Henry V, had been selected by the major nobles to become the King of the Romans. These kings typically hoped to be subsequently crowned by the Pope as the Holy Roman Emperor, but this could not be guaranteed. Henry V had coerced the Pope into crowning him in 1111, but Matilda's own status was less <b>clear.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of her marriage she was clearly the legitimate Queen of the Romans, a title that she used on her seal and charters, but it was uncertain if she had a legitimate claim to the title of empress.|$|E

500|$|The Sun {{will evolve}} {{to become a}} red giant in about [...] Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly , which is about 250 times its present radius. Earth's fate is less <b>clear.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit [...] from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, {{remaining}} life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level). A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Jose F. Promis, {{wrote that}} [...] "the song finds Madonna giving an {{understated}} and inspired performance [...] One hopes that this overlooked gem might {{find its way}} onto future [...] hits collections, because it is truly a wonderful song". Author Thomas S. Hischak called it [...] "plaintive". Billboards Geoff Burpee [...] called it [...] "A sterling, intimate moment from the Evita soundtrack. Yes kids, she [...] can sing". Writing for Los Angeles Times, David Gritten opined Madonna's voice sounded [...] "pitch-perfect and <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bell". Greg Morago, from the Hartford Courant, felt that [...] "By giving her 'Another Suitcase' with its heartbreaking 'Where am I going to?' refrain, Madonna adds a necessary, fragile vulnerability to her ambitious, rags- to-riches Eva Peron". Neil Strauss from The Herald Journal, said that [...] "Madonna radiates on 'Another Suitcase in Another Hall'". Peter Keough, from the Boston Phoenix, described the track as [...] "a poignant, winsome exploration of pathos, defilement, and resolution sung by a young, struggling Eva forced into prostitution {{with a series of}} drab johns".|$|E
500|$|Fourteen riders {{representing}} twelve teams {{broke away}} after [...] They stayed <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group through the four climbs on course {{before they started}} to splinter. Danilo Di Luca's LPR team drove the peloton most of the day, because the finish figured to favor Di Luca more than race leader Denis Menchov or the man in third, Levi Leipheimer. However, one team pulling {{at the front of}} the peloton proved to be no match for a 14-man breakaway working cohesively, and by the time the peloton reached the descent of the fourth climb, the last before the summit finish, it was clear the breakaway would not be caught. The breakaway was still twelve strong as it began the last climb of the day. Andriy Hryvko was the first to attack for the stage win, but he was caught well before the summit, and wound up finishing in the pink jersey group a minute behind the stage winner. The decisive attack came from Simon Gerrans, who no one could match, giving the Cervélo rider the stage win. Leipheimer and Ivan Basso were both dropped from the pink jersey group just before the summit of the climb and the end of the stage, losing three potentially valuable seconds to the other highly placed riders in the GC. Michael Rogers was a further three seconds back of Leipheimer and Basso, causing him to drop from sixth to seventh in the GC.|$|E

500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd never heard it before, never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and <b>clear),</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E
2500|$|In the 18th century [...] [...] [...] {{given the}} then-prevailing {{dramatic}} {{differences between the}} property rights of the husband and the far lesser rights of the wife, only {{the consent of the}} husband would matter. Whether [...] "the master of the house" [...] consented or objected, his decision would control. Thus, if [...] "original understanding" [...] were to govern the outcome of this case, the search was clearly invalid because the husband did not consent. History, however, is not dispositive, because it is now <b>clear,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> matter of constitutional law, that the male and the female are equal partners.|$|E
2500|$|The {{popularity}} of mobile use worldwide, {{has been driven}} by the huge popularity increase of Android in Asian countries, where Android is highest ranked operating system in the statistics in virtually every south-east Asian country, while it also ranks most popular in almost every African country. Poland has been desktop-minority since April 2015, because of vastly most popular Android there, and other European countries, such as Albania (and Turkey), have also crossed over. South America continent is a little far of losing desktop-majority, but the first country there, Paraguay, has lost it [...] Android and mobile browsing in general has also gotten hugely popular in all other continents where desktop has a huge (mostly saturated) desktop base and the trend to mobile is not as <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fraction of the total web use.|$|E

2500|$|Players' {{performances}} are judged on two qualities - their score and their time taken {{to complete a}} level. A high score is often achieved by comboing clears, a task accomplished by either clearing blocks before a clear from before has finished, or having blocks fall and form a <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of a previous clear. On {{the side of the}} touch screen is an item called a [...] "POW Block", which players may use to clear the bottom two lines and drop all midair blocks, but sacrifices a reserve space with each use. Coins earned in the stage can be used to regain the lost reserve spaces. There is a more difficult version of each stage called [...] "Ura", [...] "Dark" [...] or [...] "Remix". These stages are locked initially, and can only become playable by using coins, which are achieved by clearing certain kinds of blocks. These coins {{can also be used to}} purchase songs that appear in the in-game store; the initial purchase includes only the original version of the song, while the remixed version can be purchased for an increased price. These songs can also be listened to while the Nintendo DSi is closed.|$|E
2500|$|Madame Tadolini, who, for {{the first}} time is about to appear in London, I am sure will become a great favorite, as she {{possesses}} all qualities necessary to captivate an English audience. She is inclined to , but she is very handsome on the stage, with dangerous eyes—the whitest shoulder in the world—and a sense of enjoyment in her acting, which your audience {{will not be able to}} resist. Tadolini's voice is a clear soprano-mezzo-soprano in its richest quality, with an intonation that approaches, when necessary, to the contralto. It is as <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bell, round, full, and sonorous, perfectly flexible and capable of all those modulations which a great artist like her dashes off, but which are so painful and difficult to thinner voices, and less qualified science. I heard the prima donna to great disadvantage, as she disdained to sing to an empty house (from political excitement), and used merely one half of her powers. Her acting was equally restrained, but the inward spirit could not be altogether subdued, and she occasionally broke forth into silvery and impassioned notes, and abandoned herself to that natural gaiety of song that rendered her in the scene the most captivating of coquettes. Had Tadolini known that the Times has ears everywhere, she might have exerted herself to please them; but criticism has art and judgment, and though she sung at mezzo voce, it was not difficult to prognosticate complete success for her at Her Majesty's Theatre.|$|E
