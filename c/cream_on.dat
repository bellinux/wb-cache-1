Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E

5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier <b>cream</b> <b>on</b> the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E

25|$|In Europe {{and early}} America, ice cream {{was made and}} sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland {{was the first to}} {{manufacture}} ice <b>cream</b> <b>on</b> a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.|$|E
25|$|A banana split is an ice cream-based dessert. In its classic form it {{is served}} in a long dish called a boat. A banana is cut in half {{lengthwise}} (hence the split) and laid in the dish. There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with scoops of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream {{served in a}} row between the split banana. Although the banana as an exotic fruit {{was introduced to the}} American public in the 1880s, it was later in 1904, that the banana split was invented in the town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania by 23-year-old pharmacy apprentice David Strickler, who was inspired to create a new sundae after seeing a soda jerk during a visit to Atlantic City. According to The Food Chronology, written in 1995 by James Trager, Strickler concocted his sundae to include three scoops of ice <b>cream</b> <b>on</b> a split banana, topped with chocolate syrup, marshmallow, nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry that sold for a dime. Other soda jerks soon imitated Strickler's banana split, albeit in other forms.|$|E

500|$|The Last Exit on Brooklyn {{opened on}} June 30, 1967 at 3930 Brooklyn Avenue NE near the University of Washington campus {{in a small}} light-industrial {{building}} leased from the University. It {{was one of the}} pioneer espresso bars in Seattle, adding an espresso machine shortly after Café Allegro opened the first in 1975. The Last Exit was known for its original espresso concoction named the Caffè Medici – [...] "a doppio poured over chocolate syrup and orange peel with whipped <b>cream</b> <b>on</b> top". Described in 1985 as [...] "America's second oldest, continuously running coffeehouse", it was also known for its inexpensive food and as a venue for folk music and bohemian conversation.|$|E
500|$|Beatles biographer Philip Norman {{considers}} [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] to be [...] "the album's best {{piece of}} rock and roll" [...] after McCartney's [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R." [...] While admiring the interplay between the saxophones and lead guitar as [...] "rousing rock-'n'-roll confectionery", Tim Riley views the song {{as one of the}} [...] "essentials" [...] on The Beatles and, with regard to the [...] "sheer feel" [...] of the performance, Harrison's most successful contribution to the band's discography since [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] in 1966. Former Creem critic Richard Riegel included [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] on his 1996 list of the ten most underrated Beatles tracks, saying: [...] "this is a great song by any standard, certainly the most fun George would have in the sensual world for many years to come. 'Savoy Truffle' is wonderfully British psychedelic throwaway pop, much like <b>Cream</b> <b>on</b> their pop-tarty Disraeli Gears, recorded back when Eric Clapton was a mortal, too." ...|$|E

500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{many of the}} scenes in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were improvised by the actors. For example, Chris Pratt changed the {{original}} line about Mark, [...] "He's thinking with his wiener instead of his brain," [...] to [...] "He's thinking {{with the head of}} his wiener, instead of the head of his brain." [...] Aziz Ansari also improvised the line about Mark, [...] "That dude has stuck it in some crazy chicks." [...] Schur was surprised NBC censors allowed either of the lines to stay in the episode. The clip of Leslie trying to confront a raccoon loose in the city hall building was originally filmed for a Parks and Recreation commercial, but was later included into this episode. The scene was filmed to establish a running gag that Pawnee has a terrible raccoon infestation problem. The J.J.'s Diner eatery featured in the episode was named after Goor's wife. Poehler speedily eats tremendous amounts of whipped <b>cream</b> <b>on</b> her waffles. This was inspired by Parks and Recreation story editor Rachel Axler, who producer Morgan Sackett said is [...] "a tiny, bird-like woman" [...] who eats enormous amounts of whipped cream.|$|E
500|$|In the kitchen, Jan quietly confronts Pam with a false {{assumption}} that Michael and Pam had once dated, while Michael {{attempts to get}} Jim and Andy to invest in Jan's candle-making business for [...] "only $10,000". [...] Jim's attempt to escape the party with Pam by pretending his apartment has flooded is unsuccessful. [...] Dwight arrives, uninvited, with his own food, wine glasses and his former babysitter (Beth Grant) as his date (Dwight describes the relationship as [...] "purely carnal"). The feud between Michael and Jan escalates, culminating in Jan's destruction of the television using one of Michael's beloved Dundie Awards. The police arrive, responding to a call about a disturbance; despite Jan becoming remorseful, Michael agrees {{to spend the night}} with Dwight under the advice of the officers. [...] Jim and Pam share a warm moment together eating take-out food in their car, repeatedly calling each other [...] "babe" [...] in a mockery of Michael and Jan; Jim also puts on Hunter's CD, which he stole from the condo. In Andy's car, Andy attempts to flirt with Angela by leaning in and tasting her ice cream cone; she responds coldly by smashing the ice <b>cream</b> <b>on</b> the outside of the door. Jan is then seen trying to fix the broken Dundie Award.|$|E
500|$|Sestak and Specter {{held their}} {{first and only}} {{televised}} debate on May 1 at Philadelphia's Fox affiliate, during which the two candidates bitterly attacked each other's character and honesty. The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes {{and said that the}} rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, [...] "Nobody has ever called me a liar," [...] and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush, and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, [...] "It goes to his ability to get things done, to get along with people. He's all peaches and <b>cream</b> <b>on</b> television." [...] Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a ban on assault weapons in the 1990s. The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the debate was [...] "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".|$|E
