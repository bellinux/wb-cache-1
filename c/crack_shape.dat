40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{theoretical}} model is proposed to evaluate effective stiffness in general symmetric composite laminates due to transverse cracking. In the model, the <b>crack</b> <b>shape</b> {{is assumed to}} be a function of crack density. The original contribution of this article is that crack geometries are not constrained to the forms of assumed shape functions. Instead, the natural forms of the <b>crack</b> <b>shape</b> functions are shown to have forms containing hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosines based on elastic analysis. Displacement fields and stress components satisfy the boundary and continuity conditions. The change in stiffness reduction is examined theoretically. Predicted results are compared with experimental data for [m/ 90 n]s glass/epoxy laminates and [m/ 90 n]s AS 4 /epoxy laminates.

40|$|Due to the {{existence}} of vertex singularity {{at the point where the}} crack intersects the free surface, stress distribution around the crack tip and the type of the singularity is changed. In the interior of the specimen the classical singular behaviour of the crack is dominant and can be described using analytic equations. Contrary to this, at the free surface or in the boundary layer close to free surface the vertex singularity is significant. The influence of vertex singularity on crack behaviour and a <b>crack</b> <b>shape</b> for a three-dimensional structure is described in this paper.

40|$|This paper (Part II), {{which is}} the second {{in a series of}} two papers, {{presents}} new closed-form solutions for net-section-collapse (NSC) analysis of circumferentially cracked pipes for several idealized <b>crack</b> <b>shapes</b> subjected to combined bending and tension (pressure-induced) loads. They are based on further simplications of generalized NSC equations developed in a parallel study. Analytical solutions were developed for cracks with constant-depth, parabolic, and elliptical shapes. For all three <b>crack</b> <b>shapes,</b> separate equations were developed when the entire crack is subjected to tension and when part of the crack is subjected to compression. For part of the crack subjected to compression, the proposed equations can handle both tight (with crack-closure) and blunt (without crack-closure) cracks. Currently, of the three <b>crack</b> <b>shapes</b> examined in this paper, previous analytical solutions exist only for the constant-depth crack. Hence, they should be useful for pipe fracture analysis involving other <b>crack</b> <b>shapes,</b> such as the elliptical and parabolic cracks.

As substitution for the alternative material there was used white brick or dolomite. Any research about compressive strength for wall has many done such as : Widiantoro (2006), Suprianto (2006), and Ervia (2006). But the usage of white brick as wall structures has never been searched. So that writer do some research about white brick for wall to know comparison of compressive strength and <b>cracked</b> <b>shape</b> from Lamongan and Bangkalan white brick wall. The result from the research about compressive strength for white brick wall could be explained that the bigger value of wall compressive strength is from Lamongan with 1, 651 MPa. While the white brick wall from Bangkalan only had smaller wall compressive strength value with 1, 295 Mpa. The most cracked on wall was looked at white brick and partly small happened at the paste. It means that tensile strength at paste is bigger than tensile srtength that was happened at white brick both from Lamongan and Bangkalan.

40|$|The {{presented}} master’s thesis {{deals with}} fatigue <b>crack</b> front <b>shape</b> estimation. The {{aim of this}} thesis {{is to create an}} iterative process leading to the real fatigue <b>crack</b> front <b>shape.</b> Thesis is solved using finite element method.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} corrosion driving forces and interfacial toughness for a coated material subjected to mechanical loading. If the protective coating is cracked, the substrate material may become exposed to a corrosive media. For a stress corrosion sensitive substrate material, this may lead to detrimental crack growth. A crack is assumed to grow by anodic dissolution, inherently leading to a blunt crack tip. The evolution of the crack surface is modelled as a moving boundary problem using an adaptive finite element method. The rate of dissolution along the crack surface in the substrate {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the chemical potential, which is function of the local surface energy density and elastic strain energy density. The surface energy tends to flatten the surface, whereas the strain energy due to stress concentration promotes material dissolution. The influence of the interface energy density parameter for the solid-fluid combination, interface corrosion resistance and stiffness ratios between coating and substrate is investigated. Three characteristic <b>crack</b> <b>shapes</b> are obtained; deepening and narrowing single cracks, branched cracks and sharp interface <b>cracks.</b> The <b>crack</b> <b>shapes</b> obtained by our simulations are similar to real sub-coating cracks reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Experimental and {{analytical}} studies are conducted {{to characterize the}} fatigue crack growth behavior of precracked aluminum plates repaired with asymmetric bonded composite patch. For single-sided repairs, due to the asymmetry {{and the presence of}} out-of-plane bending, <b>crack</b> front <b>shape</b> would become skewed curvilinear starting from a uniform through crack profile, as observed from previous studies. As the stress intensity factor (SIF) calculated at the crack tip is much influenced by <b>crack</b> front <b>shape,</b> it is necessary to predict and consider the actual <b>crack</b> front <b>shape</b> evolution for the accurate analysis of fatigue behavior. Nevertheless, in most previous studies, crack front has been modeled as a uniform straight one, which may cause inaccuracy. In this study, the actual crack front evolution is predicted and considered in estimating the fatigue life by implementing the successive analysis technique based on the three-dimensional finite element scheme. Experimental tests with various plate thicknesses (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm) are also carried out to verify the present approach. The analytical predictions of both the <b>crack</b> front <b>shape</b> evolution and the fatigue life are in good agreement with the experimental observations. By both experimental {{and analytical}} approaches, the characteristics of the fatigue crack growth behavior and the effectiveness of single-sided repairs according to the plate thickness are investigated.

40|$|In this study, {{the short}} crack {{initiation}} and growth behaviour in a notched sample under low-cycle fatigue (LCF) {{was investigated in}} a low-pressure steam turbine material. Different crack initiation mechanisms and <b>crack</b> <b>shape</b> evolution processes were experimentally observed in samples subjected to different surface treatments: polished, T 0 (industrially applied shot peening process) and T 1 (a less intense shot peening process). To better understand the effects of shot peening on fatigue, a 3 D finite element (FE) model was developed to investigate the interaction between crack growth and the effects induced by shot peening. Firstly, residual stress redistribution caused by both mechanical loading {{and the presence of}} a crack was numerically investigated.

It is widely known that the introduction of compressive residual stresses by cold working the surface can be highly beneficial in improving the fatigue performance of structural components. Although it is recognised that relaxation of surface compressive residual stress can reduce the potential benefits, the effects of residual stress on <b>crack</b> <b>shape</b> evolution are often overlooked. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the intensity of the surface compressive residual stress has a pronounced effect on fatigue crack initiation. A recently developed technique termed controlled stitch cold working, which applies differing intensities of compressive residual stress at specific regions in a structure, is shown in the paper to influence fatigue crack propagation life considerably.

The paper describes fatigue crack growth tests on shot peened specimens tested under uniaxial tension. The specimens were peened to varying intensities and of differing coverage areas. Cracks were initiated from starter notches after peening meaning the approach can be used for fatigue performance enhancement at the construction stage or later as part of a maintenance and repair strategy.
