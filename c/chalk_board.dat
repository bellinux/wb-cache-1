500|$|On March 1, 1959, Katsura {{appeared}} on CBS' popular primetime television show, What's My Line? The show {{was in the}} format of a guessing game, in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation), {{or in the case}} of a famous [...] "mystery guest", the identity of the contestant. After she signed in using Japanese characters on a <b>chalk</b> <b>board,</b> show officials listed Katsura's occupation for the audience as [...] "Professional Billiard Player (World's Women's Champion)". Panelist Arlene Francis was successful in guessing Katsura's occupation, though she admitted that she had read about her but said she had never seen her picture. Later that month Katsura made a guest appearance on ABC's You Asked For It, going behind the scenes of westerns to show how television productions set up and filmed a covered wagon rolling over and crashing on cue. She appeared again on You Asked For It in a November 25, 1960 broadcast, this time operating in her bailiwick, demonstrating trick shots for the camera.|$|E
500|$|The Back to the Future trilogy is parodied and {{referenced}} {{throughout the}} episode, {{along with many}} other movies and famous people throughout the 1980s. Other cultural references include how after going back in time, Peter becomes excited about his new prospects in life, and states to Cleveland {{that he is going to}} [...] "raise more hell than Hellraiser" [...] from the 1987 horror film Hellraiser. It also depicts Pinhead as weak and ridiculous, stating that the worst he can do is unscrew a salt shaker and trick someone into using it, causing salt to come out all over their food. The first scene where Lois appears at the swimming pool is a reference to a scene from the 1980 film Caddyshack, featuring the song [...] "Mr. Night" [...] by Kenny Loggins. Once Lois appears, she asks Peter if he would like to see the 1982 film Zapped!. Rejecting her offer, Peter decides to go partying with Cleveland instead and play the video game Menstrual Ms. Pac-Man, in addition to making out with actress Molly Ringwald. While there, Brian gets into a fight, and instructs the bar patron to meet him on top of the World Trade Center to fight him at eight A.M. on September 11, 2001. While downstairs in the alternate universe, Peter makes a reference to the Twilight Zone episode, [...] "The Eye of the Beholder." [...] The joke about the World Trade Center has been edited from current versions of the show accessible on Netflix as of January 2012. Returning to the present, Peter and Brian decide to watch television, and are shocked to discover that actor Chevy Chase is now the host of The Tonight Show. They also discover that former Vice President Al Gore is now President of the United States, and flying cars running on vegetable oil exist. A parody of the 1962 ABC animated series, Hanna-Barbera's The Jetsons, is then shown. In the alternate reality, Death refers to the Dick Cheney hunting accident, explaining that the [...] "Chairman of Halliburton" [...] accidentally shot and killed Karl Rove, Antonin Scalia, and Tucker Carlson (Brian groans that Peter and he can't change this wonderful future, but Peter flatly says [...] "I don't know who any of those people are"). The main plot of the episode, complete with the scene in which Peter and Brian are in the living room, with Brian explaining to Peter what happened using a <b>chalk</b> <b>board,</b> is a reference to the alternate universe scene in Back to the Future Part II.|$|E
50|$|It {{was common}} in primary and {{secondary}} schools to use rastra that use chalk on a <b>chalk</b> <b>board</b> for music education. They may be called staff liners. An alternative {{is to use a}} <b>chalk</b> <b>board</b> with staff lines etched in or taped on.|$|E

50|$|It was {{not until}} the summer of 1960 that the {{architectural}} plans were approved for the new High School. As construction continued in January 1961, the School Board unanimously approved the proposed color scheme of “shades of brown and yellow.” North Farmington High School opened on September 7, 1961 but lacked many needed supplies such as <b>chalk</b> <b>boards.</b> There were 598 students from grades 7-10 who attended that first day.|$|R
50|$|As amazing as this {{performance}} was, if time permitted afterward, Koltanowski would occasionally demonstrate his mental {{grasp of the}} board by reciting {{the information contained in}} the squares by rank or file, or even the two long diagonals. He occasionally performed the tour on two boards simultaneously. In Palo Alto, California, he conducted his performance on three <b>chalk</b> <b>boards,</b> jumping the knight back and forth between boards mid-move, until all 192 squares were completed. He made two errors and immediately corrected himself both times. At the time of {{this performance}}, Koltanowski was 80 years old.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Fetter, who is {{a graphic}} artist and not a mathematician, {{achieved}} the results he desired by describing the process of perspective drawing on a <b>chalk</b> <b>board,</b> and letting others write a computer program for the mathematically equivalent operations.|$|E

5000|$|Lincoln himself also {{reviewed}} books including The Unquiet Ghost by Adam Hochschild, saying [...] "Some of Hochschild's asides tend {{at times}} to be preachy, but his genuine human concern to understand what motivates {{men and women in}} the face of disaster and death make this an important book to read" [...] and When Titans Clashed by David M. Glantz and Jonathan M. House, saying [...] "This book does not present history in human terms. Instead, it distills one of the most dramatic chapters of human history into a passively written, albeit very important, analysis drawn from the contents of map-rooms, <b>chalk</b> <b>boards,</b> and tens of thousands of pages of military reports".|$|R
50|$|A mother {{sends her}} son on a camping trip with {{a leader who}} has led this trip into the {{mountains}} 16 times before without mishap; that is until this time. Every single camper and leader and driver die with no explanation. As the grieving mother who is the protagonist begins {{to accept the fact}} that her son, Danny, is dead she starts getting vicious bully-like attacks from nowhere saying he is not dead, such as writing on <b>chalk</b> <b>boards,</b> words from printers and other various 'signs'. Along with her new friend, Elliot Stryker, Christina Evans sets out to find out what could have possibly happened on the day that her son 'died'.|$|R
50|$|Like the French version, {{mentions}} of American {{culture are}} often not mentioned such as TV shows not known internationally, while the episodes appear uncut and broadcast in full with the end credits intact.

50|$|At times, while {{songs were}} being sung by Agnes Bernelle, the curtain was an opaque surface, {{like a white}} <b>chalk</b> <b>board,</b> and at other times, the curtain became transparent, {{revealing}} {{a scene from the}} play behind (see photos, right). The curtain was suspended on a simple set of wires, and parted in the middle to reveal each scene.|$|E

5000|$|De Lairesse {{suffered}} from hereditary or congenital syphilis, which {{caused him to}} go blind around 1690. The saddle nose which the disease gave him is clearly visible on the portrait which Rembrandt painted of him around 1665 and the engraving in the [...] "Teutsche Academie" [...] by Joachim von Sandrart (1683). After losing his sight, De Lairesse was forced to give up painting and focused instead on lecturing twice a week. De Lairesse explicitly states that despite his blindness, he is perfectly able to design a perfect composition. He drew on two <b>chalk</b> <b>boards</b> and was assisted by his audience and his son Johannes who collected their notes. After several years two books on art were published: ...|$|R

Our initial exploratory research addresses the 'sharing' of object manipulation and gcsturing related to a spoken diaJogue, in a situation where subject pairs telecommunicate when performing a given task; the video images of the two spatially separated workspaces have been fused to make up one virtually-shared workspace at both sites, enabling gesturing in relation to all present objccts; actual manipulation is. of course, related to local objects only...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{announced}} a band and fan experiment called [...] "The Stew Art Series" [...] (or [...] "S2" [...] for short), whereby lucky fans get to [...] "conduct" [...] the band, in a way. An S2 event is {{an experiment in}} crowd-sourced improvisation. One hundred percent of the music performed at a S2 event is improvised, and fans {{are the ones who}} serve as directors. Using communication mediums, which could range from text messaging to prewritten cue cards to <b>chalk</b> <b>boards,</b> fans send out ideas, descriptive words, phrases, and pop culture references. The band’s soundman, Kevin Browning, sorts through them in real-time through a mobile database and projected them onto a screen for the band to then interpret musically, mid-jam. These are presented to the band who then composes jams on the fly based around those ideas.|$|R
50|$|Early {{programming}} {{was purely}} educational, {{in some cases}} consisting of {{nothing more than a}} teacher {{standing in front of a}} <b>chalk</b> <b>board</b> and lecturing. About half of the programs aired were locally produced, with the rest coming from National Educational Television (NET) and other sources. When the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) succeeded NET in 1970, the focus of programming changed to educational and entertainment programming.|$|E
50|$|Courier {{companies}} need {{a program to}} track customers that request a delivery, details about the package, and who will be delivering the package to the recipient. The central person responsible for a smooth transaction is the operations manager or dispatcher. In the 'old days', this was done on a <b>chalk</b> <b>board</b> or white board. Now shipments show up on a single screen, {{making it easier to}} follow up on the deliveries.|$|E
50|$|In February 2013, Screaming Females {{released}} the self-produced EP Chalk Tape for streaming online.

In writing Chalk Tape the band laid out their plans on a <b>chalk</b> <b>board</b> beforehand and then recorded the songs with no rewrites.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Good Hit" [...] begins with Lopez holding a pointer {{in her left}} hand, while asking for the {{attention}} of the students. Two <b>chalk</b> <b>boards</b> are shown behind her, saying the words [...] "Fierceology" [...] and [...] "Work It Out 101". Lopez is then seen dancing on chairs with several female students, each with a hair dryer in hand. These scenes are intercut with Lopez teaching the students how to whip their hair. They then strut up and down a hallway. The music video was noted for its sex appeal, in which Lopez and the students are dressed in Dolce & Gabbana. An alternate version of the video was leaked online in December 2011. This version begins with Lopez posing in front of a mirror, draped in jewelry and sitting on a couch with a telephone. This footage is taken from a behind the scenes look at the photoshoot for Love?. These scenes are intercut with that from the original version.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other Hannah Montana music videos, [...] "Ordinary Girl" [...] is not {{a concert}} taping performance. Hannah in the video is also a model, and not Miley Cyrus, as Miley Cyrus refused {{to appear in the}} video. It premiered on July 2, 2010 and starts out in Montana's {{dressing}} room where she is getting ready for a concert. She uses her video camera to tape everything that goes on, leading up to her stepping onstage, where a screaming crowd is waiting. She waves, then hands the camera to a girl in the front row of the concert. The video then flashes to a school room where the girl has a party with her friends after receiving the camera, while shots from the Hannah Montana season 3 concert are playing on the <b>chalk</b> <b>boards.</b> The camera is then passed onto another girl who bumps into a boy who begins talking to her. R5 artists Riker and Ross Lynch are seen in the classroom.|$|R
