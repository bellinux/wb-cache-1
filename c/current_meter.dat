2500|$|The {{direct method}} {{measures}} the relative {{motion of the}} target through the water by attaching a <b>current</b> <b>meter</b> directly to the leeway drift target. The first leeway study that used the direct method was conducted by Suzuki and Sato (1977). [...] They allowed a 3.9 m bamboo pole to drift from the ship at a prescribed length, measured the drift direction and {{the time it took}} for the line to pay out, and regressed these variables against the ship’s wind speed. [...] Fitzgerald et al. (1993) were the first to employ the direct method using autonomous outfitted leeway targets off the coast of Newfoundland, which eliminated many of the errors associated with the indirect method and produced a continuous record of leeway for the search object in various oceanic conditions. [...] Many of the studies listed in Allen and Plourde (1999) used S4 electromagnetic current meters produced by InterOceans System, Inc. [...] Other current meters include the Aanderaa <b>current</b> <b>meter</b> (DCS 3500), which used Doppler techniques to remotely sense the currents and Sontek Corporation’s Argtonaut XR acoustic <b>current</b> <b>meter.</b> [...] Allen and Plourde (1999) listed eight direct method leeway studies conducted from 1977 to 1999.|$|E
2500|$|George S. Blake {{worked in}} the {{vicinity}} of Nantucket and Boston until 21 September 1892. She was in New York on 11 and 12 October {{to take part in the}} New York Columbian Celebration before heading south to make an examination of part of the Hatteras Shoal. On her return north she picked up the Survey's schooner [...] for tow on 2 December 1892 in Norfolk from where both ships went to the Washington Navy Yard. George S. Blake prepared there for her appearance at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago there until 2 April 1893 when she sailed north to join Bache in a special mission. [...] The commanding officers of both Bache and George S. Blake had been directed on 30 March 1893, to support the speed trials of the new cruiser, [...] in Newport Harbor. The final trial was over a [...] course laid out in 1890 by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The vessels supported current measurements on the course using the Pillsbury <b>current</b> <b>meter</b> through 17 April. George S. Blake then proceeded to Chicago, Illinois to be a part of the Coast Survey's exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition where she remained until 5 October 1893, sailing from Chicago 15 October and arriving in Baltimore on 24 November 1893.|$|E

40|$|Hydroacoustic <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> use the Doppler {{effect to}} measure the {{velocity}} of suspended sediment par-ticles in water, which can then {{be used as a}} measure of the water velocity. Along with measured cross-sectional area, these measured water velocities are used to compute the discharge of a stream. The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) Georgia District has recently implemented the use of hydroacoustic <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> {{to measure the}} discharge of streams throughout Georgia. Hydroacoustic <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> have many advantages over conventional <b>current</b> <b>meters,</b> such as measuring discharge in a timelier and more efficient manner and measuring discharge during unsteady conditions. These advantages allow the USGS Georgia District to measure the discharge at sites that could not have been measured with the use of conventional cur-rent <b>meters.</b> Hydroacoustic <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> also can be used for other applications, such as using acoustic back-scatter as a surrogate for suspended sediment concentration.

40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) is {{evaluating}} {{the use of}} hydroacoustic <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> for making discharge measurements in shallow rivers and streams. The USGS historically has made discharge measurements in shallow rivers using mechanical, impellor-type <b>current</b> <b>meters</b> attached to a wading rod. The evaluation project has focused on three categories of hydroacoustic meters: an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) called a Flowtracker 3, an acoustic Doppler velocity profiler (BoogieDopp), and bottom-tracking acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). The USGS role in this project includes providing USGS discharge-computation methods and algorithms to instrument manufacturers and evaluating instruments in the laboratory and field. An ADV (Flowtracker) designed for making discharge measurements in shallow rivers, has been tested in a USGS tow tank and was found to meet USGS calibration standards for mechanical, impellor-type <b>current</b> <b>meters.</b> The Flowtracker was field tested by USGS offices in five states; the tests were conducted by comparing discharge measurements made with the ADV to discharge measurements made with mechanical, impellor-type <b>current</b> <b>meters.</b> In general, the comparisons of Flowtracker performance to mechanical-meter results were favorable. An acoustic Doppler velocity profiler (BoogieDopp) is being evaluated for making discharge measurements in shallow rivers. The Boogiedopp will measure vertical velocity profiles at stationary positions across a channel, and the velocity profiles {{will be used to}} compute discharge. Discharge-computation software based on USGS methods and algorithms is under development for the acoustic Doppler velocity profiler. The USGS will evaluate bottom-tracking ADCPs from two manufacturers for making discharge measurements in shallow water.
