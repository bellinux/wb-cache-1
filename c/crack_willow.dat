5|$|The main {{species of}} trees in the woods include English oak, sessile oak, hornbeam, beech, silver birch, wild service tree, aspen, rowan, field maple, <b>crack</b> <b>willow,</b> wild cherry, hazel and holly.|$|E
5|$|This covers {{most of the}} reserve. Silver birch is dominant, with a few <b>crack</b> <b>willow,</b> goat willow, {{some wild}} cherry and {{sycamore}} in the canopy. Shrubs include hawthorn, elder, holly, yew and rowan, with garden escapes like buddleia, Oregon grape, cotoneaster, privet. There are some saplings of pedunculate oak, mostly around the edge, and holm oak. The field layer is mainly thick bramble, with ivy in denser shade. Ferns include male fern, broad buckler fern and the less common lady fern.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the park}} includes many communities of a Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean type: warm oak forests with undergrowth of evergreen sclerophyll shrubs, such as tree heath (Erica arborea), butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), Rose of Sharon (Hypericum calycinum), green olive tree (Phillyrea latifolia), Cistus incanus, sage-leaved rock rose (Cistus salvifolius), among others. The xerothermic grasslands along the coast and in some areas to the west {{of the park}} have replaced forests destroyed by human activity. The most widespread floral communities of that type are dominated by Chrysopogon gryllus, Bothriochloa ischaemum and bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa). The coastal dunes are home to psammophytic vegetation. The river banks are covered with dense forests of black alder (Alnus glutinosa), white willow (Salix alba) and <b>crack</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix fragilis).|$|E
50|$|Corporation Island is {{unpopulated}} and {{is heavily}} wooded with white <b>willows,</b> <b>crack</b> <b>willows</b> and weeping willows, and hybrid black poplars.|$|R
50|$|On {{the shores}} are plants like alders, hybrid <b>crack</b> <b>willows,</b> osiers, elms, ashes, grey willow, birch, aspens, great yellow-cress, gypsywort, skullcap, whorled mint (a hybrid species between corn mint and water mint), trifid bur-marigold, slender tufted-sedge, reed sweet-grass, annual meadow-grass, {{silverweed}} and purple-loosestrife.|$|R
50|$|Former water-meadows {{are found}} along many river valleys, where the sluice gates, {{channels}} and field ridges {{may still be}} visible (however the ridges {{should not be confused}} with ridge and furrow topography, which is found on drier ground and has a very different origin in arable farming). The drains in a derelict water-meadow are generally clogged and wet, and most of the carrier channels are dry, with the smaller ones on the ridge-tops often invisible. If any main carrier channels still flow, they usually connect permanently to the by-carriers. The larger sluices may be concealed under the roots of trees (such as <b>crack</b> <b>willows),</b> which have grown up from seedlings established in the brickwork. The complex mixture of wet and drier ground often gives derelict water-meadows particularly high wetland biodiversity.|$|R
25|$|Among other notable {{parks are}} the Maritime Victory Park on Krestovsky Island and the Moscow Victory Park in the south, both commemorating the victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War, {{as well as}} the Central Park of Culture and Leisure occupying Yelagin Island and the Tauride Garden around the Tauride Palace. The most common trees grown in the parks are the English oak, Norway maple, green ash, silver birch, Siberian Larch, blue spruce, <b>crack</b> <b>willow,</b> limes, and poplars. Important dendrological {{collections}} dating back to the 19th century are hosted by the Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden and the Park of the Forestry Academy.|$|E
25|$|Whangamarino Wetland {{consists}} of a rich and representative variety of wetland ecosystems (peat bog, swamp, mesotrophic lags, open water and river systems); one of the features that lent support to its designation under the Ramsar Convention. 239 species of wetland plants {{are found in the}} Whangamarino, 60 percent of which are indigenous. A number of these are uncommon or extremely rare, including the water milfoil Myriophyllum robustum, the clubmoss Lycopodium serpentinum, and the critically endangered swamp helmet orchid Anzybas carseii, now found nowhere else in the world. Baumea spp., mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and wire rush (Empodisma minus) are the dominant vegetation of the peat bogs while greater species diversity is found in the mineralised swamp zones, including introduced species such as grey willow (Salix cinerea) and <b>crack</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix fragilia). Mosses and lichens are also well represented in the wetland.|$|E
500|$|Willow carr (locally {{uncommon}} wet woodland {{including the}} [...] "mangrove swamp") with goat willow, grey willow, and some <b>crack</b> <b>willow,</b> with hybrids. The shrubs and field layer {{are similar to}} compartment 1; there is some honeysuckle and common horsetail, hemlock water dropwort, gypsywort, yellow flag, pendulous sedge.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Nuo opera {{is that the}} performers wear masks. Different roles require different masks to reveal the characters, through their changing facial features and decorations. The masks are highly aesthetic. The art, selected materials, colors and applications of Nuo opera masks vary among the regions, ethnic groups, culture and aesthetic interests. That distinctiveness adds the masks' beauty. The masks are mainly made of poplar and willow since poplar is light and less prone to <b>cracks,</b> while <b>willow</b> {{is widely regarded as}} having the power to ward off evil. Nuo opera involves many acrobatic performances, such as getting into a hot pot, holding burned stones, crossing a fiery pit, swallowing and blowing fire, and stepping on a mountain of swords. As most of the performers are specially trained, they are good at giving exciting performances.|$|R
