5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not {{guaranteed}} entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> team from England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} {{his first}} season on Ally McBeal, over the Thanksgiving 2000 holiday, Downey was arrested when his room at Merv Griffin's Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs, California was searched by the police, who were {{responding}} to an anonymous 911 call. Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium. Despite the fact that, if convicted, he <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more Ally McBeal episodes.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, Gascoigne {{was arrested}} for drink driving. He {{subsequently}} admitted being {{more than four times}} over the limit at Newcastle upon Tyne Magistrates Court. One day after being warned he <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> prison sentence for drink driving, Gascoigne {{was arrested for}} possession of cocaine. He should have appeared in court on 11 November to be sentenced for the drink driving offence, but instead he went into rehab on the south coast of England. He was given an eight-week suspended sentence on 9 December 2010.|$|E

5|$|On 19 September 2007, {{a federal}} {{complaint}} was issued against Hsu by the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. The complaint alleges that Hsu's investment offerings were a Ponzi scheme that paid early investors with {{money that was}} contributed by later investors, that Hsu pressured investors to contribute to candidates for office, providing them {{with a list of}} candidates to choose from and that Hsu reimbursed some contributors to candidates for office in the amount of their contributions. Based on these actions, Hsu is charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and violating the Federal Election Campaign Act. He <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> sentence of up to 45 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{announcing the}} 2013 provincial budget Kennedy {{warned that if}} expediters were not brought under control the {{province}} <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> $1.6 billion deficit for the coming fiscal year and that the province's debt could increase by $4 billion in three years. These figures were much lower when the budget was brought down on March 26, 2013, but the Dunderdale government was still projecting a deficit of $563.8 million for the 2013 fiscal year. Roughly 1,200 public sector jobs were eliminated, due to spending cuts totalling over $300 million.|$|E
5|$|Texans were {{hesitant}} {{to pursue a}} US-Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense from America, since a full-scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public. If ratification of the annexation measure stalled in the US Senate, Texas <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> war alone against Mexico. Because only Congress could declare war, the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to commit the US to support of Texas. But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense, President Houston, responding to urgent calls for annexation from the Texas Congress of December 1843, authorized the reopening of annexation negotiations.|$|E
40|$|The {{debate about}} the {{relationship}} between climate change and conflict rages on. This August, Science published a high-profile evidence survey, Quantifying the Influence of Climate on Human Conflict, which gained worldwide media attention, including the BBC coverage quoted above and a New York Times op-ed by the authors arguing that “our results suggest that our children and grandchildren <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>an</b> increasingly hot and angry planet. ...|$|R
5000|$|Even {{customers}} from jurisdictions that levy sales taxes can in theory have additional tax liabilities when shopping in neighboring no-tax or lower-tax jurisdictions. For example, if an adjacent {{state has a}} slightly lower tax rate than the purchaser's home, that shopper <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>an</b> additional tax burden even though the purchase was already taxed {{at the point of}} sale. The difference in tax rates is referred to by collecting authorities as [...] "tax discount".|$|R

5|$|The lack of {{a passing}} loop {{suitable}} for passenger trains on the Amlwch line meant that trains could only operate every two hours. Coordinating this limited timetable with the main line services through Gaerwen was difficult, and passengers <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> long wait on occasions. To make the branch line workings more flexible, a passing loop was proposed for Llangwyllog in March 1914. The work was completed for the summer timetables. This required introducing a new working section, and Llangwyllog became a staff station. As the new section {{was in the middle}} of a line, a third type of staff was required (a C configuration); one of only a few sections on the LNWR that did not use a type A or B staff.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E

25|$|The first {{documented}} {{description of}} a peer review process {{is found in the}} Ethics of the Physician written by Ishaq bin Ali al-Rahwi (854–931) of al-Raha, Syria, who describes the first medical peer review process. His work, as well as later Arabic medical manuals, state that a visiting physician must always make duplicate notes of a patient's condition on every visit. When the patient was cured or had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical council of other physicians, who would review the practising physician's notes to decide whether his/her performance have met the required standards of medical care. If their reviews were negative, the practicing physician <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> lawsuit from a maltreated patient.|$|E
25|$|The first legal {{initiative}} to outlaw the devadasi system {{dates back to}} the 1934 Bombay Devadasi Protection Act. This act pertained to the Bombay province as it existed in the British Raj. The Bombay Devadasi Protection Act made dedication of women illegal, whether consensual or not. According to this act, marriage by a devadasi was to be considered lawful and valid, and the children from such wedlock were to be treated as legitimate. The Act also laid down grounds for punitive action that could be taken against any person or persons found to be involved in dedications, except the woman who was being dedicated. Those found guilty of such acts <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> year’s imprisonment, a fine, or both. The 1934 Act also provided rules, which were aimed at protecting the interests of the devadasis. Whenever there was a dispute over ownership of land involving a devadasi, the local Collector was expected to intervene.|$|E

He caught the last boat back before the Nazis invaded the Lowlands and immediately offered his services to the Dutch government-in-exile. Together with the late Hendrik Willem van Loon, Fuld started the shortwave broadcasts to the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. Rumors reached the UK of what was happening to the Jewish population of the Netherlands and that almost the complete Fuld family had been murdered by the Nazis. As a result, during this period he no longer <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>an</b> audience and stopped singing completely.|$|R

25|$|In March 2016, Pakistan was {{eliminated}} from the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing to India, New Zealand and Australia. Many were left disappointed after this and the PCB announced they would take action. There were initial talks that Ahmed Shehzad and Umar Akmal <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> potential 2-year ban following their poor performance {{but this was not}} verified. However, the focus was on Waqar Younis and Shahid Afridi. The highlight of this was that Waqar Younis had written up a 6-page report on recommendations along with discreet reasons he though contributed to the failure. However, the PCB were accused of leaking this report to the media, where all details were publicised, particularly popularising the fact Waqar thought it was Afridi's fault. The PCB then refused to meet with Younis, confirming to most that they were responsible in leaking the files. Younis announced his resignation due to this just after Afridi resigned as T20 captain in April 2016. He said the PCB's actions were a disgrace. The PCB apologised to Waqar Younis for the leak on 6 April 2016.|$|E
25|$|During {{a charity}} abseil {{on top of}} The Queen Victoria, Shirley proposes to Phil and he accepts. At their {{engagement}} party, Sharon Watts returns, begging for help, as she has left her fiancé John Hewland (Jesse Birdsall) at the altar and he has her son, Dennis Rickman Jnr (Harry Hickles). Phil helps her to rescue Dennis and they return with Phil to Walford. When Phil gets home, he finds that Shirley knows the truth about Heather's death. After a furious confrontation, he tries to convince her not to tell the police but Ben confesses {{to the police and}} is charged with Heather's murder. Jay is charged with perverting the course of justice and Phil orders him to change his statement so Ben will not go to prison, but Jay refuses and Phil disowns him but does manage to convince his cousin, Roxy, to lie in her statement. His solicitor, Ritchie Scott (Sian Webber), tells him that Ben <b>could</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> minimum of 10 years in prison. Shirley ends her relationship with Phil as she is unable to cope with his betrayal. Phil visits Ben in prison with Ian in the hope of persuading Ben to retract his confession but Ben refuses, insisting that he is doing the right thing as he needs to be punished. Ben refuses to have any contact with his family until his release.|$|E
