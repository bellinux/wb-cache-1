500|$|Scientists {{continued}} {{to search for}} new synthetic dyes that would be effective on cellulose fibres like cotton and linen, {{and that would be}} more <b>colorfast</b> on wool and silk than the early anilines. [...] Chrome or mordant dyes produced a muted but very fast color range for woollens. [...] These were followed by acid dyes for animal fibres (from 1875) and the synthesis of indigo in Germany in 1880. [...] The work on indigo {{led to the development of}} a new class of dyes called vat dyes in 1901 that produced a wide range of fast colors for vegetable fibres. [...] Disperse dyes were introduced in 1923 to color the new textiles of cellulose acetate, which could not be colored with any existing dyes. [...] Today disperse dyes are the only effective means of coloring many synthetics. [...] Reactive dyes for both wool and cotton were introduced in the mid-1950s, and are used both in commercial textile production and in craft dyeing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Bayer sought medical {{applications}} of its dyes. Gerhard Domagk {{identified as an}} antibacterial a red azo dye, introduced in 1935 as the first antibacterial drug, prontosil, soon found at Pasteur Institute to be a prodrug degraded in vivo into sulfanilamide – a colorless intermediate for many, highly <b>colorfast</b> azo dyes – already with an expired patent, synthesized in 1908 in Vienna by the researcher Paul Gelmo for his doctoral research. [...] By the 1940s, over 500 related sulfa drugs were produced. Medications in high demand during World War II (1939–45), these first miracle drugs, chemotherapy of wide effectiveness, propelled the American pharmaceutics industry. [...] In 1939, at Oxford University, seeking an alternative to sulfa drugs, Howard Florey developed Fleming's penicillin into the first systemic antibiotic drug, penicillin G. (Gramicidin, developed by René Dubos at Rockefeller Institute in 1939, was the first antibiotic, yet its toxicity restricted it to topical use.) [...] After World War II, Cornelius P.

50|$|Garments {{normally}} carry separate care/treatment labels which, in some regions, {{are subject}} to legislation. These labels typically indicate how the item should be washed (e.g., machine washed vs. dry cleaning), whether bleach can be used. Textile labels may be woven into the garment or attached, and may be heat resistant (so survivable in hot-air dryers and when pressed), <b>colorfast</b> (so does not bleed onto the garment), washable, leather or PVC/Plastic. Printed labels are an alternative to woven labels. Some upholstered furniture and mattresses have labels that are required by law, describing {{the contents of the}} stuffing.|$|E
50|$|Berries {{have been}} used in some {{cultures}} for dyeing. Many berries contain juices that can easily stain, affording use as a natural dye. For example, blackberries are useful for making dyes, especially when ripe berries can easily release juice to produce a <b>colorfast</b> effect. Rubus berries, such as blackberry, raspberry, black raspberry, dewberry, loganberry, and thimbleberry all produce dye colors. These were once used by Native Americans. In Hawaii, the native raspberry called 'akala' was used to dye tapa cloth with lavender and pink hues, whereas berries from the dianella lily were used for blue coloration, and berries from the black nightshade were used to produce green coloration.|$|E

In 1975, he started <b>Colorfast</b> Corporation, which grew under his management and ownership to become the largest independent photofinisher in Western Canada. At its peak, the company had twenty seven retail outlets, three manufacturing facilities and serviced five hundred retail outlets in Western Canada. McClelland sold the business to an employee, when he stood as a candidate in the 1993 federal election. In 1992, McClelland was honoured as a [...] "Distinguished Friend of the Institute" [...] by the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology.|$|E
50|$|Olefin fibers {{have great}} bulk and cover while having low {{specific}} gravity. This means “Warmth without the weight.” The fibers have low moisture absorption, {{but they can}} wick moisture and dry quickly. Olefin is abrasion, stain, sunlight, fire, and chemical resistant. It does not dye well, but {{has the advantage of}} being <b>colorfast.</b> Since Olefin has a low melting point, textiles can be thermally bonded. The fibers have the lowest static of all manufactured fibers and a medium luster. One of the most important properties of olefin is its strength. It keeps its strength in wet or dry conditions and is very resilient. The fiber can be produced for strength of different properties.|$|E
50|$|Renuzit {{offered a}} {{cleaning}} solvent at one time, sold in 4-ounce steel dispenser cans {{similar to those}} used for multipurpose household oil, and in steel quart and gallon cans {{similar to those used}} for paint thinner. It was apparently a dry-cleaning fluid, believed to be Benzine based and excellent for all <b>colorfast</b> objects and most, if not all, plastics, then & now. It was/is a good selection to remove the sticky adhesive left behind by older labels. In 1972, a gallon retailed for approximately $2.49. At that time, the label indicated that the Drackett Products Co. was the USA distributor. Manufacture of the product appears to have been discontinued in the early 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{components}} of modern scrapbooking is the archival quality of the supplies. Designed to preserve photographs and journaling in their original state, materials encouraged by most serious scrapbookers are of a higher quality than those of many typical photo albums commercially available. Scrappers insist on acid-free, lignin-free papers, stamp ink, and embossing powder. They also use pigment-based inks, which are fade resistant, <b>colorfast,</b> and often waterproof. Many scrappers use buffered paper, which will protect photos from acid in memorabilia used in the scrapbook. Older [...] "magnetic" [...] albums are not acid-free and thus cause damage to the photos and memorabilia included in them. Gloves, too, are used to protect photos from the oil on hands.|$|E

50|$|Redwork {{is a form}} of American embroidery, {{also called}} art needlework, that {{developed}} in the 19th century and was particularly popular between 1855 and 1925. It traditionally uses red thread, chosen because red dyes were the first commercially available <b>colorfast</b> dyes, in the form of Turkey red embroidery floss. Redwork designs are composed of simple stitches and were mainly used to decorate household objects in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially quilts. Patterns for individual quilt blocks were sold for a penny in the United States, making them popular and affordable. In the 21st century, redwork has seen a resurgence among crafters. The main stitch used in redwork is backstitch or outline stitching, formerly known as Kensington stitch. Redwork was a common introductory form of embroidery taught to children in the 19th and 20th century. Children would make quilts decorated with redwork motifs, with motifs of various sizes prior to approximately 1910 and uniform sizes after that year. It was also a way for women with skills in pattern stamping or embroidery to generate their own source of income from the home.|$|E
