5|$|Team <b>cohesion</b> {{is viewed}} as ‘‘a general {{indicator}} of synergistic group interaction—or process’’. Furthermore, <b>cohesion</b> {{has been linked to}} greater coordination during team-tasks as well as improved satisfaction, productivity, and group interactions. Team efficacy refers to team members’ perceptions of task-specific team competence. This construct is thought {{to create a sense of}} confidence within the team that enables the group to persevere when faced with hardship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cohesion</b> between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create <b>cohesion.</b> Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E
5|$|Engelbart {{served on}} the board of {{directors}} of Erhard Seminars Training (EST). Several key ARC personnel were also involved. Although EST had been recommended by other researchers, the controversial nature of EST and other social experiments reduced the morale and social <b>cohesion</b> of the ARC community.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to destroy the <b>cohesion</b> of the Crusader army and unsettle their resolve, the Ayyubid onslaught was {{accompanied}} by the clashing of cymbals and gongs, trumpets blowing and men screaming war-cries.|$|E
5|$|The present modern {{civil service}} was formed after the {{partition}} of India in 1947. It was Sardar Patel's vision that the Civil Service should strengthen <b>cohesion</b> and national unity. The values of integrity, impartiality and merit remain the guiding principles of Indian civil services.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} rein back their troops, who lost all <b>cohesion.</b> Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
5|$|Both {{operations}} were {{hampered by the}} German need to rely on their Croatian allies {{as well as the}} fact that both forces were ill-equipped for operations in mountainous terrain during extreme winter conditions. The Croatian units had proven not to be a useful addition to the operation, as they possessed {{little in the way of}} fighting power, had little unit <b>cohesion</b> and suffered from serious supply problems.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a series}} of harassing attacks by Saladin's, battle was joined {{on the morning of}} 7 September 1191. Richard's army {{successfully}} resisted attempts to disrupt its <b>cohesion</b> until the Hospitallers broke ranks and charged; Richard then committed all his forces to the attack. He regrouped his army after its initial success, and led it to victory. The battle resulted in the coastal area of central Palestine, including the port of Jaffa, returning to Christian control.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Nalder {{reported}} after {{a survey}} of his province {{that there was a}} general lack of tribal <b>cohesion.</b> Governor-General Sir Stewart Symes at Khartoum had little interest in development of the south of Sudan and he advised the local officials that chiefs should have territorial rather than ethnic authority. In 1936 Mongalla and the Bahr al-Ghazal provinces were incorporated into the Equatoria province, with headquarters at Juba, with parts of Upper Nile province detached.|$|E
5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social <b>cohesion</b> and individual well-being. Social <b>cohesion</b> becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|On {{capturing}} the second-line, {{elements of the}} Liverpool Scottish decided to consolidate the shallow trenches that afforded little protection. The battle had quickly degenerated into a disorganised and chaotic affair, with British battalions losing <b>cohesion</b> and becoming mixed up with each other. An intensive German barrage decimated the occupants of the second-line trenches, while the 10th's temporary commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.G. Thin, was wounded by gunfire. The remainder of the Liverpool Scottish continued onto the third-line with portions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and 1st Northumberland Fusiliers.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair eschewed {{the sound}} and lyrical content of her debut album Perfectionist (2011) in favour of a heavier atmosphere, driven by strong {{percussion}} and electric guitars. The lyrics, largely co-written by Sinclair and Bhasker, explore the former's problematic childhood and adolescence. Accompanying the album, its cover art was designed by Sinclair and symbolizes the album's main themes. Upon release, music critics commended the album's <b>cohesion,</b> and perceived an evolution in Sinclair' songwriting.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and logistical support and was hampered {{by a lack}} of <b>cohesion</b> due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical support base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and <b>cohesion.</b> While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|The classic legionary scutum, a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century. All troops except archers adopted large, wide, usually dished, ovoid (or sometimes round) shields. These shields were still called Scuta or Clipei, despite {{the difference in}} shape. Shields, from examples found at Dura Europos and Nydam, were of vertical plank construction, the planks glued, and mostly faced inside and out with painted leather. The edges of the shield were bound with stitched rawhide, which shrank as it dried improving structural <b>cohesion.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} Community Development Councils (CDCs) {{appointed}} {{by the board of}} management of the PA for districts in Singapore, namely, the Central Singapore CDC, North East CDC, North West CDC, South East CDC and South West CDC. The functions of a CDC include fostering community bonding and strengthening social <b>cohesion</b> amongst the people of Singapore; and advising the PA on matters affecting the well-being of residents in districts, the provision and use of public facilities and services within districts, and the use of public funds allocated to districts for community activities.|$|E
5|$|There is no ethical <b>cohesion</b> {{within the}} New Age phenomenon, {{although}} Hanegraaff {{argued that the}} central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential. Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic good and evil, negative events that happen are interpreted not {{as the result of}} evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.|$|E
5|$|Today, Oldham has large {{communities}} with heritage from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan {{and parts of}} the Caribbean. At the time of the 2001 census, over one in four of its residents identified themselves as from a South Asian or British Asian ethnic group. Cultural divisions along ethnic backgrounds are strong within the town, with poor cross-community integration and <b>cohesion</b> along Asian and white backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of {{the introduction of the}} euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, although one study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general <b>cohesion</b> policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a report}} by the Diário de Notícias, Portugal had allowed {{considerable}} slippage in state-managed public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and <b>cohesion</b> funds were mismanaged across almost four decades. When the global crisis disrupted the markets and the world economy, together with the US subprime mortgage crisis and the eurozone crisis, Portugal {{was one of the first}} economies to succumb, and was affected very deeply.|$|E
5|$|As Philip marched south, {{his opponents}} blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip {{commanded}} {{the right wing}} and Alexander the left, accompanied {{by a group of}} Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's <b>cohesion,</b> Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Crystalline solids <b>cohesion</b> is {{obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist <b>cohesion.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the nationalists' {{point of}} view, the Assyrian Levies were British proxies {{to be used}} by their 'masters' to destroy the new Iraqi state whose {{independence}} the British had consistently opposed. The British allowed their Assyrian auxiliary troops to retain their arms and granted them special duty and privileges: guarding military air installations and receiving higher pay than the Iraqi Arab recruits. Under British protection, the Assyrian Levies did not become Iraqi citizens after until 1924. The nationalists believed the British were hoping for the Assyrians to destroy Iraq's internal <b>cohesion</b> by becoming independent and by inciting others such as the Kurds to follow their example.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{was pushing}} OPEC to end {{overproduction}} and to send oil prices higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the <b>cohesion</b> of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E
5|$|Secrets of Rætikon is an action-adventure, open world {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Broken Rules. The player controls a bird and must explore the environment of Rætikon to find its secrets. Game elements include animals with specific behaviors and ancient puzzles. Development began in 2011 and the game was formally announced in July 2013 and followed by alpha and Steam Early Access releases. Rætikon was released on April 17, 2014 for Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms. It received mixed reviews from reviewers, who praised its artwork and movement physics, but criticized its inconsistency, lack of <b>cohesion,</b> and technical issues.|$|E
5|$|The Lombard {{migration}} {{started on}} Easter Monday, April 2, 568. The decision {{to combine the}} departure with a Christian celebration can be understood {{in the context of}} Alboin's recent conversion to Arian Christianity, as attested by the presence of Arian Gothic missionaries at his court. The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migration's <b>cohesion,</b> distinguishing them from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his people to the Gothic heritage, and in this way obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as foederati. It has been speculated that Alboin's migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving Ostrogoths in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean Parliament is unicameral in nature, {{consisting}} of a single legislative body tasked with making laws. However, {{the notion of a}} second legislative chamber was considered on two separate occasions. In 1954, a constitutional commission headed by Sir George William Rendel rejected a proposal for a second chamber composed solely of minority representatives, citing its unsuitability in a tiny state like Singapore and arguing that it might end up being unnecessarily bureaucratic. It also asserted that such an upper House might potentially be detrimental to social <b>cohesion.</b> This issue was also considered by the Wee Chong Jin Commission, which rejected it on similar grounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found <b>cohesion</b> of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The mix of {{engraving}} styles was criticised; {{line engraving}} {{was considered the}} superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, {{at a lower price}} to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred that the quality of the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic <b>cohesion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleolus}} is {{a discrete}} densely stained structure {{found in the}} nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural <b>cohesion</b> of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{riddle of}} water and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of <b>cohesion,</b> transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations of {{cockatoos}} are {{loud and}} harsh. They serve {{a number of}} functions, including allowing individuals to recognize one another, alerting others of predators, indicating individual moods, maintaining the <b>cohesion</b> of a flock and as warnings when defending nests. The use of calls and number of specific calls varies by species; the Carnaby's black cockatoo has as many as 15 different calls, whereas others, such as Major Mitchell's cockatoo, have fewer. Some, like the gang-gang cockatoo, are comparatively quiet but do have softer growling calls when feeding. In addition to vocalisations, palm cockatoos communicate over large distances by drumming on a dead branch with a stick. Cockatoo species also make a characteristic hissing sound when threatened.|$|E
25|$|In {{military}} studies it {{has been}} found that resilience is also dependent on group support: unit <b>cohesion</b> and morale is the best predictor of combat resiliency within a unit or organization. Resilience is highly correlated to peer support and group <b>cohesion.</b> Units with high <b>cohesion</b> tend to experience a lower rate of psychological breakdowns than units with low <b>cohesion</b> and morale. High <b>cohesion</b> and morale enhance adaptive stress reactions.|$|E
25|$|According to American Psychological Association {{empirical}} evidence fails {{to show that}} sexual orientation is germane to any aspect of military effectiveness including unit <b>cohesion,</b> morale, recruitment and retention. Sexual orientation is irrelevant to task <b>cohesion,</b> the only type of <b>cohesion</b> that critically predicts the team's military readiness and success.|$|E
25|$|Capillary forces {{determine}} the movements (or absence of movement) of free water. It {{is due to}} both adhesion and <b>cohesion.</b> Adhesion is the attraction between water to other substances and <b>cohesion</b> is the attraction of the molecules in water to each other.|$|E
