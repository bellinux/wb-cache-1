40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory {{has been}} shut down since 1969, when the fuel salt was drained from the core into two Hastelloy N drain tanks at the reactor site. Over time, {{fluorine}} (F{sub 2 }) and uranium hexafluoride (UF{sub 6 }) moved from the salt through the gas piping to a <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed,</b> where they reacted with the activated charcoal. Some of the immediate concerns related to the migration of F{sub 2 } and UF{sub 6 } to the <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> were the possibility of explosive reactions between the charcoal and F{sub 2 }, the existence of conditions that could induce a criticality accident, and the removal and recovery of the fissile uranium from the charcoal.

40|$|The {{remediation}} of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) site {{includes the}} removal of about 37 kg of uranium. Of that inventory, about 23 kg have already {{been removed from the}} piping system and chemisorbed in 25 NaF traps. This material is being stored in Building 3019. The planned recovery of - 11 kg of uranium from the fuel salt will generate another 15 to 19 NaF traps. The remaining 2 to 3 kg of uranium are present in activated <b>charcoal</b> <b>beds,</b> which are also scheduled to be removed from the reactor site. Since all of these materials (NaF traps and the uranium-laden charcoal) are not suitable for long-term storage, they will be converted to a chemical form [uranium oxide], which is suitable for long-term storage. This document describes the process that will be used to recover and convert the uranium in the NaF traps into a stable oxide for long-term storage.

40|$|The {{retention}} of methyl iodide in <b>charcoal</b> <b>beds</b> {{was found to}} vary with {{the distance from the}} leading edges of the beds. Near the leading edges, retention was less than in the deeper regions, probably due to the chemi-sorption of competing vapours in the airstream drawn through the beds. One of the poisoning agents was identified as di-methyl sulphate vapour. The penetration of methyl iodide fell exponentially with distance in the deeper regions of the beds. The slope of the penetration curves in these deeper regions was dependent on the relative humidity and the face velocity in a more complex manner than the simple relationship assumed in the 'Stay Time" concept. An empirical formula, which gave the slope of the penetration curve within a standard deviation of 7 per cent, was derived to correlate the parameters over the range of practical interest, i. e. 30 - 99 per cent relative humidity and from 1. 1 m s- 1 down to at least 0. 16 m s- 1, and probably much lower. The uncertainty in the results could have been caused by variations within the batches of charcoal. A formula was derived to translate the results of an in situ test at a measured flowrate and humidity into an expected performance at high humidity and any other flowrate. The expression is independent of the slope of the penetration curve and the thicknesses of both the poisoned and unpoisoned regions of the bed, which suggests that it may be valid even for heavily poisoned beds...|$|R
40|$|Water {{scarcity}} of drinking and agriculture {{is one of}} the immerging issues today. Few interrelated salinity reduction methods were experimented, namely; <b>charcoal</b> filter <b>bed,</b> <b>charcoal</b> and compost leaching columns with clay and waste polythene liner and uptake by Typha angustifolio plant biofilter. Parameters such as EC, salt%, pH, TDS, DO and organic content of brackish water were 6. 31 mS/cm, 3. 2 %, 3370 mg/l, 6. 4, 7. 9 mg/l and 0. 147 %, respectively. It is certain that charcoal on its own will not act as a biofilter to desalination. As alternative, mature compost can be used, since it contains substrate for the microbial population, removes around 3 / 4 of the salinity with liner system. Typha did survive at moderate salt concentrations and it did remove 1 / 3 of the salt. In fact, the field scale biofilter system removed around 2 / 3 of the salt. This study narrows down to combine; mature compost, Typha and the liner system to remove 100 % of the salinity.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of radon ((222) Rn) activity flux using activated charcoal canisters was examined {{to investigate the}} distribution of the adsorbed (222) Rn in the <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> and the relationship between (222) Rn activity flux and exposure time. The activity flux of (222) Rn from five sources of varying strengths was measured for exposure times of one, two, three, five, seven, 10, and 14 days. The distribution of the adsorbed (222) Rn in the <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> was obtained by dividing the bed into six layers and counting each layer separately after the exposure. (222) Rn activity decreased in the layers that were away from the exposed surface. Nevertheless, the results demonstrated that only a small correction might be required in the actual application of charcoal canisters for activity flux measurement, where calibration standards were often prepared by the uniform mixing of radium ((226) Ra) in the matrix. This was because the diffusion of (222) Rn in the <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> and the detection efficiency {{as a function of the}} charcoal depth tended to counterbalance each other. The influence of exposure time on the measured (222) Rn activity flux was observed in two situations of the canister exposure layout: (a) canister sealed to an open bed of the material and (b) canister sealed over a jar containing the material. The measured (222) Rn activity flux decreased as the exposure time increased. The change in the former situation was significant with an exponential decrease as the exposure time increased. In the latter case, lesser reduction was noticed in the observed activity flux with respect to exposure time. This reduction might have been related to certain factors, such as absorption site saturation or the back diffusion of (222) Rn gas occurring at the canister-soil interface...|$|E
40|$|Exposure due to thoron (Rn- 220) gas and its decay {{products}} in a thorium fuel cycle facility handling thorium or U- 232 /U- 233 mixture compounds {{is an important}} issue of radiological concern requiring control and mitigation. Adsorption in a flow-through <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> offers an excellent method of alleviating the release of (220 R) n into occupational and public domain. In this paper, we present the design, development, and characterization of a Thoron Mitigation System (TMS) for industrial application. Systematic experiments were conducted in the TMS for examining the Rn- 220 mitigation characteristics with respect to a host of parameters such as flow rate, pressure drop, charcoal grain size, charcoal mass and bed depth, water content, and heat of the carrier gas. An analysis of the experimental data shows that Rn- 220 attenuation in a flow through <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> is not exponential with respect to the residence time, L/U-a(L: bed depth; U-a: superficial velocity), but follows a power law behaviour, which {{can be attributed to the}} occurrence of large voids due to wall channeling in a flow through bed. The study demonstrates the regeneration of charcoal adsorption capacity degraded due to moisture adsorption, by hot air blowing technique. It is found that the mitigation factor (MF), which is the ratio of the inlet Rn- 220 concentration (C-in) to the outlet Rn- 220 concentration (C-out), of more than 10 (4) for the TMS is easily achievable during continuous operation (> 1000 h) at a flow rate of 40 Lmin(- 1) with negligible (< 1 cm of water column) pressure drop. The Thoron Mitigation System based on adsorption on <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> offers a compact and effective device to remove Rn- 220 from affluent air streams in a space constrained domain. The prototype system has been installed in a thorium fuel cycle facility where it is being evaluated for its long-term performance and overall effectiveness in mitigating Rn- 220 levels in the workplace.

40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Facility (MSRE) {{operated}} from 1965 to 1969. The fuel was a {{molten salt}} that flowed through the reactor core {{which consisted of}} uranium tetrafluoride with molten lithium and beryllium salt used as the coolant. In 1968 the fuel was switched from {sup 235 }U to {sup 233 }U. The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment was canceled in 1969 at which time approximately 4800 kg of salt {{was transferred to the}} fuel drain tanks. There was about 36. 3 kg of uranium, 675 grams of plutonium and various fission products present in the fuel salt. The salt was allowed to solidify in the fuel drain tanks. The salt was heated on a yearly basis to recombine the fluorine gas with the uranium salt mixture. In March 1994, a gas sample was taken from the off gas system that indicated {sup 233 }U had migrated from the fuel drain tank system to the off gas system. It was found that approximately 2. 6 kg of uranium had migrated to the Auxiliary <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Bed</b> (ACB). The ACB is located in the concrete-lined <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> cell which is below ground level located outside the MSRE building.

Conservation of helium is important not only for saving on cost, but also for ensuring supply {{at the time of}} need. During laboratory experiment, helium gas is often contaminated with air impurities (nitrogen, oxygen, argon, moisture etc.) which must be removed before the spent gas is reused for liquefaction. Therefore, a helium purifier {{is an integral part of}} any cryogenic establishment to conserve helium gas by providing grade 4. 5 helium or 99. 995 % pure helium to liquefier after separating air contaminants from impure helium. 					The helium purification is based on two principles, one is cryocondensation of moisture and air impurities, on heat exchangers at appropriate temperature and other one is cryosorption on activated charcoal to yield grade 4. 5 helium from 60 % pure helium at LN¬ 2 temperature and at high pressure of about 150 bar. The purifier has been designed for purifying impure helium upto 40 % of impurity by running 6 hours non-stop operation with the mass flow rate of 20 nm 3 /hr and delivery of impure helium to purifier at a pressure of 150 bar(a),which is ensured by a 3 -stage reciprocating compressor. In the helium purifier for cryocondensation and cryosorption process the components are moisture collector vessel, three heat exchangers, liquid air separator vessel and adsorber columns. Other major components are gas bag, compressor, LN 2 vessel and cylinder manifold. Where, all cryogenic components are housed in Superinsulated LN 2 vessel.

The current CO 2 removal system on the International Space Station employs two pellet bed canisters of 5 A molecular sieve that alternate between regeneration and sorption. A separate disposable <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> removes trace contaminants. An alternative technology has been demonstrated using a sorption bed consisting of metal meshes coated with a sorbent, trademarked and patented [1] as Microlith ® by Precision Combustion, Inc.

This allows the bed to be regenerable via resistive heating and offers the potential for shorter regeneration times, reduced power requirement, and net energy savings vs. conventional systems. The capability of removing both CO 2 and trace contaminants within the same bed has also been demonstrated. Thus, the need for a separate trace contaminant unit is eliminated resulting in an opportunity for significant weight savings.

The goal was to increase current understanding of fission product transport in helium-cooled GFRs using vented fuel {{and to provide a}} toolset for determining issues which may arise during normal and abnormal operating conditions. A review of the Peach Bottom Unit 1 reactor, the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor, the Gen IV Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor, and the Energy Multiplier Module—all helium-cooled nuclear systems utilizing vented fuel—provided sufficient background for understanding the design methodology behind vented system and helium purification system design. From documentation for these systems and other literature, the phenomena of fission product generation and decay, volatile fission product chemistry, fission product diffusion and release in fuel, fission product leakage through non-fuel components, fission product plateout, and collection of gaseous fission products through adsorption in the <b>charcoal</b> <b>beds</b> were identified as having a significant effect on the transport of fission products within a vented fuel system. Understanding of vented fuel system design and identified fission product transport phenomena was then used {{for the development of a}} vented fuel system model in the systems modeling program, STELLA. The model was used to analyze test cases, characterizing the time-dependent accumulation and decay of fission products in a vented fuel system. These results, used in conjunction with the review of past systems, were used to compile conclusions and recommendations for the design of vented fuel systems and helium purification systems, aiding direction of future research and design efforts. Briefly, the work found that the mass, activity, and power generation of accumulated fission products is likely to be very large, requiring significant consideration within the overall plant design. Additionally, the reduction of the source of vented fission products being purged from the primary vessel, either by fuel or core design, may present significant advantages in plant design. It was also found that safety systems will be necessary to prevent overheat and possible release from the helium purification system in the case of an accident scenario. Lastly, it was found that the determination of the purge stream leakage rate into the primary coolant and the fuel release rate are of crucial importance for the safety and economy of a vented fuel system.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{decipher}} the PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) impact on the “Sparnacian” diversified and interconnected paleoenvironments of the Paris Basin, and to ensure correlation of the events and processes identified, a high resolution temporal framework is essential. Historically, the Paris and adjacent basins are the cradle of stratigraphy, where the notion of "Sparnacian" took shape (Dollfus 1880), pointing terrestrial to lagoonal deposits with particular facies and faunas, interstratified between two easily distinguishable Thanetian and Ypresian sandy marine formations. Since that time stratigraphy has evolved, and we refer now to the lithostratigraphy of Aubry et al. (2005). A 31. 5 m deep drilling has been augered at Sinceny, a key locality for the “Sparnacian” of the Paris Basin. Various analyses have been performed on the samples collected: granulometry, XRD mineralogy, carbonate and organic carbon contents, biostratigraphy, palynofacies, rock-eval pyrolysis and chemostratigraphy (δ 13 C of the dispersed organic matter). Seven lithological units are defined among which five {{may be attributed to}} the “Sparnacian” intercalated between fine glauconiferous sands of Late Thanetian and Early Ypresian, with in ascending order: 1) a carbonated silty medium-sized sand, 2) a sandy marl with carbonated concretions and limestone beds, 3) a plastic clay, oxidized at the bottom, but with increasing pyrite upwards, 4) lignite and clay beds, all pyritic but more shelly upwards, 5) a shelly crag with small flint pebbles (“Falun et Sable à Galets Avellanaires de Sinceny”: FSGA). The CIE (Carbon Isotopic Excursion), proxy of the PETM, extents over nearly 20 m of the section. In this interval, isotopic values fluctuate around – 26 to – 28 ‰. They are more negative in the lower part and show short term fluctuations in the upper part, which may reflect changes in depositional environment. The Apectodinium acme, another proxy of the PETM, is recorded in the lagoonal facies. Clay minerals do not show any kaolinite influx in relation with the CIE, and interstratified kaolinite/smectite is characteristic of the third unit. The palynofacies and pollen and spore assemblages are fairly similar to those from other “Sparnacian” NW European units, with some <b>charcoal</b> <b>beds</b> and Plicapollis pseudoexcelsus, Juglandaceae and other taxa acmes. The FSGA is chemostratigraphically (averaging - 24 ‰) and biostratigraphically different (Apectodinium less abundant, other taxa present or abundant). Correlation with published sections in the Paris Basin is possible using litho- and bio-stratigraphy, but not chemostratigraphy (Thiry et al, 2006). Indeed such a long, regular and unequivocal CIE had never been recorded in the Paris Basin, neither in Limay, nor in the Mont Bernon and Provins reference sections, all situated on the Paris Basin edges where the deposits are more prone to sedimentary hiatuses. The FSGA unit postdates the PETM episode and evidences the Ypresian s. s. transgression in the “Sparnacian” lagoonal setting. Correlation with the P/E successions of the Belgian, London and Dieppe-Hampshire Basins is also possible, although further high resolution data are necessary in the Paris Basin...|$|R

40|$|Allocasuarina littoralis and A. torulosa {{occur in}} the {{woodlands}} of North Queensland in areas receiving between 1, 000 and 2, 000 mm annual rainfall. This thesis examines factors influencing their distibutional patterns, and discusses the implications of their comparative ecology for life history modelling, tropical revegetation programs and reconstruction of North Queensland’s environmental history. The life-cycle is divided into several stages: seed dispersal and losses, germination and early seedling recruitment, the first year juvenile stage, and established juvenile stage to reproduction. Factors limiting survival in each stage of the life-cycle and progression to subsequent stages are identified. Seed-fall, post-dispersal seed losses, seedling germination and recruitment, growth rate and mortality of juvenile and adult plants, and reproductive output were measured in contiguous stands in Kirrama State Forest. Seed germination, population structure and recovery from fire were measured for other North Queensland sites. The effects of fire, light and moisture conditions on germination and seedling survivorship, growth and competition were examined in the laboratory. A. littoralis {{is found to be}} adapted to low or intermittent moisture availability and high light levels. This is contributed to by erect cladodes, high root: shoot ratio, maintenance of a high transpiration rate relative to A. torulosa at all soil moisture levels, maintenance of seed variability through wetting and drying cycles and protracted germination. Life history characteristics appear to be influenced by the environments suitable to growth. A. littoralis, typically found in more open vegetation than A. torulosa, has an earlier onset of reproductive maturity and greater reproductive effort, and consequently a shorter life span; in A. torulosa, reproduction does not generally occur until individuals reach sub-canopy height. Recruitment in A. torulosa is aided by larger seeds and lignotuber reserves. A. littoralis produces more seed per individual, but, with greater seed fall and smaller seeds, experiences a greater level of seed loss due to predation that does A. torulosa. This ultimately results in A. littoralis having lower seed viability and a smaller soil stored seed bank. While lignotuber reserves may result in a greater ability of established A torulosa than A. littoralis plants to recover after fire, before these reserves are developed. A. littoralis shows the greater recovery rates, possibly aided by a higher root: shoot ratio. A. littoralis seeds appear to be more sensitive to heating by fire than those of A. torulosa, and germination in the former species is delayed by ash, but in neither species is affected by charcoal. Post-dispersal seed losses of both species are substantially lower from <b>charcoal</b> and ash <b>beds,</b> than from bare ground. The observed effects of ash and charcoal on seed harvesting are likely to operate with other species and therefore have important implications for forestry. Assessment of published models of life history characteristics are found to be inadequate to explain the data collected in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{density range}} {{in which the}} {{critical}} phenomena of methyl fluoride occurs was determined. Phosphorus trifluoride was prepared and its solubility in various solvents determined. Methods of preparing arsine and calcium arsenide were investigated. An apparatus was constructed for the determination of service times of respiratory charcoals and to study sorption of gases by charcoal in a dynamic system. Service times for respiratory charcoals were determined for arsine, phosgene, phosphorus trifluoride and cyanogen fluoride {{over a wide range}} of experimental conditions. The boiling point-service time relationship for the primary amines was investigated. The distribution of sorbed ammonia and sulphur dioxide in a <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> was studied at varying conditions of concentration and rate of flow...|$|E
40|$|Regulating the {{environmental}} discharge of Rn- 220 (historically known as thoron) and its decay products from thorium processing facilities {{is important for}} protection of environment and general public living in the vicinities. Activated charcoal provides an effective {{solution to this problem}} because of its high adsorption capacity to gaseous element like radon. In order to design and develop a charcoal based Thoron Mitigation System, a mathematical model has been developed in the present work for studying the Rn- 220 transport and adsorption in a flow through <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> and estimating the Rn- 220 mitigation factor (MF) as a function of system and operating parameters. The model accounts for inter- and intragrain diffusion, advection, radioactive decay and adsorption processes. Also, the effects of large void fluctuation and wall channeling on the mitigation factor have been included through a statistical model. Closed form solution has been provided for the MF in terms of adsorption coefficient, system dimensions, grain size, flow rate and void fluctuation exponent. It is shown that the delay effects due to intra grain diffusion plays a significant role thereby rendering external equilibrium assumptions unsuitable. Also, the application of the statistical model clearly demonstrates the transition from the exponential MF to a power-law form and shows how the occurrence of channels with low probability can lower mitigation factor by several orders of magnitude. As a part of aiding design, the model is further extended to optimise the bed dimensions in respect of pressure drop and MF. The application of the results for the design and development of a practically useful <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> is discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergency}} {{exhaust system}} of the Pakistan Research Reactor- 1 (PARR- 1) in corporates <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> filters {{for the removal of}} radioiodine from exhaust gases {{in case of an emergency}} involving the release of radioiodine. The filters adsorb radioiodine. Testing of the filters is necessary so as to assess their iodine retention efficiency, if they are to meet regulatory requirements. The retention efficiency of our filters has been measured and found to be 99. 1 %. This value is higher than the value of the activated charcoal filter efficiency (99 %) employed to determine the source term for release through emergency exhaust with filtration, for dose calculations. In this paper, the procedure for testing the efficiency of charcoal filters has been discussed and results obtained presented...|$|E
40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was {{operated}} from June 1965 to December 1969. The {{objective of}} the experiment {{was to investigate the}} practicality of developing a power reactor consisting of a graphite lattice with circulating molten uranium salt as fuel for application in central power stations. When the experiment was terminated in 1969, approximately 4710 kg of salt containing approximately 36. 3 kg of uranium, 675 g of plutonium, and various fission products were transferred to two fuel drain tanks (FDTs). The almost 30. 5 kg of Uranium 233 in the salt is the primary fissile constituent, but about 0. 93 kg of Uranium 235 is also present. In April 1994, a gas sample from the MSRE off-gas system (OGS) indicated that uranium had migrated from the FDTs into the OGS. Further investigation revealed a likely accumulation of approximately 2. 6 kg of uranium in the auxiliary <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> (ACB), which is located in the concrete-lined <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> cell (CBC) below ground level outside the MSRE building. The nuclear criticality safety (NCS) situation was further complicated by the CBC being filled with water up to the overflow pipe, which completely submerged the ACB. Thus there was not only an increased risk of criticality because of water reflection in the ACB, but also because of potential moderation in the ACB in case of water inleakage. Leakage into the ACB would result in a direct path for water between the CBC and the OGS or FDTs, thus increasing the risk of criticality in these areas. When uranium was discovered in the ACB, a number of steps, detailed in this report, were immediately taken to try to understand and ameliorate the situation. After all the actions were completed, a validation of the results obtained for the ACB was performed...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{decommissioning}} process for the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, several thermal-sciences issues were addressed. Apparently a mixture of UF{sub 6 } and F{sub 2 } had diffused into the upper portion of one charcoal column in the MSRE auxiliary <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed</b> (ACB), leading to radiative decay heating and possible chemical reaction sources. A proposed interim corrective action was planned to remove {{the water from the}} ACB cell to reduce criticality and reactivity concerns and then fill the ACB cell with an inert material. This report describes design of a thermocouple probe to obtain temperature measurements for mapping the uranium deposit, as well as development of steady-state and transient numerical models for the heat transfer inside the charcoal column. Additional numerical modeling was done to support filling of the ACB cell. Results from this work were used to develop procedures for meeting the goals of the MSRE Remediation Project without exceeding appropriate thermal limits...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{utilization of}} biomass in fluidized bed reactors depends on numerous operation conditions and parameters {{which can be}} investigated systematically with computational models. Based on a previous study [1] we compare a base scenario which mimics the experimental situation with different parameter settings for an Euler-Lagrangian simulation of wood gasification in a fluidized <b>charcoal</b> <b>bed.</b> For the varied parameters superficial velocity, reactor wall temperature, air inlet temperature, wood particle size, and the wood inlet temperature we analyse the simulation results based on data for temporal evolution of reactor outlet temperature, averaged particle temperature, overall wood mass, overall charcoal mass, concentrations of several gaseous species (N 2, CO, CO 2, H 2, H 2 O, CH 4, C 2 H 2, and three virtual tar components) and axial barycenter data of particles bed mass. Furthermore we show time averaged data for gaseous species and gas phase temperature at the reactor outlet. At the end we critically examine our findings under consideration of the models opportunities and limitations...|$|E
