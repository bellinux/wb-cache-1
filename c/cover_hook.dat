5000|$|Long <b>Cover</b> <b>Hook</b> - A long <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> is a {{condition}} where the <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> length approaches or exceeds the recommended guidelines.|$|E
5000|$|Short <b>Cover</b> <b>Hook</b> - A short <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> is a {{condition}} where the <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> {{does not meet the}} minimum recommended specification.|$|E
5000|$|Pleats, Puckers and Spurs - A pleat is a {{fold in the}} <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> {{that extends}} from the cut edge {{downward}} toward the <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> radius and sometimes below this radius in a sharp vee or spur shape. A pucker is a condition which is intermediate between a reverse wrinkle and a pleat, where the <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> at the cut edge is locally distorted downward without actually folding. A spur is a localized irregularity characterized by a sharp protrusion {{at the bottom of}} the double seam. It is usually accompanied by a pleat or vee in the <b>cover</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The IIHF <b>covers</b> <b>hooking</b> in Rule 533, {{defining}} a player guilty of hooking as one [...] "who impedes or seeks to impede {{the progress of}} an opponent by hooking him with the stick." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, the Canadian rapper Drake, {{released}} a song named [...] "Girls Love Beyonce" [...] which James Fauntleroy <b>covers</b> the <b>hook.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The NHL <b>covers</b> <b>hooking</b> in Rule 55, which defines it as [...] "the act {{of using}} the stick {{in a manner that}} enables a player or goalkeeper to {{restrain}} an opponent." [...] It goes on to specify that [...] "when a player is checking another {{in such a way that}} there is only stick-to-stick contact, such action is not to be penalized as hooking." [...] The NHL groups hooking with other [...] "Restraining fouls" [...] such as holding, interference and tripping.|$|R
5000|$|Tight First Operation Seam - Tight first {{operation}} seams {{can create}} flatness {{at the bottom}} of the first operation seam throughout its length. The <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> may also be turned into the body hook. Overly tight first operation seams tend to create more reverse wrinkles in the <b>cover</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Loose First Operation Seam - Loose first {{operation}} seams may {{not allow}} sufficient tuck {{up of the}} cover curl to form a sufficient amount of <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> and overlap in the finished seam.|$|E
5000|$|False Seam - A [...] "false seam" [...] is a seam or {{portion of}} the seam which is {{completely}} unhooked, and in which the folded <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> is compressed against the folded body hook. A false seam is not always detectable in an external examination.|$|E

5000|$|Desmodium illinoense is a {{perennial}} herb sometimes reaching {{a height of}} 1.2 m (4 feet), much of the shoot <b>covered</b> with <b>hooked</b> hairs. Leaves are trifoliate, up to 6.3 cm (2.5 inches) long. Leaflets are rounded, with a blunt tip. Flowers are white to lavender with a few white spots near the center. Seed pods are of the variety called [...] "loments," [...] constricted between the seeds {{so that when the}} pod is ripe it can break easily into 1-seed segments. These are <b>covered</b> with <b>hooked</b> hairs so that they can easily become attached to fur or to clothing and be carried some distance before falling to the ground and germinating.|$|R
5000|$|Ghoti <b>Hook</b> <b>covered</b> {{the song}} on their 1999 album of covers, Songs We Didn't Write.|$|R
5000|$|Cover Vee - [...] "Vees" [...] or [...] "lips" [...] are {{projections}} of the double seam below {{the bottom of a}} normal seam that resemble a [...] "V" [...] shape. There is usually no overlap of the <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> with the body hook and these defects usually occur in small areas of the seam.|$|E
5000|$|X-ray systems. These systems utilize X-ray {{technology}} to either provide an {{image from the}} side of the seam (comparable to double seam projector images) or from the top. X-ray systems are also capable of measuring the <b>Cover</b> <b>Hook</b> Wrinkle without damaging the can - this can provide an objective result in contrast to the subjective operator's visual assessment.|$|E
5000|$|Seam bump - Seam bumps are a {{relatively}} short area of the double seam, where the seam thickness suddenly increases by 0.004" [...] (0.1 mm) or more. They are predominantly found on welded and two-piece cans with long body hooks and are usually seen on the can filler's end when hot filled products exceed 185 degrees (Fahrenheit). The <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> radius may be {{pulled away from the}} body wall.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} holds several spiny staminate (male) flower heads next {{to larger}} pistillate (female) heads. Each pistillate head produces usually two fruits, which are yellow-brown burrs nearly 2 centimeters wide. Each burr is rounded, sticky, and <b>covered</b> in <b>hooked</b> spines.|$|R

40|$|Evening {{dress of}} multi-layered yellow silk chiffon. The slim, {{full-length}} dress has a shallow, rounded neckline, and 3 / 4 length sleeves.

The innermost layer is of yellow silk from bust to hem, the middle layer of yellow chiffon, and the outer layer of yellow chiffon with hand painted stylized floral design of purple and teal roses with green sprays. The floral design is concentrated on center front of dress with one teal rose on upper right and single purple rose at bottom left of back. Designer's label at left by zipper: "Galanos" Retailer's label at right armhole: "Neiman-Marcus...|$|R
5000|$|Traditional teardown. Although pretty rare, in {{this case}} the {{external}} measurements are made (usually consisting of seam length, seam thickness and countersink). Internal parameters are evaluated by tearing down the seam, then measuring the <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> and body hook parameters mechanically. Then, various calculations are made to evaluate overlap. This procedure is generally considered bad form as it does not evaluate all the seam parameters on the same exact point, which can lead to missing serious defects (including false seams).|$|E
50|$|The {{seaming head}} then engages the second {{operation}} roller against the partly formed seam. The second operation presses all five steel components together tightly {{to form the}} final seal. The five layers in the final seam are then called; a) End, b) Body Hook, c) <b>Cover</b> <b>Hook,</b> d) Body, e) Countersink. All sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a hermetic seal. In most cases, a rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical seal between the end and the body.|$|E
50|$|The FDA {{continues}} by {{detailing the}} requirements of double seam destructive testing:"The double seam teardown examination is a destructive test. Tools {{that are used to}} perform this test include a seam micrometer, countersink gauge can opener and nippers. Optional equipment for seam teardown examinations include a seam saw, seam projector and seam scope. Although it is not imperative the investigator carry this equipment to each LACF inspection, {{it is very important that}} they know how to operate this equipment and read measurements from the micrometer, seam projector or seam scope. It is also important that the investigator know how to determine the tightness or wrinkle rating of the <b>cover</b> <b>hook.</b> Knowledge of the procedures used to perform double seam teardown examination are essential to evaluating the firm's knowledge and ability to do this examination. Attachment 14 explains the procedure for using a seam projector for examining a cross section of the seam. Attachment 15 explains the can seam micrometer and procedure for use, and Attachment 16 explains the use of a seamscope for the same exam.|$|E

50|$|This weedy forb is {{an annual}} {{broadleaf}} plant. It inhabits agricultural land, roadsides and other disturbed areas. It {{is found in}} lawns as well, where its burrs are able to cling to the clothing or fur of any species that pass near it, thus facilitating geographic spread via these seed capsules. It makes a poor lawn in the late summer, when the leaves have yellowed and fruit sets into the 7 mm seed heads that are <b>covered</b> with <b>hooked</b> prickles.|$|R
