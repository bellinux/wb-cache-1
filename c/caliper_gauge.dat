The length and diameter of the balloon were measured in one randomly selected catheter of each type using a Vernier <b>caliper</b> <b>gauge</b> (CD 67 -S, PM/PS, Mitutoyo Measuring Instruments (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The geometric volume of the balloon was calculated based on the length and diameter of the balloon and using the capsule body as an approximation. Because the feeding tube passes through the inner space of the balloon in the SmartCath-G catheter, this volume was deducted when calculating the balloon geometric volume {{for this type of}} catheter.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study aims to {{determine}} flow stress of a steel tube by using hydraulic bulge test. A new proposed analytical model for analyzing bulge shapes of hydroformed tubes is postulated. Bulge test apparatus designed using FEA simulation of hydroforming and STKM 11 A steel tubes {{are used in}} the hydraulic bulge test. Bulge heights and internal pressures are measured during bulge testing. Tube thicknesses at vertex of a bulge shape are measured by a dial <b>caliper</b> <b>gauge.</b> Bulge curvatures and contact points are measured by taking digital photos of bulge shapes combined with measurement methods in CAD software. Effective stress- strain relationships are obtained from the newly developed analytical model using those measured values. Flow stress curves obtained from the effective stress – strain relationships are compared with those by other researchers and tensile test. Finite element analysis methods are used to conduct simulation of tube hydroforming using the flow stress curves. Predicted internal pressures versus bulge heights and tube thicknesses are compared with experimental results. Verification of the developed analytical model is presented. The flow stress at neck point of formed tube is determined...|$|E

Above-ground biomass increments in this period varied between 30. 07 – 519. 28 g per tree and mean value of water use efficiency of all monitored trees reached 2. 76 g. kg– 1. Mean diurnal sap-flow total of all sampled trees was 3. 25 liters. Results show {{that it is possible}} to establish relationship between transpiration totals and biomass increments (coefficient of determination R 2 = 0. 90) and also relationship between transpiration totals and stem diameter (R 2 = 0. 81). These results (especially after obtaining experimental data from spring growth conditions) can be further used for calculations of biomass increments and transpiration as scaling factors from tree level to whole stand level...|$|E

The roots were cut horizontally at cement-enamel junction and 4 mm short of the apex. The minimum width of residual root was measured on mesial and distal wall by a vernier <b>caliper</b> <b>gauge.</b> Results The minimum width means of residual root among 3 groups were larger than 1 mm after root canal preparation.

This important issue is achieved through effective education in a safe and stress free environment. Proper design of classroom seats proportional to anthropometric characteristics of students not only can improve academic quality but also prevent musculoskeletal disorders. In addition it may encourage students to practice correct sitting habits. This study was conducted to check the correlation of physical dimensions of students and prevalence of musculoskeletal disorder with educational chair dimensions that provided by companies.   Methods   This descriptive - analytical study was performed on 115 students of 18 to 27 years. 15 anthropometric parameters correlated with sitting on the chair were measured by anthropometry page and anthropometric <b>caliper</b> <b>gauge.</b> Dimensions of two Types of seats provided in the classrooms were compared with the standard seat dimensions.   Results   comparison of dimensions confirmed that seat dimension and students dimensions correspond with one another only in elbow length parameter and other parameters were not correspondent with each other.

40|$|For the {{nondestructive}} evaluation of components with ultrasound a priori {{information about the}} specimen is necessary. So the time of flight to a defect is measured and, with known sound velocity, {{it is possible to}} determine the correct location of the defect. In general, the sound velocity is assumed as known. If it is not known, the sound velocity has to be determined additionally. This can be done, for example, by measuring the time of flight to the backwall with ultrasound and the thickness of the specimen with a <b>caliper</b> <b>gauge.</b> However, this is impossible to realize with single-sided access to the specimen. For determining the size of inclusions, several techniques like the half-value method or the DGS-method (Distance Gain Size) are established. These methods are based on the assumption of (circular) plane reflectors. Therefore, they cannot be applied on the size determination of inclusions with curved surfaces. This contribution presents new methods for the localization and characterization of inclusions in media with unknown acoustic properties by means of annular arrays. The usage of annular arrays allows the variation of the focus position. By evaluating the signal amplitude {{as a function of the}} focus position and the measured time of flight, sound velocity and distance to the reflector can be determined simultaneously [1]. For classifying the inclusions, the directional pattern of the reflected sound field is evaluated. The sound pressure distribution of the reflected sound field at the probe surface mainly depends on the shape of the reflector. Evaluating the amplitude difference between two annular elements allows to classify the reflector shape [2]. These methods are demonstrated on a test specimen with in epoxy resin embedded spheres and circular disc-shaped reflectors with diameters between one and seven wavelengths. The sound velocity of the epoxy resin can be determined with the simultaneous method reaching an accuracy higher than 97 %. The amplitude difference method allows to distinguish between spheres and circular disc-shaped reflectors. The same method also enables a non-scanning determination of the size of the circular disc-shaped reflectors, even for dimensions smaller than the width of the sound beam. For the size determination of the spheres, several methods are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Thickness of {{the bark}} has serious {{influence}} on the round wood volume inside bark, if the diameter is measured over bark. The measured value of the bark thickness depends on measuring method. To analyse the possible bark thickness differences of spruce, given by different measuring methods and Peintinger´s bark thickness tables and to calculate the corresponding round wood volume differences, given by different bark thickness deduction compared with the Czech Standard is the principle goal of presented research. Three ways of bark thickness measuring were realized: by using bark gauge, increment hammer and slide <b>caliper.</b> Bark <b>gauge</b> gives the highest bark thickness values – 2, 2 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 3, 4 %. Measuring by this method is very carefully to the bark and it gives the real values of {{the thickness of the}} undamaged bark layer. It is close to the results of electronic diameter measuring. Slide caliper give the values 0, 9 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 1, 5 %. Slide caliper partly damages the surface layer of the bark. Increment hammer gives 0, 1 mm higher values of the bark thickness compared with our standard thanks to the destruction of the surface bark layer. Corresponding volume decrease can be approx. 0, 1 %. Peintinger’s bark thickness tables give 1, 3 mm higher spruce bark thickness, it means to 1, 9 % lower round wood volume. It means, Peintingers tables correspond better with the measured values than with the Czech Standard. We can recommend the using of Peintinger’s table for deduction of spruce bark thickness in electronic measuring of the round wood over bark and to use the bark gauge for test measuring.
