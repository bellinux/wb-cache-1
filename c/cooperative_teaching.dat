In 2007 he received the William James Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Association for Psychological Science, in which he was cited as the scientist who [...] "fundamentally changed the way we look at everyday life.” [...] A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Aronson as the 78th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

40|$|In {{a number}} of works dealing with <b>cooperative</b> <b>teaching</b> affective domain {{variables}} were in focus, while the cognitive domain variables were studied less. In this paper, we try to look on <b>cooperative</b> <b>teaching</b> {{from the point of}} conformation of declarative and procedural knowledge. The influence of three modalities of cooperative work in teaching Nature and Society on comformability of students’ declarative and procedural knowledge are experimentally checked. Arranging the students within small homogeneous and heterogeneous groups was the basis for the formation of the applied modalities. The sample consisted of 259 fourth-grade students of elementary school. The experiment was done with parallel groups. The results showed that students in the experi­mental group had better conformation of declarative and procedural knowledge not only at the final, but also at the subsequent measurings, as compared to the control group. Heterogeneous or homogeneous grouping led to the same conformation of declarative and procedural knowledge. Quality knowledge can not be obtained by accumulation of either declarative or procedural one, but by balancing these two kinds of knowledge, by their conformation.
