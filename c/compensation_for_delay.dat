40|$|A {{classical}} control {{perspective is}} used to characterize performance constraints and evaluate compensation techniques for teleoperation with delay. Use of control concepts such as open and closed loop performance, stability, and bandwidth yield insight to the delay problem. Teleoperator performance constraints are viewed as an open loop time delay lag and as a delay-induced closed loop bandwidth constraint. These constraints are illustrated with a simple analytical tracking example which is corroborated by a real time, 'man-in-the-loop' tracking experiment. The experiment also provides insight to those controller characteristics which are unique to a human operator. Predictive displays and feedforward commands are shown to provide open loop <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> lag. Low pass filtering of telemetry or feedback signals is interpreted as closed loop compensation used to maintain a sufficiently low bandwidth for stability. A new closed loop compensation approach is proposed that uses a reactive (or force feedback) hand controller to restrict system bandwidth by impeding operator inputs...|$|E
30|$|However, {{the user}} has {{no control over}} {{the quality of the}} video because if at time t 1 the quality is HD (high definition), later, when more clients join the {{multicast}} group, the quality steps down to SD (standard definition) at time t 2. Moreover, while streaming a HD content, the cache memory gets refreshed at equal intervals to fill it with the forth coming streams. Hence, there is no assurance for the user to revisit the initial part of the displayed video at a later time without any buffering. This highly relies on the present bandwidth available at that particular time slot. This paper uses the traditional method of bit rate control, by dropping the frames by the boundary conditions as stated in our algorithm and in addition uses enhanced WZ (Wyner-Ziv) coding to reconstruct the dropped frames more precisely and also to provide a better <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> induced in reconstructing those frames.|$|E
40|$|In Europe, when an {{imbalance}} between demand and capacity is detected for air traffic network resources, Air Traffic Flow Management slots are allocated to flights {{on the basis}} of a First Planned First Served principle. In the case of a single constrained en-route sector or airport, we propose a mechanism for slot allocation which is based on market principles as it enables airlines to pay for delay reduction or receive <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> increase. The mechanism fulfills the properties of individual rationality, budget balance, coalitional rationality and Pareto efficiency, and it can be implemented through two alternative distributed approaches that do not require airlines to disclose confidential information. Both approaches have the additional advantage that they directly involve airlines in the decision making process. Two computational examples relying on real data indicate that the market-based solution allows the participating airlines to significantly decrease their overall delay-related costs with respect to the First Planned First Served allocation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aim Delay in the {{diagnosis}} of colorectal cancer (CRC) may have important clinical and medico-legal implications. This study identifies the claims {{made on the basis}} of delay in {{the diagnosis}} of CRC to the Swedish insurance agency (whose English name is The County Council´s Mutual Insurance Company) and the impact and consequences of the delay on prognosis, treatment and survival for patients who reported the claims. The Company handles claims of medical malpractice where claimants seek compensation for alleged suffering and/or negative clinical impacts of diagnostic delays. Material and methods Between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2008, a total of 80 patients filed claims for negative effects resulting from delays {{in the diagnosis}} of CRC. Review of the claims led to identification of delay for 62 patients. The clinical symptoms that were overlooked and other causes of delay that had any relation to therapy, prognosis and economic compensation were evaluated. Results The median delay in the diagnosis of CRC was six months. This delay was considered to have had an impact on the therapy in 20 [*]% of the cases. The prognosis was postulated to have been adversely affected for 15 [*]% of the patients. The delay was mainly caused by incomplete consideration of the symptoms hematoschisis or anaemia, changed bowel routine, or incomplete clinical or radiological examination and by misinterpretations of the results. No impact of duration of delay on survival was identified. The importance of identifying concomitant metastatic disease at diagnosis was overwhelming. Economic compensation was given in 79 [*]% of the cases. Conclusion This study found that claims for <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> in diagnosis of CRC are rare. The delay in the diagnosis of the primary tumour was considered to have had an impact on the magnitude of therapeutic measures for a fifth of the patients who filed claims. Economic compensation for the patients´ injuries was given in almost 80 [*]% of the cases. </p...|$|E

Future 400 G systems employing {{higher order modulation}} formats and Nyquist filtering are especially sensitive to this. A blind adaptive equalizer is proposed to track and compensate the skew while also performing matched filtering. Performance is investigated in simulation for 56 GBd polarization division multi-plexed 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation (PDM- 16 QAM) and experimentally for 6 GBd PDM {{quadrature phase shift keying}} (PDM-QPSK) and PDM- 16 QAM, where <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>delays</b> up to half a symbol period are demonstrated without penalty.
