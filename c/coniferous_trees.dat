5|$|Other {{members of}} the genus Pholiota may be mistaken for Pholiota flammans, {{especially}} Pholiota squarrosa which commonly forms large tufts {{at the base of}} deciduous as well as <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees.</b> P.squarrosa tends to be a less intense yellow color than P.flammans. P.adiposa is also similar, but prefers to grow on dead hardwoods; unlike P.flammans, it has gelatinous scales on the stem as well as the cap.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation in the {{watershed}} is {{closely tied to}} elevation and precipitation levels. About 30 percent of the basin, mostly at higher elevation levels, is populated with oak, aspen and <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees.</b> At the lower levels, 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain-brush, sagebrush, juniper and grasses. About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified as urban.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria, {{commonly}} known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E

5|$|Being saprobic, P. flammans {{is found}} {{exclusively}} on dead and decaying stumps and trunks of <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees,</b> with fruit bodies appearing in tufts or singly, from summer to autumn. It is a fungus {{with a wide}} geographical distribution in boreal and temperate regions, and may be considered common to rare depending upon the region in which it occurs. It is found throughout Europe (from the British Isles to Russia) and North America (southern Canada and the United States). The species has also been collected in Asia, including India and China.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckii is an {{inedible}} (though not toxic) fungus, and {{a member}} of the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that hang from the undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species, and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees,</b> growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota flammans, {{commonly}} known as the yellow pholiota, the flaming Pholiota, or the flame scalecap, is a basidiomycete agaric mushroom of the genus Pholiota. Its fruit body is golden-yellow in color throughout, while its cap and stem are covered in sharp scales. As it is a saprobic fungus, the fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on the stumps of dead <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees.</b> P.flammans is distributed throughout Europe, North America, and Asia in boreal and temperate regions. Its edibility has not been clarified.|$|E

5|$|There are densely forested regions around Gangtok, {{consisting}} of temperate, deciduous forests of poplar, birch, oak, and elm, {{as well as}} evergreen, <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees</b> of the wet alpine zone. Orchids are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. Bamboos are also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and subtropical. Flowers such as sunflower, marigold, poinsettia, and others bloom, especially in November and December.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees</b> and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees,</b> such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E

5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees.</b> Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.|$|E
5|$|Mycena polygramma, {{commonly}} known as the grooved bonnet, is a species of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family. The inedible fruit bodies are small, pale gray-brown mushrooms with broadly conical caps, pinkish gills. They are found in small troops on stumps and branches of deciduous and occasionally <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees.</b> The mushroom is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it is typically found on twigs or buried wood, carrying out its role in the forest ecosystem by decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and forming humus in the soil. M.polygramma contains two uncommon hydroxy fatty acids and is also a bioluminescent fungus whose intensity of light emission follows a diurnal pattern.|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees,</b> notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E

5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees.</b> Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E
5|$|Sauropelta {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} known nodosaurids. All specimens of S. edwardsorum were recovered from the Little Sheep Mudstone section of the Cloverly Formation in Wyoming and Montana, which has been dated to 108.5 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous. Sauropelta lived in wide floodplains around rivers that drained into the shallow inland sea to the north and east, carrying sediment eroded from the low mountains to the west. Periodic flooding of these rivers covered the surrounding plains with new muddy sediments, creating the Cloverly Formation and burying the remains of many animals, some of which would be fossilized. At the end of Cloverly times, the shallow sea would expand to cover the entire region and would eventually split North America completely in half, forming the Western Interior Seaway. Abundant fossil remains of <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees</b> suggest that these plains were covered in forests. Grasses would not evolve until later in the Cretaceous, so Sauropelta and other Early Cretaceous dinosaurian herbivores browsed from a variety of conifers and cycads. Nodosaurids like Sauropelta had narrow snouts, an adaptation seen today in animals that are selective browsers as opposed to the wide muzzles of grazers.|$|E
25|$|Xeris {{spectrum}} {{are found}} in open pine forests. Males often begin to fly {{a few days earlier}} than females.
