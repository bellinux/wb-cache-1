40|$|Medicinal chemists' "intuition" is {{critical}} for success in modern drug discovery. Early in the discovery process, <b>chemists</b> select a subset of compounds for further research, often from many viable candidates. These decisions determine {{the success of a}} discovery campaign, and ultimately what kind of drugs are developed and marketed to the public. Surprisingly {{little is known about the}} cognitive aspects of chemists' decision-making when they prioritize compounds. We investigate 1) how and to what extent <b>chemists</b> simplify the problem of identifying promising compounds, 2) whether <b>chemists</b> agree with each other about the criteria used for such decisions, and 3) how accurately <b>chemists</b> report the criteria they use for these decisions. <b>Chemists</b> were surveyed and asked to select chemical fragments that they would be willing to develop into a lead compound from a set of ~ 4, 000 available fragments. Based on each <b>chemist's</b> selections, computational classifiers were built to model each <b>chemist's</b> selection strategy. Results suggest that <b>chemists</b> greatly simplified the problem, typically using only 1 - 2 of many possible parameters when making their selections. Although <b>chemists</b> tended to use the same parameters to select compounds, differing value preferences for these parameters led to an overall lack of consensus in compound selections. Moreover, what little agreement there was among the <b>chemists</b> was largely in what fragments were undesirable. Furthermore, <b>chemists</b> were often unaware of the parameters (such as compound size) which were statistically significant in their selections, and overestimated the number of parameters they employed. A critical evaluation of the problem space faced by medicinal <b>chemists</b> and cognitive models of categorization were especially useful in understanding the low consensus between <b>chemists...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1907, the French <b>chemist</b> Georges Urbain {{separated}} Marignac's ytterbia {{into two}} components: neoytterbia and lutecia.

Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party. The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact that}} the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain. After Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium.|$|E
