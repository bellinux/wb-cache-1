40|$|A weak {{spring is}} {{connected}} {{at one end}} to a rotor turning at constant angular velocity. The spring extends to a stretched length {{as determined by the}} spring mass, rest length, spring constant, rotor radius and rotor angular velocity. When released from the rotor, the inner end of the spring pulls away as expected, causing a wave to travel down the <b>spring</b> as it <b>collapses.</b> During this time interval, the outer end of the spring continues to move along its original circular path in uniform circular motion, as if the spring were still connected to the rotor. This is analogous to the effect of a hanging Slinky released from rest whose bottom end remains at a fixed position above the ground until a wave {{from the top of the}} Slinky reaches the bottom of the Slinky. Values from a numerical model and measurements from video analysis show that upon release the inner end travels along a circle of similar radius as the outer end. The effect appears as a series of alternating semi-circles.

40|$|In {{the southeastern}} United States, peach tree short life (PTSL) {{refers to the}} sudden <b>spring</b> <b>collapse</b> and death of young peach trees. Generally, trees 3 to 7 years old are affected. PTSL is not caused by a single {{specific}} factor, but rather by a complex of cold damage and bacterial canker, caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which act together in some years and independently in other years. In any case, the final result is the same (i. e., tree death). Many other factors contribute to the PTSL complex, including time of pruning, rootstocks, orchard floor management, fertilization practices, and rapid fluctuation in late winter/early spring temperatures. The primary biotic factor responsible for predisposing peach trees to bacterial canker or cold injury or both is the ring nematode, Mesocriconema xenoplax (see “Nematodes ” section). Cytospora canker often moves into and finally kills trees badly damaged by cold and/or bacterial canker. The role of Cytospora canker in PTSL is, however, considered secondary. Other problems such as Armillaria root rot, stem pitting, and borers have at times been thought {{to be associated with}} PTSL, but these problems have distinct symptoms and control measures, and are discussed elsewhere in this book.

However, the treaty's unpopularity forced Hoare's resignation, and future British governments showed more opposition. Owing to Mussolini's Axis Pact between his Italy and Hitler's Germany, in 1940 Italy joined the Second World War on the side of Germany.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to analyse the {{managing}} of risks, insecurities and transactions costs that deterred economic exchange during the 1930 ’s and the 1940 ’s, within the Swedish-German bilateral clearing system, from a Swedish contractual theoretical perspective. In this thesis {{it has been shown}} that the clearing agreement was put in practice in 1934, on initiative of Sweden. In the agreement financial issues associated with risks and insecurities were to be reduced by formalising rules for the economic exchange. The basic principle was that Germany regularly had a trade surplus in relation to Sweden. The surplus was used for re-building the Reichsbank’s monetary reserves, as well as payments on financial claims. The agreement was designed in an incomplete way, to be adjusted ad hoc in a trial and error process. As both parties had different interests, they had to make concessions in order to sustain the clearing system. This was also reflected in the design of the agreement, which evolved from an incomplete to a specific, detailed agreement, due to the increasing risks and insecurities that had to be dealt with. The clearing system was ideal for wartime conditions since it maintained trade flows. It also became a line of defence: specific agreements allowed the dominant Germany less scope to assert preferential rights of interpretation of the rules and regulations. When the war intensified it was difficult for Germany to carry out its commitments to Sweden, and the Swedish party found reasons to distrust the German economy, which was entering a recession. At the same time Allied forces strengthened their political influence, and the victors would become the leaders of the future international economy. Sweden made a gradual exit from the clearing system, delivering the agreed upon exports to Germany, while keeping the Allied negotiators informed of the process. The Swedish-German clearing system <b>collapsed</b> in <b>spring</b> 1945...|$|R

Many important things are going on in society that are very hard to understand. What do they mean? What caused them? What should be done about them? They need to be given a name, to be interpreted, and more generally to be set on a course where normal science, the journalists and the political commentators can take over. They need, in brief, some creative theorizing. One of these problems is the current financial crisis, which I shall use as my example.

40|$|The {{chemical}} factors (inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, silicic acid) {{that potentially}} or actually control primary production were determined for the Bay of Brest, France, a macrotidal ecosystem submitted to high-nitrate-loaded freshwater inputs (winter nitrate freshwater concentrations > 700 mu M, Si:N molar ratio {{as low as}} 0. 2, i. e. among the lowest ever published). Intensive data collection and observations were carried out from February 1993 to March 1994 to determine the variations of physical [salinity, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), freshwater discharges] and chemical (oxygen and nutrients) parameters and their impacts on the phytoplankton cycle (fluorescence, pigments, primary production). With insufficient PAR the winter stocks of nutrients were almost nonutilized and the nitrate excess was exported to the adjacent ocean, due to rapid tidal exchange. By early April, a diatom-dominated spring bloom developed (chlorophyll a maximum = 7. 7 mu g l(- 1); primary production maximum = 2. 34 g C m(- 2) d(- 1)) under high initial nutrient concentrations. Silicic acid was rapidly exhausted over the whole water column; it is inferred {{to be the primary}} limiting factor responsible for the <b>collapse</b> of the <b>spring</b> bloom by mid-May.

Those secondary blooms developed under lower nutrient concentrations, mostly originating from nutrient recycling. Until August, Si and P most likely limited primary production, whereas the last stage of the productive period in September seemed to be N limited instead, this being a period of total nitrate depletion in almost the whole water column.

It is also a region where the warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) penetrates onto the shelf during the summer. Using hydrographic observations from a summer survey in 2008 we implement a box inverse model to propose a comprehensive view of the steady state circulation on this shelf in summer. Additional information from mooring observations collected on the depression slope is used to provide context to the retrieved circulation scheme. Over the depression slope, the summer baroclinic structure of the currents is found to contrast with the almost barotropic structure in winter. The summer circulation is strongly constrained by the DSW distribution and forms a clockwise circulation primarily transporting the fresh surface waters and the warm mCDW around the dome of DSW. Over the upper flank of the Mertz Bank, the inflow branch transports the mCDW towards the Mertz Glacier, while, over {{the lower part of the}} slope, the outflow branch returns to the sill a diluted mode of the same water mass. A total of 0. 19 Sv of mCDW inflows at the sill and two-third reach the Mertz Glacier and recirculate in front of it, allowing the mCDW to penetrate into the deeper part of the depression. Possible scenarios of interaction between the mCDW and the DSW with the glacier are examined. It is shown that, despite the water mass pathways and transports suggest possible ice-ocean interaction, both lateral and basal melting were likely small in summer 2008. Finally, our results suggest that, in addition to bathymetric features, the distribution of the residual DSW which is left from the preceding winter sets up regional pressure gradients which provide a seasonal control on the shelf circulation. In particular, the <b>spring</b> <b>collapse</b> of the convective patch would contribute to setting up a deep pycnocline which strongly impacts the shelf circulation in the following summer, with possible feedback of the mCDW transports on the polynya activity and water mass formation...|$|R
