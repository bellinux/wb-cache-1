This carpet {{is used to}} simulate {{the behavior of a}} nanostructured surface in electro-discharge machining (EDM) where small protrusions on the surface could play a similar role. CNTs behave like simple electrical conductors between the discharge and the silicon wafer. They act as if they would focus the current on smaller areas. The average diameter of impacts is about five times smaller if the silicon wafer is coated by a CNT <b>carpet.</b> The <b>underlying</b> silicon surface is heated by the plasma and melts, forming a central spot surrounded by a serrated trailing edge. The current density being about one order of magnitude larger when a CNT carpet is present, the induced magnetic field stirs the molten silicon, creating serrations all around the impact. Hot nanoparticles of carbon coming from the plasma fall and roll randomly on the silicon surface where they create wavy micro-channels. Nanowires that are detached from the surface are covered by nanoparticles of platinum in the plasma and embedded within an amorphous carbon layer deposited on the nanotube. However, these effects can only be observed if the current density is high enough (>approximate to 10 A mu m(- 2) depending on the material) like in micro-EDM but not in nano-EDM...|$|R

The floors of apartment housing in South Korea commonly use standard floor finishings and structures for interlayer noise prevention, which generally consist of gypsum panels, lightweight porous concrete, side insulation, and finishing mortar. Additionally, it is reported that carpets and other soft resilient floor finishing material, such as <b>carpet</b> with rubber <b>underlay,</b> would be useful for reducing the influence of impact sound levels. However, the floor of this field test was bare, which means the finishing material or any type of noise resilient layers would be applied on top of the voided slab system. If the floor impact sound insulation performance test could be conducted after applying the construction finishing materials on top of the voided slab system, the floor impact sound insulation performance might be slightly better than that of the bare floor without finishing.|$|R

5000|$|The {{inability}} of landfills to properly {{deal with the}} disposal of tires has spurred the research into ways to successfully recycle tires into commodities and resources, such as concrete, asphalt and other tires. To convert the waste tire into a valuable product, it must first be reduced in size and then recycled. The recycling process begins first by shredding tires into small manageable chips, which are then cooled to cryogenic temperatures, causing the pieces to become brittle. These brittle pieces are then pulverized into a material that must be screened to remove large chunks of rubber or polymer. Finally, the remaining fibre and magnetic material are separated from the pulverized material using a magnetic separator and a vibrational separator. This form of recycling is environmentally friendly, and allows a valuable resource to be used again and again.There is a potential for using waste tire rubber to make activated-carbon adsorbents for air-quality control applications. Such an approach provides a recycling path for waste tires {{and the production of}} new adsorbents from a low-cost waste material.Also, recycled rubber from tires is used as a component of various products commonly known as [...] "tire derived products". Such products include asphalt paving mixtures and as extenders in a variety of rubber products such as roofing materials, walk pads, <b>carpet</b> and flooring <b>underlay</b> and other products. More such products are being developed.|$|R
40|$|Falls are {{the most}} common unintentional injury {{modality}} among infants, as well as the most common history provided by caretakers in cases of suspected child abuse. Skull fracture is a common finding for both violence-related and unintentional head injuries, and {{it is not clear what}} fall heights cause skull fracture in young children. ^ Material property testing of human infant skull and suture, anthropomorphic surrogate simulations, and finite element modeling were combined to determine the fall heights capable of creating skull fracture. The ultimate stress of human adult cranial bone at high test rates is more than 5 times higher than pediatric cranial bone, indicating a lower threshold for fracture. However, adult cranial bone was found to be 48 times stiffer than pediatric cranial bone, and pediatric cranial suture was able deform over 100 % before failure, producing an infant skullcase that may significantly deform before fracture, increasing the potential for brain deformation and injury upon impact. ^ Angular accelerations calculated from surrogate simulations of head-first falls from 1 - 3 feet reveal that drops onto mattress produce significantly lower rotational accelerations than carpet and concrete. Drops onto carpet pad were not significantly different than concrete due to compression of the <b>carpet</b> pad and <b>underlying</b> concrete surface. Sagittal and axial rotation accounted for the majority of head motion during all drops. ^ Using measured material property data and loads from the surrogate simulations, a 3 D finite element model of a 1 -½ month old infant head predicted that a 280 N impact force onto the occiput would result in a 50 % probability of skull fracture in infants. Based on the range of forces calculated for the fall simulations of average head-first impacts, we conclude that there is ≥ 50 % probability of skull fracture in infants with head-first impact to the occiput from falls of 1 - 3 feet onto carpet pad and concrete, but not onto a mattress. ^ By defining biomechanical tolerances of pediatric tissues and mechanisms of injury, better accident prevention methods may be developed, and clinicians will be better equipped to make objective assessments of injury etiologies in infants. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{challenge}} for clinicians {{when presented with}} a significant head injury in a young child and a postulated fall height {{is to determine the}} plausibility of such an injury. Previous authors have aimed to determine the head injuries that can result from a low height fall, however {{due to a lack of}} clarity it is difficult to determine a fall height at which certain head injuries including skull fracture and intra cranial injury (ICI) becomes more likely. Biomechanical thresholds aimed at young children exist for skull fracture and adult thresholds for subdural haemorrhage, however they have not been assessed against the injuries seen in a clinical setting. Consequently this study investigated low height falls in a paediatric clinical setting to determine differentiating variables and characteristics in the mechanism of head injury between children with a minor head injury and those with a skull fracture and / or ICI. The primary aim of which was to determine a fall height threshold for skull fracture and / ICI in young children. Following this, biomechanical methods were used to include, the development of an accurate anthropomorphic testing device (ATD) and a finite element model of an infant head, to investigate the differentiating variables and ultimately the clinical fall height threshold. Method A case control study of children ≤ 48 months of age who had a minor head injury and those with a skull fracture and / or ICI, to identify variables and characteristics of falls that influenced injury severity. Children were ascertained from those who attended the University Hospital of Wales Cardiff from a low height fall. The clinical characteristics and biomechanical variables evaluated included the mechanism of injury, surface of impact, site of impact and fall height (taking into consideration height of object and centre of gravity of the child’s body and head mass). Categorical variables were assessed using a Chi Square test and continuous variables using Student t-test or the non parametric equivalent. A modified logistic regression was used to evaluate the likelihood of sustaining a skull fracture and /or ICI based on fall height. Initially to investigate the differentiating variables a biofidelic infant headform was designed via image processing and segmentation of computed tomography (CT) datasets and manufactured using materials with similar properties to the bone and soft tissues of the head. The headform impact response was initially validated against infant cadaver data and then it was subject to tests classed as sub-injurious based on the clinical data collected from the hospital. The headform was dropped at impact angles of 90 o, 75 o and 60 o at three velocities (2. 4 m/s, 3 m/s, 3. 4 m/s) corresponding to three heights (0. 3 m, 0. 45 m, 0. 6 m), onto four domestic surfaces (<b>carpet,</b> <b>carpet</b> & <b>underlay,</b> laminate and wood) using two skin friction surrogates (latex, polyamide). A Student t-test was used to measure the affect of the coefficient of static friction and a three factorial ANOVA to measure the affect of impact velocity, surface type and angle of impact had on kinematic variables (peak g, HIC, rotational acceleration, change in rotational velocity and duration of impact). Finally to investigate the differentiating variables a finite element (FE) model of an infant head was developed, again through image processing of infant head CT datasets. The FE model consisted of the scalp, sutures, cranial bones, dura membranes, cerebral spinal fluid, bridging veins and the brain and the impact response was also initially validated against infant cadaver data. Post validation a parametric test across four different scenarios (0. 3 m impact onto the occipital, frontal, vertex and parietal areas of the head) was conducted to assess the affect material properties have on impacted response of the model. Finally the FE was used to assess the affect height (0. 3 m, 0. 6 m, 1. 2 m) and anatomical site of impact have on the impact response of the head, including kinematic variables and material response variables. Results Identified cases included 416 children with a minor head injury and 47 with a skull fracture and / or ICI. The mean fall height for minor head injuries was significantly lower than for a fall causing skull fracture and / or ICI (P< 0. 001). Utilising the height of centre of gravity of the head, no skull fracture and / or ICI was sustained in children who fell < 0. 6 m (2 ft). Skull fractures and / or ICI were more likely in children ≤ 12 months (P< 0. 001), following impacts to the temporal/parietal or occipital region of the head (P< 0. 01), and impacts onto wood (P< 0. 05). All tests using the biofidelic headform were conducted with impact velocities corresponding to fall heights ≤ 0. 6 m, where an increase in impact velocity, increase in surface stiffness and a decrease in impact angle significantly affected both rotational and translation kinematic variables (P< 0. 05). Peak rotational accelerations at 90 degrees were 11, 363 rad/s 2 on wood at an impact velocity corresponding to a height of 0. 6 m and significantly increased to 16, 980 rad/s 2 with a 30 degree decrease in impact angle (P< 0. 001). However head injury criterion (HIC) decreased for wood at impact velocity corresponding to 0. 6 m from 245 to 121 for a 30 degree decrease in impact angle (P< 0. 001). The parametric test using the finite element model indicated that the skull stiffness has the greatest affect on the dynamic response of the head, an increase in the skull stiffness of 7...|$|R

40|$|Efforts {{to improve}} the fire safety of {{furniture}} protect property and save lives. Fires involving ignition of residential upholstered furniture constitute {{a leading cause of}} fire deaths and serious injuries associated with consumer products. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission staff, the average annual fire losses for the years 1995 - 1999 were 460 deaths, 1, 110 injuries and $ 130 million in property damage (CPSC, 2004). Flame retardants delay ignition and have proven to save lives. While benefits achieved through enhanced fire safety are critical, they should be achieved in a manner that minimizes risk to human health and the environment. The work summarized in this report arose from concern over potential human health and environmental impacts from the use of pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE). This chemical flame retardant has been used in the manufacture of low-density, flexible polyurethane foam for upholstered furniture (residential, business and institutional), mattresses, bedding, <b>carpet</b> <b>underlay</b> and other articles.

40|$|Fractures {{of the hip}} {{are common}} among the elderly and {{preventative}} measures {{should be taken to}} reduce the risk. Hip protectors are a cost-effective solution and can be used successfully to reduce the likelihood of hip fracture. Unfortunately, they suffer from low patient compliance because they are uncomfortable to wear and require co-operation from the patient to wear them consistently. An alternative solution is to place a protective layer on the other impacting surface, which is the floor. This avoids the problem of patient compliance and ensures protection. Little research has been concerned with the role of floor coverings in an impact. A mechanical test rig has been designed and built to simulate a person falling onto floor coverings with sufficient impact energy to fracture the proximal femur if unprotected. Forces are measured using a piezoelectric load cell that is positioned under a pin to represent the greater trochanter. Both the time and frequency domain data have been analysed for each impact. Carpet and vinyl floor coverings have been tested with various underlay materials. The new underlay materials have been compared with typical <b>carpet</b> <b>underlay.</b> Results highlight the important energy absorption role that floor coverings have during impacts on the hip.

40|$|When a {{fire has}} been {{deliberately}} lit {{as an act}} of arson, a liquid accelerant is often used to intensify the blaze. Ignitable liquid residues can be left behind at the scene after the fire has been extinguished. These residues are valuable items of evidence which can indicate, in a court of law, that the fire may have been set with malicious intent. Current procedures dictate that items of fire debris thought to contain ignitable liquids residues must be collected at the scene and sent to the laboratory for confirmatory analysis. This process can take several days at its quickest and many months at its longest, depending on the caseload of the laboratory. Performing such analyses {{at the scene of the}} fire can help guide investigators much more effectively than waiting for laboratory results. Fast analysis on-site can also be utilised to screen potential fire debris samples as a quality control measure before they are submitted to the laboratory. This study aimed to evaluate the TRIDION- 9 portable gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer instrument for the purpose of on-site fire debris analysis. The TRIDION- 9 is the latest iteration in portable gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer instrumentation developed by Torion Technologies, Incorporated (American Fork, Utah, USA). A variety of substrate matrices and ignitable liquids were analysed using the TRIDION- 9. Seven substrates were chosen to represent surfaces common in residential dwellings. These were nylon carpet, polypropylene carpet, wool carpet, rubber <b>carpet</b> <b>underlay,</b> foam <b>carpet</b> <b>underlay,</b> raw pine wood and polyurethane. Seven ignitable liquids were examined, including unleaded petroleum, diesel fuel, kerosene and mineral turpentine. Unleaded petroleum was sampled at various levels of weathering (evaporation). These levels were neat (unevaporated), 70 %, 90 % and 97 % weathered. Substrates were burned before being spiked with 0. 1 μL of ignitable liquid. Sampling was performed via passive headspace solid phase microextraction, followed by immediate analysis using the TRIDION- 9. Operational samples were also gathered from a realistic burn scenario and analysed on-site. The TRIDION- 9 was used to positively identify 38 of 49 ignitable liquid samples on burned substrates. Four samples produced inconclusive results, but correctly suggested that ignitable liquids were present in the samples. Seven samples could not be identified using TRIDION- 9 data. Operational samples were obtained from a real fire scene. The TRIDION- 9 positively identified ignitable liquid residues in 9 of 11 operational samples. Two samples did not produce positive results due to sampling issues. The results of this study show that the TRIDION- 9 is well-suited to field-based fire debris analysis applications as a presumptive testing tool. The TRIDION- 9 is easy to use and operates effectively in a field environment. Result quality is excellent, rivalling the sensitivity of traditional laboratory-based instrumentation.
