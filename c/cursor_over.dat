5|$|Modules {{and weapons}} are built using a {{resource}} {{represented by a}} lug nut. This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> them. Each corporation provides {{a different type of}} cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouse cursor}} helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the <b>cursor</b> <b>over.</b> For example, to move in a direction, the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a hand holding a magnifying glass. By clicking and dragging the cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around Battle of Austerlitz, in which the forces {{under the command of}} Napoleon must defend the Austrian village of Austerlitz from the invading Austro-Russian army, led by Tsar Alexander. In the game, the battle itself begins at 7am on 2 December 1805 and is played out in a series of turns. A turn lasts fifteen minutes and a total number of eight orders must be issued {{before the end of the}} turn. The player may choose either French or Russian forces to control throughout the game. In order to move a unit, the player must select them and point their the <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> the desired location; however, movement is restricted within a turn. At the start of a movement phase, the player can issue a command to one of their units. Orders include move, attack, defend, shell, stay in reserve, retreat and report.|$|E

25|$|During {{the social}} sections, Ogami navigates the theater during limited time {{sequences}} between battles. During these sequences, when talking {{with both the}} main heroines of the Flower Division and supporting characters, conversations rely on the LIPS (Live & Interactive Picture System) system; when faced with critical choices {{in the course of}} a conversation, conversation options are displayed with a time limit for the player to select a response. Depending on the type of response, the character may respond positively or negatively, impacting their relationship with Ogami and future interactions. Other actions within LIPS include holding the <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> parts of a character's portrait to trigger internal monologues and varying responses from the characters. Each main heroine has different personality quirks that must be taken into consideration while talking with them.|$|E
25|$|LucasArts' {{previous}} graphic adventure, Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), {{introduced a}} new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, which had taken up the lower third of the player's screen. Full Throttle continued to refine on the changes introduced in Sam & Max Hit the Road: Objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor's crosshairs when the cursor is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the left mouse button causes a contextual pie menu {{to appear in the}} shape of the emblem of Ben's biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and a gloved hand. The player hovers the <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; for example, selecting the skull's mouth to speak to a character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, or pull the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player's inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory or with objects or characters in the scene. These gameplay features would be further developed for The Curse of Monkey Island (1997).|$|E
500|$|The Million Dollar Homepage is {{a website}} {{conceived}} in 2005 by Alex Tew, {{a student from}} Wiltshire, England, {{to raise money for}} his university education. The home page consists of a million pixels arranged in a [...] pixel grid; the image-based links on it were sold for $1 per pixel in [...] blocks. The purchasers of these pixel blocks provided tiny images to be displayed on them, a URL to which the images were linked, and a slogan to be displayed when hovering a <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> the link. The aim of the website was to sell all of the pixels in the image, thus generating a million dollars of income for the creator. The Wall Street Journal has commented that the site inspired other websites that sell pixels.|$|E
5000|$|Early systems {{included}} the US AN/MPQ-4, which used lobe switching to switch between two angles about 35 mils apart (about 2 degrees). Reflected signals were displayed on two B-scopes. Measurements from the B-scopes were copied into a ballistic calculator, which produced the X and Y {{location of the}} launcher. The UK Green Archer radar used a manual switch to flip between the vertical angles. The radar was normally left in the [...] "lower" [...] angle setting, while the operator waited for returns. When one was seen the switch {{was moved to the}} upper position, and the second return plotted. Ballistic calculation was performed by plotting the two points on an X-Y chart paper, and then moving mechanical <b>cursors</b> <b>over</b> the points. The rest of the calculation was carried out electronically.|$|R

5000|$|Flanders {{originally}} and temporarily {{described the}} phenomenon as Saturnic navigation {{in reference to}} the Saturn Corporation, whose company website epitomized this phenomenon. Flanders writes, [...] "The typical form of MMN is represented by menus composed of unrevealing icons that are replaced with explicative text only when the mouse <b>cursor</b> hovers <b>over</b> them".|$|R
500|$|To {{increase}} the interactivity with the game-world, id Software designed hundreds of high-resolution animated screens for in-game computers. Rather than using a simple [...] "use key" [...] to operate these computers, the crosshair {{acts as a}} mouse <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> the screens allowing the player to use a computer in the game world. This allows for in-game computer terminal to perform more than one function, from operating security door codes, activating machinery, toggling lights or unlocking weapons lockers. According to the Doom 3 manual, GUI designer Patrick Duffy wrote over 500,000 lines of script code, and generated more than 25,000 image files to create all of the graphical interfaces, computer screens, and displays throughout Doom 3. Other important features of the game engine are normal mapping and specular highlighting of textures, realistic handling of object physics, dynamic, ambient soundtrack, and multi-channel sound. Doom 3 on Xbox supports 480p widescreen video display resolution and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.|$|E
500|$|From the start, {{only one}} episode is {{available}} to play; when the player completes an episode, a new one is unlocked. The episodes are divided into chapters, which consist of investigations and courtroom sessions. During investigation sections, the player aims to find evidence {{for use in the}} courtroom sessions; the game moves on to the next chapter within the episode when the player has gathered enough evidence. The player moves and performs actions through a menu with four options: [...] "examine", which lets them move a <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> the environment and examine items; [...] "move", which shows a menu with locations the player can move to; talk, which shows a list of topics the player can discuss with witnesses in the area; and present, which lets the player show evidence or character profiles to a witness. Some witnesses do not want to discuss certain subjects, leading to a lock symbol appearing over the subject. By showing the witness a magatama, the player is able to see the secret they are trying to hide in the form of locks, called a [...] "Psyche-Lock"; by presenting correct evidence or character profiles, the player can break the locks and be able to discuss the subject.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "MouseOver" [...] exploit {{occurred}} on September 21, 2010, when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter. When a user held the mouse <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> blacked-out {{parts of a}} tweet, the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader's account. The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up ads and links to pornographic sites. The origin of the worm is unclear, but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user (possibly Masato Kinugawa) who was using it to create coloured Tweets. Kinugawa, a Japanese developer, reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14. Later, when he found it was exploitable again, he created the account 'RainbowTwtr' {{and used it to}} post coloured messages. Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for [...] "onMouseOver", and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself. Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for [...] "fun and games", but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals. Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13:50 UTC that [...] "The exploit is fully patched." [...] Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed.|$|E
5000|$|In most {{graphical}} browsers, {{when the}} <b>cursor</b> hovers <b>over</b> a link, the cursor changes into a hand with an extended index finger and the [...] is {{displayed in a}} tooltip or in some other manner.

500|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game, {{in which the}} player controls Manuel [...] "Manny" [...] Calavera (calavera being Spanish for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes [...] "Meche" [...] Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from 3D models, while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Manny must collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item {{in and out of his}} coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never die or otherwise get into a no-win situation (that prevents completion of the game).|$|E
500|$|Windows Server 2012 {{includes}} {{a new version}} of Windows Task Manager together with the old version. In the new version the tabs are hidden by default, showing applications only. In the new Processes tab, the processes are displayed in varying shades of yellow, with darker shades representing heavier resource use. It lists application names and status, as well as CPU, memory, hard disk and network utilization. The process information found in the older versions are now moved to the new Details tab. The Performance tab shows [...] "CPU", [...] "Memory", [...] "Disk", [...] "Wi-Fi" [...] and [...] "Ethernet" [...] graphs. The CPU tab no longer displays individual graphs for every logical processor on the system by default, although that remains an option. Additionally, it can display data for each non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node. When displaying data for each logical processor for machines with more than 64 logical processors, the CPU tab now displays simple utilization percentages on heat-mapping tiles. The color used for these heat maps is blue, with darker shades again indicating heavier utilization. Hovering the <b>cursor</b> <b>over</b> any logical processor's data now shows the NUMA node of that processor and its ID, if applicable. Additionally, a new Startup tab has been added that lists startup applications, however this tab does not exist in Windows Server 2012. The new task manager recognizes when a Windows Store app has the [...] "Suspended" [...] status.|$|E

50|$|The {{display of}} the wait cursor is {{controlled}} by the operating system, not by the application. This works as follows: each application has an event queue that receives events from the operating system (for example, key presses and mouse button clicks); and if an application takes longer than 2 seconds to process the events in its event queue (regardless of the cause), the operating system displays the wait cursor whenever the <b>cursor</b> hovers <b>over</b> that application's windows.|$|R

[...] The most frequently used font in the strip is Blue Highway, which does not contain any italic characters.|$|E
5000|$|Green Archer solved {{this problem}} by quickly moving the antenna between two set {{vertical}} angles. The scanner was first set so it scanned back and forth near the horizon line. When a mortar shell was seen on the display, the operator used a grease pencil to mark its location. He then pressed a button that quickly raised the scanner so it was pointed at a higher vertical angle. This happened rapidly enough that the bomb would {{take some time to}} reach this higher altitude, at which point it would appear on the display again and this second location would also be marked. The operator them placed <b>cursors</b> <b>over</b> the marks and input the plot to the radar's analogue computer. [...] These two plots, the time between them and the angle between the two beam positions gave two points on a parabolic curve. Such a curve is defined by two points and is a good approximation of a mortar bomb trajectory. Using these, the azimuth of the radar beam centre and the radar's coordinates, the mortar position coordinates were calculated. These could be adjusted to reflect the actual height of the ground.|$|R

25|$|When the <b>cursor</b> hovers <b>over</b> a link, {{depending}} on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box, which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.|$|R
