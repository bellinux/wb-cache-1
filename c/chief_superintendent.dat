5|$|Detective <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Graham Melvin of the Serious Crime Squad {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} {{investigation}} a few hours after the killing, at 2:00 am on 7 October. The inquiry became the largest {{in the history of the}} Metropolitan Police, with 150 officers assigned full-time. Melvin was born in Halifax in 1941, joining the Metropolitan Police in 1960, then the Criminal Investigation Department. He studied at Bramshill Police College, served with the Flying Squad, and was known for having solved several notorious cases, including that of Kenneth Erskine, the Stockwell Strangler. He became a detective <b>chief</b> <b>superintendent</b> in March, 1985, when he joined the elite International and Organised Crime Squad (SO1).|$|E
5|$|Operation Grange {{was led by}} Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard's Homicide and Serious Crime Command was {{the first}} senior {{investigating}} officer, reporting to Detective <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Hamish Campbell. The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff. When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall. By July 2013 the review had become an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Suffolk police {{linked the}} killings and {{launched}} a murder investigation, codenamed Operation Sumac. Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter acknowledged that Suffolk Constabulary would be reliant on external assistance owing to {{the magnitude of the}} investigation. A senior investigator with the Metropolitan Police, Commander Dave Johnston, was reported to have been drafted into the murder inquiry team from Scotland Yard in London in an advisory capacity. The day-to-day investigation was conducted by Detective <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Stewart Gull.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{month of}} Shaftesbury's disappearance, Detective <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Graham Cox, head of Sussex Police CID, who had been {{contacted}} by Lady Frances Ashley-Cooper, {{said that they were}} treating the matter as a murder case. The French police agreed with Cox, {{due to the lack of}} ransom demands or signs of fraud. Whether dead or alive, there were still no clues as to the whereabouts of the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the trial}} judge had criticized the police investigation, Essex Police held an {{internal}} inquiry, conducted by Detective <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Dickinson. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police, so he made a formal complaint, which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This process uncovered more documentation, which Bamber used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Ellison played DS Tommy Burnside in episode one {{and later}} {{returned}} as DI, later promoted to DCI, Frank Burnside from 1984 to 2000.

Since leaving The Bill, Ellison has enjoyed a guest stint as Len Harker in EastEnders. Ellison has also appeared in The Professionals, Minder, Casualty, Judge John Deed and voiced a Doctor Who audio adventure. The character spawned a spin-off, Burnside.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Brady {{allegedly}} {{confessed to}} Fred Harrison, a journalist working for The Sunday People, {{that he had}} also {{been responsible for the}} murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, something that the police already suspected, as both children lived in the same area as Brady and Hindley and had disappeared {{at about the same time}} as their other victims. The subsequent newspaper reports prompted the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to reopen the case, in an investigation headed by Detective <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Peter Topping, who had been appointed head of GMP's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} {{referred}} to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on 16 September 2009 {{to determine whether there}} was evidence of misconduct or negligence by the police during the original murder investigation, the handling of Lace’s confession in 1983 and the request from Hodgson’s solicitors in 1998 for forensic examination of exhibits. The head of Southampton CID, Detective <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Shirley Dinnell, stated that the referral was voluntarily made by Hampshire Constabulary because of the miscarriage of justice that had taken place and to ensure transparency of inquiries.|$|E
5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
5000|$|The highest rank below Chief Officer level, <b>chief</b> <b>superintendents</b> {{were first}} {{introduced}} into the Metropolitan Police in 1949, when superintendents were regraded to the new rank, and have since been adopted in all British police forces. However, the rank had been used previously to this in some forces in certain circumstances. For example, in 1920 the deputy head of Shropshire Constabulary bore the official title of [...] "chief <b>superintendent</b> and deputy <b>chief</b> constable" [...] and in 1927 Lancashire Constabulary had two <b>chief</b> <b>superintendents</b> who were junior to the assistant chief constable.|$|R

5|$|Before the battle, Captain Charles Elliot, the <b>chief</b> <b>superintendent</b> of British {{trade in}} China, sailed to Kowloon in the cutter Louisa for food supplies, {{accompanied}} by the schooner Pearl and a pinnace from HMS Volage. Upon encountering three Chinese junks, Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff with demands to re-allow the supply of provisions. After several hours of unsuccessful correspondence, Elliot delivered an ultimatum that if provisions were not received, the junks would be sunk. When it expired with no results, the British opened fire on the junks, which returned fire {{with support from the}} fort on shore. During the engagement, the larger junks pursued the British boats which were sailing away after running low on ammunition. But after replenishing their cartridges, the British re-engaged the ships, which retreated to their former position, ending the clash in a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Detective <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} return, Cockcroft was {{appointed}} <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> of the Air Defence Research Development Establishment (ADRDE) at Christchurch, Hampshire. His {{focus was on}} the use of radar for shooting down enemy aircraft. The GL Mk. III radar was developed as a target tracking and predicting radar, but by 1942 the SCR-584 radar developed for the same purpose in the United States became available, and Cockcroft recommended that it be acquired under Lend-Lease. On his own initiative, he acquired SCR-584 sets for testing, and trials conducted on the Isle of Sheppey in October 1943 conclusively demonstrated that SCR-584 was superior. This made Cockcroft very unpopular at the Ministry of Supply, but he had intelligence that the Germans were planning to deploy the V-1 flying bomb. On 1 January 1944, Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Weeks sent Washington an urgent request for 134 SCR-584 sets.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} a federally-supported {{residential}} school system relied on the expert advice of several prominent Canadian and British statesmen. Sir Peregrine Maitland, a British soldier and colonial administrator, first proposed boarding schools in 1820, believing that civilizing Indigenous children, rather than adults, {{was the best way}} to influence cultural change. Residential schools focused on imparting industry and knowledge were proposed again in 1845 in a report that had been commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot, entitled Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada. Referred to as the Bagot Report, it is seen as the foundational document for the federal residential school system. It was supported by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies, and Egerton Ryerson, who was then the <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> of Education in Upper Canada.|$|E
5|$|Key staff {{recruited}} {{to work at}} Fort Halstead included John Challens, who commenced on 1 January 1948. By mid-1948, {{it became clear that}} Penney's initial estimate that he would require 220 staff was wide of the mark, and that he would need nearly 500. This meant not only taking personnel from other projects, but scrapping some entirely. In October 1948, Penney submitted a request for developing a new, separate site for HER on grounds of safety, security and economy. This was approved, but it took another six months to locate a suitable site. An airbase, RAF South Cerney in Gloucestershire was chosen, but the RAF refused to relinquish the site. A former airbase, RAF Aldermaston, was then selected. At the same time, it was decided to separate HER from the Armaments Research Establishment (ARE). This resulted in a painful bureaucratic battle over personnel like Challens, whose expertise was wanted for research on both nuclear weapons and guided missiles. In the end, HER kept 25 of the 30 key personnel that ARE wanted, including Challens. The site was taken over on 1 April 1950. Penney became <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> High Explosive Research (CSHER). The first stage of work at Aldermaston was completed in December 1951, but the plutonium processing building was only handed over in April 1952, the month that the first plutonium was due to arrive from Windscale. At the peak of construction in 1953, over 4,000 personnel were working on the site.|$|E

50|$|In {{most other}} forces, {{superintendent}} lay between inspector and assistant chief constable {{until well into}} the 20th century.

Today, however, every force in the country has all three ranks.|$|R

25|$|Senior {{officers}} usually wear {{distinguishing marks}} around {{the outer edge}} of the peaks of their caps (or under the capbadge for female officers, who do not wear peaked caps).

Chief constables, the Commissioner of the City of London Police, and all commissioner ranks of the Metropolitan Police wear oakleaves on both the outer and inner edges of their peaks (or a double row beneath the capbadge for female officers). In Scotland, however, the mark is a silver band for inspectors and chief inspectors, a silver band and silver oakleaves on the outer and inner edges of the peak respectively for <b>superintendents</b> and <b>chief</b> <b>superintendents,</b> and silver oakleaves on the outer and inner edges of the peak for all chief officers.|$|R
