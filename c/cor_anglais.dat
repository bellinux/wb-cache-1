5|$|In {{his early}} pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, {{the size of}} the {{orchestra}} pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of 16 players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, timpani and percussion and a small string section of seven players. After moving to the Salle Choiseul he had an orchestra of 30 players. The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly. Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion. When they were available he wrote for <b>cor</b> <b>anglais,</b> harp, and, exceptionally, Keck records, an ophicleide (Le Papillon), tubular bells (Le carnaval des revues), and a wind machine (Le voyage dans la lune).|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Ferrier's death {{an appeal}} was {{launched}} by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, {{to establish a}} cancer research fund in Ferrier's name. Donations were received {{from all over the}} world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell's When I am laid in earth, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo <b>cor</b> <b>anglais.</b> The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund oncology research.|$|E
50|$|The third movement, Quid sum miser, is short, {{depicting}} after Judgement Day. It {{features an}} interesting orchestration of TTB chorus, two <b>cors</b> <b>anglais,</b> eight bassoons, cellos, and double basses. The Rex tremendae contains contrasting opposites. The choir sings both beseechingly, {{as if for}} help, and majestically. Quaerens me is a quiet, soft movement which is completely a cappella.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{movement}} is {{the highlight of}} the symphony and features horns answered by <b>cors</b> <b>anglais</b> over a walking bass line. The violins play with mutes. H. C. Robbins Landon calls it [...] "surely one of the settecentos supremely original concepts". Played with all the indicated repeats, it lasts about 10 minutes, almost half the duration of the symphony as a whole.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} in the Classical period E-flat major was only for bombastic music with brass. [...] "E-flat was the key Joseph Haydn chose most often for string quartets, ten times in all, and in every other case he wrote the slow {{movement}} in the dominant, B-flat." [...] Or [...] "when composing church music and operatic music in E-flat major, Joseph Haydn often substituted <b>cors</b> <b>anglais</b> for oboes in this period", and also in the Symphony No. 22 in E-flat major.|$|R
25|$|The {{orchestra}} {{for both}} comprises 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, <b>cor</b> <b>anglais,</b> 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, trombone, tuba, timpani, 3 percussionists (side drum, cymbals, xylophone, tambourine, bass drum, triangle, glockenspiel, castanets, rattle), and strings.|$|E
25|$|Founding Icehouse member Iva Davies (vocals, guitars, keyboards, Fairlight CMI, <b>Cor</b> <b>Anglais)</b> {{was joined}} by Robert Kretschmer (guitars), Andy Qunta (keyboards, piano), Simon Lloyd (reeds, brass, keyboards, programming), Stephen Morgan (bass guitar) and Paul Wheeler (drums, percussion) in {{recording}} the album from February 1987.|$|E
25|$|Das Rheingold {{requires}} one bass drum, one tam-tam, one onstage harp and 18 onstage anvils. Die Walküre requires one snare drum, tam-tam, and an on-stage steerhorn. Siegfried requires one onstage <b>cor</b> <b>anglais</b> and one onstage horn. Götterdämmerung requires five onstage {{horns and}} four onstage steerhorns, {{one of them}} to be blown by Hagen.|$|E
5000|$|A {{feature of}} the song was the piccolo trumpet solo played by Mason. This {{is thought to be}} the first use of this {{instrument}} (a distinctive, speciality instrument, pitched an octave higher than the standard B-flat trumpet) in pop music. Martin later wrote, [...] "The result was unique, something which had never been done in rock music before." [...] McCartney was dissatisfied with the initial attempts at the song's instrumental fill (one of which, recorded 12 January and featuring two <b>cors</b> <b>anglais</b> played by Dick Morgan and Mike Winfield, was released on Anthology 2), and was inspired to use the instrument after seeing Mason's performance on a BBC television broadcast of the second Brandenburg Concerto by Johann Sebastian Bach.|$|R
5000|$|Although not Haydn's {{greatest}} {{success in}} the operatic field, L'incontro improvviso does include some high-class and varied music. As well as the 'Turkish' music, amusing scenes for Osmin and Calandro, the 'painting' aria in the last act where Ali describes {{the contents of a}} picture with orchestral help, and another aria [...] "Senti, al buio pian" [...] for Osmin with orchestral colouring, there is Italian lyricism evident in arias for Ali ("Deh! se in ciel pietade avete") and Rezia ("Or vicina a te").Act II has two powerful arias for sopranos; Haydn detached Rezia's [...] "Or vicino a te" [...] and published it separately in 1783.The superb first act [...] "Mi sembra un sogno" [...] which contrasts a trio for female voices with muted violins, <b>cors</b> <b>anglais</b> and horns is a highlight.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version of}} the piece, well known in Haydn's time, was {{published}} by the Venier firm in Paris. This version has three movements with the second movement of the original version coming first, followed by a different movement that is marked andante grazioso in [...] and concluding with the same finale as in the original version. The second movement (catalogued as H. I:22bis) {{is thought to be}} spurious, and arrangement as a whole not Haydn's own. H. C. Robbins Landon suggests that this arrangement was likely made to the original composition due to the [...] "strangely original" [...] adagio and the existence of <b>cors</b> <b>anglais,</b> which were not available in many areas. It is precisely these elements that make this symphony so popular, so this version is seldom performed in modern times.|$|R
25|$|The opera is scored for flute, piccolo, two oboes, <b>cor</b> <b>anglais,</b> two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, cimbasso, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, harp and strings, {{together}} with offstage wind band, offstage bell and small onstage string orchestra (four to six first violins, two second violins, two violas, two cellos and two double basses).|$|E
25|$|Giovanna d'Arco is scored for piccolo (briefly {{doubling}} second flute), flute, two oboes (second doubling <b>cor</b> <b>anglais),</b> two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, six or nine offstage trumpets, three trombones, cimbasso, timpani, snare drum, {{bass drum}} and cymbals (cassa), cymbals (piatti), triangle, bell, cannon, wind band, wind band of brass instruments only, offstage band, bass drum for band, harp, harmonium, strings.|$|E
25|$|The work is scored for two flutes and a piccolo (2nd flute {{doubling}} 2nd piccolo {{for a few}} bars), two oboes (2nd doubling <b>cor</b> <b>anglais),</b> two clarinets in A and B, two bassoons, four horns in F, two trumpets in A and B, three trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, tam-tam, harp and strings. The music premiered in Saint Petersburg on October 28, 1888 {{conducted by}} Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
5000|$|With his opera La Juive, in 1835, Halévy {{attained}} {{not only}} his first major triumph, but gave the world a work {{that was to be}} one of the cornerstones of the French repertory for a century, with the role of Eléazar one of the great favorites of tenors such as Enrico Caruso. The opera's most famous aria is Eléazar's [...] "Rachel, quand du Seigneur". Its orchestral ritornello is the one quotation from Halévy that Berlioz included in his Treatise on Instrumentation, for its unusual duet for two <b>cors</b> <b>anglais.</b> It is probable however that this aria was inserted only at the request of the great tenor Adolphe Nourrit, who premiered the role and may have suggested the aria's text. La Juive is one of the grandest of grand operas, with major choruses, a spectacular procession in Act I, and impressive celebrations in Act III. It culminates with the heroine plunging into a vat of boiling water in Act V. Mahler admired it greatly, stating: [...] "I am absolutely overwhelmed by this wonderful, majestic work. I regard it as one of the greatest operas ever created". Other admirers included Wagner, who wrote an enthusiastic review of Halévy's grand operas for the German press in 1841 (Wagner never showed towards Halévy the anti-Jewish animus that was so notorious a feature of his writings on Meyerbeer and Mendelssohn).|$|R
25|$|All four parts have a {{very similar}} instrumentation. The core {{ensemble}} of instruments are one piccolo, three flutes (third doubling second piccolo), three oboes, <b>cor</b> <b>anglais</b> (doubling fourth oboe), three soprano clarinets, one bass clarinet, three bassoons; eight horns (fifth through eight doubling wagner tubas), three trumpets, one bass trumpet, three tenor trombones, one contrabass trombone (doubling bass trombone), one contrabass tuba; a percussion section with 4 timpani (requiring two players), triangle, cymbals, glockenspiel; six harps and a string section consisting of 16 first and second violins, 12 violas, 12 violoncellos, and 8 double basses.|$|E
25|$|A live {{performance}} may feature various changes. The performances require {{a minimum of}} 230 players. However, most of the expanded orchestration (double brass, added flutes) {{and some of the}} unique instruments can be removed and replaced by more conventional counterparts (the panpipes can be replaced by a recorder), some roles like the wood flute can be doubled by the existing players. Also, the orchestra (particularly the string section) can be reduced to an overall size of under seventy players in order to accommodate for the additional instruments required while keeping within the limitations of the organiser or the stage. Alternatively, the orchestra can be expanded with a larger string section and added woodwind parts (so the <b>cor</b> <b>anglais,</b> piccolo and contrabassoon are played by separate players to those on the flutes, oboes and bassoons) and the SATBB and boy choirs (an additional, separate male choir is usually not used) are typically expanded, often to as many as 150 and 100 accordingly, or more. The solo roles are often reduced to one or two sopranos, a boy soprano, a girl and a baritone.|$|E

500|$|Chrisye {{approached}} Addie MS, a young composer, {{and asked}} him to help with the next album. Addie, despite feeling that he was not in the same class as Djarot and Jockie, accepted, and [...] suggested using similar melodies as in [...] "Lilin-Lilin Kecil" [...] and Badai Pasti Berlalu. The resulting album, Sendiri (Alone), with songs by Guruh and Junaidi Salat, included harps, oboes, <b>cor</b> <b>anglais,</b> and a string section. Spawning three singles, the album sold well and earned Chrisye his first BASF Award.|$|E
500|$|The Lateinisches Requiem is scored for soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part (SATB) choir, three flutes (also piccolo), two oboes, <b>cor</b> <b>anglais,</b> two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, three percussionists and strings. It is Reger's only choral {{composition}} to use four soloists. The four [...] "" [...] {{are used}} like the several choirs in compositions by Heinrich Schütz. The first movement {{opens with a}} long organ pedal point, which {{has been compared to}} the beginning of Wagner's Das Rheingold and the Brahms Requiem.|$|E
500|$|Threni is scored for one soprano, one contralto, two tenor and two bass soloists, chorus and an {{orchestra}} of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, <b>cor</b> <b>anglais,</b> 2 clarinets (second doubling alto clarinet in F), bass clarinet, contrabass sarrusophone, flugelhorn, 4 horns, 3 trombones (1 alto, 1 tenor, 1 bass), tuba, timpani, tamtam, harp, celesta, piano and strings. (The flugelhorn is actually listed as [...] "bugle" [...] by the publisher, {{though in the}} [...] "orchestration" [...] list {{at the head of}} the score the specification is for [...] "Contralto Bugle in B (Fluegelhorn)", and in the score itself, where all the other instruments are named in Italian, it is called in French and German, [...] "Bugle C-alto (Flügelhorn)". However, the part is played on the flugelhorn. The French word for flugelhorn is bugle à pistons, and the Italian is flicorno.) ...|$|E
500|$|The chamber opera Savitri (1908) {{is written}} for three solo voices, a small hidden female chorus, and an {{instrumental}} {{combination of two}} flutes, a <b>cor</b> <b>anglais</b> and a double string quartet. The music critic John Warrack comments on the [...] "extraordinary expressive subtlety" [...] with which Holst deploys the sparse forces: [...] "...he two unaccompanied vocal lines opening the work skilfully convey the relationship between Death, steadily advancing through the forest, and Savitri, her frightened answers fluttering round him, unable to escape his harmonic pull." [...] Head describes the work as unique in its time for its compact intimacy, and considers it Holst's most successful attempt to end the domination of Wagnerian chromaticism in his music. Dickinson considers it a significant step, [...] "not towards opera, but towards an idiomatic pursuit of [...] vision". Of the Kālidāsa texts, Dickinson dismisses The Cloud Messenger (1910–12) as an [...] "accumulation of desultory incidents, opportunistic dramatic episodes and ecstatic outpourings" [...] which illustrate the composer's creative confusion during that period; the Two Eastern Pictures (1911), in Dickinson's view, provide [...] "a more memorable final impression of Kālidāsa".|$|E
500|$|The opera {{begins with}} a brief orchestral prelude, the {{principal}} theme of which prefigures Leila's entrance. The opening chorus is punctuated by a lively dance—the critic John W. Klein describes it as [...] "electrifying". Nadir's first significant contribution is his aria [...] "", sung to an accompaniment of cellos and bassoons under a string tremolo that indicates the possible influence of Meyerbeer. Flutes and harps are used to introduce the main theme of the celebrated [...] "Pearl Fishers Duet", in what the opera historian Hervé Lacombe identifies as [...] "the most highly developed poetic scene in the opera". The duet's theme has become the opera's principal musical signature, repeated in the work whenever {{the issue of the}} men's friendship arises—though in Dean's view the tune is not worthy of the weight it carries. Dean suggests that Bizet's ability to find the appropriate musical phrase with style and economy is better demonstrated in his treatment of Leila's oath of chastity, where a simple phrase is repeated twice in minor third steps. Nadir's aria [...] "Je crois entendre encore", towards the end of act 1, is written on a barcarole rhythm, with a dominant <b>cor</b> <b>anglais</b> whereby, says Lacombe, [...] "he listener has the impression that the horn is singing".|$|E
500|$|Both Lutosławski's {{harmonic}} and aleatory {{processes are}} illustrated by example 1, {{an excerpt from}} Hésitant, the first movement of the Symphony No. 2. At number 7, the conductor gives a cue to the flutes, celesta and percussionist, who then play their parts in their own time, without any attempt to synchronise with the other instrumentalists. The harmony of this section {{is based on a}} 12-note chord built from major seconds and perfect fourths. After all the instrumentalists have finished their parts, a two-second general pause is indicated. The conductor then gives a cue at number 8 (and indicates the tempo of the following section) for two oboes and the <b>cor</b> <b>anglais.</b> They each play their part, again with no attempt to synchronise with the other players. The harmony of this part is based on the hexachord F–G–A–C–D–D, arranged {{in such a way that}} the harmony of the section never includes any sixths or thirds. When the conductor gives another cue at number 9, the players each continue until they reach the repeat sign, and then stop: they are unlikely to end the section at the same time. This [...] "refrain" [...] (from numbers 8 to 9) recurs throughout the movement, slightly altered each time, but always played by double-reed instruments which do not play elsewhere in the movement: Lutosławski thus also carefully controls the orchestral palette.|$|E
500|$|While in Germany, Holst reappraised his {{professional}} life, and in 1903 {{he decided to}} abandon orchestral playing to concentrate on composition. His earnings as a composer were too little to live on, {{and two years later}} he accepted the offer of a teaching post at James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich, which he held until 1921. He also taught at the Passmore Edwards Settlement, where among other innovations he gave the British premieres of two Bach cantatas. The two teaching posts for which he is probably best known were director of music at St Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith, from 1905 until his death, and director of music at Morley College from 1907 to 1924. Vaughan Williams wrote of the former establishment: [...] "Here he did away with the childish sentimentality which schoolgirls were supposed to appreciate and substituted Bach and Vittoria; a splendid background for immature minds." [...] Several of Holst's pupils at St Paul's went on to distinguished careers, including the soprano Joan Cross, and the oboist and <b>cor</b> <b>anglais</b> player Helen Gaskell. Of Holst's impact on Morley College, Vaughan Williams wrote: [...] " [...] bad tradition had to be broken down. The results were at first discouraging, but soon a new spirit appeared and the music of Morley College, together with its offshoot the 'Whitsuntide festival'... became {{a force to be reckoned}} with". Before Holst's appointment, Morley College had not treated music very seriously (Vaughan Williams's [...] "bad tradition"), and at first Holst's exacting demands drove many students away. He persevered, and gradually built up a class of dedicated music-lovers.|$|E
