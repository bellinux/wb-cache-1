50|$|As {{shown in}} the figure 3, when the {{inverter}} is controlled as a voltage source, it consists of a synchronization unit to synchronize with the grid and a power loop to regulate the real power and reactive power exchanged with the grid. The synchronization unit often needs to provide frequency and amplitude. But when inverter is controlled as a current source, the synchronization unit is often required to provide the phase of the grid only, so {{it is much more}} easier to control it as a current source.Since a synchronous is inherently able to synchronize with the grid, it is possible to integrate the synchronization function into the power controller without synchronization unit. This results in a <b>compact</b> <b>control</b> unit, as {{shown in the}} figure 4.|$|E
