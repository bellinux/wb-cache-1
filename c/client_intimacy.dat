40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that work family conflict can lead to significant psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and psychosomatic symptoms. It has also indicated that sexual satisfaction is often considered a critical dimension of love in a relationship, and when an individual’s self perception is negatively altered, sexual attitude can also be altered. This article will explore the relationship between work family conflict and dual learning partners’ sexual satisfaction in their relationship. A discussion of the implications for counselors with regard to helping clients address and develop individualized interventions to reduce the stress associated with work family conflict, helping <b>clients</b> regain <b>intimacy</b> and sexual satisfaction in their relationship, and advocating for workforces to become more aware of family unity and its roles in the 21 st century are included...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{a survey}} of 505 {{corporate}} clients from the information technology industry, this study uses a logit statistical model to analyze whether such factors as loyalty, trust, <b>client</b> importance, <b>intimacy</b> between customer and supplier {{and the cost of}} changing suppliers may affect the choice of the marketing channel used by the client. The results show that the greater intimacy between a supplier and a corporate client is a determining factor for the client’s preference for being served by the manufacturer rather than an intermediary. In contrast, clients’ perception of their own importance to the supplier is not very relevant to their preference for being served directly by the manufacturer, and the other factors were not identified as (statistically important) determinants of the choice of the marketing channel. These results suggest that the real advantage of the direct sales channel over the indirect sales channel lies in its ability to strengthen the client-manufacturer relationship, thereby contributing to the development of solutions that better serve the needs of corporate clients...|$|R

The intent is to allow the clients to exit treatment with the confidence and ability to use adaptive coping strategies in their post-treatment lives. This phase focuses on five conceptual areas that traumatic experiences most frequently cause damage to: safety, trust, power/control, esteem, and <b>intimacy.</b> <b>Clients</b> practice recognizing how their traumatic experiences resulted in over-generalized beliefs, as well as the impact of these beliefs on current functioning and quality of life.|$|R
40|$|Treatment {{data from}} a {{university}} counseling center (UCC) that utilized the Outcome Questionnaire– 45. 2 (OQ- 45; M. J. Lambert et al., 2004), a self-report general clinical symptom measure, was compared against treatment efficacy benchmarks from clinical trials of adult major depression that utilized similar measures. Statistical analyses suggested that the treatment effect size estimate obtained at this counseling center with clients whose level of psychological distress was above the OQ- 45 clinical cutoff score was similar to treatment efficacy observed in clinical trials. Analyses on OQ- 45 items suggested that clients elevated on 3 items indicating problematic substance use resulted in poorer treatment outcomes. In addition, clients who reported their relational status as separated or divorced had poorer outcomes than did those who reported being partnered or married, and <b>clients</b> reporting <b>intimacy</b> issues resulted in greater numbers of sessions. Although differential treatment effect due to training level was found where interns and other trainees had better pre–post outcome than did staff, interpretation of this result requires great caution because clients perceived to have complicated issues are actively reassigned to staff. More effectiveness investigations at UCCs are warranted...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} our understanding of what factors to include in substance recovery programs, the following relationships were examined in clients: prevalence of sexual concerns, fears of intimacy, time in recovery, relationship status and one???s desire to receive information regarding sexual health and intimacy education in recovery. The attitudes of professionals and paraprofessionals working in the substance abuse field toward the inclusion of sexuality and intimacy interventions in substance recovery programs were also explored. Thirty participants in recovery for a substance use disorder completed a series of surveys and 15 providers {{working in the field}} of substance abuse also participated. A significant positive relationship was found between participant sexual concerns and fears of <b>intimacy.</b> <b>Clients</b> were found to have a strong desire to receive more information about intimate partner relationships. Providers, in general, reported a strong desire to deliver more information about sexual health and intimate partner relationships in their work in the substance abuse field. On the other hand, these data support the belief that there is a culture within the substance abuse field that those in recovery should either abstain from intimate partner relationships during their treatment or that such information might be a distraction. These data also reinforce the limited research suggesting that incorporating the areas of sexual health and intimacy in substance abuse treatment is important...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the specific}} moral discourses that popular class female sex {{workers and their}} regular clients create in the particular world of prostitution in Managua, Nicargua. My intention was to identify, through ethnographic narratives, what meanings sex workers and <b>clients</b> attach to <b>intimacy</b> and respect and how their street life (calle) and home making (casa) roles merge and interact. The specific kind of morality that emerges in sex workers' and clients' manner of speaking indicates how the limits of morality are fluid, pointing to where the spheres of calle and casa meet, intermingle and create specific meanings. This is not an investigation into deviant behaviour, although the actors are situated in a social world that is characterised as liminal. It is, rather, an ethnography of the particular aimed at dispelling stereotypical images portrayed of sex workers and clients. It attempts to bring a commentary to the ongoing discussion on masculinity and sexuality, where a stress is being placed on the multiplicity and shifting character of roles, and of the centrality of interaction between men and women. The study is based on ethnographical field work (Nov 1998 - Mar 1999) conducted in Managua. The main methodology used was taped life history interviews mainly with sex workers and clients; and, participant observation through site visits to both day time and night time locations. The total number of interviews conducted was 26 (women 18, men 8). Additionally, literary sources on sexuality and masculinity in Latin America were used. In the world of Managua prostitution we find popular class Managuans in their role as clients and sex workers, but we also glimpse their other, home making roles. The so called "ideal" picture of gender relations, and the real situation {{on the streets and}} homes of popular class Nicaraguans contradict each other. Men and women are conditioned to believe in romantic love, but in many Nicaraguan homes the reality is economic and emotional deprivation, violence, and abandonment. There is a lack of trust, of safety and of an opportunity for men and women to fulfil the roles of home making. Women and men live with the dream of having a home, a place of safety and love, understanding and communication. Through the game of courtship between sex workers and clients, respect and communication leads to a mutual sense of affection and a particular kind of morality. The safety arising from this interaction provides a means of making a home. In this process we find evidence of how the meaning of morality and masculinity is shifting and transformative.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this Bachelor Thesis is An enema {{in the first}} birth giving period. The Thesis is {{dividend}} in two parts, theoretical and practical ones. The theoretical part concentrates on course of childbirth, role of midwives during childbirth, communication in pregnancy and during childbirth, enema both the historical overview, {{but also on the}} views of women and experts on the cleansing enema in the first birth giving period and the role of midwives during antenatal preparation. An enema in the first birth giving period {{is one of the most}} common methods of antenatal preparation. Earlier it was a routine matter, today it is a free choice of every woman. Even though, we meet with different views of the cleansing enema in the first birth giving period. The first aim of the research investigation was to ascertain opinions and experiences of women with enema. Based on this aim was chosen research question: What kind of opinion and experiments do the women have with the administration of an enema? The second aim was to ascertain, why some women refuse enema before childbirth and what is led to this decision. The established research question to this aim sounds: Why are the women averse to an enema? The third aim was to ascertain access nursing staff to enema submission. The established research question to this aim sounds: What do nursing staff think about enema in the first birth giving period? So as to reach these aims, the qualitative research investigation in the form of depth interviews of own design, was adopted. The research sample was made up by ten women in puerperium, who gave birth in The Maternity Unit of the Hospital in České Budějovice and ten midwives from delivery room of the Hospital in České Budějovice. The data collected from the interviews were processed via the quantitative analysis. During the research investigation it was ascertained, that only one woman in puerperium, at the first birth, a cleansing enema refused, because the concept of an enema did not know. The second birth already took place after the cleansing enema submission. Another interviewee woman in puerperium states, that the application itself enema and the subsequent emptying was far worse than whole childbirth. Others the interviewee women in puerperium got a cleansing enema as part of the antenatal preparation. They state, that cleansing enema before the childbirth the first birth giving period shortens and combined with hot showers relieves pain. After application of cleansing enema will reduce the afraid and shame associated with leakage of stool in the delivery box and they are able to cooperate with the obstetric staff. For women in puerperium is embarrassing ?push out buttocks? to the midwife and the introduction of a rectal tube into the rectum. The application itself is not embarrassing. The midwives state that a cleansing enema before childbirth is not throw-back, but effective method, that helps to the client, but also whole obstetric staff. It was ascertained that the cleansing enema before childbirth warms the abdominal cavity, relief of pain, especially in combination with warm shower and regular contractions. Properly emptied colon is to prevent leakage of stool when pushing, frees up space for better entry of the fetal head to the pelvic entrance and childbirth so progresses better and thus faster. The advantage of enema for child is clearly preventing infection. The interviewee women in puerperium state that an important responsibility in the application of cleansing enema is communication with <b>client</b> and respect <b>intimacy.</b> The results of this research investigation could be used as the source of information and study material for future students of the branch Midwife. Furthermore, it can be used as education material for midwives, who work in the delivery rooms and for expectant mothers...|$|R
