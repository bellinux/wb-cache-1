40|$|Eco-driving has the {{potential}} to reduce fuel consumption and therefore emissions considerably. Previous research suggests that drivers have a certain level of eco-driving knowledge and skills, which they refrain from practising in their everyday lives. At the same time misconceptions and ambiguous messages from eco-driving support systems can confuse and demotivate. This research aimed to identify the mental models of eco-driving that regular drivers have. A driving simulator experiment with a varied road layout comprising urban and motorway sections was designed. The study used simple driving task instructions to investigate changes in the participants’ behaviour and thoughts in three conditions. Sixteen drivers were asked to ‘Drive normally’, ‘Drive safely’ or ‘Drive fuel-efficiently’. Behavioural measures, think aloud protocols and interviews were compared and analysed. The emphasis of this study was on eco-driving relevant indicators such as accelerating, braking, coasting and car-following. The results show that the participants do have mental models of eco-driving, which they did not use in the Baseline drive, when they were instructed to ‘Drive normally’. Misconceptions about speed and travel time provide {{the potential}} for more effective <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> about the momentary efficient speed as well as resulting time losses and fuel savings. In addition, in-vehicle guidance can increase driving safety compared to practicing eco-driving without them...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and {{autonomous}} driving capabilities {{have become increasingly}} widespread, and implementations already exist in cars today. Given these dramatic technological changes, human-machine interaction design is facing new challenges. One of the major challenges is the <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> as {{there is often a}} disparity between how the system behaves and the driver’s expectations. Another difficulty is that drivers may over-rely on the automation systems, and this reduces situation awareness, which in turn creates problems in reclaiming control when necessary. Furthermore, ADAS developments are traditionally based on drivers’ requirements from mature markets, such as Europe, the US and Japan. But how would ADAS perform in China, where there is dense and mixed traffic? The aim of this thesis is to gain better insights into cross-regional adaptive design on advisory traffic information systems. The purpose of advisory systems is to provide foresight traffic information to support the driver’s situation awareness. To fulfill the aim, the studies have departed from a user-centered design approach in order to understand what drivers really want. In addition, different traffic scenarios were integrated into the design procedure to identify the contextual design constraints. Two design requirements studies and two driving simulator studies have been carried out with both Swedish and Chinese drivers. The information requirement studies in this thesis showed that the similarities between Swedish and Chinese participants are greater than the differences. For example, they have similar design preferences and information requirements when interacting with a single road user. However, interesting differences were found when multiple road users were involved in the situation, e. g., when entering ramps, cutting in or changing lanes. The driving performance results indicated that advisory traffic information systems assisted Swedish and Chinese participants in different ways due to the different regional driving strategies and habits. Moreover, acceptance results also emphasized that an interface design entirely carried out in one region will likely result in lower user acceptance in another region. To conclude, cross-regional adaptive designs should focus on specific situations where the regional difference occurs, making it a feasible approach to a successful global design...|$|E

Once connected, the mobile client at the vehicle sends up to 20 location updates (probed from the GPS sensor) every 30 seconds to the Gateway.

Because all participants can be made aware of each other’s location (in fact, it could also be other context information about the truck or its environment), it is possible to react immediately to any abnormal situation and perhaps initiate a <b>communication</b> session <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers.</b> For example, one could ask a driver why he/she has stopped or is traveling at low speed, thereby receiving information about a traffic jam or an accident, allowing other drivers to choose a different route.|$|R
50|$|In September 2014 {{introduction}} of the FUTÁR information system was completed. It allows the traffic control center to continuously monitor all public transport buses and carriages of the city by having installed GPS in each of them, and it makes <b>communication</b> possible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> concerned, e.g. <b>with</b> all drivers of a specific line, or of all lines affected by an accident on their common route. FUTÁR also provides information to passengers: 263 digital boards were installed to high-traffic bus and tram stops. These boards show the approximate time that remains until the next buses and carriages of the different lines arrive to the stop. The central computer system calculates the time remaining until the buses and carriages reach the stops. The boards also inform passengers about temporary route modifications and other special circumstances. The {{information provided by the}} boards can also be accessed via internet, a smartphone application is also available to do this. In September 2014 the MOL Bubi bicycle hire system was opened for public use. It consists of 76 stations in the inner part of the city, which serve 1100 bicycles.|$|R
40|$|People with {{cognitive}} functional limitations (CFLs) have rarely {{been the focus}} of research dealing with road users and their needs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to describe how people with CFL post-stroke manage in their use of buses in the framework of their outdoor mobility, and to find out what difficulties, but also what opportunities, they experienced when moving from origin to destination using buses in public transport. Semi-structured interviews combined with participant observations during bus trips with eight persons were performed. Several barriers that have the potential to restrict autonomous outdoor mobility were identified. These barriers were not only represented by well-known infrastructure problems (high pavement curbs, etc.) or ergonomic shortcomings in the buses but, even more so, by specific issues relevant for persons with CFL, e. g. having to cross a road on their way to the bus stop, which poses problems of interaction with fast-moving car traffic. Obtaining all the necessary information prior to and during the trip is difficult and produces insecurity. Often, <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bus <b>drivers,</b> not least in connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> search for information, causes extra stress. Lack of self-confidence and feelings of inferiority add to these problems. Measures to control vehicle speeds, to optimise the communication style of bus drivers with their customers, and to improve customers 2 ̆ 7 access to information are recommended. Training measures to reassure persons with CFL in connection with their use of the public space are suggested...|$|R
50|$|Line 1 was allotted 64 coaches. Fourteen trains (of four cars) are {{in service}} during rush hour, and {{seven or eight}} in non-peak hours. All coaches are {{air-conditioned}} and have humidity control, and designed to reduce noise and vibration. Each coach is approximately 2.9 m wide and has 48 seats. A coach has a capacity of 375 passengers, and a single four car train has a total capacity of 1500 passengers. The coach body is made of lightweight stainless steel, with fire resistant metal doors. Coaches have metallic silver colour exteriors, and can be covered with vinyl sheets to display advertisements. The interior features anti-skid floors, and longitudinal seats with dedicated space to accommodate wheelchairs. Trains on Line 1 are fitted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> VTS Firetide 7010 video transmission system. Coaches are also fitted with LED displays showing dynamic route map, and LCD TVs for entertainment, information and advertising. Windows in coaches are made of double glazed laminated glass to shut out noise. Each coach has 8 externally hung, sliding bi-parting doors except the pilot cabin which has only 2. Doors are broad to enable wheelchair access. The maximum gap between the station platform and the doors is 85 mm. Trains are outfitted {{with a number of}} features for safety and convenience, including 3D route maps, first-aid kits, fire-fighting equipment and intercom systems permitting <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> train <b>driver.</b> Each coach contains a black box to assist in accident investigations.|$|R
40|$|The Paris metro network {{operated}} by RATP is well-known {{all over the}} world for its complexity and high level of efficiency. Since most of its equipment dates back from the 1970 ’s, it is undergoing an important modernisation plan, among which the renewal of all the equipment involved in traffic control, both on the lines and in terminals, within the Operational Control Centres (PCC). This new PCC system has now been implemented on lines 13 and 3, and although the operators of those lines are generally pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> technical features of the new PCC, they remain somewhat doubtful regarding its efficiency on automatic traffic regulation. The objective of this project was to detect if indeed those mixed feelings were founded by studying the specifications of the new system as well as its impact on operations through an analysis of the operational data. Although it was not a primary objective of the PCC project, it is hoped that this new system can help improve traffic regulation performance, and through this the overall quality of passenger service which is very much related to how regular the traffic of a metro line is. Public transport in Ile-de-France is governed by the public authority STIF. Every four years, a new contract is signed between STIF and RATP regarding operations in the metro network. This contract defines the total number of kilometres that need to be produced {{every day of the year}} on each line, but it also sets quality indicators among which two are directly related to traffic regularity: passenger waiting time and production during peak hours, the latter having been introduced in 2008. Production and quality of service are rewarded or penalized financially. RATP therefore has strong incentives to both produce the contractual number of train*kilometres, but also to ensure a regular traffic on their line. In order to operate the lines according to those contracts, theoretical timetables are built according to a number of constraints such as headways to be implemented, running times, dwell times, buffer times at terminals. Although those timetables are never communicated to the passengers who are only given the maximum waiting time depending on the time of day, they are the basis of operations in the metro lines. In reality, it is almost impossible for the metro lines to respect those theoretical timetables because of all the incidents, but also because it is very difficult to predict the time needed to be spent at stations. <b>With</b> more passengers, <b>the</b> trains needs to stay longer in stations, thus creating additional delay on the whole line. The later a train is, and thus the more space there is between it and the previous train, the more passengers will be waiting for it, and the more time it will have to stay in the stations. The traffic on a metro line as busy as the ones in the Paris metro network are therefore highly unstable and a single incident can completely disrupt the traffic on the whole line for a very long time. This is especially true of lines where trains are running very close to each other (down to 95 s at peak hours on line 13). Because of this, it is very important to implement the appropriate regulation strategies. At RATP, the main objective of the regulation actions is to maintain a regular interval between trains at departure and on the lines while still trying to recover from delay in terminals. Before the new PCC system was implemented, traffic on the line was overseen by the traffic controllers who were all located in the Bourdon building and used button-control panels, while departures from terminals was overseen by the departure chief in the terminals. In the new system, not only have the equipment been renewed, operations on the line have also been re-organised and the regulation strategies are now the responsibility of the computerized system. Traffic regulation on the line is still the responsibility of the traffic controller, but he is now located at the decentralised PCC, closer to <b>the</b> lines. <b>With</b> him are also the two terminal managers who now oversee all train movements in their terminals from the PCC. As for the calculation of departure times, whereas it was before the role of the departure chief, it is now the computer that calculates them according to the general decision made by the terminal manager who can choose between a no-regulation mode, a constant headway mode and a recovery mode. The latter is based on the former strategy that consisted in distributing the delay among trains in order to ensure regular departures in the line when there was a disruptive train causing delay at departure, and headway reduction in order to recover from the delay when the disruption has disappeared. When it is not possible anymore to recover from delay with those recalculation methods, namely because the accumulated delay is too important, the last resort of the terminal manager is to cancel some departures, thus leading to the so-called “lost laps for schedule compensation”. After studying the specifications of the algorithm for the calculation of departure times, it was concluded that they were in line with RATP’s requirements. However, those requirements date back from almost ten years ago, and the needs of the line operators have evolved ever since then, especially <b>with</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the “production during peak hours” criteria, which might already explain the mixed feelings of the operator regarding the system’s regulation functions. Although the operators are not completely satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> system’s performance, it needs to be stressed out that they are overall quite happy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new equipment. Furthermore, the new organisation ensures a much better communication between the various actors of traffic regulation which is much appreciated. However, traffic controller do feel a loss at being now separated from the other lines, and the terminal managers at being separated from their terminals for they do not have direct <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> anymore. As for the actual impacts of the system on operations, it was possible to conduct a performance evaluation using the operational data provided by the IGT and OSIRIS software, specifically developed for RATP. Among the various methods that were considered for this data analysis, the most efficient one was to assess the number of lost laps for schedule compensation as opposed to the number of incidents, or to the total delay on the line per day. Indeed, on days <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same amount of delay, more cancelled departures mean that the system is not able to recover from delay alone, and is therefore less efficient. Various periods before and after the implementation of the new system were thus compared. The first conclusion of this study was overall that the situation on the lines had not particularly been improved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the new system, neither had it worsened. Although this conclusion is already quite satisfactory, as it was never an objective to improve the operational results of the lines, it still needs to be taken into context. Indeed, the operational environment of the lines nowadays are very different from what they were even 5 years ago for the passenger flows and the number of scheduled trains have increased, and other modernisation project have been or are being implemented at this time. It is very likely that the old system would not have been capable of handling those changes, and would not have had as good operational results as <b>the</b> ones observed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new system. Unfortunately, this is only a guess that can never truly be verified. It was also observed on both lines 13 and 3 than the implementation of the new system was always followed by very difficult periods for the operators and that problems regarding parameterization had occurred quite often, especially on line 3. A simple model of the calculation of the algorithm on line 3 was thus built in order to try and study the impact of parameter changes. The outcome of this study was not only that a more precise calibration of parameters was necessary to improve the efficiency of the system, but also that the main calculation of the algorithm could very well be modified in order to better fit the evolving needs of the lines. A first recommendation for the improvement of the system is therefore to conduct a more extended study on this option. Furthermore, the specific characteristics of the lines and the evolving needs and structures should be better taken into account. Finally, another improvement could come from a better training and support of the operator who, as it is, does not have a good enough level of understanding of the system, which leads to misinterpretations and misuse on his part.
