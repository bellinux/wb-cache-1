40|$|Beginning in 1993, Florida’s citrus {{industry}} has been invaded by citrus leafminer (Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton, Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), brown citrus aphid (Toxoptera citricida Kirkaldy, Homoptera: Aphididae), and the Asian <b>citrus</b> <b>psylla</b> (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, Homoptera: Psyllidae). The source(s) of these pests remain unknown but {{other countries in the}} Caribbean, as well as Central and South America, also have suffered invasions by these pests. Brown citrus aphid and Asian <b>citrus</b> <b>psylla</b> are vectors of serious citrus diseases (citrus tristeza virus and greening disease, respectively), while citrus leafminer damage provides openings for invasion of the citrus canker pathogen into the foliage. All three pests were considered suitable candidates for classical biological control. Dr. Ru Nguyen (Division of Plant Industry, Gainesville, Florida) and I have collaborated on importing, evaluating, rearing and releasing parasitoids for each pest into Florida’s 860, 000 acres of citrus between 1993 and the present. Two parasitoids (Ageniaspis citricola Logvinovskaya, Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae and Cirrospilus quadristriatus, which was subsequently determined to be C. ingenuus Gahan, Hymenoptera...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{efficacy}} of different insecticides against <b>citrus</b> <b>psylla,</b> Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) were carried out at Agricultural Research Institute, Tarnab, Peshawar, Pakistan. Six insecticides viz. Actara 25 WG, (thiamethoxam) Cascade 10 DC (Flufenoxuron), Match 050 EC (lufenuron), Thiodan 35 EC (endosulfan), Karate 2. 5 EC (α-cyhalothrin), and Supracide 40 EC (methidathion), were tested for their effectiveness against D. citri. After first spray overall mean population of D. citri was 3. 63, 4. 75, 5. 59, 6. 66, 7. 47, 8. 11 per six inches tender shoot on Actara 25 WG, Cascade 10 DC, Match 050 EC, Thiodan 35 EC, Karate 2. 5 EC and Supracide 40 EC treated plants respectively, while on control plants the population was 12. 39. Similarly, after the second spray {{of each of the}} same insecticides the population of D. citri was 2. 65, 4. 23, 5. 61, 6. 41, 7. 35 and 8. 73 respectively. Where in controls there were 15. 18 psyllids. Percent decrease of D. citri population in comparison to control after the first spray was highest in Actara 25 WG (72. 20) followed by Cascade 10 DC (62. 91), Match 050 EC (54. 07), Thiodan 35 EC (47. 61), Karate 2. 5 EC (38. 94) and Supracide 40 EC (35. 74). After the second spray percent decrease over control recorded was highest in Actara 25 WG (83. 54), followed by Cascade 10 DC (71. 08), Match 050 EC (63. 94), Thiodan 35 EC (60. 79), Karate 2. 5 EC (52. 52) and Supracide 40 EC (45. 62) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{colour vision}} of adult <b>citrus</b> <b>psylla,</b> Trioza erytreae, was {{investigated}} in the laboratory using the behavioural parameters: alightment and walking. Light green flushing leaves (under which the nymphs develop) were significantly preferred, visually, to dark green mature leaves for alightment. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy showed (when expressed in the parameters of human colour vision) that flush has a very slightly longer dominant wavelength, and roughly double the reflectance and purity. Alightrnent frequency correlated almost equally well with "purity" (as noted by Moericke, 1952 et seq., in "yellow-sensitive" aphids) as with the aphidological colour parameter "long/short ratio" developed by Kennedy et al. (1961). Elucidation of the mechanism underlying the citrus psylla's alightment colour preference was initially attempted with a printed spectrum and several paint series of measured spectral characteristics. It was clear that T. erytreae belongs to the "yellow-sensitive" group of Homoptera, {{but it was impossible}} to distinguish which pararneter(s) of colour the psyllids were responding to. Phototactic (walking) response to the individual parameters of colour was therefore measured using a monochromator. The phototactic action spectrum (against wavelength) was tri-modal, with peaks in the yellow-green (YG), blue (B), and ultra= violet (UV). Rate of phototaxis was not influenced by bandwidth (roughly equivalent to purity), but was proportional to intensity (roughly equivalent to reflectance). To investigate the influence of the above three wavelength regions on alightment, use was made of a very simple flight chamber incorporating a target of coloured light. Yellow-green and UV light both independently stimulated alightment. Their effect was additive. Different thresholds indicated distinct YG and UV receptor systems. Blue light alone did not stimulate alightment, and was strongly alightment-inhibitory in combination both with YG and with UV light. On the basis of the above physiological/behavioural findings, a new alightment formula was drawn up for describing the hamopteran's apparent manner of alightment determining integration of surface reflectance. The flush preference and alightment distributions on the series of artificial surfaces were found to correlate slightly more accurately, on average, as well as more consistently, with the new formula than with previously-available colour parameters. These findings are placed in perspective to the literature, and their possible economic relevance is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (DSc (Zoology)) [...] PU for CHE, 1970. A {{comparatively}} new virus-like disease called greening {{has become}} a very serious threat in many citrus producing countries of the world. The disease is transmitted by two insect vectors belonging to the Psyllidae (Homoptera) namely, Trioza erytreae (Del Geurcio), the African vector, and Diaphorina citri Kuw., the Oriental vector. Field studies were made on the ecology, biology and control of T. erytreae in the northern Transvaal and in Swaziland during 1965 - 1970. This vector is extremely fecund but has weak powers of dispersal. The main ecological factors found to regulate populations of this insect were the flushing rhythm and flush quality of citrus, extremes of weather, and natural enemies. Other factors involved included interspecific competition with citrus aphids, and in some seasons intraspecific competition for breeding sites. Fundamentally flushing rhythm determines the potential population density of the vector, while the occurrence and sequence of lethal weather extremes mainly regulate the population size during citrus growth periods. A weather index was found to explain the pest status of the vector in southern Africa and partly accounts for previous outbreaks of vector and disease. A population model is given which explains the seasonal abundance of the insect. Studies were also made on the general biology including sex ratio, egg laying, mating behaviour, {{and the influence of}} temperature on the duration of the immature stages. The greening disease represents a severe limiting factor to citrus production in the high lying regions of the eastern Transvaal and Swaziland. The hotter lowveld areas are virtually free of disease symptoms and vector populations though present are usually low. Transmission studies showed that the T. erytreae is the principal vector, several other psyllid species feeding on citrus were not found to be transmitters. It appears that a fairly small proportion of field adults are infective {{and that there is a}} seasonal fluctuation in transmission efficiency. Single males and females were able to transmit the disease. Unsuccessful attempts were made to screen adults for infectivity using a chromatographic method, and to isolate the causal organism from excised salivary glands. The control of T. erytreae depends an the use of insecticides. Experiments to select a suitable material and to determine it’s correct time of application are described. A spray programme for the control of <b>citrus</b> <b>psylla</b> has been used with apparent success by farmers in the Malkerns district of Swaziland. Comparative field observations and surveys for both Asian greening disease and the Oriental vector are described, and the world distribution of greening and of the two psyllid vectors are given.
