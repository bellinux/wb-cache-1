Renowned masters like Telemann and Rameau were actively engaged {{in the development of a}} clavecins oculaire. The invention of the gas light in the nineteenth century created new technical possibilities for the color organ. In England between 1869 and 1873, the inventor Frederick Kastner developed an organ that he named a Pyrophone. The British inventor Alexander Rimington, a professor in fine arts in London, documented the phrase ‘Colour-Organ’ for the first time in a patent application in 1893. Inspired by Newton’s idea that music and color are both grounded in vibrations, he divided the color spectrum into intervals analogous to musical octaves and attributed colors to notes. The same notes in a higher octave produced the same <b>color</b> <b>tone</b> but then in a lighter value (Peacock 1988). Around the turn of the century, concerts with light and musical instruments were given quite regularly. As most technical problems had been conquered, the psychological questions concerning the effects of these performances came to the fore. The Russian composer Alexander Scriabin was particularly interested in the psychological effects on the audience when they experienced sound and color simultaneously. His theory was that when the correct color was perceived with the correct sound, ‘a powerful psychological resonator for the listener’ would be created. His most famous synesthetic work, which is still performed today, is Prometheus, Poem of Fire. On the score of Prometheus, he wrote next to the instruments separate parts for the tastiere per luce, the color organ (Campen 2007, Galeyev 2001, Gleich 1963).|$|E
500|$|Establishing the characters' {{background}} {{rather than}} prettiness {{was the main}} goal of costumes. Ben wore the same clothes in both seasons, and {{to make them look}} identical, around twenty multiples of his coveralls were made by hand. It took over six weeks to apply all stitches, patches and the roughly fifty holes, plus the aging process. Brother Justin's clothes were made period-correct from the beginning, but the character's foreboding presence was enhanced by fitting his frock on the waist and making the shoulders look bigger than usual for that time period. Sofie's clothes had a strong Bohemian Eastern influence to portray her mother's origin and sensibilities. Stumpy's wardrobe consisted of baggy pants and an Italian bowler hat that gave him a 1920s look instead of the 1930s, showing his clothes were second-hand. The stripper clothes of Rita Sue and Libby were influenced by Mae West, harlot movies and silent films of the 1920s and 1930s, with additional research put into Asian harlots, Latin dancers and Hawaiian dancers. The costume designers chose the costumes of the Daily Brothers Show, a rival carnival, to have a new <b>color</b> <b>tone</b> to set them apart from the Carnivàle. The dress of Sabina the Scorpion Lady underwent several die-bleaching cycles to achieve a red-orange-purple color that would work well when filming outside. Bert/Bertha's costume was made in a hurry from a vintage tuxedo and an old feathered dress, which helped to give it a [...] "made-it-on-the-road" [...] feeling.|$|E

A psychological experiment is conducted in this study to investigate visual comfort related to commercial and residential buildings. Visual observations are performed on the tones of an urban colorscape during hazy weather and air pollution in Harbin, China. Fifty-eight color samples selected through an orthogonal method are evaluated through a Likert scale by 30 subjects in a laboratory setting. Statistical analysis is performed with the maximal information coefficient and R language. Experimental {{results show that the}} changing threshold values of <b>color</b> <b>tones</b> are related to the visual comfort levels of the subjects. The influence of the three factors of <b>color</b> <b>tones</b> on visual comfort level is relatively independent, and the effects of value and chroma contrast on color comfort level are greater than that of hue contrast in hazy weather. Furthermore, the comfort recognition threshold values of <b>color</b> <b>tones</b> in hazy weather are determined through data comparisons and analyses...|$|R

40|$|Fashion {{designers}} conceive color composition as {{an ensemble}} of tones, shades and tints that often resemble an abstract or natural theme. <b>Color</b> and <b>tone</b> adjustments {{are among the}} most frequent fabric design operations. <b>Color</b> and <b>tone</b> style adjustments are part of a generic process of cognition involved in the creation of new fabric designs. A challenging problem in this process is given a s et of natural images associated with a subject or a theme, the problem is to discover the underlying cognitive relationships that connect textures and <b>color</b> <b>tones</b> that are perceived by an observer or in our case, a fabric designer. These relationships culminate in optimal combinations of <b>colors</b> and <b>tones</b> that resemble the original theme in which a template of colors is defined with respect to an associated verbal description. We formulate the fabric design process as a cognitive process that simultaneously considers multiple <b>color</b> <b>tones</b> to form a desired theme as well as texture characteristics in the fabric. In this paper, we incorporate color assembly and texture knowledge in the fabric design process in order to automatically produce the color combinations learnt from a given natural or abstract theme. We demonstrate that the use of color theme associations can automatically generate new fabric designs that rival complex commercial designs that are otherwise difficult to generate even by experienced designers. Preliminary experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method. Institute of Textiles and ClothingDepartment of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R

It also had a Color Integrity feature that allowed users keeping an image's <b>color</b> <b>tone</b> during HDR PhotoStudio image editing operations — for example changing the contrast of an image would not change image's chromatic (<b>color</b> <b>tone)</b> data.

40|$|<b>Color</b> and <b>tone</b> {{adjustments}} {{are among}} the most frequent image enhancement operations.
