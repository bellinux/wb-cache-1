50|$|At the beginning, {{it was a}} {{handmade}} production, then {{it became}} gradually mechanized and was managed by an all female staff. The first machinery was introduced in 1930 and, since that moment, the amount produced has been increasing. Subsequently, the company began a packaging process for shipping to the recipient countries.In 1961, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. started to produce bottled mineral water and other beverages in the new San Pellegrino Terme factory.In 1932, the Aranciata orangeade variant was introduced. Containing S.Pellegrino as its primary ingredient, the soda added concentrated orange juice. Today, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. also produces various other flavors of carbonated beverages: Limonata (lemonade), Sanbittèr (bitters), Pompelmo (grapefruit), Aranciata Rossa (blood orange), and Chinò (<b>chinotto).</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{for the first}} time some physical quality attributes of unripe Citrus x myrtifolia Rafinesque which is the ingredient of the popular soft drink <b>Chinotto.</b> Samples for analysis were processed to better reproduce the crude materials used for industrial <b>chinotto</b> extract, discarding part of the juice. Fruit bioactive compounds such as ascorbic acid, carotenoids, chlorophylls, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity were estimated. An important nutritional aspect arose from the data presented was the high concentration of flavonoids (780 mg/ 100 g FW) and vitamin C (42 mg/ 100 g FW). A good antioxidant capacity (5872 µM Trolox equivalents/ 100 g FW) was estimated by oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). This matrix could be considered as a good nutraceutical source, giving new opportunity to citrus industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of tyramine and its methylated derivatives, N-methyltyramine and N,N-dimethyltyramine, {{was investigated in}} tissue parts (leaves and fruits) of several plants of Citrus genus by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). In {{the course of our}} study we discovered the occurrence of N,N,N- trimethyltyramine in all citrus plants examined. This quaternary ammonium compound, known to act in animals as a neurotoxin, was recognized and characterized by mass spectrometric analysis. The substance, never described before in the Citrus genus, is also known as candicine or maltoxin. Results indicate that N,N,N-trimethyltyramine is consistently expressed in leaves of clementine, bitter orange, and lemon. Conversely, low levels were found in the leaves of orange, mandarin, <b>chinotto</b> (Citrus myrtifolia), bergamot, citron, and pomelo. In the edible part of the fruits, N,N,N-trimethyltyramine was found at trace levels. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Mal secco disease (MSD) is {{a severe}} tracheomycotic disease of citrus {{caused by the}} mitosporic fungus Phoma tracheiphila. Besides lemon, the most {{sensitive}} species, MSD also affects other citrus species, such as citron, lime, bergamot, <b>chinotto,</b> sour orange, rough lemon or volkamer lemon. When the infection is through rootlets of a susceptible species, more frequently in the nursery but also in bearing plants in the grove, the pathogen may be restricted {{for many years to}} the inner layers of wood, leading to a form of the disease known as ‘mal nero’, a syndrome characterized by blackish discoloration of the hard wood and by the absence of almost any external symptom. Eventually, after several years, the pathogen reaches the sapwood, causing a sudden collapse of the canopy, even on resistant scions. Host resistance remains the most desirable goal among the measures to control MSD, and the search for new resistant rootstocks to replace the susceptible ones, has long been pursued by Italian researchers. This paper reviews the conclusive data collected over almost three decades of research, conducted both in the field and in a controlled environment, on the behaviour of putative lemon rootstocks towards MSD. The rootstocks tested include: alemow, sour orange (‘S. Marina’ and undetermined selections), ‘Ichang’ lemon, ‘Yuzu’ orange, ‘Nansho Daidai’ sour orange, ‘Siamelo’, ‘Yuma’ citrange, ‘Sacaton’, ‘Swingle 4475 ’, and ‘Swingle FF 9 ’ citrumelos, and the hybrids ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin × Poncirus, and ‘Christian’ Poncirus × ‘Cleopatra’ mandari...|$|E
