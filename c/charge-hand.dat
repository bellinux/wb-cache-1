5000|$|He {{was born}} in London. His father was a <b>charge-hand</b> at Francis & White's [...] "Roman Cement" [...] plant in Nine Elms. He himself worked there as a {{labourer}} from age 16 while studying chemistry. In 1833 he became manager of John Bazeley White's cement plant at Swanscombe on the Thames Estuary which {{at that time was}} producing [...] "Artificial Cement" [...] and [...] "Roman Cement". Joseph Aspdin's product was successful but very expensive,and was later improved independently by his son William. Johnson set to work trying to discover its composition but because Aspdin's product was protected by explicit patents and extreme secrecy it was impossible to market a copy. After nearly two years' work, he succeeded and started marketing his own considerably improved version. Johnson, a highly moral man, Mayor of Gateshead and a JP, was able to claim that he was the inventor of [...] "true" [...] Portland cement and is generally recognised as such. See the link for Johnson's account of this work.|$|E
