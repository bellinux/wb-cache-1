In fact, such imperfections evolve subnanometer (angstrom-scaled) low-electron-density spaces stretching far below characteristic sizes of a few bond lengths, a level which is beyond measuring possibilities for many direct experimental structural probes (such as optical or electron microscopy). In application to semiconductors, this method allows useful identification of intrinsic-free volumes owing to simple models considering competitive channels of positron trapping from delocalized defect-free bulk states, deep ground states of positron traps (extended free-volume defects), and pick-off decaying of bounded positron-electron (positronium Ps) states [1, 2].

40|$|International audienceThe {{electrical}} properties of (1 -x) Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 -xPbTiO 3 films with composition in the morphotropic phase boundary region around x= 0. 35, submicron thickness and columnar microstructure, prepared on Si based substrates by chemical solution deposition are presented and discussed {{in relation to}} the properties of coarse and fine grained ceramics. The films show relaxor characteristics that are proposed to result from a grain size effect on the kinetics of the relaxor to ferroelectric transition. The transition is slowed down for grain sizes in the submicron range, and as a consequence intermediate polar domain configurations with typical length scales in the submicron- and nanoscales are stabilised. A high saturation polarisation can be attained under field, but fast polarisation relaxation occurs after its removal, and negligible remnant values are obtained. At the same time, they also show spontaneous piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity. Self polarisation is thus present, which indicates the existence of an internal electric field that is most probably a substrate effect. Films would be then in a phase instability, at an intermediate state between the relaxor and ferroelectric ones, and under a bias electric field, which would explain the very high spontaneous pyroelectric response found. 1 1. Introduction Piezoelectric, ferroelectric films are being integrated in Si-based microelectromechanical systems to implement sensing and actuation [1], and are also considered for nanoelectromechanical systems [2]. The material most often used is perovskite P(Zr, Ti) O 3 (PZT) around the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), which has been the key to commercial high sensitivity piezoelectric ceramics; a mature and ubiquitous technology [3]. The MPB is a region in the phase diagram that separates ferroelectric rhombohedral and tetragonal polymorphs, and in which the single crystal piezoelectric coefficients are very high thanks to a mechanism of polarisation rotation [4]. Also, ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain wall motion significantly contributes to the piezoelectric response [5]. The highest d 33 coefficients are provided by soft PZT, for which values of ∼ 600 pC N - 1 are achieved by enhancing wall mobility through compositional modification [6]. However, domain wall motion is limited in films, and negligible in thin layers with submicron range thickness because of substrate clamping [7]. This has shifted interest to alternative MPB materials with higher crystal piezoelectric coefficients than PZT, among which relaxor based Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 -PbTiO 3 (PMN-PT) stands out. PMN-PT single crystals with composition at the rhombohedral side of the MPB region; (1 -x) PMN-xPT with 0. 3 ≤x direction [8], and textured 0. 675 PMN- 0. 325 PT ceramics have already been processed with coefficients above 1500 pC N - 1 [9]. In the case of conventional ceramics, 0. 65 PMN- 0. 35 PT shows piezoelectric coefficients comparable with those of soft PZT with significantly less domain wall contribution [10, 11]. However, films do not show such good electromechanical properties. The best results have been reported for epitaxial 0. 67 PMN- 0. 33 PT films on (001) SrRuO 3 /SrTiO 3 substrates with a thickness of 3. 3 µm, which show only a d 33 of 250 pC N - 1 [12]. On Si substrates, a coefficient of ∼ 180 pC N - 1 has been reported for oriented 2 columnar 0. 7 PMN- 0. 3 PT films with a thickness of 1. 5 µm [13], which was even lower when thickness decreased to the submicron range [14]. Although low, the coefficients obtained were higher for oriented films than for similarly prepared oriented layers, which indicates that the mechanism of polarisation rotation is still active to some extent in the films. Therefore, it is worth carrying out further work to understand the mechanisms that reduce the piezoelectric activity of this promising material in thin film form. We present here a study of the properties of columnar MPB PMN-PT thin films with submicron thickness, and discuss them by taking into account grain size effects; recently reported down to the nanoscale in ceramics [15, 16], {{and the role of the}} film/substrate interface. It is intended to shed light onto the mechanisms responsible of the distinctive features shown by this type of film. 2. Experimental Thin films were prepared by chemical solution deposition (CSD). A diol-based sol-gel procedure was used to synthesise the precursor solutions [17]. Around 0. 3 M diluted solutions were deposited on Pt/TiO 2 /Si substrates by spin coating. Crystallisation was carried out by rapid thermal annealing in O 2. A temperature of 650 ºC, a time of 6 s and a heating rate of 200 ºC s - 1 were chosen; conditions that allow perovskite single phase layers of (1 -x) PMN-xPT with 0. 3 ≤x≤ 0. 4 to be obtained according to X-ray diffraction data. Deposition and crystallisation were repeated 4 times to obtain films with a thickness of ∼ 0. 25 µm. A columnar microstructure results with typical diameters of 0. 2 - 0. 4 µm. More details of the preparation and microstructure of the films can be found elsewhere [18]. The {{electrical properties}} were studied on an array of Pt top electrodes with a diameter of 350 µm that was deposited on the films by sputtering. 3 The temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity and losses was measured with a HP 4284 A Precision LCR meter at 9 frequencies between 100 Hz and 1 MHz. Measurements were dynamically carried out during heating at 1 K min - 1 from room temperature (RT) to 573 K. Room temperature ferroelectric hysteresis loops were measured with a modified Sawyer-Tower circuit and a Tektronix TDS 520 oscilloscope. A HP 8116 A pulse generator was used to apply voltage sinusoidal waves with an amplitude between 0. 5 and 12 V and a frequency of 200 Hz. The longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient was measured by optical interferometry. The system developed at National Physical Laboratory makes use of common path optics to isolate environmental noise [19]. Displacements in the subpicometer range are measured through the use of lock-in techniques under applied voltage sine waves with amplitudes between 0. 05 and 0. 20 V at frequencies between 5 and 20 kHz. Local piezoelectric measurements were carried out with a commercial scanning force microscope (Nanotec® with WSxM® software; Nanotec Electrónica) in which piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has been implemented. In this work we have used conductive commercial Pt/Ir coated tips (Nanosensors) on cantilevers with a force constant of 42 N/m and resonance frequency of 320 kHz, to apply an ac voltage of 1 V at 50 kHz. Finally, pyroelectricity was also characterised. Thermal triangular waves were applied and the pyroelectric currents were dynamically measured with a Keithley 6514 Electrometer. 3. Results and discussion The temperature dependences of the relative permittivity and dielectric losses for a 0. 65 PMN- 0. 35 PT thin film are shown in Figure 1 at several frequencies. Relaxor type behaviour is observed; permittivity is highly dispersive and decreases as frequency increases at temperatures 4 below a broad maximum, whose position shifts towards higher temperatures with frequency [20]. The relaxor character of the maximum in permittivity is further confirmed by the observation of its shift with composition across the solid solution, as expected and previously reported [18]. High temperature electrical conduction is responsible for the significant increase in dielectric losses above 400 K, and the presence of dispersion in the permittivity at temperatures above the maximum. This phenomenon has also been observed in PMN-PT films grown on LaNiO 3 /Si substrates by pulsed laser deposition, and associated with hopping of oxygen vacancies [21]. This behaviour is very different to that of <b>coarse</b> grained <b>ceramics</b> with the same composition, which is also shown in Figure 1 for a material with a grain size of 4 µm. A well defined dielectric anomaly, typical of a first order ferroelectric phase transition, is observed, with a transition temperature of 442 K. This transition is between a ferroelectric phase and a high temperature relaxor state, which have been reported to exist up to 0. 5 PMN- 0. 5 PT [22]. However, the behaviour of the PMN-PT films studied here is similar to that of a fine grained ceramic with a grain size of 0. 15 µm, also shown in the figure. In this case, relaxor type behaviour is observed. Results of bulk ceramics correspond to materials with high chemical homogeneity, processed from nanocrystalline powder synthesised by mechanochemical activation, and therefore, these differences cannot be attributed to compositional variations. Details of the processing can be found elsewhere [23]. A thorough study of these ceramics concluded that a grain size effect is associated with the mechanisms of development of ferroelectric long range order in relaxor based systems. When grains go down to the submicron range in size, approaching the nanoscale, the transition from the relaxor to the ferroelectric state is slowed down. As a consequence, intermediate submicron/nanometer sized crosshatched polar domains persist down to room temperature, and a relaxor-type electrical behaviour is observed [15]. This slowing down with the decrease in grain size has experimentally been observed for 0. 8 PMN- 0. 2 PT between 0. 36 and 0. 21 µm [16]. The lateral size of the columnar grains of the film with 0. 25 µm thickness is 0. 2 - 0. 4 5 µm, so it is reasonable to assume that the relaxor-type behaviour observed is similarly a consequence of the reduced grain size of films. Note that permittivity values for the thin film are smaller than those of the fine grained ceramic, in spite of the column size not being smaller in the former than the grain size in the latter. This is most probably an effect of the substrate/film interface that acts as a low dielectric permittivity layer in series with the|$|R
