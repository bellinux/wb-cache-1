5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (<b>cholestyramine</b> or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
25|$|Medications used to slow or stop diarrhea, such as loperamide, may worsen C. difficile {{disease and}} {{therefore}} are not recommended. <b>Cholestyramine,</b> an ion exchange resin, {{is effective in}} binding both toxin A and B, slowing bowel motility, and helping prevent dehydration. <b>Cholestyramine</b> is recommended with vancomycin. A last-resort treatment in those who are immunosuppressed is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).|$|E
25|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} such as <b>cholestyramine</b> can {{be effective}} in chronic diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as SeHCAT retention.|$|E
25|$|In {{people who}} have {{undergone}} gallbladder removal, the bile acid sequestrant <b>cholestyramine</b> may help minor degrees of FI. Bulking agents also absorb water, so may be helpful for those with diarrhea. A common side effect is bloating and flatulence. Topical agents to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used, such as topical antifungals when {{there is evidence of}} perianal candidiasis or occasionally mild topical anti-inflammatory medication. Prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing, moisturization, and use of a skin protectant.|$|E
500|$|The main toxic {{substance}} {{found in the}} parotoid gland and skin of the common toad is called bufotoxin. It was first isolated by Heinrich Wieland and his colleagues in 1922 and they succeeded in identifying its structure about 20 years later. [...] Meanwhile, other workers succeeded in isolating the same compound and its parent steroid bufotalin from the Japanese toad (Bufo japonicus). By 1986, researchers at the Arizona State University had succeeded in synthesizing the toad venom constituents bufotalin, bufalitoxin and bufotoxin. The chemical formula of bufotoxin is C40H60N4O10. Its physical effects resemble those of digitalis which in small doses increases the strength with which the heart muscle contracts and which {{is used in the}} treatment of congestive heart failure. The skin of one toad contains enough toxin to cause serious symptoms or even death in animals and man. Clinical effects include severe irritation and pain to eyes, mouth, nose and throat, cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms, paralysis and seizures, increased salivation, vomiting, hyperkalemia, cyanosis and hallucinations. There is no known anti-venom. Treatment consists of supporting respiratory and cardiovascular functions, prevention of absorption and electrocardiography to monitor the condition. Atropine, phenytoin, <b>cholestyramine</b> and lidocaine may prove useful in its management.|$|E
2500|$|Statins (or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are {{commonly}} used to treat hypercholesterolemia if diet is ineffective. Other agents {{that may be used}} include: fibrates, nicotinic acid, and <b>cholestyramine.</b> These, however, are only recommended if statins are not tolerated or in pregnant women. Statins can reduce total cholesterol by about 50% in the majority of people; [...] effects appear similar regardless of the statin used. While statins are effective in decreasing mortality in those who have had previous cardiovascular disease, debate exists over {{whether or not they are}} effective in those with high cholesterol but no other health problems. One review did not find a mortality benefit in those at high risk, but without prior cardiovascular disease. Other reviews concluded a mortality benefit does exist. Statins may improve quality of life when used in people without existing cardiovascular disease (i.e. for primary prevention). Statins decrease cholesterol in children with hypercholesterolemia, but no studies as of 2010 show improved clinical outcomes and diet is the mainstay of therapy in childhood. Injectable antibodies against the protein PCSK9 (evolocumab, bococizumab, alirocumab) can reduce LDL cholesterol and have been shown to reduce mortality.|$|E
50|$|Studies of {{a number}} of other agents {{including}} antidiarrheals, bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), mesalazine/mesalamine (alone or in combination with <b>cholestyramine),</b> systemic corticosteroids, <b>cholestyramine,</b> immunomodulators, and probiotics have shown to be less effective than budesonide for treating both forms of microscopic colitis.|$|E
50|$|Ion-exchange resins {{are used}} in the {{manufacturing}} of pharmaceuticals, not only for catalyzing certain reactions but also for isolating and purifying pharmaceutical active ingredients.Three ion-exchange resins, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, colestipol, and <b>cholestyramine,</b> are used as active ingredients. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a strongly acidic ion-exchange resin and is used to treat hyperkalemia. Colestipol is a weakly basic ion-exchange resin and is used to treat hypercholesterolemia. <b>Cholestyramine</b> is a strongly basic ion-exchange resin and is also used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Colestipol and <b>cholestyramine</b> are known as bile acid sequestrants.|$|E
50|$|Medications used to slow or stop diarrhea, such as loperamide, may worsen C. difficile {{disease and}} {{therefore}} are not recommended. <b>Cholestyramine,</b> an ion exchange resin, {{is effective in}} binding both toxin A and B, slowing bowel motility, and helping prevent dehydration. <b>Cholestyramine</b> is recommended with vancomycin. A last-resort treatment in those who are immunosuppressed is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).|$|E
50|$|<b>Cholestyramine</b> {{or other}} bile acid {{sequestrants}} will help reducing diarrhoea in bile acid malabsorption.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cholestyramine</b> {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of Clostridium difficile infections, in order to absorb toxins A and B.|$|E
5000|$|Drugs that {{interfere}} with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as <b>cholestyramine</b> may {{interfere with}} the absorption of paricalcitol.|$|E
5000|$|Additional {{cholesterol-lowering}} medications such as: fenofibrate (Tricor), gemfibrozil (Lopid), <b>cholestyramine</b> (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar), and niacin (nicotinic acid, Niacor, Niaspan); ...|$|E
5000|$|Activated charcoal, like <b>cholestyramine,</b> binds to {{protoporphyrin}} in the intestine {{and prevents}} its absorption. It is cheap and readily available. It {{seems to be}} effective in reducing circulating protoporphyrin levels.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{diarrhea}} in postcholecystectomy {{syndrome is}} a type of bile acid diarrhea (type 3). This can be treated with a bile acid sequestrant like <b>cholestyramine,</b> colestipol or colesevelam, which may be better tolerated.|$|E
50|$|Colesevelam can be {{used instead}} of <b>cholestyramine</b> in {{symptomatic}} chronic diarrhea due to bile salt malabsorption (bile acid diarrhea), {{which can be a}} primary condition, or secondary to Crohn's disease or the postcholecystectomy syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, another {{possibility}} is that the drug is retained in the intestinal lumen forming large complexes that impede its absorption. This can occur with <b>cholestyramine</b> if it is associated with sulfamethoxazol, thyroxine, warfarin or digoxin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cholestyramine</b> is an orally {{administered}} resin {{which reduces}} circulating levels of protoporphyrin by binding to protoporphyrin in the intestine and, hence, interrupting the enterohepatic circulation. It is usually used {{in combination with}} other treatment approaches.|$|E
50|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} such as <b>cholestyramine</b> can {{be effective}} in chronic diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as SeHCAT retention.|$|E
50|$|Upon diagnosis, many {{providers}} will prescribe Ursodeoxycholic Acid. While {{there is}} no cure for ICP, and no way to guarantee a successful outcome, studies have shown a slightly better fetal and maternal outcome from administration of Ursodeoxycholic Acid, whereas <b>Cholestyramine</b> appears to only relieve itching.|$|E
50|$|Treatment for {{symptoms}} of PSC include therapies to relieve itching (antipruritics) (e.g. bile acid sequestrants such as (<b>cholestyramine)),</b> antibiotics to treat episodes of acute cholangitis, and vitamin supplements, as people with PSC are often deficient in fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K).|$|E
50|$|Like <b>cholestyramine,</b> {{colestipol}} {{works in}} the gut by trapping bile acids and preventing them from being reabsorbed. This leads to decreased enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids, increased synthesis of new bile acids by the liver from cholesterol, decreased liver cholesterol, increased LDL receptor expression, and decreasing LDL in blood.|$|E
50|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} (e.g. <b>cholestyramine,</b> colestipol, etc.): If taken together, {{bile acid}} resins may bind to fenofibrate, {{resulting in a}} decrease in fenofibrate absorption. To maximize absorption, patients need to separate administration by at least 1 h before or 4 h to 6 h after taking the bile acid sequestrant.|$|E
50|$|Medications used in {{managing}} biliary reflux include bile acid sequestrants, particularly <b>cholestyramine,</b> which disrupt {{the circulation of}} bile in the digestive tract and sequester bile that would otherwise cause symptoms when refluxed; and prokinetic agents, to move material from the stomach to the small bowel more rapidly and prevent reflux.|$|E
50|$|Several {{medications}} {{are used}} to improve bile flow, including ursodiol (Actigall).These medications differ in their rates of success. Certain drugs {{may be used to}} reduce itching (pruritus): hydroxyzine (Atarax), <b>cholestyramine,</b> rifampicin, phenobarbital, and naltrexone. Similar to the medications which improve bile flow, the anti-itching drugs vary in their success rate.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} at least 18 studies of the use of SeHCAT testing in diarrhea-predominant {{irritable}} bowel syndrome patients. When these data were combined, 32% of 1223 patients had a SeHCAT 7-day retention of less than 10%, and 80% of these reported a response to <b>cholestyramine,</b> a bile acid sequestrant.|$|E
5000|$|To relieve itching {{caused by}} bile acids in circulation, which are {{normally}} removed by the liver, <b>cholestyramine</b> (a bile acid sequestrant) may be prescribed to absorb bile acids {{in the gut}} and be eliminated, rather than re-enter the blood stream. Other drugs that do this include stanozolol, naltrexone and rifampicin.|$|E
5000|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} are {{the principal}} therapy for bile acid-induced diarrhea. [...] <b>Cholestyramine,</b> colestipol and colesevelam have all been used. Doses may {{not need to be}} as high as those previously used for hyperlipidemia. Many patients find them hard to tolerate, as although the diarrhea may improve, bloating and abdominal pain can worsen.|$|E
50|$|As many as 20% of {{patients}} develop chronic diarrhea. The cause is unclear, but {{is presumed to}} involve the disturbance to the bile system. Most cases clear up within weeks or a few months, though in rare cases the condition may last for many years. It can be controlled with medication such as <b>cholestyramine.</b>|$|E
50|$|If dietary {{treatment}} {{alone is}} insufficient, bile acid-binding resins (e.g., <b>cholestyramine,</b> colestipol) could be considered. In October 2002, a new cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval {{for use in}} sitosterolemia. This drug is now the standard of care, as it blocks sterol entry {{and can be used}} in combination with bile-acid resins.|$|E
50|$|Knowing this it is {{advisable}} to monitor those functions continuously using an EKG. As {{there is no}} antidote against bufotalin all occurring symptoms need to be treated separately or if possible in combination with others. To increase the clearance theoretically, due to the similarities with digitoxin, <b>cholestyramine,</b> a bile salt, might help. Recent animal {{studies have shown that}} taurine restores cardiac functions.|$|E
5000|$|Other less {{beneficial}} treatments {{have been}} used to help treat Gunther's disease. These include oral beta-carotene and other treatments such as activated charcoal and <b>cholestyramine,</b> which are used to interrupt and stop the porphyrins from being reabsorbed in the body. The reason that these oral treatments are unreasonable is because they require an extremely large dose of medicine and therefore are not beneficial.|$|E
5000|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} (resins, e.g. <b>cholestyramine)</b> {{are particularly}} effective for lowering LDL-C by sequestering the cholesterol-containing bile acids {{released into the}} intestine and preventing their reabsorption from the intestine. It decreases LDL by 15-30% and raises HDL by 3-5%, with little effect on triglycerides but can cause a slight increase. Bile acid sequestrants may cause gastrointestinal problems and may also reduce the absorption of other drugs and vitamins from the gut.|$|E
50|$|Colestyramine (INN) or <b>cholestyramine</b> (USAN) (trade names Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar, Olestyr) is a {{bile acid}} sequestrant, which binds bile in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract to prevent its reabsorption. It {{is a strong}} ion exchange resin, which means it can exchange its chloride anions with anionic bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract and bind them strongly in the resin matrix. The functional group of the anion exchange resin is a quaternary ammonium group attached to an inert styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{with primary}} bile acid {{diarrhea}} are frequently misdiagnosed as having the irritable bowel syndrome as clinicians fail to recognize the condition. When SeHCAT testing is performed, the diagnosis of {{primary bile acid}} diarrhea is commonly made. In a review of 18 studies {{of the use of}} SeHCAT testing in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients, 32% of 1223 patients had a SeHCAT 7-day retention of less than 10%, and 80% of these reported a response to <b>cholestyramine,</b> a bile acid sequestrant.|$|E
50|$|In {{people who}} have {{undergone}} gallbladder removal, the bile acid sequestrant <b>cholestyramine</b> may help minor degrees of FI. Bulking agents also absorb water, so may be helpful for those with diarrhea. A common side effect is bloating and flatulence. Topical agents to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used, such as topical antifungals when {{there is evidence of}} perianal candidiasis or occasionally mild topical anti-inflammatory medication. Prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing, moisturization, and use of a skin protectant.|$|E
