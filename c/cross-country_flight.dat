5|$|Achievements in gliding {{have been}} marked by the {{awarding}} of badges since the 1920s. For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight,</b> including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the Gliding Commission of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} Paulhan's victory, the Daily Mail offered a new prize; £10,000 {{to the first}} aviator to cover a 1,000-mile (1,609-km) circuit of Britain in a single day, with 11compulsory stops at fixed intervals. The {{challenge}} was completed by M Beaumont on 26July 1911, in about 22½ hours. Paulhan and Grahame-White competed again later in 1910, for the newspaper's prize of £1,000 for the greatest aggregate <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight,</b> which Paulhan won.|$|E

5|$|Air Vice Marshal Henry Neilson Wrigley, CBE, DFC, AFC (21April 1892– 14September 1987) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A pioneering flyer and aviation scholar, he piloted the first trans-Australia flight from Melbourne to Darwin in 1919, and afterwards {{laid the groundwork for}} the RAAF's air power doctrine. During World WarI, Wrigley joined the Australian Flying Corps and saw combat with No.3 Squadron on the Western Front, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross; he later commanded the unit and published a history of its wartime exploits. He was awarded the Air Force Cross for his 1919 <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 30 May he was graded First Class Flier. The {{grade was}} based upon his achievements; he had {{achieved}} a dead-stick landing within a fifty-yard marker, a 15-minute flight at 6,000 feet, a 60-mile <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight</b> and 15 hours solo flying. On 24 May he passed his final test with a two-hour flight from Salisbury, to Southampton and onto Basingstoke. His 74 hours flying experience was well above the minimum. By {{the time he left}} for France in June he had accumulated 121 flying hours, given 177 lessons as instructor, and had personally tutored 40 student pilots.|$|E
5|$|OTUs, {{employing}} as {{they did}} warplanes that were more advanced and more powerful than trainers, and teaching combat techniques that often carried high risk, generally suffered higher accident rates than other flying training schools. On 3March 1943, a Wirraway of No.4 OTU crashed near Williamtown, killing both crewmen. Two others died when their Vengeance crashed and burned near Goulburn during a cross-country exercise on 4August. On 16August, a Vengeance flew into trees after apparently pulling out late from a dive, resulting in two fatalities. A Vengeance blew up in flight during dive-bombing practice at Williamtown on 14September, killing both crewmen. On 5October, a Vengeance on a dive-bombing exercise crashed into the sea near Newcastle; both crewmen were reported as missing, believed killed. No.4 OTU suffered two more fatalities when a Vengeance struck a hill near Braidwood during a <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight</b> on 26November 1943. Another Vengeance hit the water and exploded in Nelson Bay on 7April 1944 after failing to recover from a dive, killing the two-man crew.|$|E
50|$|For a time, {{there were}} six {{training}} squadrons at the field, eventually this settled down to three, they were the 822nd, 823rd, and the 825th. Sometimes {{it was necessary to}} schedule Sunday flying when inclement weather prevented flying during the week. Normal flying periods were one hour, except <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights.</b> Usually <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights</b> took place between Coffeyville and Claremore, Oklahoma, and Neosho, Joplin, and Nevada, Missouri. Others were flown between Coffeyville, Chanute, and Fort Scott, Kansas.|$|R

25|$|The V12, after {{completing}} a long <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight</b> from Germany, was flown to Mont Blanc {{to perform a}} rescue of 17 people trapped on the mountain. Unfortunately, a mechanical link failure resulted in a rotor disintegrating, and, although the machine touched down on its wheels, it was hurled against an embankment and the crew was killed.|$|E
25|$|The system {{shown on}} mockups used two large oval {{windows on the}} cockpit sides, and a periscope system {{projecting}} an image onto a fresnel lens arrangement {{directly in front of}} the pilot. In 1955, the periscope concept was tested on a modified F-84G, which was flown on a long, <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight</b> with the pilot's forward vision blocked.|$|E
50|$|Typically the {{day would}} start with Reveille at 6:15 AM, {{followed}} by breakfast at 6:30. Flying would begin at 7:45 AM. If a student was not scheduled to fly {{he would be in}} ground school, drill, or involved in required athletics. Sometimes it was necessary to schedule Sunday flying when inclement weather prevented flying during the week. Normal flying periods were one hour, except <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights.</b> Usually <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights</b> took place between Independence and Claremore, Oklahoma, and Neosho, Joplin, and Nevada, Missouri.

50|$|With the {{operational}} squadrons leaving, a caretaker unit was assigned and the flying mission at the airfield {{was reduced to}} the support of transient aircraft using Keystone for landings and <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights.</b> The number of personnel were reduced, being reassigned to other bases.|$|R
25|$|He had two {{seizures}} in June 2016, {{during a}} <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight</b> from Wisconsin to California, {{and landed in}} Omaha, Nebraska.

Less than a month later, he had another seizure, supposedly due to not taking his epilepsy medication.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Captain Lionel Woolson and Professor Hermann Dorner, the DR-980 {{made the}} first <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight</b> with a Diesel-powered {{aircraft}} in the United States when Woolson flew from Detroit to Langley Field in 1929, a distance of 700 miles (1,126km) with a flight time of 6 hours and 40 minutes. On a later flight in a Stinson Detroiter from Detroit to Miami, the new engine showed its economy, the cost for fuel consumption being less than one cent a mile. This aircraft (complete with its engine) is preserved at the Golden Wings Flying Museum.|$|E
25|$|Lorenzo instituted {{cost-cutting}} measures at Eastern by outsourcing some maintenance work, requiring {{pilots to}} fly longer hours, and delaying repairs. In one instance, a pilot refused to fly {{with only one}} functioning air-conditioning unit on a <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight.</b> The FAA investigated {{in the summer of}} 1987 and found that Eastern had the worst repair record of 11 airlines, and had an average of 55 items unrepaired per day, compared to an average of 29 in the industry. In October 1987, at a Congressional hearing, pilots told of being forced to fly unsafe planes.|$|E
50|$|The next {{aircraft}} was the GAX (GA-l), a ground attack triplane. These {{tests were conducted}} to determine the capability of aircraft under hard service incurred during long <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights.</b> All squadron officers and enlisted personnel attended classes to learn everything they could about the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} season, {{there are many}} hiking {{possibilities}} (altitude hiking). The Wildkogel offers cycling for mountain bikes ( [...] "Bike-Arena"), and also the participants of the yearly held Transalp have to cross. The mountain is also a popular starting point for <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights</b> with the paraglider, as the Pinzgau is thermally very reliable.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the end of}} Wireless School {{trainees}} {{moved out}} of the classroom and began to practise signalling in aircraft. This phase lasted several weeks and consisted of message transmission, signalling, and direction finding (DF) during local and <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights.</b> After 30 or so hours in the air, most of them in daylight, training was complete.|$|R
25|$|The two Warrigal {{aircraft}} had short service careers, {{which consisted}} mostly of testing and evaluation trials. The Warrigal I {{was delivered to}} RAAF base Point Cook on 29 January 1929 after a seven-hour <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight</b> with stops at Golburn and Cootamundra. On 31 January the aircraft was christened by Mrs. Ettie Williams, {{the wife of the}} Chief of Air Staff Richard Williams and handed over to the Commonwealth Air Board for a series of performance, handling and operational tests. Numerous RAAF pilots were invited to test the handling of the aircraft, including Charles Eaton, who described an alarming incident when he was unable to recover from an intentional spin until the last moment possible, almost resulting in the loss of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In April 1941, the RAF {{sent two}} Spitfire Mark VA fighters to Dayton for testing. The variant used a {{pressurized}} cockpit for high-altitude pilot comfort—the pilot {{would not have}} to wear an oxygen mask. Kelsey ferried one of the aircraft to and from Los Angeles so that it could be examined further at a California facility. Because of the Spitfire's inherent range limitations, Kelsey was forced to make a number of refueling stops at little-used air fields. Kelsey noted engine overheating during taxiing and brake fade on long desert runways in the presence of significant crosswind. He found long <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight</b> very tiring due to the Spitfire's marginal stability (which gave it high maneuverability in combat.) Kelsey felt that the highly lauded fighter would not have been approved for purchase in the United States where requirements included long range.|$|E
25|$|Use of the {{laminar flow}} NACA 63 (3)-618 {{aerofoil}} section imbued the Mü22 {{with a good}} glide ratio at a high speed which was ideal for competition <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight,</b> {{in contrast to the}} low speed Mü Scheibe section used for previous sailplanes at Akaflieg München. To maintain strength with reduced weight and to eliminate turbulence from gaps and protuberances the Mü22 was built without airbrakes, relying {{on the use of the}} 70 degree trailing edge split flaps and the skill of the pilot in side-slipping for approach control. The high performance of the design was demonstrated during flight testing after the first flight on 29 November 1954 at Riem, as well as by placing second in the German National Gliding Championships in 1959. The Mü22 was also flown extensively to investigate mountain flying during which the Mü22 suffered a serious accident late in 1959 and was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
50|$|Marshall {{was much}} {{used as a}} {{convenient}} stop on <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights.</b> Of some 1,400 landings and take-offs at the field in July 1945, 614 were transients. Another and not inconsiderable activity was the flying {{in and out of}} distinguished visitors to Fort Riley. Among them were Generals Ben Lear, Joseph W. Stilwell, and George S. Patton.|$|R
25|$|The Parnall Pixie was a {{low powered}} British single-seat {{monoplane}} light aircraft originally designed {{to compete in the}} Lympne, UK trials for motor-gliders in 1923, where it was flown successfully by Norman Macmillan. It had two sets of wings, one for <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights</b> and the other for speed; it later appeared as a biplane which could be converted into a monoplane.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, the War Department {{announced}} its intentions to build several new military installations. Efforts by Frank Miller, then {{owner of the}} Mission Inn in Riverside, California, Hiram Johnson and others, succeeded in gaining War Department approval to construct an airfield at Alessandro Field located near Riverside, an airstrip used by aviators from Rockwell Field on <b>cross-country</b> <b>flights</b> from San Diego.|$|R

25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} month of June where they left off in May, losing their fifth {{straight}} game. This time they committed four errors and were pounded by the Colorado Rockies 13–3 at Coors Field. In that game, the Dodgers set a Major League record by having five sons of former Major Leaguers in the lineup {{at the same time}} (Tony Gwynn, Jr., Jerry Hairston, Jr., Iván DeJesús, Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. The losing streak came to an end the next day, when they got a strong pitching performance from Aaron Harang and some timely hitting, including Bobby Abreu's first homer as a Dodger, in a 6–2 win. However, the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation the next day as they dropped the series finale to the Rockies 3–2. The Dodgers road trip continued on June 4 as they traveled to Citizens Bank Park to open a four-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Dee Gordon hit a triple to lead off the ninth against Phillies closer Jonathan Papelbon and then scored on a single by Elián Herrera to give the Dodgers the winning margin in the 4–3 victory. Herrera came through the next night as well, hitting a two-RBI double off Cliff Lee {{in the top of the}} eighth to give the Dodgers the go-ahead run in a 2–1 victory over the Phillies. Dee Gordon delivered a two-run single during the Dodgers three-run sixth inning on June 6 as they again came from behind to beat the Phillies, this time by a score of 6-5. Kenley Jansen picked up his third save in three days against the Phillies. The Dodgers, helped by three Phillies errors, swept the series with an 8–3 victory in the series finale. The victory was the 100th career win for pitcher Aaron Harang and the team's first ever four-game series sweep in Philadelphia. The Dodgers continued the lengthy road trip with a <b>cross-country</b> <b>flight</b> to Seattle to take on the Mariners in interleague play. In the opener Nathan Eovaldi pitched six scoreless innings before the Mariners got a run off of relief pitcher Scott Elbert. It was all they needed because Kevin Millwood and five relief pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Dodgers. This was the first official no-hitter against the Dodgers since Kent Mercker of the Atlanta Braves had done it on April 4, 1994. The Dodgers got back into the winning ways the next day as Clayton Kershaw stuck out a season high 12 batters in 7 innings and Jerry Hairston, Jr. hit a home run and had 5 RBI in the 8–3 win. Andre Ethier hit his fourth career grand slam to back Chad Billingsley's strong effort as the Dodgers closed out the lengthy road trip with an 8–2 victory over the Mariners. Billingsley allowed only one run in 7 innings while striking out 8.|$|E
