Pillsbury quickly adopted two more principles, numbers three and five, to its own company in 1975. It was further supported by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) that governmental inspections by the FDA go from reviewing plant records to compliance with its HACCP system. A second proposal by the NAS {{led to the development}} of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) in 1987. NACMCF {{was initially}} responsible for defining HACCP's systems and guidelines for its application and were coordinated with the Codex Committee for Food Hygiene, that led to reports starting in 1992 and further harmonization in 1997. By 1997, the seven HACCP principles listed below became the standard. A year earlier, the American Society for Quality offered their first certifications for HACCP Auditors. (First known as <b>Certified</b> <b>Quality</b> Auditor-HACCP, they were changed to Certified HACCP Auditor (CHA) in 2004.).|$|E
