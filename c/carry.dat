5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 the <b>Carry</b> On {{producer}} Peter Rogers assembled the cast for the 15th film of the series, <b>Carry</b> On Doctor. Rogers initially chose Joan Sims {{to play the role}} of the hospital matron but she declined the part, stating that Jacques's performance of the role in <b>Carry</b> On Nurse could not be bettered. As such, Rogers cast Jacques as Matron, with Sims accepting a smaller role as the timid assistant of the film's lead character Francis Bigger, played by Frankie Howerd. Jacques's screen time was increased from <b>Carry</b> On Nurse, as the producers considered her part to be an extension of the earlier role. <b>Carry</b> On Doctor was released in December of that year, to much success.|$|E
