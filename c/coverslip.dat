40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{high-resolution}} microscopy, {{cells have}} to be analyzed through thin glass <b>coverslips.</b> Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} culture cells on <b>coverslips</b> for preservation of cell morphology. We found cell attachment and spreading to be relatively slow processes, even when cells were plated on coated <b>coverslips.</b> This slowness presents a problem, particularly when synchronized cell populations are used. METHODS: In this paper, we present a method that is based on glow-discharged carbon coating of <b>coverslips</b> which promotes rapid attachment and spreading of cells, enabling rapid analysis of cells after plating. Results obtained with carbon-coated <b>coverslips</b> were compared with those of other types of coating. Two fibroblast lines, an epithelial cell line, and a carcinoma cell line were tested. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: All cell lines showed a rapid adhesion on carbon-coated <b>coverslips.</b> With fibroblasts we found the carbon coating to be superior to other coatings tested, mainly because the carbon did not influence cell morphology. Using synchronized or irradiated cells produced similar results. The superior performance of carbon coating is probably due to carboxylic groups on the glow-discharged carbon layer. The carbon layer does not interfere with microscopy or immunocytochemical staining procedure...|$|R

Host cells are grown in flasks and when ready for use are seeded into 24 -well plates containing Thermanox <b>coverslips.</b> Using <b>coverslips</b> allows subsequent removal of the cells from the wells to reduce interference from serum proteins deposited onto the sides of the wells (to which S. aureus would attach).

40|$|INTRODUCTIONIt is {{imperative}} that the slides and <b>coverslips</b> used in fluorescence microscopy procedures be extremely clean. Although <b>coverslips</b> look clean, especially when a new box is first opened, {{they may have a}} thin film of grease on them that will not allow tissue culture cells to adhere well and that may interfere with some processing steps in certain protocols. Therefore, <b>coverslips</b> should routinely be washed with acid or base solutions to rid them of this film. Commercial precleaned slides are also likely to be dirty and must be washed prior to use. This protocol describes various approaches for cleaning slides and <b>coverslips</b> and sterilizing them for cell culture, as well as methods for subbing slides. In the subbing procedure, slides are coated with gelatin, aminoalkylsilane, or poly-L-lysine solution to promote the adhesion of cells or tissues to the glass surface. Gelatin or aminoalkylsilane is usually used for tissue sections or small organisms, whereas poly-L-lysine is routinely used for cultured cells...|$|R

The glass <b>coverslip</b> forms another side of the parallel-plate flow chamber and can be coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, vascular cells, or biomaterials of interest.

40|$|Staphylococcal {{infection}} of various prosthetic and internal fixation devices {{is a major}} complication associated with orthopaedic surgery. This study investigated {{the role of the}} host protein fibronectin in promoting adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis to metallic surfaces representing materials used for orthopaedic devices. Pure human fibronectin was adsorbed in vitro onto <b>coverslips</b> (0. 8 x 0. 8 cm) of stainless steel, pure titanium, or titanium-aluminum-niobium alloy. In vitro bacterial adhesion was promoted more strongly by the metallic surfaces coated with fibronectin than by albumin-coated controls for two strains of S. aureus and one strain of S. epidermidis. Furthermore, with the fibronectin-coated <b>coverslips,</b> bacterial adhesion to titanium alloy was significantly greater than adhesion to stainless steel. Adhesion of the three staphylococcal strains was promoted more strongly by <b>coverslips</b> explanted from the subcutaneous space of guinea pigs and tested under similar conditions than by albumin-coated controls. Incubation of either in vitro fibronectin-coated or explanted metallic <b>coverslips</b> with anti-fibronectin antibodies produced a significant decrease in staphylococcal adhesion. These results suggest that the presence of fibronectin on the surface of implanted metallic devices is an important determinant of colonization of orthopaedic biomaterials by staphylococci...|$|R

Results: We investigate here the effect of MW‑CNTs on astrocytic morphology, cell–cell interaction and the distribu‑ tion of intracellular GABA (gamma‑amino butyric acid). Primary cultured cortical astrocytes on MW‑CNT‑coated glass <b>coverslips</b> grow rounder and make more cell–cell interactions, with many cell processes, compared to astrocytes on poly‑d‑lysine (PDL) <b>coverslips.</b> In addition, intracellular GABA spreads into the cell processes of astrocytes on MW‑CNT <b>coverslips.</b> When this GABA spreads into cell processes from the cell body GABA can be released more easily and in larger quantities compared to astrocytes on PDL <b>coverslips.</b> Conclusions: Our result confirm that MW‑CNTs modulate astrocytic morphology, the distribution of astrocytic GABA, cell–cell interactions and the extension of cell processes.

40|$|Mechanical and {{physical}} {{features of the}} extracellular environment dramatically impact cell shape. Fibroblasts interacting with 3 D relaxed collagen matrices appear much different from cells on 2 D collagen-coated surfaces and form dendritic cell extensions that contain microtubule cores and actin-rich tips. We found that interfering with cellular microtubules caused cells in relaxed matrices to remain round and unable to form dendritic extensions, whereas fibroblasts on <b>coverslips</b> formed lamellipodial extensions and were spread completely without microtubules but were unable to become polarized. Fibroblasts in relaxed collagen matrices lack stress fibers, focal adhesions, and focal adhesion signaling. Fibroblasts on collagen-coated <b>coverslips</b> that were unable to develop stress fibers and focal adhesions, because of either adding blebbistatin to the cells or use of soft <b>coverslips,</b> also formed microtubule-dependent dendritic extensions. Conversely, fibroblasts interacting with precontracted collagen matrices developed stress fibers and lamellipodial extensions and required microtubules for polarization but not spreading. Our findings demonstrate an unexpected relationship between the role of microtubules in cell spreading and the tension state of cell–matrix interactions. At a low tension state (absence of stress fibers and focal adhesions) typical of fibroblasts in relaxed collagen matrices, cells spread with dendritic extensions whose formation requires microtubules; at a high tension state (stress fibers and focal adhesions) typical of cells on <b>coverslips,</b> cells spread with lamellipodial extensions and microtubules are required for cell polarization but not for spreading...|$|R

Subcutaneous tissue cages containing polymethylmethacrylate <b>coverslips</b> were infected with 1 x 10 (5) to 5 x 10 (5) CFU of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Three weeks later, a quantitative culturing of the fluid that had accumulated in the cages was done (mean, 6. 72 log 10 CFU/ml; n = 110) and treatment was initiated after randomization. The CFUs in the cage fluid were counted on days 11 and 22 and 1 week after the termination of treatment; in addition, a final culture of <b>coverslips</b> (surface-bound microorganisms) was performed. The three-drug therapy was significantly superior to the other treatments on day 11 (a 5. 16 log 10 decrease of bacterial counts versus a 2. 12 log 10 to 2. 94 log 10 decrease for vancomycin, fleroxacin, and fleroxacin plus rifampin; P less than 0. 01). On day 22, count decreases were 4. 16 log 10 for vancomycin, 4. 91 log 10 for fleroxacin (vancomycin versus fleroxacin, not significant), 6. 14 log 10 for two-drug therapy, and 6. 34 log 10 for three-drug therapy (vancomycin-fleroxacin-rifampin versus fleroxacin-rifampin, not significant; fleroxacin-rifampin versus monotherapies, P less than 0. 01); the numbers of CFU in most cage fluids were under the detection limit (20 CFU/ml) in combination groups. One week {{after the end of}} treatment, 92 % of fluids and <b>coverslips</b> (detection limit, 1 CFU) were culture negative with tritherapy, 88 % of fluids and 41 % of <b>coverslips</b> were negative with bitherapy, and less than 12 % of fluids and <b>coverslips</b> were negative with single drugs (for <b>coverslips,</b> P was < 0. 01 for vancomycin-fleroxacin-rifampin versus fleroxacin-rifampin and P was < 0. 001 for fleroxacin-rifampin versus the monotherapies).
