5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, {{a space station}} located near a stable {{wormhole}} between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this episode, a Bajoran terrorist seeks asylum aboard the station from pursuing Cardassians, publicly renouncing his past violent ways. He begins liaising with the Duras sisters (Barbara March and Gwynyth Walsh), leading to suspicion that he was planning further acts of terrorism and causing Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) to <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> loyalties.|$|E
5|$|By June 5, 2016, she {{had earned}} enough pledged delegates and {{supportive}} superdelegates {{for the media}} to <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> the presumptive nominee. On June 7, after winning most of {{the states in the}} final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47. She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13 million.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels {{sure that there is}} nothing wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and those who can afford it <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E

5|$|In 1935 Wong {{was dealt}} {{the most severe}} {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in {{the film version of}} Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Shashthi's roots {{can be traced}} to Hindu folk traditions. References to this goddess appear in Hindu scriptures as early as 8th and 9th century BCE, in which she is associated with children as well as the Hindu war-god Skanda. Early references <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> a foster-mother of Skanda, but in later texts she is identified with Skanda's consort, Devasena. In some early texts where Shashthi appears as an attendant of Skanda, she is said to cause diseases in the mother and child, and thus needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth. However, over time, this malignant goddess became seen as the benevolent saviour and bestower of children.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} the night together, Tosh and Tommy return to the hospital as the disruptions intensify, accompanied by Jack. During one disruption, the three witness the 1918 Torchwood team; Jack relays instructions through Tommy {{for them to take}} the 1918 version of Tommy into their custody before the older Tommy arrives. Tommy and Tosh share a goodbye, and Jack briefs Tommy on using the Rift Key before he steps back to 1918 during the next disruption. However, when back in the past, Tommy becomes shell-shocked, and is led back to his bed by nurses; he is unable to operate the Rift Key in his state. At Torchwood's headquarters, Jack and Tosh use the Cardiff Rift to project an image of Tosh into Tommy's mind. Tommy senses some familiarity with Tosh but otherwise does not recognise her. Despite this, Tosh is able to instruct Tommy to activate the Rift Key, and the distortions at the hospital soon dissipate. Recovering from events, Tosh brushes off Owen's sympathy and takes a moment to <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> short time with Tommy.|$|E

5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> most famous work Disappearing Model. The work {{appeared}} on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the face and body of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and yellow flowers of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen in a photograph of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
5|$|Generally, Banai's {{birth is}} not {{discussed}} in the folk songs. Few regard her as an avatar of the apsara (celestial nymph) Rambha, while others <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> {{as one of the}} seven daughters of Indra, the king of the gods. She is found by a Dhangar in a golden box in the forest, hidden in a termite mound or a pit. Her Dhangar father (sometimes named Yamu) is the chief of shepherds, who owns nine lakh sheep and goats, nine lakh lambs and numerous barren ones. Yamu is said to have prayed for a child and finds Banai in a box. A virgin ewe is said to have fed Banai her milk, as Yamu does not have a wife and does not know how to feed the infant. In another miracle, a three-storeyed house appears at the place of Yamu's tent for the young Banai to reside, {{while the rest of the}} Dhangars live in tents. She grows up as a rich shepherdess and becomes the overseer of twelve Dhangar vadas (pastoral settlements or camps, inhabited by different Dhangar clans). She cares for her sheep, grazes them and learns how to breed them.|$|E
5|$|The queen's foreign contemporaries {{strongly}} condemned her {{policies and}} viewed {{them as the}} actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman, a characterization that persisted in Western historical literature until the 1970s. Although Ranavalona has traditionally been depicted as a cruel and xenophobic tyrant, in more recent historical analyses she is commonly viewed as an astute politician who effectively protected the political and cultural sovereignty of her nation from European encroachment. In Madagascar today, the Malagasy of the central highlands hold complex and diverse views ranging across this spectrum. Most condemn her reign, in line with negative depictions of Ranavalona in current Malagasy history textbooks; this view is most common among Malagasy Christians. Others admire her effort to preserve Malagasy traditions and independence. The majority, regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies, <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> a remarkable figure in Malagasy history and commend her strength as a ruler in a period of tension with European powers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extent of}} her {{influence}} at matters of court and {{state has been}} a matter of debate among historians.

Zosimus <b>considers</b> <b>her</b> strong-willed but ultimately manipulated by eunuchs at court and the women of her environment. Barbarians and Bishops: Army, Church, and State in the Age of Arcadius and Chrysostom (1990) by J. W. H. G. Liebeschuetz <b>considers</b> <b>her</b> influence overestimated in primary sources while The Cambridge Ancient History XIII.

25|$|Due {{to lack of}} evidence, Zoran Stojanović was pardoned in 2007 and {{released}} from custody. In late 2009, President of Serbia Boris Tadić pardoned Zoran Stojanović, declaring that the trial was unjust, which opened {{the question as to}} whether he had jurisdiction because Stojanović was sentenced by an international High court. Stojanović's ethnic Albanian wife and their two children have been exposed to intensified intimidation, most notably because other Albanians <b>consider</b> <b>her</b> a traitor for marrying a Serb. As of 2011, no one has been found guilty of participation in the Račak massacre and no known investigations are currently being held.|$|E
