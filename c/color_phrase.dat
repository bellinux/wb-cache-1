40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the changes in the {{understanding}} of learners of Chinese as a Foreign language (CFL) of certain Chinese metaphorical expressions (e. g. <b>color</b> <b>phrases).</b> By implementing conceptual metaphor theory as a way to connect language and culture in CFL instruction, the present study examines how instructional interventions can be used to raise students’ conceptual awareness of certain metaphorical expressions and their communicative intent in a lower level Chinese language classes. The research questions are: 1) 	 What are the initial interpretations of certain <b>color</b> <b>phrases</b> by students from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds? 2) How, if at all, do students’ explanations of <b>color</b> <b>phrases</b> with metaphorical meanings change from pre-test to post-test? 3) Can students make use of the knowledge that they gained from instruction to interpret novel metaphoric expressions using the color metaphors that they have learned? The findings demonstrated that the students were able to interpret the color metaphors in a culturally appropriate way and applied their knowledge of three Chinese colors to metaphoric expressions that they had not encountered before. The findings also revealed that intentional instruction is needed for raising students’ metaphorical awareness to better understand metaphorical meanings in the target language and culture. The pedagogical implications raises the issue of the need to balance instruction on language and instruction on conceptual metaphors. This study is beneficial to the foreign language education field for several reasons. First, instruction on metaphoric interpretations will encourage the students to use metaphors to communicate meaning in a foreign language, and facilitate their comprehension of cultural meanings of the texts in the target language. Because Chinese is a less commonly-taught language, this study furthers our understanding of Chinese color metaphors, a new research area that has not been fully explored before. This study also contributes to the issue of the disconnection between lower-level language courses and upper-level content courses, by introducing selected conceptual metaphors in lower-level classes...|$|R

25|$|Benny Moré, {{considered}} {{by many as the}} greatest Cuban singer of all time, was in his heyday in the 1950s. He had an innate musicality and fluid tenor voice, which he <b>colored</b> and <b>phrased</b> with great expressivity. Although he could not read music, Moré was a master of all the genres, including son montuno, mambo, guaracha, guajira, cha cha cha, afro, canción, guaguancó, and bolero. His orchestra, the Banda Gigante, and his music, was a development – more flexible and fluid in style – of the Perez Prado orchestra, which he sang with in 1949–1950.|$|R

5000|$|De gustibus non est disputandum, or de gustibus non disputandum est, is a Latin maxim meaning [...] "In {{matters of}} taste, {{there can be}} no disputes" [...] (literally [...] "about tastes, it should not be disputed/discussed").

Sometimes the phrase is expanded as De gustibus et coloribus... referring to tastes and <b>colors.</b> The <b>phrase</b> is most commonly rendered in English as [...] "There is no accounting for taste(s)." [...] The original quotation is an ancient Latin adage, i.e. Roman, and discussed by many philosophers and economists.|$|R
5000|$|By {{referring}} to De Lucia as an artificial tenor, Shaw is associating him with other tenors who employed a similar vocal technique, and {{were inclined to}} <b>color</b> and <b>phrase</b> in {{the same sort of}} way as De Lucia. They include Alessandro Bonci, Giuseppe Anselmi, Fiorello Giraud, Charles Friant, Edmond Clement, and David Devries. The voices of several of these tenors had a fast vibrato which is apparent on their gramophone records. Musicologists debate whether this is a genuine stylistic hand-me-down from the [...] "bel canto" [...] singing tradition founded by the virtuoso tenor Giovanni Rubini (1794-1854) or merely a flaw, attributable to inadequate breath support, in the vocal method adopted subsequent to Rubini by some Mediterranean tenors.|$|R

40|$|When {{a speaker}} says {{the name of}} a color, the color they picture is not {{necessarily}} the same as the listener imagines. Color is a grounded semantic task, but that grounding is not a single value as the most recent works on color-generation do. Rather proper understanding of color language requires the capacity to map a sequence of words is to a distribution in color space. To achieve this, we propose a novel GRU based model which when given a color description such as "light greenish blue" produces an estimated probability distribution across HSV color space. This model learns the compositional functioning of each term: "light", "green", "ish" and "blue" in the color name, and show together they determine the shape of the distribution. This allows the prediction of distributions for <b>color</b> description <b>phrases</b> never seen in training. Such capacity is crucial in allowing human computer interaction systems to interpret vague color statements, with particular use in recognising objects described by color.

5000|$|Brendel has {{performed}} {{on all the}} major opera stages in Germany (Hamburg State Opera, both the Deutsche Oper and the Staatsoper in Berlin, Dresden) and throughout Europe (Vienna, Milan, London, Paris, Bayreuth, Dresden, Amsterdam, Lisbon, Madrid), in Tokyo, and in the United States (New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas). Since Brendel's debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1975, age 27, as Count Almaviva, he has sung 91 performances there through 2007 in Mozart (Papageno), Verdi (Germont, Miller), Wagner (Amfortas), Puccini (Sharpless), J. Strauß (Dr. Falke and Eisenstein), and R. Strauss (Mandryka, Barak, Count in Capriccio, Music Master, Altair). In his Andante on-line review of Brendel's Barak in the new production of Die Frau ohne Schatten in 2001, Paul Griffiths catches {{the essence of the}} baritone in so many of his roles: [...] "Wolfgang Brendel is extraordinarily resourceful. With his subtle control of <b>color</b> and <b>phrasing,</b> he can suggest a man fiercely resolute, tired or ironically self-dismissive, yet always good and trustworthy.

If it is a men's dinner, or more especially a men's supper, these stories are pretty sure to follow the coffee; but when there have been women at the board, some sense of their presence seems to linger in the more delicate American nerves, and the indulgence is limited to two or three things off <b>color,</b> as the <b>phrase</b> is here, told with anxious glances at the drawing-room doors, to see if they are fast shut.|$|R
5000|$|Three years later, in his 1903 book, Du Bois {{used the}} phrase first in his introduction, titled [...] "The Forethought", writing: [...] "This meaning is not without {{interest}} to you, Gentle Reader; for {{the problem of the}} Twentieth Century is the problem of <b>color</b> line". The <b>phrase</b> occurs again in the book's second essay, [...] "Of the Dawn of Freedom", at both its beginning and its end. At the outset of the essay, Du Bois writes: [...] "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line - the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea". At the end of the essay, Du Bois truncates his statement to: [...] "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line", the more frequently quoted version of the sentiment.|$|R
40|$|The {{compositional}} {{style of}} music for flute and piccolo by Martin Amlin is examined through formal and harmonic analyses and through {{interviews with the}} composer and the musicians most {{closely associated with the}} works, flutist Leone Buyse and piccoloist Zart Dombourian-Eby. Amlin's compositional style as represented in these pieces may be described as combining characteristic twentieth-century American driving rhythms and perpetual motion, symmetry on multiple levels, and a unique blend of French use of <b>color</b> and <b>phrasing.</b> Complex rhythms and constantly-shifting meters and timbres give the music a kaleidoscopic effect. The composer's fascination with symmetry is reflected both formally and harmonically, in both the often-used arch form and the frequent use of serialism based on symmetrical tone rows. Symmetrical division of meter often produces jazz rhythms, and major and minor 7 th chords are featured due to their symmetrical sound. Amlin's style of serialism appeals to many because of its unusual, almost-tonal sound. This effect is due to the structure of the rows, in which half of the intervals are perfect 4 ths; many major and minor 7 th chords are produced internally. This is intentional {{on the part of the}} composer, who is not so much intent on abandoning all tonality as on producing music that finds favor with both the ear and the mind. All three pieces exhibit use of the full range of the instruments, a quality that both Buyse and Dombourian-Eby mentioned as appealing to them. Yet, as in the style of the best sonatas of the repertoire, the parts are balanced; lines interweave, rise, and fall in a balanced whole. As more flutists become aware of the quality of these works, they will become a strong and vibrant staple of the body of flute and piccolo literature...|$|R
40|$|The Fantasy form {{offered a}} {{composer}} {{the freedom to}} create a work without concerns for fitting into the current stylistic and traditional structures. The flowering of the form seems to be concentrated from 1820 - 1920 since the composer started {{to use it as}} a way to convey a personal idea or to portray a special spirit. This dissertation is comprised of three recitals with fantasies in different genres and styles. Through performing these diverse fantasies, I have been inspired to connect with the imagery and spirit of the compositions in order to capture the unique sentiments of each piece. Also, in order to keep the audience absorbed in the music that is without structure, I have focused on expanding my technical abilities to vary <b>color,</b> sonority, and <b>phrasing.</b> Program one (April 26, 2004) includes Fantasie, Op. 17 and Piano Concerto, Op. 54 (assisted by Ya-Hsin Wu) by R. Schumann. Program two (December 10, 2004) includes Three Fantastic Dances, Op. 5 by D. Shostakovitch, Fantasy "Sonataecossaise ", Op. 28 by F. Mendelssohn, Sonata No. 2 "Sonata-Fantasy", Op. 19 by A. Scriabin and Fantasie for Piano and Violin, D 934 by F. Schubert with violinist, TaoChang Yu. The last program (November 1, 2005) includes Fantasia baetica by E. de Falla, Morceaux de Fantaisie, Op. 3 by S.
