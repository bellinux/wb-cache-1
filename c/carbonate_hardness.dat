The correlation coefficient matrix between the hydrochemical parameters was carried out using Pearson’s correlation to infer the possible water–rock interactions responsible for the variation of groundwater chemistry and this has been supported by Gibbs diagram. The results indicate that the groundwater in Tummalapalle area is alkaline in nature. Ca–Mg–HCO 3 is the dominant hydrogeochemical facies. Water chemistry of the study area strongly reflects the dominance of weathering of rock-forming minerals such as bicarbonates and silicates. All parameters and diagrams suggest that the water samples of the study are good for irrigation, and the plots of TDS and TH suggest that 12.5 % of the samples are good for human consumption.|$|R
30|$|Hardness is the {{property}} of water which prevents lather formation with soap. Principal cations imparting hardness are calcium and magnesium. However, other cations such as strontium, iron and manganese also contribute to hardness. The anions responsible for hardness are mainly bicarbonate and <b>carbonate.</b> The <b>hardness</b> mean concentration in river water samples ranged from 342  ±  19.69 to 570  ±  86.16  mg/l in PRM and from 70  ±  23.18 to 206  ±  35.77  mg/l in POM season. The concentration during PRM season of all the river water samples exceeded the desirable limit of hardness i.e. 300  mg/l {{but none of the}} sample in POM exceeded the limit. Water hardness has no adverse effect on health as such but the higher concentration of hardness in water causes heart disease as well as kidney stone problem (Napacho and Manyele 2010). The mean concentration of alkalinity in water ranged from 218  ±  7.60 to 461  ±  12.57 and from 57  ±  10.13 to 186  ±  34.7  mg/l during PRM and POM seasons, respectively. The concentration during PRM seasons of all the river water samples exceeded the desirable limit of alkalinity i.e. 200  mg/l but in POM season concentration is found well within the limit. Alkalinity in water is due to the presence of carbonates, bicarbonates and hydroxide constituents, which may be derived from dissolved rocks, salts or sediments (Kumar et al. 2012).|$|R

50|$|The {{characteristics}} {{capable of}} supporting Type 1 pits were determined empirically by Lucey after examining the compositions of waters {{in which the}} pitting behaviour was known. They should be cold, less than 30°C, hard or moderately hard, 170 to 300 mg/l <b>carbonate</b> <b>hardness,</b> and organically pure. Organically pure waters usually originate from deep wells, or boreholes. Surface waters from rivers or lakes contain naturally occurring organic compounds that inhibit the formation of Type 1 pits, unless a deflocculation treatment {{has been carried out}} that removes organic material. Type 1 pitting is relatively uncommon in North America and this may be a result of the lower population density allowing a significant proportion of the potable water to be obtained from surface derived sources. In addition to being cold hard and organically pure, the water needs a specific chemistry. The effect of the water chemistry can be empirically determined though use of the Pitting Propensity Rating (PPR) a number that takes into account the sulfate, chloride, nitrate and sodium ion concentrations of the water as well as its acidity or pH.

30|$|Hardness {{is defined}} as a {{characteristic}} of water which represents the total concentration of Ca and Mg expressed as their calcium <b>carbonate</b> equivalent. Water <b>hardness</b> may be caused by natural geological process or pollution from industries and commercial operations. The ratio of Ca 2 + to Mg 2 + in Lusui bore-hole was about 2 (Table  2). This is an interesting result which may suggest that most of the calcium in Lusui waters may be due to maize and tea farming in the upper areas of Lusui (Nandi County). Another remarkable result was observed in Shivikwa borehole, where Mg was twice the concentration of Ca. Although it is expected that Ca should dominate the water because of application of calcium-based fertilizers such as calcium ammonium nitrate and lime in sugar farms, this was not so in Shivikwa waters (sample 7). Large concentrations of Mg may, therefore, be attributed to a geological source containing soil minerals rich in magnesium. Generally, apart from Lusui bore-hole which had the highest concentration of Ca (50.6  ±  1.5  mg/L), all other boreholes contained low concentrations of calcium in comparison to Mg levels. Ideally, Kakamega waters have significantly high concentrations of Mg.|$|R

Correlation between natural food and carp growth was analyzed as well. The investigations revealed negative correlation between the amount of natural food per kilogram of ichthyomass and pH (p < 0. 001, r =- 0. 875), electroconductivity (p = 0. 0294, r =- 0. 673), COD (p = 0. 0052, r =- 0. 782), total water hardness (p = 0. 0186, r =- 0. 709), and <b>carbonate</b> water <b>hardness</b> (p = 0. 0087, r =- 0. 758). However, statistically significant positive correlation was found between the biomass of natural food (g/kg of ichthyomass) and concentration of nitrates (p < 0. 01, r = 0. 841) and phosphates (p = 0. 0427, r = 0. 640). Concerning components of natural food (zooplankton and bottom fauna), bottom fauna biomass had a very low production and showed no statistically significant correlation (p = 0. 137, r = 0. 491) with total natural food biomass whereas zooplankton biomass was very significantly correlated (p< 0. 001, r = 0. 830) with the total amount of natural food, indicating that zooplankton was the dominant component of natural food at the investigated fish pond.

Chloride concentration in the water of Nachiketa Tal was maximum (5.68 [*]±[*] 0  mg l− 1) in monsoon season at all the four stations and minimum (3.03 [*]±[*] 0.32  mg l− 1) in winter season at S 4. Chemically, the most stable form of nitrogen is nitrate. In the present study, the values of nitrates were maximum (0.046 [*]±[*] 0.01  mg l− 1) during monsoon season at S 4 and minimum (0.030 [*]±[*] 0.02  mg l− 1) during winter at S 1 and S 2. Similar results were reported by Abir (2014) and Wondie et al. (2007) in their respective studies. Seasonally, phosphates concentration was high (0.10 [*]±[*] 0  mg l− 1) during monsoon at S 1 and minimum (0.05 [*]±[*] 0.01  mg l− 1) in winter at S 2 and S 3. The higher concentration of phosphates in monsoon season was also reported by Shukla et al. (2013) and Krishanmoorthi and Selvakumar (2012). Sulphates in the Nachiketa Tal were found to be maximum (8.63 [*]±[*] 0.61  mg l− 1) in monsoon at S 1 and minimum (5.46 [*]±[*] 0.2  mg l− 1) in spring at S 1. Similar trend of higher concentration of sulphates in monsoon season was reported by Abubakar (2012) in Nguru Lake of north-eastern Nigeria, and Latha and Mohan (2010) in Kommagatta Lake of Bangalore.|$|R
