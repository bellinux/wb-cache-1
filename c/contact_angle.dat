5|$|The <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> (θ), {{as seen in}} Figure 1, is {{the angle}} at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> decreases. Thus, the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E
5|$|A <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> {{less than}} 90° (low <b>contact</b> <b>angle)</b> usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high <b>contact</b> <b>angle)</b> generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E
5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. <b>Contact</b> <b>angle</b> of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Earlier {{studies on}} some dental {{materials}} measured roughness and/or <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> or fluoride release separately. In the present study, five dental polymers were investigated to ascertain their <b>contact</b> <b>angles,</b> wettability, roughness, and fluoride release in dry or wet conditions. METHODS: Samples for 5 materials were prepared and stored dry or wet in deionized water pH 6. 8. Samples were submitted to finishing/polishing procedures, and the measurements in Goniometer, roughness (µm) and fluoride analysis RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Except for the Ariston pHc, all the materials displayed high <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> when measured with water, showing hydrophobic characteristics. Roughness changed the <b>contact</b> <b>angles,</b> {{especially those of}} Ariston (&# 945; < 0. 05). Fluoride did not modify the <b>contact</b> <b>angles,</b> but increased the roughness of the finished material...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{were used to}} investigate the formation of water droplets on two kaolinite surfaces: the gibbsite-like surface which is hydrophilic and the silica surface which is hydrophobic. Two methods for calculating <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> were investigated in detail. The method of Giovambattista et al. was successful in calculating <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> on both surfaces that compare well to the experimental data available. This {{is the first time}} that <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> have been calculated for kaolinite surfaces from molecular simulations. This preliminary study provides the groundwork for investigating <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> for more complex systems involving multiple fluids (water, CO{sub 2 }, oil) in contact with different minerals in the subsurface environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of surface roughness on <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> in the system of liquid Al wetting solid surfaces of Al 2 O 3 has been studied. It was observed that <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> of liquid Al vary significantly on different rough surfaces of Al 2 O 3 A model is proposed to correlate <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> with conventional roughness measurements and wavelengths by assuming a cosine profile of rough grooves with a Gaussian distribution of amplitudes. In comparison with the experimental results, the model provides a good estimate for describing {{the influence of}} surface roughness on <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> of liquid Al on Al 2 O 3...|$|R
5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially}} the displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E
5|$|Observe that in {{the special}} case of a water–silver {{interface}} where the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is equal to 90°, the liquid–solid/solid–air surface tension difference is exactly zero.|$|E
50|$|This {{occurs because}} as {{the size of}} the {{homogeneous}} domains become very small compared to {{the size of the}} drop, the differences in <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> along different homogeneous regions becomes indistinguishable from the average of the <b>contact</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R
30|$|The surface free {{energies}} of the rubber films were evaluated with the Owens–Wendt equation [18]. Because {{two types of}} <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> are required for this evaluation, we used ultrapure water and diiodomethane, and determined the <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> with a Dropmaster 300 from Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> and contact-angle {{hysteresis}} of {{a series}} of poly(n-alkyl methacrylates) (PAMA) were investigated using the Wilhelmy plate technique. The mobility of polymer surface chains, segments, and side groups affected the measured <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> and their hysteresis. A model is presented in which contact-angle hysteresis of PAMA's is explained in terms of the reorientation of polymer chains and segments at the interface of the polymers with water and air. The <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> observed also indicated structural transitions in the polymer surfaces of PAMA's that were dependent on alkyl side chain length and temperature...|$|R
5|$|Sessile drop method: A {{method for}} {{determining}} surface tension and density {{by placing a}} drop on a substrate and measuring the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> (see Sessile drop technique).|$|E
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
5|$|The formula also {{predicts that}} when the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is 0°, the liquid will spread out into a micro-thin layer over the surface. Such a surface {{is said to be}} fully {{wettable}} by the liquid.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} wetting/dewetting of a metal surface by {{distilled water}} drop was studied experimentally. The advancing and receding dynamic <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> were obtained {{as a function}} of a contact line speed. The hydrodynamic and molecular-kinetic models have been applied to the experimental data to interpret the obtained results. The independent variables of the molecular-kinetic and hydrodynamic models, and the determination coefficient were determined by fitting procedure. The receding <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> are found to be fitted better to the wetting models in comparison with the advancing dynamic <b>contact</b> <b>angles...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} the wetting behavior of nanostructured wrinkle and gradient wrinkle substrates. Different <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> {{on both sides}} of a water droplet after deposition on a gradient sample induce the self-propelled motion of the liquid toward smaller wrinkle dimensions. The droplet motion is self-limited by the <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> balancing out. Because of the correlation between droplet motion and <b>contact</b> <b>angles,</b> we investigate the wetting behavior of wrinkle substrates with constant dimensions (wavelengths of 400 - 1200 nm). <b>Contact</b> <b>angles</b> of water droplets on those substrates increase with increasing dimensions of the underlying substrate. The results are independent of the two measurement directions, parallel and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the nanostructure. The presented findings may be considered for designing microfluidic or related devices and initiate ideas for the development of further wrinkle applications...|$|R
40|$|Advancing and {{receding}} <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> {{on individual}} hydrophobic microspheres at the air-water and liquid-liquid, namely hexadecane-water, interfaces were determined. For this purpose, spherical silanated silica particles (R = 2. 35 μm) and polystyrene particles of different radii (R = 1. 80 - 4. 38 μm) {{were attached to}} atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers. Polystyrene particles were sintered onto the AFM cantilevers to provide stability in organic solvent. Then the equilibrium position of the microsphere at the air-water interface of a drop or an air bubble was measured with an AFM-related set-up. From the equilibrium position the <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> were calculated. Advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> determined with silanated silica particles (Θ a = 97 °and Θ r = 81 °) agreed roughly with <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> measured on similarly prepared planar surfaces (Θ a = 95 °and Θ r = 83 °). The apparent <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> measured on polystyrene particles decreased with increasing particle size. This can be interpreted by assuming a negative line tension of the order of- 0. 3 μN...|$|R
5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of high {{resolution}} imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie–Baxter equation when calculating the apparent <b>contact</b> <b>angle.</b> These groups believe the apparent <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is largely dependent on the triple line. The triple line, which is {{in contact with the}} heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface {{like the rest of the}} drop. In theory, it should follow the surface imperfection. This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie–Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of the triple line hinges on the idea of a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie–Baxter model.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (<b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E

25|$|A superhydrophobic {{surface is}} a low energy, {{generally}} rough surface on which water has a <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> of >150°. Nonpolar materials such as hydrocarbons traditionally have relatively low surface energies, however this property alone {{is not sufficient to}} achieve superhydrophobicity. Superhydrophobic surfaces can be created in a number of ways, however most of the synthesis strategies are inspired by natural designs. The Cassie-Baxter model provides and explanation for superhydropbicity—air trapped in microgrooves of a rough surface create a “composite” surface consisting of air and the tops of microprotrusions. This structure is maintained as the scale of the features decreases, thus many approaches to the synthesis of superhydrophobic surfaces have focused on the fractal contribution. Wax solidification, lithography, vapor deposition, template methods, polymer reconfirmation, sublimation, plasma, electrospinning, sol-gel processing, electrochemical methods, hydrothermal synthesis, layer-by-layer deposition, and one-pot reactions are approaches to the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces that have been suggested.|$|E

50|$|Measuring <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> for pendant drops is {{much more}} {{complicated}} than for sessile drops due to the inherent unstable nature of inverted drops. This complexity is further amplified when one attempts to incline the surface. Experimental apparatus to measure pendant drop <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> on inclined substrates has been developed recently. This method allows for the deposition of multiple microdrops on the underside of a textured substrate, which can be imaged using a high resolution CCD camera.
