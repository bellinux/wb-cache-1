25|$|No part of Medicare {{pays for}} all of a beneficiary's covered medical costs and many costs and {{services}} are not covered at all. The program contains premiums, deductibles and <b>coinsurance,</b> which the covered individual must pay out-of-pocket. A study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found the Fee-for-Service Medicare benefit package was less generous than either the typical large employer Preferred provider organization plan or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option. Some people may qualify to have other governmental programs (such as Medicaid) pay premiums and {{some or all of}} the costs associated with Medicare.|$|E
25|$|Some Medicare {{supplemental}} insurance (or “Medigap”) plans {{cover all}} of an enrollee's cost-sharing, insulating them from any out-of-pocket costs and guaranteeing financial security to individuals with significant health care needs. Many policymakers {{believe that such}} plans raise the cost of Medicare by creating a perverse incentive that leads patients to seek unnecessary, costly treatments. Many argue that unnecessary treatments are {{a major cause of}} rising costs and propose that people with Medicare should feel more of the cost of their care to create incentives to seek the most efficient alternatives. Various restrictions and surcharges on Medigap coverage have appeared in recent deficit reduction proposals. One of the furthest-reaching reforms proposed, which would prevent Medigap from covering any of the first $500 of <b>coinsurance</b> charges and limit it to covering 50 percent of all costs beyond that, could save $50 billion over 10 years. But it would also increase health care costs substantially for people with costly health care needs.|$|E
2500|$|Part A covers {{inpatient}} hospital stays, including semi-private room, food, and tests. As of January 1, 2016, Medicare Part A has an inpatient hospital deductible of $1288, <b>coinsurance</b> per day as $322 after 61 days confinement {{within one}} [...] "spell of illness", <b>coinsurance</b> for [...] "lifetime reserve days" [...] (essentially, days 91-150) of $644 per day, and <b>coinsurance</b> in an Skilled Nursing Family (following a medically necessary hospital confinement) for days 21-100 of $161 per day.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} using such a plan, unlike an HMO plan, {{which has a}} copayment cost share feature (a nominal payment {{generally}} paid {{at the time of}} service), a PPO generally does not have a copayment but offers a deductible and a <b>coinsurance</b> feature. The deductible must be paid in full before any benefits are provided. After the deductible is met, the <b>coinsurance</b> benefits apply. If the PPO plan is an 80% <b>coinsurance</b> plan with a $1,000 deductible, the patient pays 100% of the allowed provider fee up to $1,000. The insurer will pay 80% of the other fees, and the patient will pay the remaining 20%. [...] Charges above the allowed amount are not payable by the patient or insurer but written off as a discount by the physician.|$|E
2500|$|Methods {{of payment}} in the United States include private {{insurance}} (Individual & Family coverage, Small Group coverage through an employer (Under 50 full-time employees) and Large Group coverage through an employer (50 or more full-time employees), public insurance (Medicare and Medicaid) and self-pay. [...] Out of pocket costs {{for a patient}} with private or public insurance that specifically list bariatric surgery as a covered benefit include several insurance-policy-specific parameters such as deductible levels, <b>coinsurance</b> percentages, copay amounts and out of pocket limits.|$|E

50|$|In {{business}} income interruption insurance, {{a type of}} time-element insurance, the <b>coinsurance</b> percent indicates how long the coverage will last, and can range from 50% to 125%. The former <b>coinsurance</b> allows for 6 months of coverage, compared to 15 months for 125%.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coinsurance</b> is a {{percentage}} of the allowed amount that the patient must pay. It is most often applied to surgical and/or diagnostic procedures. Using the above example, a <b>coinsurance</b> of 20% would have the patient owing $10.00 and the insurance company owing $40.00.|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} {{discriminatory practice}} {{that resulted in}} barriers to mental health care for older adults was the Outpatient Mental Health Treatment Limitation, which established a 50% <b>coinsurance</b> for outpatient mental health treatment. This 50% <b>coinsurance</b> applied to outpatient treatment services, not to psychodiagnostic services, inpatient services, or psychological and neuropsychological assessment services. Passage of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 required a phased out elimination of the Outpatient Mental Health Treatment Limitation. Since January 1, 2014, Medicare’s <b>coinsurance</b> for outpatient mental health treatment is 20%, consistent with other outpatient services (Medicare Learning Network Matters®) (2013, January 18).|$|E

5000|$|A copayment or copay is a fixed {{amount for}} a covered service, paid by a patient to the {{insurance}} company before patient receives service from physician. In the United States, copayment is a payment defined in an insurance policy and paid by an insured person each time a medical service is accessed. It is technically a form of <b>coinsurance,</b> but is defined differently in health insurance where a <b>coinsurance</b> is a percentage payment after the deductible {{up to a certain}} limit. It must be paid before any policy benefit is payable by an insurance company. Copayments do not usually contribute towards any policy out-of-pocket maxima whereas <b>coinsurance</b> payments do.|$|E

50|$|Tricare Standard {{beneficiaries}} can {{elect to}} use the Tricare Extra option by using a civilian health care provider from within the regional contractor's provider network. In this way, Tricare Extra represents a preferred provider organization (PPO). When using Tricare Extra, the beneficiary's <b>coinsurance</b> amount is reduced by at least five percentage points. There is no fee {{for use of the}} Tricare Extra benefit other than the <b>coinsurance.</b>|$|E

Charges above the allowed amount are not payable by the patient or insurer but written off as a discount by the physician.|$|E
50|$|In health insurance, <b>coinsurance</b> is {{sometimes}} used synonymously with copayment, but copayment is fixed while the <b>coinsurance</b> is a percentage that the insurer pays after the insurance policy's deductible is exceeded, {{up to the}} policy's stop loss. It can be expressed {{as a pair of}} percentages with the insurer's portion stated first, or just a single percentage showing what the insured pays. The percentage due from the insured can range up to 100% (100% meaning the insured pays all costs until reaching the out of pocket maximum). Once the insured's out-of-pocket expenses equal the stop loss the insurer will assume responsibility for 100% of any additional costs. 70-30, 80-20, and 90-10 insurer-insured <b>coinsurance</b> schemes are common, with stop loss limits of $1,000 to $3,000 after which the insurer covers all expenses.|$|E

50|$|According to VaccineNewsDaily, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society {{is urging}} {{the state of}} California to reconsider its {{standard}} benefit design due to the potential negative impact on specialty medication users like cancer patients. California's benefit design specifies copayment and <b>coinsurance</b> levels that insurance companies in the exchange will charge for services. <b>Coinsurance</b> requires patients {{to pay for a}} percentage of cost of the drug or service they are receiving. The Society urges California to look at New York's benefit design, which is more fairly organized for specialty medication users.|$|E

5000|$|A {{buildings}} {{replacement cost}} actually valued at $1,000,000 has an 80% <b>coinsurance</b> clause but is insured for only $750,000. Since its insured value {{is less than}} 80% of its replacement value, when it suffers a loss, the insurance payout {{will be subject to}} the underreporting penalty. For example, if it suffers a $200,000 loss, the insured would recover $750,000 ÷ (0.80 × 1,000,000) × 200,000 = $187,500 (less any deductible). In this example, the underreporting penalty would be $12,500. More generally, suppose a building with replacement cost R is insured for amount I, with a coninsurance requirement c, expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.8 for an 80% <b>coinsurance</b> clause). If this building suffers a loss L, then the insurance payout (less deductibles) would be the smallest of the three amounts, L, I, and IL/(cR). The first two alternatives reflect the fact that the payout will not exceed the loss nor the amount the building was insured for, while the last amount represents the intended action of the <b>coinsurance</b> requirement to penalize underreporting.|$|E
50|$|With HSAs, in catastrophic situations, {{the maximum}} out-of-pocket expense legal {{liability}} {{can be less}} than that of a traditional health plan. That is because a qualified HDHP can cover 100% after the deductible, involving no <b>coinsurance.</b>|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{including}} employer's liability insurance, <b>coinsurance</b> percent denotes {{a function}} {{analogous to the}} copay function that it has in health insurance, in which the insured covers {{a certain percentage of}} the losses up to a certain level.|$|E
50|$|The deductibles, co-pays, and <b>coinsurance</b> {{charges for}} Part C and D plans vary from plan to plan. All Part C plans include an annual {{out of pocket}} (OOP) upper spend limit. Original Medicare does not include an OOP limit.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{moral hazard}} is so severe it makes {{insurance}} policies impossible. <b>Coinsurance,</b> co-payments, and deductibles {{reduce the risk}} of moral hazard by increasing the out-of-pocket spending of consumers, which decreases their incentive to consume. Thus, the insured have a financial incentive to avoid making a claim.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} issued <b>coinsurance</b> percentage would be 80% {{but it can}} be as high as 100%, which would impose the greatest penalty for underreporting. For this reason, it is vital for values of property to be accurately reported and updated annually to reflect inflation and other increases in cost.|$|E
50|$|Many {{forms of}} {{commercial}} health insurance control their costs by restricting {{the benefits that}} are paid by through deductibles, co-payments, <b>coinsurance,</b> policy exclusions, and total coverage limits and will severely restrict or refuse coverage of pre-existing conditions. Many government schemes also have co-payment schemes but exclusions are rare because of political pressure. The larger insurance schemes may also negotiate fees with providers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Co{{insurance}}</b> is {{a penalty}} {{imposed on the}} insured by the insurance carrier for under reporting/declaring/insuring the value of tangible property or business income.

The penalty {{is based on a}} percentage stated within the policy and the amount under reported. As an example: ...|$|E
50|$|According to the IRS, {{employees}} are reimbursed tax-free for qualified medical expenses up {{to a maximum}} amount for a coverage period. HRAs reimburse only items (co-pays, <b>coinsurance,</b> deductibles, and services) agreed to by the employer that {{are not covered by}} the employer's selected standard insurance plan (any health insurance plan, not only a High Deductible Health Plan). The arrangements are described in IRC Section 105.|$|E
5000|$|In health care, {{cost sharing}} occurs when {{patients}} {{pay for a}} portion of health care costs not covered by health insurance. The [...] "out-of-pocket" [...] payment varies among healthcare plans and depends on whether or not the patient chooses to use a healthcare provider who is contracted with the healthcare plan's network. Examples of out-of-pocket payments involved in cost sharing include copays, deductibles, and <b>coinsurance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Coverage A - Dwelling: Covers {{the value}} of the {{dwelling}} itself (not including the land). Typically, a <b>coinsurance</b> clause states {{that as long as the}} dwelling is insured to 80% of actual value, losses will be adjusted at replacement cost, up to the policy limits. This is in place to give a buffer against inflation. HO-4 (renter's insurance) typically has no Coverage A, although it has additional coverages for improvements.|$|E
5000|$|In-Network Provider: (U.S. term) A {{health care}} {{provider}} {{on a list of}} providers preselected by the insurer. The insurer will offer discounted <b>coinsurance</b> or co-payments, or additional benefits, to a plan member to see an in-network provider. Generally, providers in network are providers who have a contract with the insurer to accept rates further discounted from the [...] "usual and customary" [...] charges the insurer pays to out-of-network providers.|$|E
