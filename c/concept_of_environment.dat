Although the meaning of the con-cept of environment is not explicitly articulated in Orem’s work, the SCDNT rests on the philosophic system of moder-ate realism (Banfield, 2001; Taylor, Geden, Isaramalai, & Wongvatunyu, 2000). Based on this philosophic system, as well as on statements found in Orem’s work, the position of the SCDNT on the metaparadigm <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>environment</b> can be described. In terms of the theoretical structure of the SCDNT, environment is incorporated into the basic condi-tioning factors.

40|$|The {{globally}} generated <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>environment</b> {{and sustainability}} are fast gaining currency in international business discourse. Sustainability concerns are concurrently becoming significant to business planning around {{corporate social responsibility}} and integral to organizational strategies toward enhancing shareholder value. The mindset of corporate managers is {{a key factor in}} determining company approaches to sustainability. But what do corporate managers understand by sustainability? Our study explores discursive meaning negotiation surrounding the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>environment</b> and sustainability within business discourse. The study is based on qualitative interpretive research drawing from symbolic interactionism (Blumer, Symbolic interactionism: perspective and method. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1969) which postulates that meaning in discourse is an essentially contested domain dependent upon negotiation in the Habermasian tradition of mutually respectful dialogue (Habermas, The theory of communicative action: lifeworld and system: a critique of functionalist reason. Beacon Press, Boston 1987). Data from semi-structured intensive interviews of a small sample of senior corporate managers was analyzed to examine how corporate elites in India frame their approach to sustainability issues and respond to external pressures for deeper corporate responsibility. The findings point to the existence of a distinctively local narrative with strong potential for the discursive negotiation of personal and collective understanding of ethical and socio-cultural values that may help internalize broader sustainability considerations into corporate decision-making processes. 19 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{generally}} true that energy authorities always pursue optimal electrical power generation {{for use by}} the population at large. This text extends the application of the basic model of Rebelo’s Cobb-Douglas production model in order to calculate ways in which energy authorities (power companies) can generate optimal electricity using their existing equipment. This paper also applies that governments can utilize the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>Environment</b> Rent and the Contribution Theory from traditional Chinese philosophy to face the energy issues. Besides, the paper attempts to calculate and identify optimal solutions from these mathematics models, an approach which is rarely seen in the power generation journals. The use if existing equipment to optimize electricity (power) generation for the population {{will have an impact on}} economical development and electricity control. The appropriate control of power generation can effectively reduce the use of certain dangerous and polluting energy sources, and this is the main contribution of this study. The change in economic matters makes the energy strategies more difficult than before. This paper claims that governments can utilize the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>Environment</b> Rent and the Contribution Theory from traditional Chinese philosophy to deal with the energy problems and issues.

This paradigm, which I call the environment/society disconnect, infiltrates the secondary school system, leading to serious deficiencies in how students understand the social dimensions of environmental problems.
