5000|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, special <b>core</b> <b>analysis,</b> often abbreviated SCAL or SPCAN, is a laboratory procedure for conducting flow experiments on core plugs {{taken from a}} petroleum reservoir. Special <b>core</b> <b>analysis</b> is distinguished from [...] "routine or conventional core analysis" [...] by adding more experiments, in particular including measurements of two-phase flow properties, determining relative permeability and capillary pressure.|$|E

Capillary pressure curves using centrifugal method for both drainage and imbibition cycles were obtained. The capillary pressure curves show a wide range of variations indicating different pore geometries and reservoir properties.|$|R

5000|$|... “Isolated pores” in clastics, {{and most}} carbonates, make a {{negligible}} contribution to porosity. There are exceptions. In some carbonates, for example, the tests of microscopic organisms can become calcified to create significant isolated intra-particular pore space {{which is not}} connected to the inter-particular pore space available for hydrocarbon storage and flow. In such cases, <b>core</b> <b>analysis</b> will only record the inter-particular pore space, or “effective porosity”, whereas the density and neutron logs will record the total pore space. Only by crushing the rock can the <b>core</b> <b>analysis</b> yield the total porosity seen by the logs. The traditional Petroleum Engineering and <b>core</b> <b>analysis</b> definition of effective porosity {{is the sum of}} the interconnected pore space—that is, excluding isolated pores (ref. 11). Therefore in practice, {{for the vast majority of}} sedimentary rocks, this definition of effective porosity equates to total porosity.|$|E

3000|$|The {{characteristics}} and genetic mechanisms of the SPDZs in Es 4 x [...] in the Minfeng Sag were systematically studied {{based on a}} combination of core observations, thin section identification, SEM observations, fluid inclusion <b>analysis,</b> <b>core</b> X-ray <b>analysis,</b> vitrinite reflectance tests, and <b>core</b> properties <b>analysis,</b> along with additional knowledge regarding the tectonic evolution history, thermal evolution of organic matter, and history of hydrocarbon accumulation in the study area. The results of this study show that the deep SPDZs in the study area experienced the formation of significant secondary pores at shallow depth and the occupation of many primary pores by massive asphalt and pyrite from oil cracking in deeply buried paleo-reservoirs under high temperature. This achievement is significant for re-evaluating the genetic mechanisms and distribution of deep high-quality reservoirs and the deployment of hydrocarbon exploration in deep formations.|$|R
