In this study, we compare the therapeutic effect of <b>cefmenoxime</b> with that of cefbuperazone and explore the in vivo paradoxical effect of <b>cefmenoxime</b> by using an experimental infection model in mice. In an intraperitoneal infection with P. vulgaris 11, the survival rate with <b>cefmenoxime</b> was increased to 43 % at 3. 13 mg/kg but was lower at higher doses. On the other hand, cefbuperazone did not show such a paradoxical therapeutic effect. In mice infected with P. vulgaris 11, <b>cefmenoxime</b> levels in both serum and peritoneal washings were rapidly reduced and beta-lactamase activities in the peritoneal cavity were increased at higher <b>cefmenoxime</b> doses. These findings suggested that high levels of <b>cefmenoxime</b> at the infection site induced increased production of beta-lactamase, which then rapidly inactivated the antibiotic. We conclude that the paradoxical therapeutic effect of <b>cefmenoxime</b> against P. vulgaris occurs by the same mechanisms as the in vitro effect and that the high beta-lactamase inducibility and low beta-lactamase stability may account for the paradoxical therapeutic effect of <b>cefmenoxime</b> against P. vulgaris...|$|E

The MBCs of cefotiam, <b>cefmenoxime,</b> and ceftriaxone for the E. coli strain were 0. 5, 0. 125, and 0. 06 microgram/ml, respectively. Killing curves at 10 times the MBC were similar for the three cephalosporins. In serum, the elimination half-life of ceftriaxone was twice as much as the elimination half-life of cefotiam or <b>cefmenoxime</b> (2. 8 +/- 0. 45 versus 1. 4 +/- 0. 25 or 1. 3 +/- 0. 4 h, respectively). Ceftriaxone was much more effective than cefotiam. The bacterial titer in the vegetations (log 10 CFU per gram of vegetation) was 7. 56 +/- 1 with cefotiam and 2. 41 +/- 2. 6 with ceftriaxone, as their concentrations were 18 and 466 times higher, respectively, than their MBCs. Although ceftriaxone and <b>cefmenoxime</b> exhibited a similar rate of killing and percentage of protein binding, ceftriaxone was more effective than <b>cefmenoxime</b> at the same regimen of 15 mg/kg twice a day (3. 08 +/- 1. 1 versus 4. 82 +/- 3. 2 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation).

The bacterial titer measured 24 h after the fourth injection of 30 mg of ceftriaxone per kg confirmed that this regimen prevented regrowth of bacteria. These results suggest that the local antibiotic level/MBC ratio roughly correlated with the antibacterial effect and could represent an adequate basis to explain the differences observed between the drugs in vivo.

Overall, satisfactory clinical response rate was noted in 78 - 6 %, while four patients responded satisfactorily with recurrence, and two treatments were unsatisfactory. No serious adverse effects were observed. <b>Cefmenoxime</b> is a promising agent for treatment of susceptible pneumonias in critical care patients...|$|E
40|$|The minimal {{inhibitory}} {{concentrations of}} <b>cefmenoxime,</b> cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and moxalactam {{were determined by}} agar dilution for 202 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.

40|$|In this study, we were {{concerned}} with the effect of probenecid on the pharmacokinetics of 1, 000 mg of <b>cefmenoxime</b> administered over a 30 -min period by intravenous infusion. Each {{of a total of}} 10 subjects received <b>cefmenoxime</b> twice, once with and once without adjunctive probenecid. The data were fit by iterative nonlinear regression procedures to a two-compartment open pharmacokinetic model, with elimination from the central compartment. The mean calculated peak concentration, area under the curve from zero to infinity, and half-life without probenecid were 78. 1 micrograms/ml, 77. 2 micrograms. h/ml, and 1. 14 h, respectively. When <b>cefmenoxime</b> was administered with probenecid, these values were 86. 7 micrograms/ml, 158. 2 micrograms. h/ml, and 1. 78 h, respectively. Averages of about 55 and 46 % of the administered doses were recovered in urine samples collected at 0 through 24 h for doses administered without and with probenecid, respectively. The mean corrected renal drug clearance was 159 and 66 ml/min without and with probenecid, respectively. Statistical significance (P less than 0. 05) was demonstrated for the differences in beta half-life, (K/net), calculated peak concentration, area under the curve from 0 to infinity, and renal clearance, but not for K 21, K 12, volume of distribution, or alpha-phase distribution rate constant. The results {{of this study indicate that}} tubular secretion is the predominant mechanism of clearance for <b>cefmenoxime</b> and that probenecid alters the pharmacokinetics of the compound by competitively inhibiting its tubular secretion without affecting either the rate or the extent of its distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>cefmenoxime,</b> an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. It was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. It had activity {{similar to that}} of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria spp. <b>Cefmenoxime</b> had activity {{similar to that of}} cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, and Shigella. It inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at {{less than or equal to}} 0. 4 microgram/ml. <b>Cefmenoxime</b> was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against Morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90 % of isolates, 0. 1 microgram/ml.), Proteus vulgaris and Providencia spp. It was as active as ceftizoxime was against Serratia. Pseudomonas spp. and Bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90 % of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). The compound was stable to the common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of TEM. It was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by Bacteroides and Acinetobacter...|$|E
40|$|A {{beta-lactamase}} from Branhamella catarrhalis was purified by column chromatography. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed penicillins, such as ampicillin, carbenicillin, and piperacillin, {{more rapidly}} than cephalosporins. Furthermore, the enzyme hydrolyzed cefotaxime and <b>cefmenoxime.</b> The molecular weight of the enzyme was 33, 000. The pI was 5. 4...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefmenoxime</b> {{were determined}} after a 30 -min intravenous infusion of 15 mg/kg of total body weight to 33 adult subjects with normal renal function (CLCR, greater than 80 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, group I), mild renal insufficiency (CLCR, 40 to 79 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, group II), moderate renal insufficiency (CLCR, 10 to 39 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, group III), or severe renal impairment, (CLCR, less than 10 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, group IV) or to patients between hemodialysis (CLCR, less than 10 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, group V). Concentrations of <b>cefmenoxime</b> in serum and urine {{were determined by}} high-pressure liquid chromatography, and serum concentrations were fit to a two-compartment model. There was no significant relationship between creatinine clearance and either peak serum concentrations or volume of distribution at steady state. Patients in group I excreted 81 % of the dose into the urine within 24 h; recovery decreased with worsening renal function. The mean terminal half-lives in groups I to V were 1. 06, 1. 50, 3. 55, 4. 60, and 11. 4 h, respectively. There were good linear relationships between creatinine clearance, and the elimination rate and total body clearance of <b>cefmenoxime.</b> Dosage recommendations for subjects with renal insufficiency are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics, cefazolin and <b>cefmenoxime,</b> {{were administered}} in an experimental model of murine pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae {{in a way}} which enabled us to approximate the serum antibiotic concentration time course in humans. Bacterial counts during the experiments were subjected to nonlinear least-squares analyses by using a mathematical model that explained the bacterial killing by the antibiotic concentration time course and other factors associated with antimicrobial potency and bacterial growth. Cefazolin gave a killing curve that changed synchronously with the drug levels in serum; in contrast, <b>cefmenoxime</b> gave a curve that was prolonged as compared with the change in the drug levels in serum. Multiple correlation coefficients were about 0. 9, and the model worked well for bacterial count data. Parameters relating to antimicrobial potency of the drugs, bacterial growth rate, and drug distribution into the tissue were estimated numerically...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of 26 isolates of Nocardia asteroides {{to several}} antibiotics {{was determined by}} the agar dilution technique. Many currently available beta-lactam antibiotics were ineffective. Cefotaxime, <b>cefmenoxime,</b> and N-formimidoyl thienamycin were active against these strains, with 80 % minimal inhibitory concentrations of 4, 4, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Amikacin was the most effective agent tested...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that the DD-carboxypeptidase is the primary in vitro target of benzylpenicillin in Gaffkya homari (W. P. Hammes, Eur. J. Biochem. 70 : 107 - 113, 1976). To determine whether this enzyme is also the primary target of benzylpenicillin in vivo, we compared {{the effects of this}} beta-lactam, <b>cefmenoxime,</b> cephalothin, and cefoxitin on growth with their acylation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 9, the DD-carboxypeptidase. Results of three types of experiments with membrane-walls indicated that PBP 9 is this enzyme and that it is the primary in vitro target of these beta-lactams in the synthesis of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -insoluble peptidoglycan. First, the acylation of PBP 9 by these beta-lactams paralleled the inhibition of DD-carboxypeptidase and the inhibition of SDS-insoluble peptidoglycan synthesis. Second, the rate of benzylpenicillin release from PBP 9 correlated with the recovery of DD-carboxypeptidase. Third, DD-carboxypeptidase activity was detected in a protein with the same apparent molecular weight as PBP 9 after elution from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. When intact cells were treated with benzylpenicillin, the minimum growth inhibitory concentration (MGIC) correlated with the concentration of [35 S]benzylpenicillin required to acylate PBPs 6 and 9 by 50 %. When intact cells were treated with <b>cefmenoxime,</b> cephalothin, or cefoxitin, the MGICs correlated with the concentration of unlabeled beta-lactam required to reduce the subsequent binding of [35 S]benzylpenicillin by 50 % (ED 50) for PBP 6. In contrast, the MGICs of these beta-lactams did not correlate with the ED 50 s for PBP 9. PBP 9 was not acylated by <b>cefmenoxime</b> or cephalothin at their MGICs, whereas this PBP was fully acylated by cefoxitin at one-tenth of its MGIC. It is suggested that PBP 6 may be a primary target of growth inhibition by benzylpenicillin, <b>cefmenoxime,</b> cephalothin, and cefoxitin; PBP 9, the DD-carboxypeptidase, is dispensable for growth under laboratory conditions; and PBP 9 {{does not appear to be}} a primary in vivo target of these beta-lactams, even though this PBP is their primary target in vitro...|$|E
