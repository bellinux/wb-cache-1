5|$|In 1985, the New York City Health Department {{ordered that}} the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, {{heterosexual}} sex clubs such as Plato's Retreat had {{to shut down}} as well because the city had just passed a gay rights ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> gay establishments {{would have been a}} violation of that ordinance.|$|E
5|$|Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy (IORT) delivers radiation {{at the same}} time as the surgery to remove the tumour (lumpectomy). An applicator is placed in the cavity left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates radiation (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. Radiation is delivered all at once and the applicator removed before <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> incision.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{are built}} {{on top of a}} {{standard}} door <b>closer.</b> To open <b>the</b> door, the operator forces <b>the</b> <b>closer</b> in <b>the</b> opening direction.

5|$|Murray had {{designed}} {{a car for}} the 1979 season called the BT47 that had a Chaparral 2J-type box rear end with twin variable geometry fans on the rear to maximize ground effect.

5|$|The Civil Aviation Administration {{proposed}} in 1994 <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> airport along with eight other regional airports, {{because they had}} high subsidy levels.

At its <b>closing,</b> <b>the</b> school had approximately 150 students and 20 employees.|$|E
5|$|The town of Atherton, {{which lies}} on the tracks, was an early and vocal {{opponent}} of electrification. Residents opposed electrification and the proposed high-speed rail route because the overhead electrical lines would require tree removal and the town could potentially be divided in two by permanently <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> two grade crossings at Fair Oaks Lane and Watkins Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Vettel won {{the race}} from pole position, ahead of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in second and Vettel's Ferrari {{teammate}} Kimi Räikkönen in third.

5|$|A major 18-month {{redevelopment}} of {{the square}} led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides {{of the square}}, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace {{in front of the}} National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.|$|E
5|$|A {{sea anemone}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead. After opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which represented the affected Wheeling Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, {{due in part to}} the work delays.|$|E

5|$|BART {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. systems of any size to be {{substantially}} automated. Routing and dispatching of trains, and adjustments for schedule recovery are controlled by a combination of computer and human supervision at BART's Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the Kaiser Center in Downtown Oakland. Station-to-station train movement, including speed control and maintenance of separation between successive trains, is entirely automatic under normal operation, the operator's routine responsibilities being issuing announcements, <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> doors after stations stops, and monitoring the track ahead for hazards. In unusual circumstances the operator controls the train manually at reduced speed.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{scored a}} goal {{each in the}} second and third periods. In the second period, an early {{tripping}} penalty against Ottawa's Mike Fisher put the Flyers on the power play, during which Kim Johnsson extended Philadelphia's lead to 4–1. Ottawa received another penalty less than a minute later, which sent Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding. A Flyers penalty against Radovan Somik for slashing Martin Havlat resulted in a power play goal for the Senators' Zdeno Chara, <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second penalty of the game, for high-sticking.|$|E
5|$|Designed as the {{commercial}} heart of San Marco, the square had declined seriously by the 1970s, with many businesses <b>closing.</b> <b>The</b> original, compass-themed fountain was demolished. In the 1990s the City of Jacksonville undertook a major renovation and streetscaping project, which included restoring the fountain with three lion statues {{inspired by the}} Piazza San Marco. Since then, the square has become a popular commercial destination with many shops, restaurants and bars. In 2013 the square underwent another renovation project that rerouted the streets and expanded the small park in the center, named Balis Park, into a larger pedestrian green space.|$|E
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby.
