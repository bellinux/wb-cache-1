Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to <b>consequent.</b> Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s rising shore costs, dock workers strikes, {{restrictive}} practices {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic, and subsidised competition from American shipping lines, persuaded Manchester Liners to switch its future fleet to container ships only.

6000|$|... § 2. The {{different}} antecedents and <b>consequents</b> being, then, {{supposed to}} be, {{so far as}} the case requires, ascertained and discriminated from one another, we are to inquire which is connected with which. In every instance which comes under our observation, there are many antecedents and many <b>consequents.</b> If those antecedents could not be severed from one another except in thought, or if those <b>consequents</b> never were found apart, it would be impossible for us to distinguish (a posteriori at least) the real laws, or to assign to any cause its effect, or to any effect its cause. To do so, we must be able to meet with some of the antecedents apart from the rest, and observe what follows from them; or some of the <b>consequents,</b> and observe by what they are preceded. We must, in short, follow the Baconian rule of varying the circumstances. This is, indeed, only the first rule of physical inquiry, and not, as some have thought, the sole rule; but it is the foundation of all the rest.|$|R

40|$|Fuzzy {{inference}} control uses fuzzy sets {{to describe}} the antecedents and <b>consequents</b> of If-Then rules. However, most surveys show the antecedents and <b>consequents</b> are uncertain sets rather than fuzzy sets. This fact provides a motivation to invent an uncertain inference control method.

As an example, an uncertain inference controller for balancing an inverted pendulum system is successfully designed.

5|$|From {{this point}} Fort Glanville's {{significance}} declined rapidly. Fort Largs was equipped in 1889 with two 6inch breech-loading disappearing guns which outranged Glanville's armament. The decline was also linked {{to changes in}} Port Adelaide's maritime facilities and the <b>consequent</b> northward movement of anchored and berthed vessels. During the 1880s the Port River was deepened enabling large ships to sail up and berth, rather than the former practice of anchoring off-shore.|$|E

30|$|Uncertain system, {{proposed}} by Liu [16], {{is a function}} from its inputs to outputs based on the uncertain inference rule. Usually, an uncertain system consists of five parts: inputs that are crisp data to be fed into the uncertain system; a rule-base that contains a set of if-then rules provided by the experts; an uncertain inference rule that infers uncertain <b>consequents</b> from the uncertain antecedents; an expected value operator that converts the uncertain <b>consequents</b> to crisp values; and outputs that are crisp data yielded from the expected value operator.|$|R
30|$|Here, we {{introduce}} {{concepts of}} the uncertain inference and uncertain system. Inference rules are the key points of the inference systems. In fuzzy systems, CRI approach [22], Mamdani inference rules [23] and Takagi-Sugeno inference rules [24] {{are the most common}} used inference rules. Fuzzy if-then inference rules use fuzzy sets to describe the antecedents and the <b>consequents.</b> Unlike fuzzy inference, both antecedents and <b>consequents</b> in uncertain inference are characterized by uncertain sets. Uncertain inference [16] is a process of deriving consequences from human knowledge via uncertain set theory. First, we introduce the following inference rule.|$|R

5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10).

Moreover, all 152mm howitzers were excluded from divisional artillery. As a result, there was no series production of 152mm howitzers during 1942.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to analyze}} the attributes, antecedents and <b>consequents</b> of the family conference concept. Method: Walker and Avante's method for concept {{analysis}} and the stages of the integrative review process, with a selection of publications in the PubMed, Cinahl and Lilacs databases focusing on the family conference theme {{in the context of}} palliative care. Results: the most cited antecedents were the presence of doubts and the need to define a care plan. Family reunion and working instrument were evidenced as attributes. With respect to <b>consequents,</b> to promote the effective communication and to establish a plan of consensual action were the most remarkable elements. Final considerations: the scarcity of publications on the subject was observed, as well as and the limitation of the empirical studies to the space of intensive therapy. Thus, by analyzing the attributes, antecedents and <b>consequents</b> of the concept it was possible to follow their evolution and to show their efficacy and effectiveness as a therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{sketch a}} logic-based {{framework}} in which computation consists of performing actions to generate a sequence of states, {{with the purpose of}} making a set of reactive rules in the logical form antecedents � <b>consequents</b> all true. The antecedents of the rules are conjunctions of past or present conditions and events, and the <b>consequents</b> of the rules are disjunctions of conjunctions of future conditions and actions. The antecedents can be viewed as complex/composite events, and the <b>consequents</b> as complex/composite/macro actions or processes. States are represented by sets of atomic sentences, and can be viewed as global variables, relational databases, Herbrand models, or mental representations of the real world. Events, including actions, transform one state into another. The operational semantics maintains only a single, destructively updated current state, whereas the model-theoretic semantics treats the entire sequence of states, events and actions as a single model. The model-theoretic semantics can be viewed as the problem of generating a model that makes all the reactive rules true...|$|R
