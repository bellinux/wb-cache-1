40|$|We {{investigate}} the dramatic 2008 – 2009 trade collapse using microdata {{from a small}} open economy, Belgium. Belgian trade essentially fell because of reduced quantities and unit prices, rather than fewer firms involved in international transactions, fewer trading partners per firm, or fewer products traded. Our difference-in-difference results point to a fall in the demand for tradables – especially durables and capital goods – as the main driver of the recent collapse. Finance and involvement in global value chains played only minor roles. Firm-level exports-to-turnover and imports-to-intermediates – as well as exports-to-production and imports-to-production – ratios reveal a comparable collapse of domestic and <b>cross-border</b> operations. <b>Access</b> to credit affected both types of activities to the same extent.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{opportunities}} and challenges that Eastern African farmers face in accessing domestic, regional and international markets. With rising population and incomes, domestic markets offer great opportunities for farmers. However, because of structural, institutional and organizational constraints, small scale rural farmers may not benefit much from domestic urban markets unless they are organized and trained to meet the high quality product standards demanded by urban consumers and supermarkets. ECA countries stand to gain more by investing in commodities that are consumed within the region, than from traditional cash crops destined for international markets. Regional integration offers opportunities for larger markets and efficiency gains and this is happening, although countries still {{have to do more}} to ease the flow of goods across the region, including joint investments in infrastructure to link markets, harmonizing trade policies, and removing trade barriers that limit <b>cross-border</b> trade. <b>Access</b> to international markets remains constrained because of trade distorting practices in developed countries, especially tariff peaks and tariff escalation, domestic support to their farmers, and export subsidies. All these practices render African products uncompetitive, discourage investments in agro-industries, thus limiting growth in jobs and incomes, and slow down the pace of economic growth and overall poverty reduction. African countries stand to gain more from liberal trade policies than from aid from developed countries.

40|$|Background: Communication {{with health}} care {{providers}} represents {{an essential part of}} access to health care for the over 230 million cross-border migrants around the world. In this article, we explore the complexity of health communication from the perspective of cross-border migrants seeking antenatal care in Cape Town, South Africa in order to highlight the importance of high quality medical interpretation. Methods: As part of a broader study of migrant maternal and infant nutrition, we conducted a secondary data analysis of semi-structured in-depth interviews (N = 23) with Congolese (n = 7), Somali (n = 8) and Zimbabwean (n = 8) women living in Cape Town, as well as nine focus group discussions (including men: n = 3 and women: n = 6) were conducted with migrant Somalis, Congolese, and Zimbabweans (N = 48). We first used content analysis to gather all data related to language and communication. We then analysed this data thematically. Results: Zimbabwean participants described how the inability to speak the local South African language (IsiXhosa) gave rise to labelling and stereotyping by healthcare staff. Congolese and Somali participants described medical procedures, including tubal ligation, which were performed without consent. Partners often tried {{to play the role of}} interpreter, which resulted in loss of income and non-professional medical interpretation. Participants’ highlighted fears over unwanted procedures or being unable to access care. Challenges of communication without a common language (and without professional medical interpretation), rather than outright denial of care by healthcare professionals, mediated these encounters. Conclusion: Although there are several factors impeding <b>cross-border</b> migrants’ <b>access</b> to health care, effective communication is a prerequisite for quality care. Free-to-patient professional medical interpretation would not only benefit migrant populations but would benefit the broader community where language and health literacy are barriers to accessing health care.

40|$|Purpose - To {{assess the}} {{compatibility}} of the UN Convention's provisions on {{the validity of}} anti-assignment clauses with English contract law. Design/methodology/approach - A {{review of the literature}} of the assignment of receivables is presented. Analyses and unpicks some of the central, and frequently unarticulated but implicit, policy imperatives that the law is tasked with in balancing the field of the assignment of receivables. Discusses the recurrent theme in the argument about liquidity and cost of credit and the need for the workings of private law to foster the former and lower the latter. Examines the regulation of contractual prohibitions in English law, and the effectiveness of an assignment made notwithstanding an anti-assignment clause under the UN Convention. Compares and contrasts the UN's approach to this matter with English law in order to assess the compatibility of the latter. Findings - It is argued that, in order to facilitate the flow of <b>cross-border</b> credit and <b>access</b> to lower cost credit, anti-assignment clauses should be rendered ineffective and assignments should be given effectiveness notwithstanding contractual prohibitions.

This paper {{argues that the}} situation is made more complex by the lack of a common general frame of reference for comparing objectives and concerns; this reinforces the risk-aversion in government organisations. Attempts to develop general international data access strategies therefore collapse to sui generis bilateral agreements of limited strategic value. One way forward is to decouple implementation from strategic principles. A principles-based risk-assessment framework, using popular multiple-component data security models, allows decisions about access to focus on objectives; similarly, secure facilities could be developed to standards independent of dataset-specific negotiations. In an international context, proposals for classification systems are easier to agree than specific multilateral implementations. Moreover, a principles-based approach can be aligned with organisational goals, allowing countries to signal strategic intentions to others without the need for explicit commitment. The paper uses examples from the UK, US and cross-European projects to show how such principles-based standards have worked on a within-country basis and may help to resolve immediate practical issues...|$|E

Trade liberalization could complement other financial reforms by enhancing the efficiency, quality, and variety of financial services and by encouraging improvement of financial regulations and practices.

The design of trade policy should therefore emphasize the nexus with the macroeconomic framework and other financial sector policies, especially prudential and capital account regulations. It should also differentiate between types of trade. National reforms should be coordinated with multilateral trade agreements and initiatives on international financial architecture.

The Member States face new challenges concerning the possibility of excluding economically inactive European Union (EU) citizens from other Member States from special non-contributory social benefits. However, if on one hand we have the need to protect the financial sustainability of the Member States, as non-active EU citizens from other Member States can represent a burden on their social assistance systems, on the other hand, we also need to respect one of the EU’s most basilar principles: the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality. The CJEU has decided that the economically nonactive citizens of other Member States can only claim equal treatment in regard to access to social benefits, when they have a right of residence under Directive 2004 / 38 in the host Member State. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} influence of international risks, {{and the level of}} resources of South African construction companies on entry decisions made to <b>access</b> <b>cross‐border</b> African construction markets. The study further investigates how the resources of South African construction companies and their decisions to enter into African construction markets, interact to mitigate the perceived impact of risks encountered in these markets. The study adopted a convergence of the mixed methods research approach where quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently from multiple sources. These data include a questionnaire survey distributed to construction companies registered on Grades 8 and 9 of the Construction Industry Development Board (cidb) Register of Contractors; interviews conducted with construction companies having international markets experience, as well as an assessment of annual and financial reports. Data obtained through the survey were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The model developed was validated using a partial least squares structural equation modelling technique. Thematic content analysis was adopted in analysing the data obtained from the assessments of company documents and interviews. The study reveals that the level of revenue, the assets, and the number of employees of South African construction companies with cross-border experience, influence the perceived impact of political, social, procurement, design and construction related-risks in foreign markets. It also emerged that the decisions on entry modes were significantly influenced by the perceived impact of all classes of risk. The study established that significant positive interactions exist between assets and joint venture companies; joint venture projects and branch offices and companies; and that international experience are significantly related to strategic alliance as an entry mode. The positive interactions between resources and entry decisions made mitigate the perceived impact of risk in African construction markets. The study makes a significant contribution to the body of knowledge on international construction, by establishing an all-inclusive risk profile of the African construction market. Also, it establishes that the resources of multinational construction companies influences their perception of risks, and that the perceived impact of risks influences cross‐border entry decisions made to access foreign markets to mitigate the risks encountered. A risk-based entry decision model as a strategic tool, helps multinational construction companies to leverage their resources, as well as providing an adequate perception of risks when deciding on an appropriate strategic entry mode which will mitigate the risks encountered in crossborder markets...|$|R
40|$|Luxembourg {{has been}} a country of {{immigration}} for more than 50 years. Located {{in the heart of}} Europe, it holds a strong attraction for EU citizens and nationals from countries all around the world, who {{play a central role in}} the national economy, making an important contribution to the population growth and the labour market. Over the course of 2015, Luxembourg’s population has continued its steady growth of approximately 13. 000 people per year, increasing by 2, 36 %, from 562. 958 on 1 st January 2015 to 576. 249 on 1 st January 2016. Foreign citizens have continued to play an essential role in Luxembourg’s population growth, both in terms of net migration and births. The total net migration amounted to + 11. 159 individuals in 2015, which signifies a surplus of arrivals over departures. Foreign EU citizens accounted for 76, 1 %; third-country nationals represented 32, 9 %, while Luxembourgish nationals’ contribution was negative, at - 9 %. The number of births in 2015 was the highest on record, equal to that in 2013, with 6. 115 births in total. Foreigners contributed a birth surplus of 2. 150 to Luxembourg’s natural increase, while a birth deficit of - 18 was recorded for Luxembourgish nationals. 2015 also marked a record year regarding naturalisations, with Belgians remaining the citizens that obtain citizenship most frequently, followed by the French and the Portuguese. On 1 st January 2016, 46, 7 % of Luxembourg’s residents were foreigners. Representing 34, 6 % of the total foreign population, Portuguese remained the most represented nationality, followed by France (15, 5 %) and Italy (7, 5 %), while the most numerous third-country nationals were Montenegrins. Due to the war in Syria and the influx of applicants for international protection that followed, the Syrian population living in Luxembourg showed the highest proportional increase during 2015, growing by 461, 5 % from January 2015 to January 2016. A look at Luxembourg’s labour market also reveals the central role that foreigners play in the national economy. In the first quarter of 2016, residents of Luxembourg represented 55 % of the country’s salaried workforce. Of these, 27, 5 % were Luxembourgish nationals, while EU nationals represented 24, 2 % and third-country nationals 3, 3 %. Cross-border workers from France, Belgium and Germany represented 45 % of all salaried workers in Luxembourg. They mainly work in the manufacturing industries, construction and commerce. A majority of recruitments in the HORECA sector are of foreign residents. Third-country nationals who do not benefit from free movement must be issued with a residence permit in order to enter Luxembourg. An increase in first issues of residence permits was recorded for most categories compared to the preceding year, which had experienced a decrease in almost all categories. In 2015, residence permits were most frequently issued in the “family member”, “salaried worker” and “European Blue Card” categories. 2015 was marked by a significant increase in the number of applications for international protection, which has more than doubled when compared to 2014 (2. 447 applications in 2015). While there was a strong increase at the end of 2015, the trend slowed down in 2016. Nonetheless, the number of applications for international protection remains higher than levels in 2013 / 2014. Most applications were from Syrians and Iraqis (27, 3 % and 22 % respectively), who accounted for only 9 % and 1 % respectively in 2014. Moreover, both the rate of status recognition (refugee and subsidiary protection status) and of return decision increased. In 2015, Luxembourg pledged to relocate 557 individuals to Luxembourg in the framework of the EU Council decision to relocate 160. 000 international protection applicants from Greece and Italy. Within this framework, 114 refugees have been relocated from Greece and 20 from Italy up until mid-August 2016. Furthermore, 46 refugees were resettled from Turkey in 2015, followed by 52 further refugees as a result of Luxembourg’s pledge to resettle 194 refugees from Turkey in the context of the EU-Turkey agreement of March 2016. Additionally, 44 Syrians were welcomed in 2015 following a request for assistance by German authorities. Faced with the increased inflow of applicants for international protection, an emergency reception plan was developed in 2015. The plan included the establishment of first-instance reception centres and the strengthening of the capacity in human resources of both the Luxembourg Reception and Integration Agency (OLAI) and the Directorate of Immigration, which is under the authority of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The OLAI also strengthened the collaboration with stakeholders at inter-ministerial and local levels. A strong focus has also been put on integration, where major developments include the setting up of integration projects by the municipalities in the context of the ‘Communal Integration Plan’ project and the creation of Luxembourg’s Centre for Integration and Cohesion (LISKO), a service supporting the beneficiaries of international protection in their process of integration in Luxembourgish society. Over the course of 2015 and 2016, Luxembourg continued to transpose and implement several EU directives. The law of 18 th December 2015 on the reception of applicants for international protection and temporary protection transposes Directive 2013 / 33 /EU (re-cast reception conditions) into national law. The law of 18 th December 2015 on international protection and temporary protection transposed Directive 2013 / 32 /EU (re-cast procedure), establishing the procedures for granting and withdrawing international and subsidiary protection and the standardisation of the content of this protection. The bill implementing Directive 2013 / 55 /EU on the recognition of professional qualifications was introduced into parliament in 2015 and the bill implementing Directive 2014 / 36 /EU on seasonal workers and Directive 2014 / 66 /EU on intra-corporate transferees and investors’ residence permits was introduced in 2016. Regarding the transposition of the Blue Card Directive, a Government Decree was issued on 22 nd May 2015 establishing the professions to which the lower salary threshold for hiring highly qualified workers applies. On the national level, a number of legislative changes address some of the challenges set by Luxembourg’s heterogeneity. The bill no. 6410 on youth, introduced into parliament on 6 th February 2015, gives <b>cross-border</b> workers <b>access</b> to the care service voucher system which was previously only available to Luxembourgish residents. Bill no. 6893 on the recognition of qualifications was introduced in parliament in October 2015. At the referendum of 7 th June 2015, the proposal to extend the right to vote of non-Luxembourgish residents was rejected by a large majority, who argued in favour of the acquisition of nationality as the more appropriate way to acquire the right to vote. Consequently, the government took steps towards reforming the law on nationality in order to soften the requirements for acquisition of nationality, and in this way enable the broadening of participation in elections. Bill no. 6977 on nationality was introduced in parliament on 24 th March 2016. It includes the reduction of the required duration of residency from seven to five years and the reintroduction of procedure of option in cases of close links with Luxembourg. The level of fluency in Luxembourgish required has become a central focus of the debate on the bill on nationality, some fearing that linguistic requirements would become an obstacle to foreigners’ acquisition of nationality, others underlining the command of the language as a central factor in integration and thus also in the acquisition of nationality. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Pyrenees are a 400 -km-long {{mountain}} range located in southwest Europe along the French–Spanish border, and constitute {{one of the}} most earthquake-prone regions of mainland France and Spain. At the “observational” level, the Pyrenean region is monitored by several seismological networks {{on both sides of the}} French -Spanish border, counting in total around 120 seismic stations (of different types). Thanks to a progressive decrease of constraints associated to real-time seismology (generalization of low-cost robust data-transfer technologies, continuous increasing of data storage capacities, etc.), a growing proportion of these stations are progressively called to evolve toward real-time data transmission. Moreover, a recent project called “SISPyr” (www. sispyr. eu), involving the main owners of Pyrenean seismic stations, has notably allowed the establishment of a real-time pooling process of Pyrenean seismological data resulting in an improvement of the coverage of the massif. At the “operational” level also, each country has its own civil protection organization as well as specific earthquake crisis plans. However, big earthquakes in the Pyrenees can impact the two (or the three) borders. Moreover, systemic cross-border interactions are multiples (transport network, energy lifelines, hospitals <b>access,</b> <b>cross-border</b> populations, etc.). Rapid response overviewExperience of past earthquakes as well as "earthquake" civil-protection’s exercises underlines the need for crisis managers to have at their disposal rapid-response tools able to assess consequences caused by earthquakes, even for moderate events. SisPyr partnership has developed tools to meet these operational needs, in order to automatically and quickly ( 15 min) produce maps of seismic ground-motions. These “Shakemaps” integrate both seismological real-time data coming from observatories and internet citizen data (web-questionnaires). Exploratory tracks are also being considered in order to enrich the information feedback from the field by using techniques of "crowd-sourcing", thanks to the use of distributed "citizen" sensors or of social-networks. To go further in taking account operational requirements related to the management of seismic crisis, work is being done in order to provide the authorities with a quick assessment of the human tolls (potential victims or damages, needs for shelters) that may control their actions, structured within reports dedicated to civil-protection teams. Need for geospatial ICT supportMulti-actors contextPyrenean region disposes of several seismological networks on both sides of the Franco-Spanish border: CEA-LDG, OMP and BRGM for the French part (with stations belonging to the Seismic Monitoring National Network – RéNaSS, and to the French Permanent Accelerometric network – RAP), and the Spanish and the Catalan seismological surveys (respectively IGN and ICGC) for the Spanish part. It is also to notice the presence of a broad-band station in Andorra managed by Andorran Studies Institute (IEA). In case of earthquake, several of these institutes produce their own assessment of magnitude/location, while alert itself is assigned in France to CEA-LDG, and in Spain to IGN. At the same time, in case of great earthquakes, international organizations like JRC and CSEM (Europe), and even USGS (US), produces information bulletins, which are not really followed by national/regional crisis management community. Moreover in France Internet citizen data (macroseismic intensities) are collected by another institution, BCSF. In Spain these citizen data are collected both by ICGC and IGN. The Sispyr’s Shakemap system is triggered by alerts coming from IGN (disregarding ones coming from CEA-LDG), and uses IGN, ICGC, OMP and BRGM seismic data, as well as IGN, ICGC and BCSF citizen data. Input data interoperability Due to the multiplicity of data-producers, question of interoperability of input data is critical. Regarding real-time collection of instrumental data, different protocols are used (NAQS, Seedlink and Scream!), corresponding to well-known or accepted “standards” in the scientific community. In any case, the goal was to converge to shakemaps needed input files format and standards. Output data Shakemaps produces intensity maps, as image format or kmz files. This restitution format is not really adapted to crisis managers which work with own GIS platforms. Otherwise, intensity maps are still quite difficult to be interpreted in local-regional crisis management centers, for people which are not familiar with seismic risk. Thus, the incoming step is to produce automatically a “human tolls bulletins” estimating the level of the earthquake according to estimated potential victims or no-shelters populations. These bulletins follow a “light color code”. Red color signification for USGS, European Commission, Spanish and French Civil protection would be the same? Which coherence with other natural risks? (cf. discussions about natural risks zones maps in INSPIRE). Limits-Is Web diffusion of bulletins and maps well adapted for crisis management community?-How communicate in understandable and interoperable way information about outputs’ uncertainties? This issue also questions the notion of responsibility of broadcasters of these data with respect to crisis managers?-In case of significant earthquake, international organizations produce information bulletins, which are not really followed by national/regional crisis management community. -Input data interoperability: de facto standards are used, but are they international or own?-Output data: how to allow reuse of outputs...|$|R
40|$|I want {{to address}} a set of issues I believe are {{fundamental}} {{to the future of}} the world economy. And I am not referring to the global economic crisis. Rather I am referring to the issues surrounding improved <b>cross-border</b> <b>access</b> to the world’s markets for goods and services. The WTO Doha Development Round negotiations stalled again in December 2008 and little has changed since then. The global economic crisis has shifted public attention away from these negotiations. This is quite understandable but we must not allow them to recede as, arguably, the success or failure of these negotiations will have as much effect on the world economy in the medium and longer run as the pace of recovery from the current crisis. In Sections 1 - 4 I present the case for trade liberalisation as the main engine of growth of the world economy and review progress towards the goal of free trade through multilateral and regional negotiations. Section 5 draws out some of the implications of this analysis for East Asia. 1. Free trade is best The unanimous view of trade economists today is that free trade is the best policy fo...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cross-border</b> <b>access</b> to {{a variety}} of data such as market information, {{strategic}} information, or customer-related information defines the daily business of many global companies, including financial institutions. These companies are obliged by law to keep a data processing legal for all offered services. They need to fulfill different security objectives specified by the legislation. Therefore, they control access to prevent unauthorized users from using data. Those security objectives, for example confidentiality or secrecy, are often defined in the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language that promotes interoperability between different systems. In this paper, we show the necessity of incorporating the requirements of legislation into access control. Based on the work flow in a banking scenario we describe a variety of available contextual information and their interrelations. Different from other access control systems our main focus is on law-compliant cross-border data access. By including legislation directly into access decisions, this lawfulness can be ensured. We also describe our information model to demonstrate how these policies can be implemented into an existing network and how the components and contextual information interrelate. Finally, we outline an event flow for a request made from a remote user exemplifying how such a system decides about access. Comment: IEEE Publication Format, [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the political {{impact of the}} European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) case law concerning the free movement of EU citizens and their <b>cross-border</b> <b>access</b> to social benefits. Public debates about ‘welfare migration’ or ‘social tourism’ often fluctuate between populist hysteria and outright denial, but they obscure the real political and legal issues at stake: that ECJ jurisprudence incrementally broadens EU citizens’ opportunities to claim social benefits abroad while narrowing member states’ scope to regulate and restrict access to national welfare systems. We argue that legal uncertainty challenges national administrations in terms of workload and rule-of-law standards, while domestic legislative reforms increasingly shift the burden of legal uncertainty to EU migrants by raising evidentiary requirements and threatening economically inactive EU citizens with expulsion. We illustrate this argument first with {{a brief overview of}} the EU’s legal framework, highlighting the ambiguity of core concepts from the Court’s case law, and then with empirical evidence from the UK, Germany and Austria, analyzing similar domestic responses to the ECJ’s jurisprudence. We conclude that EU citizenship law, while promising to build the union from below on the basis of equal legal entitlements, may, in fact, risk rousing further nationalism and decrease solidarity across the union...|$|E
40|$|The main {{research}} question of this thesis is: How can <b>cross-border</b> <b>access</b> to human genetic resources, such as blood or DNA samples, be governed to achieve equity for developing countries? Access to and benefit sharing for human biological resources is not regulated through an international legal framework {{such as the}} Convention on Biological Diversity, which applies only to plants, animals and micro-organisms as well as associated traditional knowledge. This legal vacuum for the governance of human genetic resources can be attributed (in part) to the concern that benefit sharing might provide undue inducements to research participants and their communities. This thesis shows that: (a) 	Benefit sharing is crucial to avoiding the exploitation of developing countries in genomic research. (b) 	With functioning research ethics committees, undue inducement {{is less of a}} concern in genetic research than in other medical research (e. g. clinical trials). (c) 	Concerns remain over research involving indigenous populations and some recommendations are provided. In drawing its conclusions, the thesis resolves a highly pressing topic in global bioethics and international law. Originally, it combines bioethical argument with jurisprudence, in particular reference to the law of equity and the legal concepts of duress (coercion), unconscionable dealing, and undue influence...|$|E
40|$|Extract: This chapter {{analyses}} Directive 2012 / 28 /EU of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council of 25 October 2012 {{on certain}} permitted uses of orphan works. This Directive {{is the result of}} a legislative process that addresses the legal situation where authors or rights holders of copyright protected works cannot be identified or located. It does this by establishing the conditions under which the orphan work status can be declared throughout the EU region, and under which such works can legitimately be reproduced and made available online. Without lengthy consideration of the actual risk and commercial consequences for a cultural heritage institution to be sued by an author who has found out that his work was considered to be an orphan, the EU accepted that 'soft-law' initiatives such as the 2006 Recommendation on the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural content and preservation were not sufficient to address the orphan works issue in an appropriate manner. Despite the Recommendation, only a few Member States have implemented orphan works legislation. Moreover, developments at the national level were circumscribed by the fact that they were not capable of addressing the issues posed by the online environment as they limited online access to citizens resident in their national territories. This was ignoring the cultural and educational potential offered by <b>cross-border</b> <b>access</b> of content...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} {{proposed new}} Copyright Directive {{was released on}} 14 September 2016. It {{has been described by}} EU law-makers as the pillar of the copyright package promised by the European Commission (EC), to be delivered before the end of Mr. Juncker's mandate. In its Communication of 6 May 2015, the EC had stressed “the importance to enhance <b>cross-border</b> <b>access</b> to copyright-protected content services, facilitate new uses in the fields of research and education, and clarify the role of online services in the distribution of works and other subject-matter. ” The proposed Copyright Directive is thus a key measure aiming to address two of these three issues. However it is not without shortfalls. We have therefore decided to publicly express our concerns and send an open letter to the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council to urge them to re-assess the new provisions dealing with mandatory filtering of user-generated content {{in the light of the}} CJEU case law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In a more extended statement, we examine in details the text of both the explanatory memorandum and the Directive itself. Our conclusions are: 1. A comprehensive re-assessment of Article 13 and Recital 39 in the light of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the E-commerce Directive (in particular Article 15) including CJEU case law is needed, as the proposed Copyright Directive does not expressly address the issue of its compatibility with both of these texts. 2. Recital 38 does not clarify the domain and effect of Article 13. Rather, it creates confusion as it goes against settled CJEU case law (relating to Articles 14 and 15 of the E-commerce Directive and Article 3 of the Infosoc Directive). Recital 38 should therefore be deleted or substantially re-drafted/re-phrased. If the EU wants to introduce a change in this regard it should clearly justify its choice. In any case, a recital in the preamble to a directive is not an appropriate tool to achieve this effect. We hope that this exercise will prove useful for the debate that has now begun both in the European Parliament and in the Council...|$|E
