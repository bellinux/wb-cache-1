The study analyzed information management at the school level by focusing on data collection, record keeping, data communication, and information use. The approach to thus study involved survey research at the school level and qualitative research at district level. The study revealed that the documents which teachers regularly updated were those that are required. As for record-keeping practice at school level, the factor of rural and urban location influenced the updating of class registers.

A total of ten groups were formed from the <b>class</b> <b>register.</b> A common group work was posted to the students via their ulink, an online technology for lecturers to communicate academic information with students at this university. The information consisted of students’ instructions, the questions, date and venue for the presentation. Findings: The students asked questions to the groups that had presented their group work. Furthermore, working in groups led to class involvement of the students. Limitations: The use of observation in this study was a limitation.

In this sense, the teaching profession is no exception. If we think back to our primary school days, we may note that our teachers began by only using overhead projectors and transparencies, later on incorporating computer and LCD projector. Technology has changed as much in the case of passing knowledge on to students as it has with recording school documentation. In the past, teachers filled out the <b>class</b> <b>register</b> and grade book in class, but now this documentation is filled out with the aid of computer and pre-prepared programmes. The main goal of the empirical research in the diploma work is to verify teachers' opinions on the use of electronic class registers and grade books.

The data processing showed {{that a majority of the}} teachers had a positive attitude towards the use of electronic class registers and grade books. Variations in the statements appeared depending on gender and age as well as the respondent's period of employment. Therefore, I have determined that male teachers are more inclined towards the use of the electronic method than female teachers and that the respondents' age and period of employment also influence their opinions on the use of electronic class registers and grade books. ...|$|E

Design: controlled prospective educational intervention. Setting: community. Participants: the entire Year 6 population (402 pupils) of 2 randomly chosen rural school districts of the province of Mantua (Italy); of these, we took 108 (selected according to position in the <b>class</b> <b>register)</b> : 82. 4 % completed the study; 402 parents and 124 teachers entered the study, 77. 1 % and 37. 1 % respectively completed it. Intervention: instructive meeting and written material for teachers, and a leaflet for parents on backpack management. Main outcome measures: backpack weight and content; back pain; subjective perceptions of backpack load; packing and carrying methods; backpack load: importance, management and education; backpack characteristics. We obtained a statistically significant reduction in the backpack weight {{in each of the}} groups (study 11. 2 %; control 7. 9 % - not a statistically significant difference); 90. 1 % of the material carried is necessary. Backpacks are considered a problem by 95. 1 % of parents, 73 % of teachers, and 60. 3 % of pupils. Backpack weight: 8. 75 +/- 1. 26 kg (19. 9 +/- 5. 3 % of body weight); fatigue during backpack carrying: 72. 7 %; back pain life prevalence: 58. 4 %; fatigue during backpack carrying and considering backpacks a problem were associated with back pain (odds ratios 4. 4 and 5).

40|$|Hitherto, the {{language}} of the Methodist revival has received only moderate, and mainly descriptive, attention. A present-day study should move beyond description and approach the phenomenon from a «critical» angle, thus allowing the linguist to assess the indictments which have branded Methodist discourse as manipulative. Critics have stereotyped Methodism as an oppressive, reactionary discourse forced upon illiterate audiences by insidious rhetorical devices. The guiding hypothesis which underlies such analyses seems to be that the success of Methodism, if any, was not a natural and voluntary response to a religious appeal, but the effect of a deliberate, manipulative process which cynically sought to trick people into a belief system which conditioned their world-view and behaviour patterns, allegedly on behalf of industrial interests which required an obedient and submissive work force. The investigation of the workings of Methodist discourse in its many textualised and non-textualised aspects allows one to understand the widespread popular impact of the movement in both linguistic and extralinguistic terms. The discourse analysis which constitutes the bulk of this study shows that Methodism in its early Wesleyan stage was remarkably efficient in providing a multi-modal discourse which managed to reach the working classes and to answer their needs and aspirations. The widespread popular response to the message in certain areas may be explained in terms of natural audience motivation, and there is little if any ground, notwithstanding Wesley's particular use of language and his explicitly conservative attitude, to hypothesize a deliberate manipulative socio-political intent {{on the part of the}} Wesleyans. The critical analysis shows that Wesley's discourse did, however, contain the seeds of a work ethic which lay the message open to misunderstanding and misuse in post-Wesleyan Methodism. Under the influence of increasing embourgeoisement and denominational self-interest, some branches of later Methodism progressively abandoned the Wesleyan perspective, and may be suspected of sustaining capitalist interests in some parts of their discourse; but the Methodist revival as a whole cannot be indicted with intentional manipulation of the working masses.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The study examined the influence of conditions of test administration upon shy children's performance on tests of vocabulary. Prior research had established that shy children differ from their peers not only {{in their use of}} language in routine social encounters, but also in formal assessments of their language development, including psychometric tests of vocabulary. This has been interpreted in terms of deficits in shy children's communicative competence. An alternative hypothesis is that shy children are more anxious when tested. The two hypotheses were tested within a sample of 9 - 10 year-olds by examining children's performance when they undertook tests either individually with an examiner or among their peers within the familiar classroom setting. Care was taken to remedy some shortcomings in the design of previous studies, for example in the identification of shy children. Shy children performed significantly more poorly in the individual condition relative to the group condition, providing support for the social anxiety hypothesis. A younger cohort of children (aged 4 - 5 years) completed the vocabulary and mental arithmetic tests, but differences between shy and less shy were not significant. Nevertheless there was a trend for shy children to perform less well than their peers in all conditions. These findings are of theoretical interest but also have practical implications for testing children, especially as the assessment of young children is increasingly common in schools. Main Topics : The data set includes the scores on tests of vocabulary and mental arithmetic administered to 320 children, 80 aged 4 - 5 years and 240 aged 9 - 10 years. Half of the children are identified as shy on the basis of teachers' ratings and half are chosen from the <b>class</b> <b>register</b> to serve as the comparison group. Data are coded for age and shyness and scores on teachers' shyness checklist items are included for all children. Items were submitted to reliability analysis and a total shyness score was generated for each child and included as a variable. Scores are provided for the 4 - 5 year-old children on two vocabulary tests and a mental arithmetic test, and also on standardised attainment tests that had been administered by teachers in class on a separate occasion. Scores are provided for the 9 - 10 year-olds on one vocabulary test and a mental arithmetic test, together with scores on standardised assessments of language and number administered in the classroom by teachers on a separate occasion. Children in this age cohort were given the vocabulary and mental arithmetic tests in one of three conditions: individually with oral responses; individually with written responses; as part of the whole class in the normal classroom, giving written responses. Eighty children, equal numbers of shy and less shy children, participated in each condition, and one variable carries information about the condition to which each child was assigned.

40|$|M. Ed. Truancy, which {{according}} to Thompson and Rudolph (1992 : 513), is a deliberate absence from school without a valid reason, {{is a problem that}} probably dates back to the initial institution of large scale formal schooling. Although it may seem obvious that the reason for truancy is related {{to the fact that the}} truant prefers to be elsewhere, or that he finds the school an unpleasant place to be, the underlying reasons for truancy are more difficult to pinpoint. Research conducted in 1991 and 1992 in the United Kingdom (O'Keefe, 1994 : 48), and which included 150 schools, revealed that a significant number of pupils of compulsory school—going age become involved in truancy. Statistics reported by the research team themselves, based on a survey which involved questionnaires, suggested that if the results of their survey could be extrapolated to all schools, then a 95 per cent confidence interval for the mean truancy level in schools, is between 29. 7 per cent and 32. 4 per cent. About two thirds (68 %), of all schools should have truancy levels between 22. 7 per cent and 39. 3 per cent, and 96 per cent of all schools should have levels between 14. 4 per cent and 47. 4 per cent. If these statistics could be used as a guide to estimate an average of truants per school, the enormity of the prevalence of truancy becomes evident. According to McWhirter and McWhirter (1993 : 58), truants tend to have what is termed a "dropouts perspective". They claim that dropouts inter alia tend to leave school for the following reasons: * a dislike for school, with the opinion that school is boring and not relevant to their needs * low academic achievement and poor grades * poverty, a desire to work full-time, and a need for money, and * a lack of belonging and a sense that nobody cares about them Some of these attributes might thus also obtain for many truants. Paterson (Wardaugh, 1990 : 744), proposes two broad categories of truants, namely the "endangered" truant (also termed the delinquent or morally endangered truant), and the "fearful" truant (also termed the school phobic or abused truant). The "endangered" truant is prone to falling into trouble when absent from school, while the "fearful" truant wishes to go to school, but is afraid to do so. Truancy is also listed by Kapp (1990 : 119) as one of the behaviours manifested by juvenile delinquents along with various other delinquencies such as theft, running away from home, use and distribution of drugs, burglary, vandalism, assault and robbery, thus suggesting that truancy is associated with these misdemeanours. Healy (Tyerman, 1968 : 10), notes that truancy is the root of all these misbehaviours, and he described truancy as "the kindergarten of crime". In 1944 Burt (1944 : 455) already referred to truancy as "the first step on the downward stair to crime". According to Hersov and Berg (1980 : 67), truancy is a reliable predictor of difficulties in later life. They also report that school truancy significantly predicts four subsequent child events: being held back in elementary school, dropping out of high school,leaving the parental home before the age of 18, and marriage before the age of 18. Thus, it would appear that the prognosis for truants in terms of completing their schooling, securing stable employment and fulfilling responsible citizenship, without being a burden to their future spouses, families, communities and the state, is rather uncertain. Against this background, there can be little argument that the phenomenon of truancy is serious enough to warrant a counseling programme that will be effective in treating truants in the light of their problems in such a way that they will obtain a balanced perspective of the value of regular school attendance. In South Africa, the incidence of truancy, in the old racially biased provincial education schooling system of the House of Assembly (HOA), could be measured quite accurately, simply by consulting the <b>class</b> <b>register</b> over a period of time. Through investigating the circumstances surrounding the absenteeism the teacher could quite easily determine whether such circumstances met the criteria for classification of such absentees as truants. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the schools which were under the jurisdiction of the former Department of Education and Training (DET), of which the researcher was an employee for a number of years. Not only were records of attendance not kept properly in many instances to be able to determine how often a pupil was absent, but even if attendance records had been kept properly, the possible reasons for staying away from school, such as political violence, intimidation, and caring for younger siblings, do also not meet the criteria for classifying such an absentee as a truant. What is however also true, is that large numbers of former DET pupils could have exploited the prevailing situation at the time and could have stayed away from school for reasons that may well have qualified them as truants. Many schools served by the former House of Delegates (HOD), and the former House of Representatives (HOR), were, maybe, just as seriously affected by the political climate as the DET schools. The level of absenteeism related to unrest situations in the former HOD and HOR schools makes it just as difficult to distinguish between the "truants" and the "bona fide" absentees during those turbulent times. For this reason it was decided to restrict the scope of the present study to truants in schools which traditionally fell under the provincial education system of the former House of Assembly...|$|E
