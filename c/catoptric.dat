25|$|The {{original}} lantern was a <b>catoptric</b> device, and was upgraded {{a number}} of times until the 1950s. It was destroyed by fire in 1954, and the lantern room was replaced by a steel frame. The lighthouse was decommissioned in the late 1950s, and in 1961, it became property of Parks Canada, which removed the steel frame in the 1970s, and also restored the door and fan light. These were destroyed by vandals, so the entrance was blocked with stone rubble.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of the steady illumination of the Argand lamp, the application of optical lenses to increase and focus the light intensity became a practical possibility. William Hutchinson developed the first practical optical system in 1763, known as a <b>catoptric</b> system. This rudimentary system effectively collimated the emitted light into a concentrated beam, thereby greatly increasing the light's visibility. The ability to focus the light led to the first revolving lighthouse beams, where the light would appear to the mariners as a series of intermittent flashes. It also became possible to transmit complex signals using the light flashes.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the opening of the {{lighthouse}} in 1841, a fixed light was emitted by an oil lamp with one wick. The intensity of the light was increased by a combination of a dioptric fixed lens and <b>catoptric</b> mirrors. On 25 April 1843, lighting was upgraded to improve visibility from Sandy Bay, and in 1854, the lighthouse had a reported visibility of [...]|$|E

2500|$|The tower's {{completed}} height was [...] {{shorter than}} the design, and commissioning was finally completed in 1851 when the revolving lamp and clockwork mechanism were fitted. [...] Unusually for the period as most lighthouse lamps and mechanisms came from England, the machinery for the revolving <b>catoptric</b> light was designed and built in Fremantle. [...] Assistant Surveyor-General Augustus Gregory designed the mechanism which comprised two sets of three oil burning lamps, each with a silvered parabolic reflector. [...] In 1850, a contract was let to Alfred Carson to construct the revolving apparatus {{at a cost of}} £43. [...] The official opening on 1 June 1851 coincided with the twenty-second anniversary of the Colony and the opening of another lighthouse at Arthur Head.|$|E
60|$|The {{floating}} {{lights of}} England are illuminated {{by means of}} lamps with metallic reflectors, on what is styled the <b>catoptric</b> system. The dioptric system, in which the rays of light are transmitted through glass, has been introduced into the floating lights of India by the Messrs. Stevenson, C.E., of Edinburgh. The first floating light on this system in India was shown on the Hoogly in 1865. Since then, several more dioptric lights {{have been sent to}} the same region, and also to Japan in 1869, and all reports agree in describing these lights as being eminently successful.|$|E

50|$|In geometry, John Horton Conway defines architectonic and <b>catoptric</b> tessellations as {{the uniform}} tessellations (or honeycombs) of Euclidean 3-space and their duals, as {{three-dimensional}} analogue of the Platonic, Archimedean, and Catalan tiling of the plane. The singular vertex figure of an architectonic tessellation is the dual {{of the cell}} of <b>catoptric</b> tessellation. The cubille is the only Platonic (regular) tessellation of 3-space, and is self-dual.|$|E

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was designed}} by Alexander Dawson, the New South Wales Government Architect at that time. Dawson approved the recommended location as having adequate foundations, and also reported that the government stores already had a <b>catoptric</b> lens apparatus available that has been purchased in 1853.|$|E
50|$|His name is {{associated}} with Purkinje-Sanson images, being defined as <b>catoptric</b> images produced by reflections from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea, and from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the crystalline lens. Term named in conjunction with Czech physiologist Jan Evangelista Purkyne (1787-1869).|$|E
50|$|John Horton Conway {{calls this}} {{honeycomb}} a truncated octahedrille in his Architectonic and <b>catoptric</b> tessellation list, with its dual called an oblate tetrahedrille, also called a disphenoid tetrahedral honeycomb. Although a regular tetrahedron can not tessellate space alone, this dual has identical disphenoid tetrahedron cells with isosceles triangle faces.|$|E

50|$|The {{pairs of}} architectonic and <b>catoptric</b> tessellations are listed below with their {{symmetry}} group.

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} by Robert Stevenson in 1833 {{at a cost of}} £4260 and initially showed a fixed white light. In 1910 most of the Northern Lighthouse Board's lights were changed to dioptric or Fresnel lenses but Lismore and Fidra, in the Firth of Forth, were left as the only remaining purely <b>catoptric</b> lights in the service.|$|E
50|$|In 1865, {{the light}} source was {{improved}} from <b>catoptric</b> to first order dioptric. At the same time, John Richardson Wigham had patented a gas-burning light, so experiments {{with this new}} system were tried at Baily. A gas works was built at the station to produce the fuel, first from oil, then shale, and finally rich cannel coal. The experiments were a success, and the system was added to nine other lighthouses.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} and keepers' {{houses were}} designed by George Halpin and the works were {{carried out by the}} Board's workers under his inspection. The conical tower of cut granite was painted white. The original light was a fixed white <b>catoptric</b> third order lens pointed to land 66 feet above high water and visible in clear weather for 12 miles. It was first exhibited on 1 September 1838 before completion. The cost at the end of 1839 amounted to £8,697.19s.4d.|$|E
50|$|The {{museum was}} founded in 1882 by Arthur Meyer, a {{journalist}} for Le Gaulois, and named for its first artistic director, caricaturist Alfred Grévin. It {{is one of the}} oldest wax museums in Europe. Its baroque architecture includes a hall of mirrors based on the principle of a <b>catoptric</b> cistula and a theater for magic shows. The hall of mirrors was built for the Exposition Universelle in 1900.It was originally housed in the Palais des mirages designed by Eugène Hénard.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{recording}} a new album, the duo released four EPs of experimental material. The first, Telesthetic Tape, {{appeared on the}} Danish Skrot Up label and featured two untitled tracks. It was re-released in 2011 on vinyl. In June 2010 the band release the four-track <b>Catoptric</b> EP through The Social Registry. In the same month the Astral Occurrence EP appeared on the Australian label The Spring Press. Lastly, a remix EP entitled FRKWYS Vol. 4 included contributions by Juan Atkins, Gibby Haynes and Hans-Joachim Irmler.|$|E
