40|$|BACKGROUND—T cell {{responses}} to normal intestinal bacteria or their products {{may be important}} in the immunopathogenesis of chronic enterocolitis.  AIMS—To investigate the T cell specificity and cross reactivity towards intestinal bacteria.  PATIENTS/METHODS—T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were isolated with phytohaemagglutinin from peripheral blood and biopsy specimens of inflamed and non-inflamed colon from five patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and two controls. T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were restimulated with anaerobic Bacteroides and Bifidobacteria species, enterobacteria, and direct isolates of aerobic intestinal flora. T cell phenotype was analysed by single-cell immunocyte assay.  RESULTS—Analysis of 96  T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> isolated from peripheral blood and biopsy specimens from two patients with IBD showed that both Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species specifically stimulate proliferation of CD 4 +TCRαβ+ T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> from both sites and that cross reactivity exists between these anaerobic bacteria and different enterobacteria.

They are called HEK since they originated in human embryonic kidney cultures, while the number 293 came from Graham's habit of numbering his experiments; the original HEK 293 <b>cell</b> <b>clone</b> was from his 293rd experiment. Graham performed the transformation a total of eight times, obtaining just one clone of cells that were cultured for several months. After presumably adapting to tissue culture, cells from this clone developed into the relatively stable HEK 293 line.|$|E
5000|$|The {{usage of}} {{terminology}} for types of goiter has varied {{over the past}} century. Physicians and surgeons tend to differentiate among solitary-nodule goiter, multinodular goiter, and non-nodular goiter more thoroughly in recent decades than they formerly did. Thus some sources have described, or still describe, thyroid adenoma (toxic adenoma) as synonymous with toxic multinodular goiter, but other sources differentiate those two as single-nodule disease versus multinodular disease (respectively) with pathogenesis that is likely differing in most cases (eg, single neoplastic <b>cell</b> <b>clone</b> versus multifocal or diffuse molecular metabolic change). The medical eponyms [...] "Plummer disease" [...] (named after American physician Henry Stanley Plummer) and [...] "Parry disease" [...] (named after English physician Caleb Hillier Parry) {{have been used to}} refer to toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, and toxic diffuse goiter (Graves' disease); the specific entity in each patient/case is not always clear retrospectively, especially in older literature. This is logical given that advanced medical imaging that can show what is happening at various places within a thyroid gland inside a living person (such as nuclear medicine imaging of radioiodine tracer uptake) was not available until after the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Soluble LAG3 {{was first}} {{established}} as a dendritic cell activator in the late 1990s. Frédéric Triebel, who discovered LAG3 in 1990, worked through the 1990s at his laboratory at the Institut Gustave Roussy, in collaboration with INSERM and Merck Serono, to elucidate LAG-3’s role in the immune system. Triebel et al. had successfully produced a soluble fusion protein of LAG3 and immunoglobulin around 1995 and had initially envisaged its use as an immunosuppressant after evidence that its interaction with MHC class II molecules leads to the down-regulation of CD4+ antigen-specific T <b>cell</b> <b>clone</b> proliferation and cytokine secretion, and that it inhibited the alloresponses of naive peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, in March 1999 a key paper in the Journal of Immunology from scientists at the University of Montreal, on which Triebel was listed as a co-author, demonstrated soluble LAG3's role as a dendritic cell activator. Shortly after this, in 2001, Triebel formed a biotechnology company called Immutep SA in 2001 {{in order to develop}} the therapeutic potential of LAG3 including soluble LAG3. Immutep called its product 'ImmuFact IMP321', the 'act' part of ImmuFact referring to the products immune activating properties. By 2010 there was a large body of evidence of the efficacy of IMP321 in cancer. Immutep was acquired by Prima BioMed in 2014 and as a result IMP321 became Prima BioMed's lead compound.|$|E
40|$|Human cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) /cancer-initiating cells (CICs) can be {{isolated}} as side population (SP) cells, aldehyde dehydrogenase high (ALDHhigh) cells or cell surface marker-positive cells including CD 44 + cells and CD 133 + cells. CSCs/CICs and non-CSCs/CICs are unstable in in vitro culture, and CSCs/CICs can differentiate into non-CSCs/CICs and some non-CSCs/CICs can dedifferentiate into CSCs/CICs. Therefore, experiments using {{a large amount}} of CSCs/CICs are technically very difficult. In this study, we isolated single <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> from SP <b>cells</b> and main population (MP) cells derived from the human colon cancer cell line SW 480. SP analysis revealed that SP <b>clone</b> <b>cells</b> had relatively high percentages of SP <b>cells,</b> whereas MP <b>clone</b> <b>cells</b> showed very few SP cells, and the phenotypes were sustainable for more than 2 months of in vitro culture. Xenograft transplantation revealed that SP <b>clone</b> <b>cells</b> have higher tumor-initiating ability than that of MP <b>clone</b> <b>cells</b> and SP <b>clone</b> <b>cell</b> showed higher chemo-resistance compared with MP <b>clone</b> <b>cells.</b> These results indicate that SP <b>clone</b> <b>cells</b> derived from SW 480 cells are enriched with CSCs/CICs, whereas MP <b>clone</b> <b>cells</b> are pure non-CSCs/CICs. SP <b>clone</b> <b>cells</b> and MP <b>clone</b> <b>cells</b> are a very stable in vitro CSC/CIC-enriched and non-CSC/CIC model for further analysis...|$|R

40|$|Adoptive T cell therapy, {{involving}} the ex vivo selection {{and expansion of}} antigen-specific T <b>cell</b> <b>clones,</b> provides a means of augmenting antigen-specific immunity without the in vivo constraints that can accompany vaccine-based strategies. A phase I study was performed to evaluate the safety, in vivo persistence, and efficacy of adoptively transferred CD 8 + T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> targeting the tumor-associated antigens, MART 1 /MelanA and gp 100 {{for the treatment of}} patients with metastatic melanoma. Four infusions of autologous T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were administered, the first without IL- 2 and subsequent infusions with low-dose IL- 2 (at 0. 25, 0. 50, and 1. 0 × 106 units/m 2 twice daily for the second, third, and fourth infusions, respectively). Forty-three infusions of MART 1 /MelanA-specific or gp 100 -specific CD 8 + T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> were administered to 10 patients. No serious toxicity was observed. We demonstrate that the adoptively transferred T <b>cell</b> <b>clones</b> persist in vivo in response to low-dose IL- 2, preferentially localize to tumor sites and mediate an antigen-specific immune response characterized by the elimination of antigen-positive tumor cells, regression of individual metastases, and minor, mixed or stable responses in 8 of 10 patients with refractory, metastatic disease for up to 21 mo...|$|R
