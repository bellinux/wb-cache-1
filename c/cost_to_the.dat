5|$|The Luftwaffe cowed the defenders, {{breaking}} them psychologically. The gunners, {{the backbone}} of the defences, had abandoned their positions by the time the German ground assault had begun. The <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe was just six aircraft, three of which were Ju 87s.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were {{returned}} discreetly to the Reich. The {{experience of the}} Spanish Civil War proved invaluable - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions. The Ju 87 had not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was learned later at great <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Stuka crews.|$|E
5|$|Australian rules {{football}} is the main sport played at the stadium which has hosted Australian Football League (AFL) games since 2001, when the state government started paying interstate clubs to relocate their home games. Melbourne-based Hawthorn played one game in 2001 and two in 2002, and in 2003 were joined by another Melbourne team, St Kilda. In 2004, {{it was estimated that}} the <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government per game was between $300,000 and $500,000, but Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated that the government was making a profit on its investment, estimating that each game injected between $1million and $1.5million into the Tasmanian economy.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} peace was {{completely}} restored in the city, the <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state for {{suppression of the}} mob was between $80,000 and $85,000. Later that year, the B agreed {{to a number of}} reforms: crewmen would not be called to work more than an hour before a train's departure, crews were to be paid a quarter of a day's pay if the train they were working was canceled, and passes were to be given for men working who had long layovers. In 1880, the B Employees Relief Association was established.|$|E
5|$|During Western Australia's convict era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the Convict Establishment, and was used for convicts transported from Britain. Longer term local prisoners were also held there from 1858, at a <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> colonial government, as the then-newly {{constructed}} Perth Gaol had been handed over to the British imperial government for use as a convict station for short term prisoners. Local prisoners were also been kept in the Round House, or on Rottnest Island. In 1876 Perth Gaol was transferred back to local control.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E

5|$|In all 416,806 Australians {{enlisted in}} the AIF {{during the war and}} 333,000 served overseas. 61,508 were killed and another 155,000 were wounded (a total {{casualty}} rate of 65%). The financial <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly {{towards the end of the}} fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war.|$|E
5|$|Intent {{on making}} more money, Forbes in November 1922 began selling {{valuable}} hospital supplies under his control in large warehouses at the Perryville Depot in Maryland. The government had stockpiled huge quantities of hospital supplies {{during the first}} World War, which Forbes unloaded {{for a fraction of}} their <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Boston firm of Thompson and Kelly {{at a time when the}} Veterans' Bureau was buying supplies for the hospitals at a much higher price.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are often}} characterized as either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative metabolites {{are defined as}} toxins that interfere with an herbivore’s metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plant. Qualitative allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted specialists and generalist herbivores.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} cost of insecticide resistance is significant, but published {{data on the}} subject is minimal. In 1994, total costs of the insecticide and crop losses in the US state of Michigan were $13.3 million, representing 13.7% of {{the total value of}} the crop. The estimate of the cost implication of insecticides and crop losses per hectare is $138–368. Long-term increased <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Michigan potato industry caused by insecticide resistance in Colorado potato beetle was estimated at $0.9 to $1.4 million each year.|$|E

5|$|The pass at Thermopylae {{was thus}} {{opened to the}} Persian army, {{according}} to Herodotus, at the <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Persians of up to 20,000 fatalities. The Greek rearguard, meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed {{on the first two}} days of battle. Herodotus says, at one point 4,000 Greeks died, but assuming the Phocians guarding the track were not killed during the battle (as Herodotus implies), this would be almost every Greek soldier present (by Herodotus' own estimates), and this number is probably too high.|$|E

5|$|Though {{concentrated}} in London, the outbreak affected {{other areas of}} the country as well. Perhaps the most famous example was the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas but the <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.|$|E
5|$|Train {{operating}} {{companies were}} {{adversely affected by}} the disruption, losing an estimated 19% of revenue in the year following the crash.
