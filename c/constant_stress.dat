40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} modeling study of creep and recovery behaviors of magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) under <b>constant</b> <b>stresses.</b> Experimental study was accomplished using a rheometer with parallel-plate geometry. Under <b>constant</b> <b>stresses</b> {{ranging from a}} small value to a large one, the resultant strains were recorded. The experimental results demonstrated that MREs behave as linear visocleastic properties. The effects of the magnetic field and stress on MRE creep behaviors were discussed. Moreover, a four-parameter viscoelastic model was developed to describe MRE creep behaviors. The comparison between the experimental results and the modeling predictions indicates that the model can predict MRE creep behaviors very well...|$|R
