The examinations were performed in two layer strains, Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) and Lohmann Brown (LB), over two laying periods. In addition, the effects of layer strain, month of laying period, rearing method, group- size and body weight on these traits were tested. The assessments based on a scoring system comprising the scores 1 (very severely defective part of the body) to 4 (intact part of the body) were performed every three months during the laying period. Examinations of keel bone condition and measurements of body weight were performed {{in a total of}} 864 hens, <b>claw</b> <b>length</b> and plumage condition were examined in a total of 720 hens. Housing system showed a significant effect on the incidence of keel bone deformities and <b>claw</b> <b>length.</b> Plumage condition was significantly affected by group size, whereas plumage condition was worst in groups of 20 hens in Aviplus and in groups of 10 hens in Eurovent 625 A-EU. Concerning <b>claw</b> <b>length</b> there were significant differences between diverse claw abrasives. The strongest abrasion was found in groups with two abrasive blocks, whereas perforated metal plates led to the least abrasion.

The objective of this study was to determine the fitness of linear, log linear, polynomial, exponential and Logistic functions to the growth curves of Macrobrachium rosenbergii obtained by using weekly records of live weight, total length, head length, <b>claw</b> <b>length,</b> and last segment length from 20 to 192 days of age. The models were evaluated according to the coefficient of determination (R 2), and error sum off square (ESS) and helps in formulating breeders in selective breeding programs. Twenty full-sib families consisting 400 PLs each were stocked in 20 different hapas and reared till 8 weeks after which a total of 1200 animals were transferred to earthen ponds and reared up to 192 days. The R 2 values of the models ranged from 56 – 96 in case of overall body weight with logistic model being the highest. The R 2 value for total length ranged from 62 to 90 with logistic model being the highest. In case of head length, the R 2 value ranged between 55 and 95 with logistic model being the highest. The R 2 value for <b>claw</b> <b>length</b> ranged from 44 to 94 with logistic model being the highest. For last segment length, R 2 value ranged from 55 – 80 with polynomial model being the highest. However, the log linear model registered low ESS value followed by linear model for overall body weight while exponential model showed low ESS value followed by log linear model in case of head length. For total length the low ESS value was given by log linear model followed by logistic model and for <b>claw</b> <b>length</b> exponential model showed low ESS value followed by log linear model. In case of last segment length, linear model showed lowest ESS value followed by log linear model. Since, the model that shows highest R 2 value with low ESS value is generally considered as the best fit model. Among the five models tested, logistic model, log linear model and linear models were found to be the best models for overall body weight, total length and head length respectively. For <b>claw</b> <b>length</b> and last segment length, log linear model was found to be the best model. These models can be used to predict growth rates in M. rosenbergii. However, further studies need to be conducted with more growth traits taken into consideratio...|$|E

40|$|Exploring the {{relationship}} between phenotype and performance in an ecological and evolutionary context is crucial to understanding the adaptive nature of phenotypic traits. Despite their ubiquity in vertebrates, {{few studies have examined}} the functional and ecological significance of claw morphologies.

Claw characters are significantly different between lizards classified as arboreal (perch height >= 1 m) and non-arboreal (perch height < 1 m). Arboreal species possess significantly higher and longer claws, and show trends toward decreased claw curvature and wider claw tip angles. Toepad size and <b>claw</b> <b>length</b> and height are tightly correlated {{with each other and with}} perch height, suggesting that the adhesive toepad and gripping claw have co-evolved to accommodate different habitats.

Studentâ€™s T {{test was used to}} assess for significant differences between sexes in their bill and claw morphological characteristics. Regression analysis indicated significant relationships between the morphological characteristics in birds of prey. In both the Falconiformes and Strigiformes orders significant differences were observed among the prey categories in the entire three claw morphological characteristics measured (claw shape, total <b>claw</b> <b>length</b> and hind <b>claw</b> <b>length).</b> In both orders all species except for carrion feeders showed significant variation in claw lengths with increase in mean body mass and wing length. Claws of carrion feeders were the least curved and shortest relative to their body masses and wing lengths among the raptors. In both orders, beak sizes and shapes showed some overlap among the prey categories. No significant differences were observed in bill shapes and bill volumes among the prey categories of both orders. However, in both orders the prey categories showed significant differences in bill lengths and culmen lengths. Except in carrion feeders, culmen length varied significantly with increase in mean body mass and wing length in all prey categories of both orders. Reversed sexual size dimorphism was also observed in the bill and claw sizes in most species in the two orders. However, no significant differences in the hind claw shape and bill shape were observed between sexes in most species of both orders. Degree of sexual size dimorphism varied among the species.

Concordance correlation coefficients and limits-of-agreement analysis showed that, for {{four of the five}} measures (claw height, <b>claw</b> width, toe <b>length</b> and abaxial groove length), agreement was too poor for digital and manual measures to be used interchangeably. For all four of these measures, Liao’s modified concordance correlation coefficient (mCCC) was ≤ 0. 4, indicating poor concordance despite Pearson’s correlation being > 0. 6 in all cases. The worst concordance was seen for toe length (mCCC = 0. 13). Limits-of-agreement analysis showed that, for all four measures, there was a large variation in the difference between the manual and digital methods, even when the effect of mean on difference was accounted for, with the 95 % limits-of-agreement for the four measures being further away from the mean difference than 10 % of the mean in all four cases. The only one of the five measures with an acceptable concordance between digital and manual measurement was toe angle (mCCC = 0. 81). Nevertheless, the limits-of-agreement analysis showed that there was a systematic bias with, on average, the manual measure of toe angle, being 2. 1 ° smaller than the digital. The 95 % limits-of-agreement for toe angle were ± 3. 4 °, probably at the upper limit of what is acceptable.

Measurements were carried out in spring and in autumn. Holstein dairy cows (n = 101) with production 11874. 77 kg of milk, 3. 94 % of fat and 3. 34 % of protein and Slovak Simmental cows (n = 101) with production 5834. 25 kg of milk, 4. 44 % of fat and 3. 59 % of protein were included into study. Holstein and Slovak Simmental dairy cows affected with claw diseases produced on first lactations 553. 67 resp. 838. 71 kg of milk more than average production of observed groups. On the second and higher lactations dairy cows of Holstein and Slovak Simmental breed affected with claw diseases produced 734. 3 resp. 1118. 3 kg of milk less than healthy dairy cows. Statistically significant differences in claws formation were observed in both breeds according to the claw trimming season...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{describe}} variation in length of the dorsal hoof wall {{in contact with the}} dermis for cows on a single farm, and hence, derive minimum appropriate claw lengths for routine foot trimming. The hind feet of 68 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were collected post mortem, and the internal structures were visualised using x-ray mCT. The internal distance from the proximal limit of the wall horn to the distal tip of the dermis was measured from crosssectional sagittal images. A constant was added to allow for a minimum sole thickness of 5 mm and an average wall thickness of 8 mm. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics and two-level linear regression models with claw nested within cow. Based on 219 claws, the recommended dorsal wall length from the proximal limit of hoof horn was up to 90 mm for 96 per cent of claws, and the median value was 83 mm. Dorsal wall length increased by 1 mm per year of age, yet 85 per cent of the null model variance remained unexplained. Overtrimming can have severe consequences; the authors propose that the minimum recommended <b>claw</b> <b>length</b> stated in training materials for all Holstein-Friesian cows should be increased to 90 mm...|$|E

60|$|This was, however, an {{excellent}} reason for pushing on {{as fast as}} possible, and they stumbled and floundered forward {{until late in the}} afternoon, while the ice became more rugged and broken as they proceeded. The snow had ceased, but the drifts which stretched across their path were plentiful, and they {{were in the midst of}} one when it seemed to Wyllard who was leading that they were sinking much deeper than usual. The snow was over the top of his long boots, the sled seemed very heavy, and he could hear his comrades floundering savagely. Then there was a cry behind him, and he was jerked suddenly backwards for a pace or two until he flung himself down at full <b>length</b> <b>clawing</b> at the snow. After that he was drawn back no further, but the strain upon the trace became almost insupportable, and there was still a furious scuffling behind him.|$|R
40|$|Microsatellite markers from a {{transcriptome}} sequence library {{were initially}} isolated, and their genetic variation was characterized {{in a wild}} population of the mud crab (Scylla paramamosain). We then tested the association between these microsatellite markers and the growth performance of S. paramamosain. A total of 129 polymorphic microsatellite markers were identified, with an observed heterozygosity ranging from 0. 19 to 1. 00 per locus, an expected heterozygosity ranging from 0. 23 to 0. 96 per locus, and a polymorphism information content (PIC) ranging from 0. 21 to 0. 95 per locus. Of these microsatellite markers, 30 showed polymorphism in 96 full-sib individuals of a first generation family. Statistical analysis indicated that three microsatellite markers {{were significantly associated with}} 12 growth traits of S. paramamosain. Of these three markers, locus Scpa 36 was significantly associated with eight growth traits, namely, carapace length, abdomen width (AW), body height (BH), fixed finger <b>length</b> of the <b>claw,</b> fixed finger width of the claw, fixed finger height of the <b>claw,</b> meropodite <b>length</b> of pereiopod 2, and meropodite length of pereiopod 3 (MLP 3) (P, 0. 05). Locus Scpa 75 was significantly associated with five growth traits, namely, internal carapace width, AW, carapace width at spine 8, distance between lateral spine 2 (DLS 2), and MLP 3 (P, 0. 05). Locus Spm 30 was significantly associated with BH, DLS 2, and body weight (P, 0. 05). Further analysis suggested a set of genotypes (BC at Scpa 36, BC and BD at Scpa 75, and AC at Spm 30) that have great potential in the selection of S. paramamosain for growth traits. These findings will facilitate the development of populatio...|$|R
