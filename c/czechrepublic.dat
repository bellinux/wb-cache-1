40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} {{corporate governance}} and its necessary change {{with regard to}} trends in society, especially {{in view of the}} concept of sustainability. Corporate sustainability is understood as the ability of companies to positively influence environmental, social and economic development through their governance practices and market presence. The approach of enterprises to sustainability and the level of integration of sustainability into corporate governance were examined by the author's empirical research conducted among enterprises in the <b>CzechRepublic</b> in 2012. It was found that enterprises are {{aware of the importance of}} the concept of sustainability to achieve corporate performance in the long term. However, sustainability is not integrated into individual business processes (especially by small and medium-sized enterprises), as research results demonstrated. Focus on the company's financial results is prevalent. Many enterprises do not work with sustainability within corporate strategy and management, and neither do they include sustainability in performance measurement and management. Reporting of sustainable corporate activities is very simple, especially for SMEs. A prerequisite for fully functioning corporate governance with regard to sustainability is a reflection of sustainability through the whole process of business management. Sustainability should become an integral part of strategic management and corporate planning...|$|E
40|$|Title: Implications of the {{institutional}} theories of regional development {{for the emergence of}} the regional innovation systems in the <b>CzechRepublic</b> Author: Pavla Žižalová Summary The accelerated intensity of the economic globalization and its implications for all segments of the society during {{the last couple of days}} have changed profoundly the workings of contemporary capitalism. Increased pressure is put on national and regional economies to continuously upgrade their competitive advantages and at the same time new learning opportunities occur at a faster rate than ever. As a result, in recent years, almost all have come to a consensus that today's advanced economies are "knowledge-based" economies -economies directly based on the production, distribution and use of knowledge where learning and innovation creation is the most fundamental process for competitiveness not only for firms and organizations, but also for nations and regions. Parallel to the globalization process there are, however, strong forces of localization. To some extent paradoxically, empirical studies have revealed that knowledge intensive industries - the most potentially footloose of all activities - tend to agglomerate in space, often in proximity to universities and research institutes. Indeed, the most knowledge- intensive of these [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Methamphetamine {{is a drug}} {{frequently}} {{abused by}} drug-addicted pregnant women and {{also one of the}} mostcommonly used drugs in the <b>CzechRepublic.</b> This drug passes easily through a placental barrier into the fetus. Thus it can negatively affect not only the mother but also the prenatal development of her offspring. Objectives: In the framework of the grant project GA CR: 14 - 03708 S, the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to methamphetamine were detected. It was determined whether the prenatal methamphetamine exposure affects the generation of offspring of exposed females at the level of gene expression of genes in specific regions of the brain, striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Methods: In the selected parts of the brain, which were removed from the rat, the microarray hybridization and the real-time PCR to express changes in expression of selected genes were performed. Results: Statistical analysis of microarray hybridization did not show the significantly altered gene expression in tested genes significantly. Only boundary values for 13 genes were measured, which were further tested by real-time PCR. After a statistic evaluation of real-time PCR, the significantly altered expression was found in 2 genes. The significantly changed expression of DRD 3 and TACR 3 genes was found [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Access {{to higher}} {{education}} {{is an issue of}} human rights, since higher education often is a pre-requisite for obtaining paid work for persons with disabilities. This study examines higher education and accommodations aimed at promoting an accessible education from the view of students with disabilities, arising out of a comparative analysis of interviews with students in Sweden, The Czech Republic and the US. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore students´ perspectives on their participation in higher education, the supporting system and the meaning of the concept of an accessible education. The study was conducted at two universities in Sweden and the <b>CzechRepublic</b> and one university in the USA. Overall 48 students were interviewed about their experiences. Interviews were also conducted with six coordinators at the five universities. Major differences appeared in the organization of and eligibility for support in the different countries. One example is to what extent support relies on individualized accommodations or on general accessibility.   Although differences are obvious in policy as well as practice, the findings also show that students share some experiences of being in higher education. A shared experience among student is the decisive relationship with the teacher. Teachers are viewed as the core of the academic education which can either take a supportive and facilitating role or preclude all possibilities of an education. Furthermore, the findings indicate a gap between policy and practice that opens for a discussion on the meaning of accessibility in higher education...|$|E

First, we have the picture of macro-economic view on the issues through theinternational comparison of government expenditures on individual areas of public order and security. Morecomprehensive part of the paper maps out the development of registered and cleared-up crime in the <b>CzechRepublic</b> by main types, it pays attention to selected groups of perpetrators (children, juveniles, criminal repeaters) and also its signifi cant regional dimensions, including attempts to explain it. Overwhelming quantitativeview on crime is extended also by subjective evaluation of security of population near their residence. Signifi cance of qualitative view increases mainly in attempt to make international comparison where traditional“hard“ data on crime hit diff erent legal environment also in geographically close countries within theEU. Social pathology and criminal legislation infl uence also the composition of prison population which isassessed from the aspect of sex, age, citizenship, education, the level of imposed sentence and criminal history. Increasing number of prisoners has recently negatively infl uenced the occupancy rate of prisons, which raisesquestions concerning sustainability of fi nancing of penitentiary system especially {{in the period of}} total economicdepression.

40|$|Background: About 30 % {{of cases}} of chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukaemia (CLL) carry quasi-identical B-cell receptorimmunoglobulins and can be assigned to distinct stereotyped subsets. Although preliminary evidence suggeststhat B-cell receptor immunoglobulin stereotypy is relevant from a clinical viewpoint, this aspect has never beenexplored in a systematic manner or in a cohort of adequate size that would enable clinical conclusions to be drawn. Methods: For this retrospective, multicentre study, we analysed 8593 patients with CLL for whom immunogeneticdata were available. These patients were followed up in 15 academic institutions throughout Europe (in <b>CzechRepublic,</b> Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK) and the USA, and data were collectedbetween June 1, 2012, and June 7, 2013. We retrospectively assessed the clinical implications of CLL B-cell receptorimmunoglobulin stereotypy, with a particular focus on 14 major stereotyped subsets comprising cases expressingunmutated (U-CLL) or mutated (M-CLL) immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes. The primary outcome ofour analysis was time to fi rst treatment, defi ned as the time between diagnosis and date of fi rst treatment. Findings: 2878 patients were assigned to a stereotyped subset, of which 1122 patients belonged to one of 14 majorsubsets. Stereotyped subsets showed signifi cant diff erences in terms of age, sex, disease burden at diagnosis,CD 38 expression, and cytogenetic aberrations of prognostic signifi cance. Patients within a specifi c subset generallyfollowed the same clinical course, whereas patients in diff erent stereotyped subsets-despite having the sameimmunoglobulin heavy variable gene and displaying similar immunoglobulin mutational status-showedsubstantially diff erent times to fi rst treatment. By integrating B-cell receptor immunoglobulin stereotypy (forsubsets 1, 2, and 4) into the well established Döhner cytogenetic prognostic model, we showed these, whichcollectively account for around 7 % of all cases of CLL and represent both U-CLL and M-CLL, constituted separateclinical entities, ranging from very indolent (subset 4) to aggressive disease (subsets 1 and 2). Interpretation: The molecular classifi cation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia based on B-cell receptorimmunoglobulin stereotypy improves the Döhner hierarchical model and refi nes prognostication beyondimmunoglobulin mutational status, with potential implications for clinical decision making, especially withinprospective clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{previous}} {{studies have suggested that}} estimated daily globalradiation (RG) values contain an error that could compromise the precision of subsequentcrop model applications. The following study presents a detailed site and spatial analysis ofthe RG error propagation in CERES and WOFOST crop growth models in Central Europeanclimate conditions. The research was conducted i) at the eight individual sites in Austria andthe Czech Republic where measured daily RG values were available as a reference, withseven methods for RG estimation being tested, and ii) for the agricultural areas of the <b>CzechRepublic</b> using daily data from 52 weather stations, with five RG estimation methods. In thelatter case the RG values estimated from the hours of sunshine using the ÃƒÂ¥ngstrÃƒÂ¶m-Prescottformula were used as the standard method {{because of the lack of}} measured RG data. At thesite level we found that even the use of methods based on hours of sunshine, which showedthe lowest bias in RG estimates, led to a significant distortion of the key crop model outputs. When the ÃƒÂ¥ngstrÃƒÂ¶m-Prescott method was used to estimate RG, for example, deviationsgreater than Ã‚Â± 10 per cent in winter wheat and spring barley yields were noted in 5 to 6 percent of cases. The precision of the yield estimates and other crop model outputs was lowerwhen RG estimates based on the diurnal temperature range and cloud cover were used (mean bias error 2. 0 to 4. 1 per cent). The methods for estimating RG from the diurnal temperature range produced a wheat yield bias of more than 25 per cent in 12 to 16 per cent of the seasons. Such uncertainty in the crop model outputs makes the reliability of any seasonal yield forecasts or climate change impact assessments questionable if they are based on this type of data. The spatial assessment of the RG data uncertainty propagation over the winter wheat yields also revealed significant differences within the study area. We found that RG estimates based on diurnal temperature range or its combination with daily total precipitation produced a bias of to 30 per cent in the mean winter wheat grain yields in some regions compared with simulations in which RG values had been estimated using the ÃƒÂ¥ngstrÃƒÂ¶m-Prescott formula. In contrast to the results at the individual sites, the methods based on the diurnal temperature range in combination with daily precipitation totals showed significantly poorer performance than the methods based on the diurnal temperature range only. This was due to the marked increase in the bias in RG estimates with altitude, longitude or latitude of given region. These findings in our view should act as an incentive for further research to develop more precise and generally applicable methods for estimating daily RG based more on the underlying physical principles and/or the remote sensing approach...|$|E
