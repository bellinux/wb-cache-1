40|$|This paper answers three {{questions}} related to the discrete nature of pollution abatement: (i) does a source 2 ̆ 7 s incremental <b>control</b> <b>cost</b> (as defined by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency) necessarily exceed its average <b>control</b> <b>cost,</b> (ii) is incremental <b>control</b> <b>cost</b> a better approximation of a source 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to pay for abatement credits than average <b>control</b> <b>cost,</b> and (iii) exactly how does trading in discrete and continuous abatement markets differ? We find {{that the answer to}} the first two questions are both 2 ̆ 2 no 2 ̆ 2, suggesting that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency needs to refine its reliance on incremental <b>control</b> <b>cost</b> as the sole measure upon which to assess the financial feasibility of water quality trading. In answer to the third question, we show that the outcome of bilateral trading in the presence of discrete abatement is determined by comparing the gains from trade associated with the full sequence of possible “sunk cost trading” scenarios. For the most common case where trading partners 2 ̆ 7 average <b>control</b> <b>cost</b> curves 2 ̆ 2 cross, 2 ̆ 2 the trading outcome with discrete abatement is inherently sensitive to the initial allocation of abatement responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} is proposed for solving dual structural-control optimization problems for high-order flexible space structures where reduced-order structural models are employed. For a given initial structural dessign, a quadratic <b>control</b> <b>cost</b> is minimized {{subject to a}} constant-mass constraint. The sensitivity of the optimal <b>control</b> <b>cost</b> {{with respect to the}} stuctural design variables is then determined and used to obtain successive structural redesigns using a contrained gradient optimization algorithm. This process is repeated until the constrained <b>control</b> <b>cost</b> sensitivity becomes negligible. A numerical example is presented which demonstrates that this {{new approach}} effectively addresses the problem of dual optimization for potentially very high-order structures...|$|R

25|$|When {{the mine}} was {{returned}} to the company in June 1944, production was scaled down and thirty men were discharged. The manager began to plan how best to work the mine {{to keep it in}} profit, while making sure no ore reserves would be lost when the mine did close. Everything possible was done to <b>control</b> <b>costs</b> and maximise income. But this was not the high output mine the Basinghall Mining Syndicate had seen itself running, and they announced production would cease in 1946. However, in the year to September 1946 the mine made its best profit to date, of £19,926. A steady development programme kept production constant, and with a good lead price the company was content to leave the mine open.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} <b>control</b> <b>costs,</b> Honda {{decided not to}} include the electric-assist air {{conditioning}} compressor used in the Civic Hybrid. The Civic Hybrid's electric-assist allows the air conditioning compressor to continue running (using battery pack power) to maintain cabin temperature when the engine is shut off in Idle Stop mode. Instead, the Insight limits {{the duration of the}} Idle Stop mode during air conditioning use and restarts the engine, when needed, to maintain cabin temperature. However, when the Insight's ECON function is engaged, a longer Idle Stop time is invoked for improved fuel efficiency at the expense of rapid cabin cooling. In other words, the air conditioning stops whenever the car stops, as in stop-and-go traffic. During Idle Stop the blower continues to run albeit at a low speed.|$|E

25|$|For many years, California was {{the only}} state that did not use an exit {{numbering}} system. It was granted an exemption in the 1950s due to having an already largely completed and signed highway system; placing exit number signage across the state was deemed too expensive. To <b>control</b> <b>costs,</b> California began to incorporate exit numbers on its freeways in 2002—Interstate, U.S., and state routes alike. Caltrans commonly installs exit number signage only when a freeway or interchange is built, reconstructed, retrofitted, or repaired, and it is usually just tacked onto the top-right corner of an already existing sign. Newer signs along the freeways follow this practice as well. Most exits along California's Interstates now have exit number signage, particularly in rural areas. California, however, still does not use mileposts, although a few exist for experiments or for special purposes.|$|E

Although Ten was already in some financial difficulties before Murdoch became CEO, by late 2012, on paper Illyria had lost 110million of the original 150million invested since 2010. The share price had fallen by about 80% and network profits had dropped by over half. In an attempt to <b>control</b> <b>costs,</b> Ten had reduced employment numbers by 160 people, and the problems were mainly attributed to falling advertising revenues and restructuring at the network.

25|$|On 12 January 2000, Københavns Lufthavne, which {{operates}} {{among other things}} Copenhagen Airport, bought 33.3% of the shares in Rygge Sivile Lufthavn. The company stated that they had invited the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration to purchase part of the company, but that no decision {{had been made by}} the government agency. The company stated that they were therefore forced to invite a foreign airport operate to purchase part of the company to have sufficient competence in airport operations. In December, the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration stated that they were negative to the plans for civilian traffic at Rygge. The administration operates with the model that the large airports, in particular Gardermoen, make a profit, which is used to finance the deficits at smaller airports. The administration stated that establishing a civilian airport at Rygge would undermine the financial structure of Norwegian airports and would breach the political presumptions for constructing Gardermoen. If the administration was to be able to complete on price with Rygge, the state would have to give the necessary grants to cover the deficits at other airports. At the same time, Torp was required to pay their own air traffic <b>control</b> <b>costs,</b> which until then had been covered by the administration. In September 2001, the Norwegian Competition Authority supported the airport, stating that it would allow more competition on international flights from Norway, and could make it easier to establish domestic competition in the face of Scandinavian Airline's take-over of Braathens.|$|E

40|$|Estimation of {{emission}} <b>control</b> <b>cost</b> functions {{is often}} {{carried out in}} a partial equilibrium framework, i. e., {{under the assumption that}} emission control measures have negligible effects on input and output prices. In this paper a computable general equilibrium model is used for simulation of the impact on factor prices and resource allocation of reductions of SO infx sup-, NO infx su- and CO 2 -emissions. Thus the model includes markets for tradable emission permits, and the equilibrium prices of permits reflect the marginal <b>costs</b> of emission <b>control.</b> The results suggest that major emission reductions are likely to have general equilibrium effects, and thus that emission <b>control</b> <b>cost</b> functions that fail to take these effects into account may give a distorted picture of the economic impact of emission control.
