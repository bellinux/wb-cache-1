40|$|International audienceIn any {{cable or}} power line communications, impulse noise {{is known to}} be the most {{difficult}} noise to filter. In particular, non periodic asynchronous impulse noise is impossible to predict. Under such noise conditions, the OFDM 1 symbol generally used in PLC 2 is corrupted. To overcome this problem, the signal-to-noise ratio is generally improved by detecting and/or filtering the noise. This leads however to heavy detection and computing time in comparison with the disturbance duration. In this paper, we study the parameters of the noise generated by a load commutation and propose a new approach that consists in controlling the commutation instant of the load. This approach reduces by up to 15 dB the asynchronous impulsive noise emitted by a resistive load in a 40. 96 -μs typical Homeplug AV 3 OFDM symbol duration.

Preface The melting of glass is a complex physical-chemistry reaction, which is full of not only delays and inertia, but also is nonlinear. Affected by different factors, such as gas pressure, batch uniformity and insulating of furnace etc, this reaction becomes a complex thermal process. Thus, it is difficult to set an accurate mathematical model to control this complex process. However, as an important procedure in this reaction, the <b>commutation</b> <b>system</b> for regenerative furnace would not only affect the glass quality and the energy consumption but also concern about the environment protection and labor’s protection.

The modeling of BLDC motor involves two loops. The first is the current control loop {{and the second is}} the speed control loop. The analysis of the BLDC motor is based on the simulation results of the speed control block, current control block and Voltage Source Inverter (VSI). Hence an advanced simulation model for BLDC motor drives using MATLAB can be presented. In this developed model, the dynamic characteristics of speed and torque as well as voltages and currents can be efficiently monitored and analyzed. A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) here involves two inputs and a output. The difference between the reference speed and the actual speed gives the error.

For clerics wishing to avoid penitential fasts, he offered redemption in the form of aescetic exercizes to lay persons, however, redemption took monetary form money thus incarnating the frontier between the sacred and the profane. A study of these commutations allows one to date them and to show that Castille, around the year 1050, still did not have its own monetary system, but used that of Muslim Spain. Moreover, since these commutations required liquidities which only soldiers possessed, thanks to their forays into the neighboring muslim's territory, they came to symbolize penitential institution in which faith war and money were intricately intertwined.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{mismatch}} effect due to a unequally irradiation on a PV (PhotoVoltaic) system. The mismatch effect due to the partial shading of a PV module can be limited thanks to the installation of both bypass and block diodes. Unfortunately, this solution cannot fully solve the disvantages related to the mismatch effect. The Authors, in previous papers [1, 2], have theoretically demonstrated that the mismatch effect can be solved by changing the parallel/series connections of the modules of a PV system, taking into account each module radiating condition. This paper represents a first step of the experimental development of the above mentioned theoretical result. Specifically, the energy production maximization of the unequally irradiated PV system is obtained thanks to a Labview FPGA reconfiguration controller, designed by the Authors. This controller is able to detect the voltage values of all the modules and consequently to take the decision whether to change the connections of the modules or not {{in order to maximize}} the energy production of the PV system.

In t roduct ion Rewrite techniques have been applied to various problems, including the word problem in universal algebra (Knuth and Bendix, 1970), theorem proving in first order logic (Hsiang, 1985), proofs of inductive properties of abstract data types (Musser, 1980; Huet & Hullot, 1982), and computing with rewrite programs (O'Donnetl, 1985; Dershowitz, 1985 a). Many of these applica-tions require a terminating rewrite system (see Dershowitz, 1985 b). In this paper we study the use of commutation properties for proving termination of rewrite systems. We present termina-tion methods for ordinary and for equational rewrite systems.

Volvo Cars is a global company in an implementation phase of the change project ”One Finance”. The purpose of the change project is to standardize the financial processes which will change the organization structure in the financial departments. Since this is a global change project there are several factors that can affect the internal communication and can result in affecting the success of a change project. The purpose of this thesis is to study the internal communication during a global change project and to analyze what factors are affecting the internal communication from a global perspective. The thesis will also include what impact internal communication has on the organization. The study will mainly be on the internal communication between the headquarter in Gothenburg and the developing financial department in America. Collecting primary data in terms of semi-structure interviews has provided an understanding about Volvo Cars internal communication. Using electronic communication channels and cascade-communication model the organization has informed well about the concept and the purpose of the change. Some respondents are still requesting information about how they should work according to the change.

40|$|AbstractSynchronization {{expressions}} {{introduced in}} [7] {{within the framework}} of the ParC project are a high-level construct which allow a programmer to express minimal synchronization constraints of a program in a distributed context. The study and the implementation of these expressions are based on their associated synchronization languages. Synchronization languages have been introduced in [9, 10]. They give a way to implement synchronization expressions and specify their semantic. These languages represent distributed systems whose behaviour respects synchronization constraints expressed by the programmer with synchronization expressions. So these languages describe all the correct executions of a program. In [9, 10] Guo, Salomaa and Yu propose a characterization of synchronization languages based on a rewriting system named R which generalizes partial <b>commutations.</b> This <b>system</b> gives a way to rewrite a word representing a parallel execution into a word with a lower or equal degree of parallelism.

We present a general model of the process of decision making based on the representation of the basic behavioral variables with the aid of an algebra of qubit creation–annihilation operators, adopted from the quantum information theory. In contrast to the genuine quantum physical systems, which are divided into either bosons or fermions and modeled with the aid of operators, satisfying canonical commutation or anti-commutation relations, decision makers preferences for possible actions are constructed with the aid of operators satisfying the so-called qubit <b>commutation</b> relations. <b>Systems</b> described by operators, satisfying such commutation relations, combine the features of bosons and fermions. Thus, one of the basic consequences of the presented model is that decision makers mimic the combined bosonic–fermionic behavior. By using the algebra of qubit creation–annihilation operators, we proceed with the construction of the concrete operators, describing the process of decision making. In particular, the generators of the quantum Markov dynamics, which is used for modeling human decision making process, are expressed as polynomials of the qubit creation–annihilation operators. The devised coefficients have a natural cognitive and social meaning. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

The vibration procedures were tested under exactly stated conditions. After testing in practice we think this method of measurement is quite suitable. The objective method of commutative measurement hasn't been known yet. That is why we suggest to measure voltage at motor brushes during the analysis of the correct commutation.
