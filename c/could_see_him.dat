25|$|Away {{from the}} cricket field, on 8 April the ECB {{announced}} that triangular One Day International tournaments {{would no longer}} be played in England. On 11 April Kevin Pietersen, England's South African-born all-rounder was reported to have a foot injury that <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> miss the start of the season, and Chris Schofield began his case for unfair dismissal against Lancashire, which he eventually won.|$|E
25|$|Betsen made a {{good start}} with Wasps {{performing}} well and earning respect from the Wasps supporters, for the A side whilst recovering from injury, before moving into the first XV. During the 2009 6 Nations championship he was made Wasps captain {{in the absence of}} the senior England players and friend Rafa Ibanez (though retirement caused by injury). The club announced that he would share the captaincy for the remainder of the 2008/09 season with Phil Vickery, though his performances as captain and 2-man of the match awards in quick succession, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> keeping the role on a sole basis.|$|E

25|$|When Laurence Olivier {{gave his}} {{acclaimed}} performance of Othello at the Royal National Theatre (UK) in 1964, {{he had developed}} a case of stage fright that was so profound {{that when he was}} alone onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> to settle his nerves. This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). The film version still holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film — Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|Ken Barrington was {{the eldest}} child of Percy and Winifred Barrington {{and had two}} brothers, Roy and Colin, and a sister, Sheila. His father was a career soldier {{who served in the}} British Army for 28 years, 24 of them in the Royal Berkshire Regiment. Despite winning a row of medals for service around the world {{including}} the First World War Percy Barrington remained a private and when Ken was born was a batman in the officer's mess at Brock Barracks in Reading, Berkshire. His children grew up in the barracks and led a rather Spartan life in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Percy remained at Brock Barracks in the Second World War, left the Army in 1947 and took up work as a watchman for Handley Page. When Ken became a professional cricketer he often gave them tickets for the Oval so they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> play.|$|E
25|$|In Conrad Murray's {{manslaughter}} trial, David Walgren stated {{another one}} of Jackson's future plans was to open a children's hospital. This was heard in an audio tape Conrad Murray played of Jackson {{under the influence of}} propofol on May 10, 2009. His voice is barely recognisable in the recording, but he can be clearly heard saying that he wanted to build the greatest children's hospital in the world and name it after himself: The Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital. Walgren also stated that while the tour was happening, Jackson wanted to buy an estate with streams, horses and animals so his three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket could live normal lives as their father performed the concerts, as he was photographed looking for a house in the United Kingdom with his children. Walgren also said that the tour would begin that summer, and Jackson could take his children out of school and bring them with him so they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> perform in London.|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 2005, Hardy {{posted on}} his website {{that he was}} finally [...] "free", that wrestling fans {{had not seen the}} last of him, and that he had a {{surprise}} for the fans who had supported him. That night on Raw, Hardy attacked Edge backstage and again later during Edge's match with Kane, leaving the commentators speechless. Before being escorted out of the building by security, Hardy stated that Edge and Lita would pay for their actions and told fans that they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> at Ring of Honor while security officials and event staff were trying to restrain him. Hardy also called out Johnny Ace as security had him in handcuffs taking him out of the arena. This caused an uproar amongst fans, who were confused and wondered if the whole thing was a work or a shoot. Similar occurrences repeated during the following two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Dolan {{gave him}} a {{contract}} for the 2000–01 season and appointed him as York's captain despite the concerns over his knee. Swan battled against his own body to play all the pre-season friendlies, including a clash with Manchester United and their star players of David Beckham, Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs, and Paul Scholes. He was sent off {{in the first game}} of the season after attempting to headbutt Chesterfield's Steve Blatherwick. He captained the [...] "Minstermen" [...] for the first and only time at Bootham Crescent against Cheltenham Town, before he went in for some keyhole surgery to clean out his knee. The surgeon told Swan that [...] "the mess in there is unbelievable... there's no cartilage, there are bits floating around everywhere and it's riddled with arthritis" [...] and warned him that any further matches <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> confined to a wheelchair. After a few weeks Swan accepted both Dolan's and the surgeon's advice and retired.|$|E
500|$|As Smith {{entered the}} 1996 season, he {{finalized}} a divorce {{from his wife}} Denise {{during the first half}} of the year. Meanwhile, manager Tony La Russa began his first season with the Cardinals in tandem with a new ownership group. After General Manager Walt Jocketty acquired shortstop Royce Clayton during the offseason, La Russa emphasized an open competition for the spot that would give the Cardinals the best chance to win. When spring training concluded, Smith had amassed a [...]288 batting average and zero errors in the field, and Clayton batted [...]190 with eight errors. Smith believed he had earned the position with his spring training performance, but La Russa disagreed, and awarded Clayton the majority of playing time in the platoon situation that developed, where Smith typically saw action every third game. La Russa said, [...] "I think it's fair to say he misunderstood how he compared to Royce in spring training...When I and the coaches evaluated the play in spring training—the whole game—Royce started very slowly offensively and you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> start to get better. By what he was able to do defensively and on the bases, Royce deserved to play the majority of the games." ...|$|E

2500|$|President Roosevelt died at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1945. In {{the minutes}} after his death, Fala behaved very strangely. FDR biographer Jim Bishop {{wrote about the}} death scene: [...] "… a snapping, snarling series of barks was heard. No one had paid any {{attention}} to Fala. He had been dozing {{in a corner of the}} room. For a reason beyond understanding, he ran directly for the front screen door and bashed his black head against it. The screen broke and he crawled through and ran snapping and barking up into the hills. There, Secret Service men <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> standing alone, unmoving, on an eminence. This led to the quiet question: 'Do dogs really know?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon {{and their}} wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in April 1965, when a dentist friend {{slipped it into}} their after-dinner coffee. The {{heightened}} perception induced by the hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It changed me, {{and there was no way}} back to what I was before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to submit {{two of his}} compositions to Spector: [...] "Don't Worry Baby" [...] and [...] "Don't Hurt My Little Sister"; both written with the Ronettes in mind. It was reported that Wilson attended the session for [...] "River Deep – Mountain High" [...] (1966), where he sat [...] "transfixed" [...] and [...] "did not say a word". Harry Nilsson wrote [...] "This Could Be the Night" [...] (1966) {{as a tribute to}} Wilson, with production helmed by Spector. Modern Folk Quartet's Henry Diltz recalled Wilson at the studio during the sessions: [...] "we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in the recording booth, in his robe and slippers, sitting there playing our song over and over, for what seemed like hours". Wilson deemed it one of Nilsson's very best compositions and one of Spector's best productions, explaining [...] "Well, the idea they've been dating and waiting and finally they made love… I love that message." ...|$|E

2500|$|Faith made {{appearances}} in various Buffy and Angel comic books and novels. In the Buffy the Vampire Slayer comic book story [...] "Haunted", an imprisoned Faith reveals to Angel her memories {{of being in}} a coma between Buffy seasons three and four; she shared a psychic link with the Mayor's spirit and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> attacking people through his eyes. [...] "Note from the Underground" [...] sees Faith being temporarily released from jail into Angel's custody, in order to help Buffy defeat the demonic fascists, the Scourge. Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Faith Trials, Vol. 1 is a novelization of Buffy season three episodes which center around Faith, including [...] "Faith, Hope & Trick", [...] "Bad Girls", and [...] "Consequences". These episodes focus specifically on Faith's arrival in Sunnydale, and her subsequent turn to the dark side following the death of the Deputy Mayor. Faith appeared prominently in her own 2006 novel [...] by Robert Joseph Levy, which elaborates on Faith's back-story in South Boston and how she came to be the Slayer. Written in diary format, it fleshes out many areas of Faith's past which were only alluded to in the show, such as her alcoholic mother's abuse, her previous relationships, and her first Watcher's gruesome death {{at the hands of the}} vampire Kakistos. Author Robert Joseph Levy describes writing the book, [...] "I wanted to explore the choices she made and the choices that were taken away from her, and how they affected her mental state and her development from Potential to Chosen before she arrived." [...] Expanded Universe material such as this is not usually considered canonical unless otherwise stated.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the failure}} of Operation Dove, Ryan {{remained}} in Berlin. Between Autumn 1940 and January 1943 {{he lived in a}} [...] "large gloomy flat" [...] in Berlin with an acquaintance from Ireland, Helmut Clissmann, and Hans Ritter, both of whom were Abwehr assets. Clissmann was married to Elizabeth [...] "Budge" [...] Mulcahy of Sligo, a friend of both Ryan and Leopold Kerney. As an exchange student in Dublin in the 1930s Clissmann had known Ryan and other republicans and socialists well; before Hitler came to power, he {{had been a member of}} a left-wing student organisation. Ryan was not in good health as a result of his wound and treatment in the Spanish prison, and at one stage he had a stroke, but he remained convivial and drew around him a small circle of friends. He had to remain incognito and in general did not discuss politics. He grew increasingly deaf (though his friends suggested that he sometimes feigned deafness to avoid uncomfortable conversations with the German authorities) so that he could not be left alone at night – he could not hear the anti-aircraft sirens. He later had to spend his days outdoors or in cafés (where he became friendly with Francis Stuart, whom he had known from Dublin) so that people <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> if the sirens sounded. He took Irish newspapers to Stuart and, being in a position to get extra rations, shared them generously with his friends. In return, Stuart took Ryan, who had a lot of time on his hands, on trips to the countryside and on outings with his students. Stephen Hayes, Chief of Staff of the IRA, claimed that Ryan and Stuart were carrying out propaganda work among Irish prisoners of war. This was untrue. They visited a camp for Irish prisoners, who signified their intent of joining an [...] "Irish Guard". Ryan and Clissmann also visited a camp containing some men who intended setting up this Guard. Ryan had nothing to do with this and the scheme came to nothing. Ryan regretted visiting the camp and told Stuart that the whole scheme disheartened him – he only had sympathy with men who were, like he and his comrades had been, in prison camps.|$|E
