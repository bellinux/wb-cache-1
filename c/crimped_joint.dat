40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a novel technical solution that is aimed {{to improve the quality of}} cable crimp terminations in the electronics industry. The automotive, aero and military vehicle industries are of special interest due to their stringent requirements for guaranteed quality assurances in relation to their safety-critical products. The emphasis is on handheld crimping tools, where a new scheme for measuring the relevant crimp force is proposed using a small embedded computer to process information; so as to make an on-instrument statement regarding the crimp process quality. The thesis includes a detailed review of the current technical practices in the cable termination business, with a particular emphasis on the quality estimations for crimped connections using the crimp force monitoring (CFM) scheme. A comprehensive study of the state-of-the-art crimp force monitoring schemes and technologies is presented. A gap in the tool chain is identified whereby the industry has a preference for the use of hand tools in some selected processes; but the CFM scheme cannot be currently integrated directly with such hand tools. The bulk of the work in this thesis is thus focused on the development of a technical solution that will address this need for integration of hand tools with the CFM scheme. The concept is to develop a fully embedded subsystem that can be attached directly to a hand tool and this system will perform all of the signal processing and the statistical analysis so that each <b>crimped</b> <b>joint</b> can be trusted to meet the relevant stated quality parameters. In the course of development work a fully functional prototype subsystem is developed for the CFM solution, for application to hand tools. Analytical and statistical measurement and assessment algorithms were developed to a standard, which allows a final quality rating to be applied to <b>crimped</b> <b>joint</b> connections. Such algorithms are designed to be embedded directly onto the instrument’s microcomputer. The new system has been evaluated and tested in the course of this research project and it has currently been accepted by a number of industries for a planned volume qualification assessment...|$|E
40|$|Over {{its history}} {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) has probably seen {{far and away}} more application in assembling tubes or rings onto (or into) nominally axisymmetric mating elements. The vast majority of these assemblies does not require any significant structural integrity or strength. However, {{a small fraction of}} these are designed and fabricated for mechanically-demanding applications. There are two key factors (which seem to be largely independent) that are key in the design and performance of a crimpedelectromagnetic tube joint. First is the state of residual stress that exists after the <b>crimped</b> <b>joint</b> is created. A natural interference fit seems to be a fairly general feature of EMF crimp joints. This interference gives a backlash-free joint that will not fret. The second key issue is the configuration of the joint. The fabrication of designed interlocking geometries is required to create a joint that maximizes mechanical strength while minimizing the electromagnetic energy and forces required to create it. Both of these issues will be considered here. Here we consider crimping onto textured surfaces such as screw threads and knurls. We show experimentally that approaches of this type can give joints that exceed the strength of the tube both in torsion and axial loading. Analysis methods based on coupling impact-indentation and break-before-strip criteria can be used to compare joints made in this way with those based on the more traditional large scale deformation of the tube. One of the advantages of forming onto 'textured' surfaces is that a number of small pulses (possibly generated by small and inexpensive capacitor banks) can be used to create a joint that has the strength of the parent tube, without any heat affected zones or distortion. Again, the natural interference fit developed by impact eliminates the potential for fretting...|$|E

40|$|Electromagnetic pulse {{crimping}} of {{form fit}} joints was investigated using tubes in the aluminium alloy EN AW- 6060, with {{a diameter of}} 50 mm and a wall thickness of 1, 5 mm. First {{the influence of the}} charging voltage and the geometrical groove parameters on the deformation behaviour and localised thickness reduction of the tube wall was investigated. The experimental results provided data for optimising the groove design. The Design of Experiments method was used to optimise the shape and dimensions of the internal workpieces with a double groove design. Results of tensile tests on the <b>crimp</b> <b>joints</b> allowed determining the most important parameters for the groove design. Based on these observations an optimal double groove joint design was proposed. The deformation and failure behaviour of the <b>crimp</b> <b>joints</b> during tensile testing were experimentally studied using the digital image correlation technique. This technique was used to measure the local and global deformation of the joint. Failure mechanisms include pull-out, local shearing and fracture of the tube. Three main failure modes were observed...|$|R
50|$|After {{the strap}} is tensioned, the strap is often sealed to itself. Steel strap is sealed with a seal and notch joint, a seal and <b>crimp,</b> seal-less <b>joint,</b> or via welding. Seals come in various shapes {{depending}} on the application; some can be put on after the strap is tensioned, while others must be installed before tensioning. To create the seal, the seal and strap are notched on both sides; if one set of notches are created then it is called a single notch joint, if two sets of notches are created then it is called a double notch <b>joint.</b> <b>Crimp</b> <b>joints</b> also use a seal, but crimp undulations are used instead of formed notches. These crimps form great frictional forces which keep the joint from seeping. Seal-less joints are created by forming interlocking keys {{into the middle of}} the strap.|$|R
50|$|Within {{hand tools}} there are manual and {{automatic}} tools. Manual tensioners and crimping systems {{are available for}} low volume applications. Automatic hand tools are used for higher volume applications. Automatic tools are available using a battery power source or compressed air. Both manual and automatic tools are available as combination tools, which perform the tensioning, sealing and cutting, or as separate tensioners, sealers, and cutters. Manual sealers for plastic strap always use a seal and a compression (serrated seals) or <b>crimp</b> <b>joint</b> (smooth faced seals). Manual and automatic hand sealers for steel can use a seal or a seal-less joint. Automatic hand tools for plastic strap use a friction weld.|$|R
40|$|Compared to {{conventional}} forming joining technics, e. q. mechanical crimping, the magnetic pulse crimping gives advantages {{because of a}} contact-free tooling, a symmetrical coaxial pressure and forming, {{as well as a}} low spring back after forming. Limitations of the general functionality of <b>crimp</b> <b>joints</b> also obtain for magnetic pulsed crimp joints: Leak-tightness, combined with corrosion resistance, and a partially Limitation of electrical conductivity (transition resistance). To improve and to extend the functionality of MP-crimp-joints different filler materials can be used. By envi-ronment of a public research project, adhesives, solder and metal coatings have been applied as fill-er materials to MP-crimping. Within the lecture the behavior of the filler materials under the influ-ence of high speed forming, the suitable operating conditions and achieved joint properties will be described...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a project of}} a prototype stand for making inseparable <b>crimped</b> <b>joints</b> through <b>crimping</b> operation, which is commonly used {{in the construction of}} heat exchangers. The joint is formed by tools in form of crimping jaws, which are considered as a punch stamp for pressing two materials into each other. In effect these two materials are mutually “crimped”. This elaboration contains a case study of joints being made by the workstand. Furthermore, the paper {{presents a}}n analysis of features of the joints by examining them by destructive testing: Micrography, Tensile strength test, and non-destructive testing: Leakage test. The elements to be joined have been made of aluminium 6060, which is well matched to indirectly or directly make joints for all kinds of coolers or condensers...|$|R
50|$|The Triodetic System was {{developed}} and patented in Canada in 1955 by F. Fentiman and Sons of Ottawa. This system was originally made from aluminum components. It uses extruded cylindrical solid aluminum hubs (nodes) with slots, and tubular aluminum or steel members with matching <b>crimped</b> ends. Triodetic <b>joints</b> resist tension, compression and combined cross loading. Triodetic domes are designed as double curved shells which allow increased structural advantages for the span:rise ratio. The use of triangles makes the structure rigid and very strong, and similar to the geodesic design, stresses are transmitted throughout the structure. Even with light structural components, triodetic domes are able to withstand extremes of wind and even earth quakes. This enables a large interior volume to be enclosed {{without the need for}} internal supporting columns.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} differences of the kinetics of the crimp and the slope grip used in rock climbing. Nine cadaver fingers were prepared and fixated with the proximal phalanx in a frame. The superficial (FDS) and deep (FDP) flexor tendons were loaded selectively and together with 40 N in the <b>crimp</b> grip (PIP <b>joint</b> flexed 90 °/DIP joint hyperextended) and the slope grip position (< 25 ° flexed/ 50 ° flexed respectively). Five different grip sizes were tested and the flexion force which was generated to the grip was measured. In the crimp grip the FDP generated more flexion force in small sized holds whereas the FDS generated more force in the larger holds. During the slope grip the FDP was {{more effective than the}} FDS. While both tendons were loaded, the flexion force was always greater during crimp grip compared with the slope grip. The FDP seems to be most important for very small holds using the crimp grip but also during slope grip holds whereas the FDS is more important for larger flat holds...|$|R
