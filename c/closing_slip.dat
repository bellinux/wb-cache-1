The number of patients presenting to us over a 6 month period was recorded. The original diagnosis, time to diagnosis of central slip injury and the presence/absence of a boutonniere deformity were recorded. Ten patients were included in the study. Seven (70 %) injuries were due to sport. Eight (80 %) had a delayed diagnosis of central slip injury. Six (60 %) had previously presented to general practitioners or emergency departments.

When seated, the top of the pew came just to his chin, so that his silvery, placid head rose above it like the moon above the horizon.

40|$|For {{a mobile}} {{manipulator}} {{consisting of a}} 4 -wheel skid-steering mobile robot with a 7 -DOF manipulator, {{in order to avoid}} wheel slip caused by unstructured road conditions, the concept of active control is introduced in this paper. By properly changing the configuration of the 7 -DOF arm, the vertical forces of the wheels on the road are adjusted. The wheels which are <b>close</b> to <b>slipping</b> should have a larger force applied so as to be able to avoid the slip. In this paper, an estimate model is built to monitor the slipping condition of the wheels. Additionally, the relationship between the arm's configuration and the vertical force applied on the wheels is also modeled. Finally, those models are verified by experiments on a mobile manipulator. © 2011 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Dielectric spectra in the {{frequency}} range of 0. 1 ≤ ν/GHz ≤ 89 were recorded for acetonitrile, covering temperatures between − 5 and 65 °C. These data are accurately described by a single Debye equation. The obtained values for static relative permittivity, relaxation amplitude and relaxation time exhibit a smooth temperature dependence with low standard uncertainties. Thus, acetonitrile {{may serve as a}} dielectric reference for medium permittivities (ε ≈ 30 − 40). At 25 °C the dielectric spectrum was extended to 8 THz. Its analysis revealed that the short-time dynamics of acetonitrile is dominated by dipole libration and cage rattling. On the picosecond timescale these localized motions fade into rotational diffusion of the AN molecules, which is <b>close</b> to <b>slip</b> boundary conditions. Whilst static dipole–dipole correlations are present to some extent, dynamical correlations appear to be absent for diffusive dipole reorientation...|$|R

500|$|In 1933, Ward {{started all}} eight games for Michigan at right end {{and was a}} key player in Michigan’s second {{consecutive}} undefeated football season and national championship. [...] Time magazine credited the work of Ward and halfback Herman Everhardus: [...] "Michigan came perilously <b>close</b> to <b>slipping</b> {{from the top of the}} Big Ten, where it has been for three years. That it did not slip was largely due to a crack halfback named Herman Everhardus and to Willis Ward, a rangy Negro end. It was Ward who, after hard-fighting Illinois had marched to a touchdown in the first period, shot through and blocked the place kick which would have given Illinois a seventh point." [...] After the season was over, Coach Kipke also credited the play of Everhardus and his ends for the undefeated season: [...] "Our ends, Ward and Petoskey, were near perfection." [...] Michigan's left end, Ted Petoskey was named a first-team All-American in 1933, and Ward earned honorable mention All-American honors at right end.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The main {{objective}} of the paper is to control the speed of an induction machine with scalar control technique. Induction motor (IM) because of its poor dynamic response {{in comparison to the}} DC motor drives. A Voltage Source Inverter (VSI), it is possible to control directly the stator flux linkage and the electromagnetic torque by the optimum selection of inverter switching vectors. The scalar control technique (V/F) is used because of simplicity of control algorithm implementation and the response is better and accurate with <b>closed</b> loop <b>slip</b> compensation the modelling of an IM drive employing V/F method with application of Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) is performed in this article, it is better to understand the V/F method and its difficulties. By using 3 -level inverter, ripples in speed and torque will reduce. The reference voltage vector is then realized using a voltage vector modulator.
