40|$|AIM: To compare {{genotype}} of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{isolated from}} saliva, dental plaques, gastric biopsy, and stool of each patient {{in order to}} evaluate the mode of transmission of H. pylori infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on 300 antral gastric biopsy, saliva, dental plaque and stool samples which were obtained from patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy referred to endoscopy centre of Hajar hospital of Shahrekord, Iran from March 2010 to February 2011. Initially, H. pylori strains were identified by rapid urease test (RUT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were applied to determine the presence of H. pylori (ureC) and for genotyping of voculating cytotoxin gene A (vacA) and cytotoxin associated <b>gene</b> A (<b>cagA)</b> <b>genes</b> in each specimen. Finally the data were analyzed by using statistical formulas such as Chi-square and Fisher&#x 2019;s exact tests to find any significant relationship between these genes and patient&#x 2019;s diseases. P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 300 gastric biopsy samples, 77. 66 % were confirmed to be H. pylori positive by PCR assay while this bacterium were detected in 10. 72 % of saliva, 71. 67 % of stool samples. We {{were not able to}} find it in dental plaque specimens. The prevalence of H. pylori was 90. 47 % among patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD), 80 % among patients with gastric cancer, and 74. 13 % among patients with none ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) by PCR assay. The evaluation of vacA and <b>cagA</b> <b>genes</b> showed 6 differences between gastric biopsy and saliva specimens and 11 differences between gastric and stool specimens. 94. 42 % of H. pylori positive specimens were cagA positive and all samples had amplified band both for vacA s and m regions. There was significant relationship between vacA s 1 a/m 1 a and PUD diseases (P = 0. 04), s 2 /m 2 genotype and NUD diseases (P = 0. 05).

40|$|The Helicobacter pylori immunodominant protein, CagA, is {{associated}} with severe gastritis and carcinoma. Injection of CagA into gastric epithelial cells by type IV secretion leads to actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell scattering.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} is prevalent in Ghana. The development of gastro-duodenal disease {{is dependent on}} virulence of the infecting strain, host susceptibility and environmental factors. Helicobacter pylori cagA and vacA strains induce more inflammation, ulceration and oncogenesis. Here, {{for the first time}} we present data on H. pylori <b>cagA</b> and vacA <b>genes</b> and their association with gastro-duodenal disease in Ghana. A total of 159 patients with dyspepsia at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, were investigated for H. pylori with urease-CLO, of which 113 (71. 1 %) were positive. Genomic DNA was extracted from antral biopsies using QIAGEN DNeasy kit. Detection of H. pylori vacA and <b>cagA</b> <b>genes</b> were determined by PCR as previously described. RESULTS: In total, 110 (69. 2 %) vacAs 1, 71 (44. 7 %) vacAm 1, 35 (22. 0 %) vacAm 2, 77 (48. 4 %) cagA-(hydrophilic region) and 109 (68. 6 %) cagA-(internal duplication region) were detected. In multivariate analysis, duodenal ulcer was more likely than other diagnoses to have detectable cagA-(hydrophilic region) (OR 3. 1 CI 1. 2 - 7. 9) or vacAs 1 m 1 (OR 6. 5 CI 1. 2 - 34. 0).

The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 82. 1 % in 112 patients with gallstones and 80. 3 % in 112 controls (NS). Fifteen bile samples out of 23 specimens from infected patients (65. 2 %) contained anti-CagA antibodies.

METHODS: Construction of a cagA knock out mutant Hp 27 _ΔcagA (cagA-) via homologous recombination with the wild-type strain Hp 27 (cagA+) as a recipient was performed. The method of sonication-urea-CHAPS-DTT was employed to extract bacterial proteins from both strains. Soluble proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE). Images of 2 -DE gels were digitalized and analyzed. Only spots that had a statistical significance in differential expression were selected and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Biological information was used to search protein database and identify the biological function of proteins. RESULTS: The proteome expressions between wild-type strain and isogenic mutant with the <b>cagA</b> <b>gene</b> knocked-out were compared. Five protein spots with high abundance in bacteria proteins of wild-type strains, down-regulated or absently expressed in bacteria proteins of mutants, were identified and analyzed.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four children with dyspepsia (54 boys, 70 girls; mean age 10. 5 years; range 4 - 19) underwent gastroscopy: 56 had H. pylori infection (31 girls, 25 boys), while 68 (37 girls and 31 boys), were H. pylori-negative. All sera were tested for the presence of: parietal cell autoantibodies (PCA), intrinsic factor autoantibodies (IFA), microsomial autoantibodies, thyroglobulin autoantibodies, islet cell autoantibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies, adrenal cortex autoantibodies, steroid-producing cell autoantibodies; gastrin, pepsinogen A, pepsinogen C and anti-H. pylori antibodies. The histological features and the ureA and <b>cagA</b> <b>genes</b> were also considered. RESULTS: The frequency of organ-specific autoantibodies was higher in patients with H. pylori infection than in uninfected patients (chi 2 -test p <. 0001).

Patients and Methods: 100 serum samples of patients with above IgG titer against Helicobacter pylori were examined with PCR to investigate the existence of <b>cagA</b> <b>gene.</b> Moreover triglyceride and cholesterol titers and blood pressure were measured. Results: Eighteen samples out of 100 positive serumic samples from patients with helicobacter pylori had a positive result for the existence of <b>cagA</b> <b>gene.</b> Twelve samples (66 ٪) out of eighteen serumic samples had triglyceride and cholesterol titer greater than the normal levels. From 18 specimens detected in sera, about 12 people had cardiac disorders and 10 patients had high blood pressure. Conclusions: Since secretion system of type IV is capable of secreting both genome and the protein of this bacterium into the cell, we decided to investigate the existence of <b>cagA</b> <b>gene</b> in sera. This bacterium was unable to induce septicemia and bacteriemia; the possibility is that the gene integrated with protein cagA to blood, was protected from degradation which increases the risk of antibody production against these factors and elevates the risk of heart disease. For this reason, for the first time in the world, we studied the presence of cagA genome in serum samples...|$|E
40|$|Background—Helicobacter pylori strains {{possessing}} the <b>cagA</b> <b>gene</b> {{are thought to}} induce interleukin 8 (IL- 8) in gastric mucosa. However, it is still unclear whether a relation exists between the <b>cagA</b> <b>gene</b> and the expression patterns of cytokines other than IL- 8.  Aims—To investigate {{the relation between the}} <b>cagA</b> <b>gene</b> and the production of various cytokine proteins using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Patients and methods—In 184 patients, the <b>cagA</b> <b>gene</b> was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and levels of production of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 7, IL- 8, IL- 10, and tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in antral biopsy specimens were measured by ELISA.  Results—Mucosal levels of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-α were significantly higher in H pylori positive than in H pylori negative patients. Furthermore, the mucosal levels of IL- 1 β and IL- 8 were significantly higher in specimens infected with cagA positive strains than in those infected with cagA negative strains. In H pylori positive patients, the mucosal level of IL- 8 was closely correlated with that of IL- 1 β (p< 0. 0001), and the mucosal level of IL- 6 was closely correlated with that of TNF-α (p< 0. 0001).  Conclusion—These findings suggest that the ability to induce cytokines differs among the strains; cagA+ strains induce various kinds of cytokines and may cause severe inflammation, whereas cagA strains induce IL- 8 and IL- 1 β only weakly and may cause only mild inflammation. However, as most patients infected with the cagA+ strains have gastritis, these strains may not be equivalent to ulcerogenic strains. ...|$|E
40|$|The Helicobacter pylori is {{associated}} with the development of different diseases. The clinical outcome of infection may be associated with the cagA bacterial genotype. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the EPIYA patterns of strains isolated from patients with gastritis and gastric adenocarcinoma and correlate these patterns with the histopathological features. Gastric biopsy samples were selected from 384 patients infected with H. pylori, including 194 with chronic gastritis and 190 with gastric adenocarcinoma. The presence of the <b>cagA</b> <b>gene</b> and the EPIYA motif was determined by PCR. The <b>cagA</b> <b>gene</b> was more prevalent in patients with gastric cancer and was associated with a higher degree of inflammation, neutrophil activity, and development of intestinal metaplasia. The number of EPIYA-C repeats showed a significant association with an increased risk of gastric carcinoma (OR = 3. 79, 95 % CI = 1. 92 – 7. 46, and P= 0. 002). A larger number of EPIYA-C motifs were also associated with intestinal metaplasia. In the present study, infection with H. pylori strains harboring more than one EPIYA-C motif in the <b>cagA</b> <b>gene</b> was associated with the development of intestinal metaplasia and gastric adenocarcinoma but not with neutrophil activity or degree of inflammation...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{verify the}} {{methylation}} status of CDH 1, DAPK, COX 2, hMLH 1 and CDKN 2 A genes and {{to evaluate their}} association with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) -cagA(+) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infections in gastric adenocarcinomas. METHODS: Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay was performed in 89 primary gastric carcinomas (intestinal and diffuse types). Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis was performed using the BAT 26 primer set and PCR products were analyzed with the ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer using Genescan 3. 7 software (Applied Biosystems). Detection of H, pylori and genotyping were performed by PCR, using specific primers for ureaseC and <b>cagA</b> <b>genes.</b> The presence of EBV was assessed by in situ hybridization. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi(2) or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The most frequent hypermethylated gene was COX- 2 (63. 5 %) followed by DAPK (55. 7 %), CDH 1 (51 %), CDKN 2 A (36 %) and hMLH 1 (30. 3 %). Intestinal and diffuse adenocarcinomas showed different methylation profiles {{and there was an}} association between methylation of E-CDH 1 and H. pylori-cagA(+) in the intestinal adenocarcinoma type. MSI was correlated with hMLH 1 methylation. There was an inverse correlation between DAPK hypermethylation and MSI. CONCLUSION: We found a strong association between CDH 1 methylation and H, pylori-cagA+ in intestinal-type gastric cancer, association of MSI and better prognosis and an heterogeneous COX- 2 overexpression.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori vacA and <b>cagA</b> <b>genes</b> have {{significant}} genetic heterogenicity, resulting in different clinical outcomes. Northeast part of China has reported high prevalence of H. pylori infections and gastric cancer. Hence, we investigated the H. pylori cagA and vacA genotypes with clinical outcomes in Northeast China. Gastric tissue samples (n= 169), chronic gastritis (GIs), gastric ulcer (GU), and gastric cancer (GC) were analysed for 16 S rRNA ureA, cagA, and cagA genotypes by PCR. A total of 141 (84 %) cases were found positive for H. pylori by 16 S rRNA and ureA. GC showed high H. pylori infection (93 %) compared with GIs (72 %) and GU (84 %). The vacAs 1 am 1 was highly found in GC (40 %) and GU (36 %), vacAs 1 am 2 in GIs (33 %), vacAs 1 bm 1 (14 %) and vacAs 1 bm 2 (8 %) in GU cases, and s 2 m 1 in normal cases (33 %), while vacAs 1 cm 1 showed low frequency in GIs (2 %) and GU (3 %) and GC showed negative result. The East-Asian cagA strain was highly observed in GC (43 %), {{as compared to}} GIs (41 %) and GU (20 %). The East-Asian cagA/vacAs 1 am 1 was significantly higher in GC (23 %) than in GU (22 %) and GIs (145) patients. The East-Asian type cagA with vacAs 1 a and vacAm 1 is the most predominant genotype in H. pylori strains of Northeast China...|$|R
