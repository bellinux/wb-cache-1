50|$|Wari first {{appeared}} in Wonder Woman #1, volume 1, published {{in the summer of}} 1942, written and created by Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston as the embodiment of all abnormal emotions, evil, and essentially all that Wonder Woman was against. In the very next issue, he reappeared under his Roman name, Storm. He would retain this name until February 1987, when comics writer/artist George Pérez restored the Greek name Ares as part of his reboot of the Wonder Woman mythos. As the narrative continuity of Wonder Woman comics have been adjusted by different writers throughout the years, various versions of Mars/Ares, with various personalities and physical appearances, have been presented, though most have been depicted wearing Greek hoplite or Roman gladiator armor. The character's longest-running look, designed by George Pérez (at right), is that of a red-eyed Greek warrior clad in black and indigo battle armor, face hidden by an Attic helmet. After DC's continuity was again rebooted in 2011 (an event known as the New 52), the <b>character</b> <b>cycled</b> through several divergent visual interpretations before returning to his Pérez-inspired warrior design.|$|R

Nowadays, this issue is already being discussed, but the issue of domestic violence against women or children is still at the forefront.

At the beginning of the theoretical part, I focused on defining the concept of domestic violence: its definition, forms, <b>characters,</b> <b>cycle</b> Then I continued with the protection of domestic violence and victims of domestic violence. In the last part of the theoretical part, I looked at the man as a victim of domestic violence. I dedicated what can be a role of man in a domestic violence, what are the manifestations of this domestic violence, how can a threatened man be helped. Finally, I added real life cases. To achieve the intended goals, I used a qualitative research method in the practical part, with the main research method being an anonymous questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 14 questions, of which 12 questions are with a closed answer and for 2 questions respondents answered in their own words.
