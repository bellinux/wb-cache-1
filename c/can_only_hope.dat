If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a showdown occurs.

A player may use both of their own two hole cards, only one, or none at all, to form their final five-card hand.

[...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry [...] "solid and efficient". The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that [...] "as a director [...] makes 'Underneath' shine", but were critical of some of the [...] "trademark X-File moments", citing [...] "the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror" [...] and [...] "the climactic fight in a sewer" [...] as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett.

Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a [...] "C" [...] grade. She sarcastically wrote, [...] "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up.

[...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode [...] "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin. The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, [...] "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" [...] but shows that the most important [...] "things to care about in life" [...] are [...] "humans". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this was a pleasant yet bittersweet episode, one that leaves the characters in relative peace.

40|$|Why {{has there}} been such {{long-term}} controversy (LTC) over the mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) ? The inability to resolve this debate may have many sources, including intrinsically empirical as well as sociological factors. Certainly, the regulatory mechanisms underlying modification of transmission in the brain {{are likely to be}} complex, and the tools we posses are relatively coarse. In this light, the fact that scientists generally are clever enough to think of mechanistic scenarios that cannot be disproved by existing empirical tools complicates the search. Furthermore, the imbalanced impact of positive results over negative results, or the natural bias of scientists to champion their own point of view, can prolong the discourse.
