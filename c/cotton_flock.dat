60|$|There {{were still}} {{four hours of}} {{daylight}} after they had finished their meal, so they went out with Dias to explore one of the numerous burying- grounds round the village. It consisted of sunken chambers. In these were bones, with remains of the mats in which the bodies had been clothed. These wrappings resembled small sacks, and they remarked that the people must have been of very small size, or they could never have been packed away in them. With them had been buried many of the implements of their trade. One or two had apparently not been opened. Here were knitting utensils, toilet articles, implements for weaving, spools of thread, needles of bone and bronze. With {{the body of a}} girl had been placed a kind of work-box, containing the articles that she had used, and the mummy of a parrot, some beads, and fragments of an ornament of silver. Dias told them that all these tombs were made long before the coming of the Incas. He said that round the heads of the men and boys were wound the slings they had used in life, while a piece of <b>cotton</b> <b>flock</b> was wrapped round the heads of the women. Many of the graves communicated with each other by very narrow passages; the purpose of these was not clear, but probably they were made to enable the spirits of the dead to meet and hold communion with each other.|$|E
40|$|The fires which {{recently}} occurred in flock machines in America {{have shown that}} toady's knowledge of the ignitability of flock clouds on flock machines is not sufficient. This is why it has been investigated {{within the scope of}} a research project which minimum spark energy is required to ignite flock clouds on flock machines. The first step taken for this purpose consisted in measuring the minimum ignition energy of more than 60 commercial flock samples on a minimum ignition energy apparatus optimized for high spark energies. It turned out that the minimum ignition energy of flock depends on fiber diameter, fiber length, fiber material, type and quantity of the chemical preparation compound and on the fiber color. Average flock has a minimum ignition energy of about 150 mJ. The lowest value of approx. 80 mJ was obtained for the finest commercial ground <b>cotton</b> <b>flock.</b> If the fines content can accumulate, it is, however, possible that even much lower values can be reached. In a second step it was tried to ignite the most ignitable flock samples by sparks and arc discharges from flock machines. It turned out that the single sparks of DC flock machines which are not ignition-optimized ignited the most ignitable flock samples only at discharge energies above 1300 mJ. Such discharges can occur only during failures of large DC facilities. (orig.)

5000|$|The {{forerunner of}} the cue was the , an {{implement}} {{similar to a}} light-weight golf club, with a foot that was generally used to shove rather than strike the cue ball. When the ball was [...] against a , use of the mace was difficult (the foot would not fit under {{the edge of the}} cushion to strike the ball squarely), and by 1670 experienced players often used the tail or butt end of the mace instead. The term [...] "cue" [...] comes from queue, the French word for [...] "tail", in reference to this practice, a style of shooting that eventually {{led to the development of}} separate, footless cue sticks by about 1800, used initially as adjuncts to the mace, which remained in use until well into the 19th century. In public billiard rooms only skilled players were allowed to use the cue, because the fragile cloth could be torn by novices. [...] The introduction of the cue, and the new game possibilities it engendered, led to the development of cushions with more rebound, initially stuffed with linen or <b>cotton</b> <b>flocking,</b> but eventually replaced by rubber.|$|R

5000|$|The mill was rebuilt {{after the}} attack and {{converted}} to a corn mill, until it was bought in 1840 by Peter Ditchfield, a cotton manufacturer who restored it to a cotton mill. On his death in 1854 the mill, by then employing some 40 people, passed to his son, Peter Ditchfield, jnr. After many years of spinning <b>cotton</b> and making <b>flock,</b> production ceased and the mill stood empty. It was eventually demolished in 1912 and the site is still (2017) a vacant lot.|$|R
40|$|Parameters like zone reading, {{inoculum}} density, and plate streaking {{influence the}} {{precision and accuracy}} of disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). While improved reading precision has been demonstrated using automated imaging systems, standardization of the inoculum and of plate streaking have not been systematically investigated yet. This study analyzed whether photometrically controlled inoculum preparation and/or automated inoculation could further improve the standardization of disk diffusion. Suspensions of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 of 0. 5 McFarland standard were prepared by 10 operators using both visual comparison to turbidity standards and a Densichek photometer (bioMÃ©rieux), and the resulting CFU counts were determined. Furthermore, eight experienced operators each inoculated 10 Mueller-Hinton agar plates using a single 0. 5 McFarland standard bacterial suspension of E. coli ATCC 25922 using regular <b>cotton</b> swabs, dry <b>flocked</b> swabs (Copan, Brescia, Italy), or an automated streaking device (BD-Kiestra, Drachten, Netherlands). The mean CFU counts obtained from 0. 5 McFarland standard E. coli ATCC 25922 suspensions were significantly different for suspensions prepared by eye and by Densichek (P < 0. 001). Preparation by eye resulted in counts that were closer to the CLSI/EUCAST target of 10 (8) CFU/ml than those resulting from Densichek preparation. No {{significant differences in the}} standard deviations of the CFU counts were observed. The interoperator differences in standard deviations when dry flocked swabs were used decreased significantly compared to the differences when regular cotton swabs were used, whereas the mean of the standard deviations of all operators together was not significantly altered. In contrast, automated streaking significantly reduced both interoperator differences, i. e., the individual standard deviations, compared to the standard deviations for the manual method, and the mean of the standard deviations of all operators together, i. e., total methodological variation...|$|R
5000|$|The basic combat {{clothing}} was a <b>flocked</b> <b>cotton</b> over nylon. There {{are many different}} variations on the Canadian combat shirt (tunic); one was a simple button up with FN magazine type pockets, another made of a heavier material (for cold weather) and had a zipper in place of buttons with the same pocket style but without dividers for FNC1A1 magazines, and the cadet combats that was made of a lighter material then to both and had different pockets arrangement and size as well as no draw strings. The combat jacket was of heavy cotton while the arctic jacket had a nylon shell. Both the combat shirt and the jackets had two lower cargo pockets with inserts that could hold 3 FNC1A1 20 round magazines each. The upper 2 pockets were angled inward and could hold 1 FNC1A1 magazine each. The combat shirts also have one inner pocket that was held closed by velcro and was clearly visible by an outline of thread on the outer {{right side of the}} shirt. Both the jackets and combat shirts have draw strings on the bottom {{and in the middle of}} the shirt, these were there to prevent debris and winds from entering the shirt as well as to prevent billowing during para jumping. Combat pants have buttons on every belt loop, this was if the pants were to large you could button over to the next button to make them smaller. Combat pants also had [...] "blousers" [...] which were tucked into the boots and the draw string on the bottom of the pant leg with be tightened around the top of the boot to keep out foreign objects and pests. Often the [...] "blousers" [...] were ripped out of the pant leg and used as toilet paper.|$|R
