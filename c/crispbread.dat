50|$|<b>Crispbread</b> {{has been}} baked in central Sweden since 500 AD. It was made as round wafers {{with a hole}} in the middle so the bread could be stored on sticks under the roof. Traditional <b>crispbread</b> was invented about 500 years ago. Finland and Sweden have long traditions in <b>crispbread</b> consumption, and <b>crispbread</b> has been known in most {{households}} since the 1800s. Traditionally, crispbreads were baked just twice a year; following harvest and again in the spring when frozen river waters began to flow. Traditional western Finnish <b>crispbread</b> was (and still is) made {{in the form of a}} round flat loaf {{with a hole in}} the middle to facilitate storage on long poles hanging near the ceiling. Sweden's first industrial <b>crispbread</b> bakery, AU Bergmans enka, began its production in Stockholm in 1850. Rectangular Knäckebrot was first manufactured in Germany in 1927 and has remained popular and readily available there ever since.|$|E

50|$|Bread Ice Cream - In Grythyttan {{in central}} Sweden, the local {{ice cream and}} {{chocolate}} shop has invented a new ice cream. They have taken an ordinary white vanilla ice cream and flavoured it with dry <b>crispbread</b> of rye (knäckebröd). Small pieces of the bread are also added to the ice cream, giving it the texture of both smooth ice cream and hard and sometime soggy bites of the <b>crispbread.</b> The ice cream is very popular among young people.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the association of}} melanoma risk with food consumption in a northern Italian population in which disease risk was shown to correlate with linoleic acid and soluble carbohydrates intake. We collected information regarding the habitual consumption of 188 food items in 59 patients with newly diagnosed cutaneous melanoma and 59 sex- and age-matched population controls. In the unadjusted analyses, the intake of several foodstuffs directly or inversely correlated with melanoma risk. In multivariate analysis adjusting for several potential confounders, risk correrlated directly with vegetable oil intake and inversely with consumption of <b>crispbreads</b> and rusk. Overall, most of the food items rich in linoleic acid and soluble carbohydrated were unrelated to disease risk. Despite the limited statistical precision of the point estimates, these findings {{seem to indicate that}} consumption of specific foods may influence melanoma risk...|$|R
50|$|Swedish cuisine {{could be}} {{described}} as centered around cultured dairy products, crisp and soft (often sugared) breads, berries and stone fruits, beef, chicken, lamb, pork, and seafood. Potatoes are often served as a side dish, often boiled. Swedish cuisine has a huge variety of breads of different shapes and sizes, made of rye, wheat, oat, white, dark, sourdough, and whole grain, and including flatbreads and <b>crispbreads.</b> There are many sweetened bread types and some use spices. Many meat dishes, especially meatballs, are served with lingonberry jam. Fruit soups with high viscosity, like rose hip soup and blueberry soup (blåbärssoppa) served hot or cold, are typical of Swedish cuisine. Butter and margarine are the primary fat sources, although olive oil is becoming more popular. Sweden's pastry tradition features a variety of yeast buns, cookies, biscuits and cakes; many of them are in a very sugary style and often eaten with coffee (fika).|$|R

The most consistent recommendations were for sliced breads, with most manufacturers recommending two slices as a serve, and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals (one cup). The median values for cereal products were mostly lower than the typical reported amounts consumed by adult Australians and those recommended in the AGHE. The recommended serves for pulses were higher than the AGHE serves. It is suggested that food manufacturers attempt to standardise the values closer to those in the AGHE and to provide both raw and cooked serve sizes, where appropriate.

50|$|In Medieval times (1100-1200 AD) {{in central}} and {{southern}} Sweden, rye flour was baked into soft loafs or, in the central regions, into <b>crispbread</b> (knäckebröd, “bread which can be broken”). The <b>crispbread</b> was baked {{with a hole in}} the middle so that it could be threaded over a beam and stored suspended from the ceiling. From Medieval times and the introduction of the first simple watermills, these flatbreads and crispbreads were baked only {{once or twice a year}} and kept dry in a storage chamber.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crispbread</b> (näkkileipä in Finnish) are leavened rye breads {{that are}} dried into thin crisp. They are {{sometimes}} made using sour dough. <b>Crispbread</b> are very common throughout the Nordic countries and if stored properly will not spoil {{for a long}} time. Variants of crisp bread are thicker (½ cm), air-containing crisps (called just näkkileipä) and thinner sour crisps (hapankorppu). The most common type, often stereotypically associated with schools and other institutions, is rectangular in shape, e.g. Koulunäkki and Kunto brands. A round shape is another variant. Hapankorppu is rectangular.|$|E
40|$|Fumonisins B (FBs) {{can occur}} in maize as free forms and as hidden FBs (interaction between FBs and matrix macro-constituents). The {{analytical}} methods to detect free FBs in maize and derived products usually involve extraction with aqueous methanol and/or acetonitrile; for hidden FBs, alkaline hydrolysis (2 MKOH) and following CH 3 CN extraction is used. Recently, we proposed a simple phosphate buffer (PB) extraction to detect free FBs in masa and maize samples. This study aimed at evaluating if this method is suitable to detect also hidden FBs; then, a comparison between the most common solvents, PB, and alkaline hydrolysis was carried out. For maize samples, {{the results showed that}} 0. 4 M PB can extract both free and most hidden FBs; however, this method was not suitable for some categories of maize-based processed food products, in particular cornflakes, chips, and <b>crispbreads.</b> To solve this drawback, a modified PB extraction, which entails the addition of Carrez solutions in order to precipitate proteins, was tested and satisfactory results were obtained. Finally, the alkaline hydrolysis of maize-based food extracts showed that bound FBs can be co-extracted together with free forms by 0. 4 M PB and quantified as hydrolyzed FBs...|$|R

40|$|Sourdough {{fermentation}} {{is considered}} to have beneficial effects on postprandial satiety and metabolic responses, but studies demonstrating effects at physiological conditions are lacking. The aim of this acute breakfast intervention {{study was to determine}} the effect of consumption of sourdough-fermented and unfermented rye <b>crispbread</b> on self-rated appetite, postprandial glucose and insulin response in healthy subjects. In all, twenty-four Swedish adults were included in a single-blinded, randomised cross-over trial. Three crispbreads (sourdough-fermented and unfermented whole grain rye and yeast-fermented refined wheat as control) were consumed as part of a standardised breakfast. Subjective appetite score, assessed using visual analogue scale, and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at baseline and postprandially until 360 and 240 min, respectively. Structural changes and viscosity during mastication and gastric digestion were investigated using in vitro methods. Hunger and desire to eat were lower (P< 005) based on AUC measurements after intake of sourdough-fermented rye <b>crispbread</b> compared with after intake of yeast-fermented refined wheat <b>crispbread.</b> On the basis of AUC (0 - 230 min), insulin response was lowest after intake of unfermented rye <b>crispbread</b> compared with sourdough-fermented rye and yeast-fermented refined wheat <b>crispbread.</b> Degradation of viscous fibres and faster bolus disintegration for the sourdough-fermented bread may partly explain the less favourable metabolic responses compared with unfermented bread.

40|$|Insulin resistance, {{high blood}} glucose and raised total blood {{cholesterol}} are major {{risk factors for}} cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Partly they are caused by overweight and obesity. Diet is an important modifiable determinant for these risk factors and understanding how food characteristics, e. g. composition and structure, influence appetite and metabolic responses might aid {{in the development of}} healthy foods. In this thesis I examined how formulation, processing techniques (baking, cooking, extrusion) and process parameters affect rye, oat and wheat food characteristics (including structure and dietary fibre composition) and the implications of this for appetite and metabolic responses in humans. In vitro digestion methods were used to study structural changes, gastric disintegration, digesta viscosity and glucose release. In human trials, the effect of aeration method (fermentation or whipping) in rye <b>crispbread</b> production on appetite and metabolic responses was evaluated. When inulin was added to rye porridge, available water was reduced, decreasing starch gelatinisation and viscosity, changes with potentially counteracting effects on glucose response in humans. Smaller oat bran particles in bread increased degradation of β-glucan during fermentation, but also increased their solubility, events with opposing effects on digesta viscosity. Increased viscosity is an underlying mechanism for the ability of β-glucans, and certain other dietary fibres, to lower glucose response and total blood cholesterol. In fermented rye <b>crispbread</b> viscous fibres were more degraded and postprandial insulin response higher when compared with unfermented rye <b>crispbread.</b> However, the effect could also be attributed to slower gastric disintegration for the unfermented rye <b>crispbread.</b> Choice of aeration method had no observable impact on appetite. An amylose layer surrounding starch granules was observed only in sourdough-fermented soft rye bread. This seemed to inhibit glucose release, despite degraded viscous dietary fibres and rapid gastric disintegration. To conclude, processing and formulation were found to generally affect more than one food characteristic, which might be of relevance for a specific metabolic response. The net effect of characteristics associated with a targeted metabolic response should be considered when designing or selecting foods intended to promote health...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} effect on blood glucose {{concentrations}} of guar incorporated into crispbreads with that of unprocessed high-fibre foods groups of four to six diabetics took a total of seven test breakfasts on separate days. By comparison with a breakfast of wholemeal bread and cheese, guar <b>crispbread</b> combined with bread reduced the area under the glucose response curve to 51 % (p < 0. 05); bread and soya beans reduced the area to 65 % (p < 0. 05); guar <b>crispbread</b> with soya beans to 25 % (p < 0. 002); and soya beans with lentils to 29 % (p < 0. 002).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{exposure}} to enzymes and prevalence of enzyme sensitisation in the baking industry. METHODS: A cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} four bakeries, one flour mill, and one <b>crispbread</b> factory. Sensitisation to enzymes, flours, and storage mites was examined by skin prick and radioallergosorbent (RAST) tests. 365 workers were tested. The workers were interviewed for work related respiratory and skin symptoms. Total dust concentrations were measured by a gravimetric method, and the concentration of alpha-amylase in air was measured by a catalytic method. An immunochemical method was used for measuring cellulase and xylanase in air. RESULTS: Total measured dust concentrations were from 0. 1 to 18 mg/m 3, with highest values in dough making areas of bakeries. The alpha-amylase concentrations generally followed the total dust concentrations and reached the highest values < 6. 6 micrograms/m 3 in the same areas. Cellulase and xylanase varied with concentrations < 180 ng/m 3 and < 40 ng/m 3, respectively, in the flour mill and the <b>crispbread</b> factory. No cellulase, but concentrations of 1 - 200 ng/m 3 xylanase, were found in the bakeries, probably indicating the natural xylanase activity of wheat. 12 workers (8 %) in the bakeries, three (5 %) in the flour mill, and four (3 %) in the <b>crispbread</b> factory were skin prick positive to enzymes. The corresponding percentages of positive reactions to flours were 12 %, 5 %, and 8 %. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that industrial enzymes in baking used as additives in a powdered form pose a risk of sensitisation. The no effect air concentrations for industrial enzymes are not known. Based on present knowledge, however, lowering exposures and eliminating short and high peaks by technical measures would lower the risk of sensitisation. This would be most effectively accomplished by shifting to non-dusty products...|$|E
