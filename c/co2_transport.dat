Currently, both membrane and amine-based absorption processes can be designed to yield a 90% CO2 capture rate. [...] For carbon capture at an average 600 MW coal-fired power plant, the cost of CO2 capture using amine-based absorption is in the $40-100 per ton of CO2 range, while the cost of CO2 capture using current membrane technology (including current process design schemes) is about $23 per ton of CO2. Additionally, running an amine-based absorption process at an average 600 MW coal-fired power plant consumes about 30% of the energy generated by the power plant, while running a membrane process requires about 16% of the energy generated. <b>CO2</b> <b>transport</b> (e.g. to geologic sequestration sites, or to be used for EOR) costs about $2-5 per ton of CO2.This cost is the same for all types of CO2 capture/separation processes such as membrane separation and absorption.

40|$|Playing a {{key role}} in plant growth and development, leaves need to be {{continuously}} supplied with water and carbon dioxide to fulfil their photosynthetic function. On its way through the leaf from the xylem to the stomata, water can either move through cell walls or pass from cell to cell to cross the different tissues. Although both pathways are probably used to some degree, evidence is accumulating that living cells contribute substantially to the overall leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf)). Transcellular water flow is facilitated and regulated by water channels in the membranes, named aquaporins (AQPs). This review addresses how AQP expression and activity effectively regulate the leaf water balance in normal conditions and modify the cell membrane water permeability in response to different environmental factors, such as irradiance, temperature, and water supply.

40|$|CO₂ {{diffusion}} across membranes {{is one of}} {{the rate}} limiting steps during photosynthesis, therefore understanding the process of CO₂ permeation across membranes is important. The question of whether <b>CO₂</b> <b>transport</b> across membranes can be facilitated by aquaporins is very controversial. Previous research where aquaporins were heterologously expressed in either Xenopus oocytes or yeast protoplasts showed that some plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) or animal aquaporins could facilitate <b>CO₂</b> <b>transport.</b> However, others have demonstrated using molecular simulation approaches and biophysical calculations that the unstirred layer poses the major rate limiting step for CO₂ diffusion across membranes, and that it is unlikely that CO₂ permeates via the water pathway in aquaporins, because this pathway exhibits a greater energy barrier compared to that for the lipid bilayer. If water and CO₂ share the same pathway through aquaporins or if the presence and activity of aquaporins somehow affects CO₂ permeation, there should be a correlation between water permeability and CO₂ permeability. Therefore, by employing the stopped-flow technique and using pea plasma membrane vesicles isolated from pea leaves, this thesis explored the links between CO₂ permeability and water permeability. Plasma membrane vesicles from pea plants that were grown in different conditions showed considerable variability in water permeability. The very high and variable (between preparations) water permeability (0. 06 to 0. 18 m s⁻¹) plus the low activation energy (10. 8 KJ mol⁻¹) of water transport indicated aquaporins dominated water flow, yet there was no significant correlation between water permeability and CO₂ permeability (1. 49 x 10 - 2 cm s⁻¹). The activation energy for CO₂ permeation was 37 KJ/mol which is about double that for CO₂ diffusion in water. Also the aquaporin inhibitor silver sulfadiazine resulted in a large inhibition of water permeability but this did not affect CO₂ permeability. Similar results were obtained for plasma membrane vesicles isolated from Arabidopsis leaves though the water permeability was lower. In performing these measurements care was taken to exclude artifacts caused by the concentration of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and its temperature dependence, since vesicular entrapped CA was required to measure CO₂ permeability via changes in vesicular pH. Because there are not many aquaporins that have been identified in pea, some Arabidopsis aquaporins that have been suggested to be involved in <b>CO₂</b> <b>transport</b> were expressed in Xenopus oocytes for further investigation. Water transport via these aquaporins was first studied. It was demonstrated that PIP 2 s were functional water channels when expressed alone, while PIP 1 s were not. However when PIP 1 and PIP 2 aquaporins were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes a greater than additive effect on water permeation was observed for some combinations. This suggested that AtPIP 1; 2 and AtPIP 2; 1, and AtPIP 1; 5 and AtPIP 2; 1 interact. A previously identified natural mutation in the pore region of VvPIP 2; 5 from grapevine (G 100 W), which prevented water flow, was used to probe AtPIP 2; 1 and its interaction with AtPIP 1; 2. This showed that the interaction still occurred despite the lower water permeation of the combined pair when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Originally, the CO₂ permeabilities of the Arabidopsis aquaporins of interest were intended to be tested using the external pH micro-electrode technique which was first employed to test <b>CO₂</b> <b>transport</b> across Xenopus oocyte plasma membrane. However, one of the criteria for using this technique is that the expression of the aquaporins should not induce any ion conductance, which would potentially alter external pH either directly or indirectly. Therefore, electrophysiology experiments were conducted to test whether the expressed aquaporins induced any ionic currents. It was found that AtPIP 2; 1 indeed induced ionic currents selective to anions including HCO₃⁻ when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. It was demonstrated that AtPIP 2; 1 homotetramer was likely to function as an ion channel since when co-expressed with its interacting partner (AtPIP 1; 2) this abolished the anion conductance. Furthermore the G 100 W mutation also prevented anion conductance of the AtPIP 2; 1 indicating that the pathway may be via the water pore. Expression of AtPIP 2; 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was undertaken to test a potential anion sensitivity induced by the expression of AtPIP 2; 1. The expression of AtPIP 2; 1 induced increased water permeability of the yeast spheroplast as it does in Xenopus oocytes, and gave a low growth phenotype on all media tested, however this could not be linked to increased anion transport. This thesis has demonstrated that measurements of CO₂ permeability are extremely difficult and likely to be limited by factors not always controlled for in previous experiments. Furthermore it has been demonstrated that some plant PIP aquaporins may function as anion channels and that this could complicate the interpretation of CO₂ permeation particularly when the HCO₃⁻ anion can permeate as was demonstrated for AtPIP 2; 1.

40|$|Palytoxin (PTX) is {{classified}} {{as one of the}} most powerful marine biotoxins (of high molecular weight and no protein origin) because it is able to interact strongly with important cellular structures influencing their function in different biological processes. This study of the effects of PTX on red blood cells (RBC) extends the knowledge about its toxicity, which concerns not only the well-known action on Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase but also band 3 protein (B 3 or AE 1), the role of which is essential for anion transport and for the structure, function, and metabolic integrity of the erythrocyte. The effects of PTX on RBC can be summarized as follows: it alters the anionic flux and seriously compromises not only <b>CO(2)</b> <b>transport</b> but also the metabolic modulation centered on the oxy-deoxy cycle of hemoglobin; it stabilizes the plasma membrane by preventing lipid peroxidation; and its effect does not lead to activation of caspases 3 and 8.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} some acid-base abnormalities on blood capacity of transporting CO(2). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: General and Cardiosurgical ICUs of a University hospital. PATIENTS: Six groups of ten patients characterized by: metabolic alkalosis; respiratory alkalosis; absence of acid-base abnormalities; metabolic acidosis; uncompensated respiratory acidosis; and compensated respiratory acidosis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The CO(2) dissociation curve, Haldane effect, and the ratio Ra-v between Ca-vCO(2) and Pa-vCO(2) were calculated from arterial and mixed-venous blood gas analyses. The CO(2) dissociation curve was shifted upwards by metabolic alkalosis and compensated respiratory acidosis and downwards by metabolic acidosis. The slope of the curve was unaffected, but <b>CO(2)</b> <b>transport</b> not due to Haldane effect was significantly lower in respiratory acidosis since the slope was less steep at higher PCO(2) values. In comparison with controls, patients affected by metabolic acidosis showed lower Haldane effect values (0. 18 +/- 0. 15 vs 0. 59 +/- 0. 26 ml of CO(2) per ml of arterial-mixed venous O(2) content difference; P <. 05) and Ra-v values (0. 43 +/- 0. 10 vs 0. 84 +/- 0. 17 ml of CO(2) transported by 100 ml of blood per Torr of arterial-mixed venous PCO(2) gradient; P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that acid-base abnormalities, particularly metabolic acidosis, markedly affect blood capacity of transporting CO(2) and may worsen tissue hypercarbia associated with hypoperfusion. However, because of possible errors due to small measurements and the assumptions of the method, in the future definitive clarification will require the construction of original CO(2) dissociation curves for each acid-base abnormality...|$|E

40|$|Diffusion of (14) C-labeled CO(2) was {{measured}} through lipid bilayer membranes composed of egg lecithin and cholesterol (1 : 1 mol ratio) dissolved in n-decane. The {{results indicate that}} CO(2), but not HCO(3 -), crosses the membrane and that different steps in the transport process are rate limiting under different conditions. In one series of experiments we studied one-way fluxes between identical solutions at constant pCO(2) but differing [HCO(3 -) ] and pH. In the absence of carbonic anhydrase (CA) the diffusion of CO(2) through the aqueous unstirred layers is rate limiting because the uncatalyzed hydration-dehydration of CO(2) is too slow to permit the high [HCO(3 -) ] to facilitate tracer diffusion through the unstirred layers. Addition of CA (ca. 1 mg/ml) to both bathing solutions causes a 10 - 100 -fold stimulation of the CO(2) flux, which is proportional to [HCO(3 -) ] over the pH range 7 - 8. In the presence of CA the hydration- dehydration reaction is so fast that <b>CO(2)</b> <b>transport</b> across the entire system is rate limited by diffusion of HCO(3 -) through unstirred layers. However, {{in the presence of}} CA when the ratio [HCO(3 -) + CO(3 =) ]:[CO(2) ] more than 1, 000 (pH 9 - 10) the CO(2) flux reaches a maximum value. Under these conditions the diffusion of CO(2) through the membrane becomes rate limiting, which allows us to estimate a permeability coefficient of the membrane to CO(2) of 0. 35 cm s(- 1). In a second series of experiments we studied the effects of CA and buffer concentration on the net flux of CO(2). CA stimulates the net CO(2) flux in well buffered, but no in unbuffered, solutions. The buffer provides a proton source on the upstream side of the membrane and proton sink on the downstream side, thus allowing HCO(3 -) to facilitate the net transport of CO(2) through the unstirred layers...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Motorised {{travel and}} {{associated}} carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions generate substantial health costs; {{in the case}} of motorised travel, this may include contributing to rising obesity levels. Obesity has in turn been hypothesised to increase motorised travel and/or CO₂ emissions, both because heavier people may use motorised travel more and because heavier people may choose larger and less fuel-efficient cars. These hypothesised associations have not been examined empirically, however, nor has previous research examined associations with other health characteristics. Our aim was therefore to examine how and why weight status, health, and physical activity are associated with <b>transport</b> <b>CO₂</b> emissions. METHODS: 3463 adults completed questionnaires in the baseline iConnect survey at three study sites in the UK, reporting their health, weight, height and past-week physical activity. Seven-day recall instruments were used to assess travel behaviour and, together with data on car characteristics, were used to estimate CO 2 emissions. We used path analysis to examine the extent to which active travel, motorised travel and car engine size explained associations between health characteristics and CO₂ emissions. RESULTS: CO₂ emissions were higher in overweight or obese participants (multivariable standardized probit coefficients 0. 16, 95 % CI 0. 08 to 0. 25 for overweight vs. normal weight; 0. 16, 95 % CI 0. 04 to 0. 28 for obese vs. normal weight). Lower active travel and, particularly for obesity, larger car engine size explained 19 - 31 % of this effect, but most of the effect was directly explained by greater distance travelled by motor vehicles. Walking for recreation and leisure-time physical activity were associated with higher motorised travel distance and therefore higher CO₂ emissions, while active travel was associated with lower CO₂ emissions. Poor health and illness were not independently associated with CO₂ emissions. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing the direction of causality between weight status and travel behaviour requires longitudinal data, but the association with engine size suggests that there may be at least some causal effect of obesity on CO₂ emissions. More generally, <b>transport</b> <b>CO₂</b> emissions are associated in different ways with different health-related characteristics. These include associations between health goods and environmental harms (recreational physical activity and high emissions), indicating that environment-health 'co-benefits' cannot be assumed. Instead, attention should also be paid to identifying and mitigating potential areas of tension, for example by promoting low-carbon recreational physical activity...|$|R
5000|$|CA IV {{has been}} {{identified}} in pulmonary epithelium of many mammalian species and may be uniquely adaptive for gas exchange necessary for the high metabolic requirements of mammals. A majority of the CO2 produced by metabolism is transported as bicarbonate (HCO3-). At the tissue capillary, CO2 diffuses from tissue to plasma. Other forms of carbonic anhydrase enzyme are not present in the plasma, restricting the equilibrium reaction of CO2+H2O = H2CO3 = H+ HCO3-. CO2 in the plasma diffuses into the Red Blood Cell. CA is present within the Red Blood Cell, facilitating the conversion of CO2 to HCO3-. HCO3- so produced is transferred by the HCO3-/Cl- [...] "shuttle" [...] from {{the interior of the}} Red Blood Cell to the plasma. HCO3- doers not diffuse across cell membranes and, in the absence of CA, stays as HCO3- and concentrates in plasma. Up to 80% of metabolically produced <b>CO2</b> is <b>transported</b> in plasma in the form of HCO3-. Blood moves from the tissue capillary to the pulmonary capillary where CO2 is exchanged at the lung. In the pulmonary capillary, bicarbonate can not simply diffuse either into the Red Blood Cell or the alvioli. It is traditionally thought that HCO3- is returned to the interior of the Red Blood Cell by a reversal of the HCO3-/CO2- shuttle, where, in the presence of CA, it is returned to a CO2 form to diffuse from the interior of the Red Blood Cell, to the plasma and then into the alvioli. Membrane bound CA (CA IV) on the luminal side of the pulmonary membrane would have direct contact with plasma HCO3- and would enzimatically convert HCO3- to CO2 in the area immediately proximal to the exchange membrane, greatly increasing the concentration gradient for exchange. In this way, plasma HCO3- can be converted to CO2 within the plasma compartment and exchanged with the alvioli without the requirement of returning the HCO3- to the interior of the Red Blood Cell.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Understanding the {{transport}} of three fluid phases through porous media has important applications in subsurface contaminant remediation, oil and gas recovery, and geological <b>CO₂</b> sequestration. Existing <b>transport</b> models may be improved by including physical phenomena that govern fluid flow at the pore scale. In particular, thermodynamic arguments suggest that hysteresis in the capillary pressure-saturation (P[subscript c]-S) relationship may be resolved by including an additional parameter, fluid-fluid interfacial area per volume (a[subscript nw]). Synchrotron-based Computed X-ray Microtomography (CMT) is a method that allows observation of fluid interfaces. Flow experiments were conducted using CMT to investigate uniqueness of the P[subscript c]-S[subscript w]-a[subscript nw] relationship in a porous media system containing three immiscible fluid phases. Drainage and imbibition surfaces were fit to P[subscript c]-S[subscript w]-a[subscript nw] data collected over a limited range of water saturations. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the drainage and imbibition surfaces was negligible, indicating that the P[subscript c]-S[subscript w]-a[subscript nw] relationship is unique. These results are {{a first step in}} validating the P[subscript c]-S[subscript w]-a[subscript nw] relationship for three-phase porous media systems. In addition, spreading intermediate-phase layers were observed to bring oil and solid into contact, which in the presence of X-rays changed the solid wettability within a relatively short time period. These observations confirm a proposed theoretical scenario that three-phase systems are more susceptible to wettability changes than to two-phase systems due to intermediate-phase spreading behavior...|$|R

Research published by the Urban Land Institute (e. g. the study ‘Growing Cooler’, 2007) gives comprehensive evidence {{that there is a}} connection between urban development and climate change. Sustainable urban growth of regional cities leads to human settlement that enables its residents to live a good quality of life while using minimal natural resources and supporting maximum biodiversity. These settlements could be typified by: Urban consolidation to ensure that new homes are close to employment, education, shopping, health services, etc. giving the option to walk, bike, or public transport; Residential typologies that are multi-storey and compact, to maximise the land available for green space and gardens and to avoid sprawl; Buildings that make the best use of renewable sources, such as sun, wind, rainfall and bio waste; A high proportion of building materials that are designed for reuse and recycling; Materials, food and other goods that are sourced from nearby, in order to cut <b>CO₂</b> emissions through <b>transport.</b> In this context, {{one of the most important}} planning issues for Newcastle is how its city centre will develop in the future. What are our strategies to overcome sprawling suburbs, boarded-up shop fronts in the city centre, neglected public spaces and vacant, derelict heritage buildings? The current transformation process from a heavy industry city to a contemporary, postindustrial centre for the 21 st Century – with an emerging new image around tourism, services, creative industries and education – will need strong political leadership and well-informed urban design decisions...|$|R
50|$|Green {{vehicles}} {{are intended to}} have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when {{the environmental impact of}} a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle {{this may not be the}} case. Electric vehicle technology has the potential to reduce <b>transport</b> <b>CO2</b> emissions, depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. The primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries (coal, gas, oil) mean that until world electricity production changes substantially, private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of CO2 than petrol equivalent vehicles. The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24 km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100 kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17 cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface.At that power, only a few sections of the road need embedded cables. Hybrid vehicles, which use an internal combustion engine combined with an electric engine to achieve better fuel efficiency than a regular combustion engine, are already common. Natural gas is also used as a transport fuel. Biofuels are a less common, and less promising, technology; Brazil met 17% of its transport fuel needs from bioethanol in 2007, but the OECD has warned that the success of biofuels in Brazil is due to specific local circumstances; internationally, biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions, at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures.|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{reduction}} from New Zealand {{transport sector}} {{can be reduced}} to 1990 levels if a wide range of methods are adopted such as fuel mix, electrification of vehicles and rail, and cycling. A comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide emissions from electric, plug-in electric hybrid, hybrid and internal combustion engine vehicles was done under different scenarios. Five different models including each type of vehicle were chosen in this analysis. The main exercise for this analysis is to determine how much CO₂ can be reduced by PHEV’s and EV’s from the light passenger vehicles in New Zealand. It was found that that Toyota Prius, a plug-in hybrid vehicle, emits less CO₂ when compared to all different types of models. Since these vehicles are not manufactured in New Zealand the CO₂ emission due to manufacturing of the batteries and vehicles can be ignored. This means that if only the tail pipe CO₂ emission is taken into consideration, then there can be a reduction of 50 to 60 percent of <b>CO₂</b> emission from <b>transport</b> sector in New Zealand if all light passenger vehicles are PHEV’s or EV’s. The uptake of PHEV’s and EV’s depends on the number of initiatives taken by the local and central government. Further analysis was done to determine the total ownership cost (TOC) of these vehicles. It was found that the capital cost and the battery cost plays a significant role in determining the total ownership cost for PHEV’s and EV’s. Based on estimates from the International Energy Agency there will be about 106 million PHEV’s and EV’s that will be sold in a year by 2050. With the current projected rate of lithium production, {{it will be difficult to}} meet the demand to manufacture lithium-ion batteries. A survey was also carried out at Hamilton Girl’s High School to determine the number of students that cycle to school. 450 students were surveyed, questions such as the mode of transport, the distance from school to their home, barriers to cycling, the engine size of the vehicle used to come to school and the suburb they live in were asked. This was done to estimate how much CO₂ emission can be reduced if students who are keen to cycle and live within 10 km radius of the school cycle to school in Hamilton City area. About 20 percent of the students at Hamilton Girls’ High School are willing to cycle to school, however, according to them the major barrier to cycling was the safety followed by distance and cost of bicycles. If these barriers are minimised and they start cycling to school, about 60 tonnes of CO₂ can be reduced in a year only from HGHS students. If the sample size is applied to all the schools in the city and 20 percent of all secondary and intermediate students started cycling to school there would be a reduction of 6 percent CO₂ emissions from light passenger vehicles in Hamilton Cit...|$|R
40|$|Mineralisation in the Grey River Tungsten Prospect, Newfoundland, is {{contained}} within {{a swarm of}} quartz veins and fractures which traverse the contact between a sheared Devonian (405 ± 10 Ma) K-feldspar megacrystic granite, and metamorphic rocks which are typical of the gneissic terrain of the Gander Zone. The mineralisation is genetically related to a suite of post-tectonic, highly differentiated, alkali-rich leucogranite dykes. [...] The tungsten-bearing hydrothermal veins, dated at 330 Ma, range from tensional fractures and veinlets to lodes containing several injections of quartz. The mineralisation is divided into four stages; the Early Stage, characterised by quartz-feldspar-molybdenite veins; the Composite Stage, consisting of five vein types (in paragenetic order), quartz-bismuthinite, quartz-wolframite (Fe-rich), greisen, quartz-sulphide, and quartz-wolframite (Mn-rich) veins; the Sulphide Stage, characterised by silver-bearing quartz-galenasphalerite veins; and the Late Stage, composed of zoned fluorite-calcite-barite veins. A spatial mineral zonation from south to north matches the temporal sequence outlined above, {{with the exception of}} the Late Stage veins which crosscut Composite Stage veins. [...] Fluid inclusion data indicate a complex evolutionary history for the hydrothermal fluid. Initially a homogeneous supercritical fluid (XCO₂ = 0. 4) with a density of 0. 65 g/cc deposited quartz-feldspar-molybdenite veins at temperatures of 450 - 500 °C and fluid pressures of 1200 - 1400 bars (120 - 140 MPa). The simultaneous trapping of CO₂-rich and H₂O-rich fluid inclusions, as well as solid inclusions of calcite in quartz of the quartz-bismuthinite vein type is evidence for the existence of an immiscible heterogeneous fluid during this stage of mineralisatiion. Fluid phase equilibria indicate immiscibility occurred at temperatures of 390 - 430 °C and fluid pressures of 1000 - 1200 bars (100 - 120 MPa). Oxygen isotope data indicate that greisen alteration halos of the composite lodes were formed at temperatures between 350 - 400 °C. [...] In these lodes quartz-sulphide and quartz-wolframite veins were deposited in open spaces created by normal faulting. These movements prompted rapid decreases in fluid pressure and temperature and caused retrograde boiling of the hydro-thermal fluid (at 350 bars and 300 - 390 °C) during deposition of quartz-sulphide veins. Deposition of wolframite in quartz-wolframite veins occurred at 270 - 330 °C and fluid pressures less than 350 bars, from an aqueous fluid of low salinity (< 0. 5 wt% NaCl) and CO₂ content (< 10 bars PCO₂), and after separation of a CO₂ vapour phase by retrograde boiling. [...] Calculated δ¹⁸OH₂O values indicate a progressive depletion in ¹⁸O isotopic composition of the hydrothermal fluid with time (7. 3 °/oo to 0. 5 °/oo). The depletion is due to the loss of 40 mol% CO₂ from the hydrothermal fluid by immiscibility and retrograde boiling, and subsequent fractionation effects. The oxygen isotope data suggest that the hydrothermal fluid was dominantly of magmatic origin. [...] Heavy REE enrichment and light REE depletion during greisenisation indicate extensive REE mobility, and imply both that CO₃²⁻ was the dominant anionic species in the hydrothermal fluid and that mobilisation of REE occurred by REE carbonate complexing. A positive correlation between heavy REE enrichment and high tungsten concentration suggests that REE mobility is related to tungsten transport. Together with the fluid inclusion evidence these data suggest that the transport of tungsten in hydrothermal fluids might be due to carbonate/bicarbonate complexing. [...] The fluid inclusion and isotopic data from the Grey River Tungsten Prospect serve to illustrate the previously unrecognised role of <b>CO₂</b> in the <b>transport</b> and deposition of tungsten in the hydrothermal environment...|$|R
