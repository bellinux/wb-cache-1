40|$|The {{electrodeposition}} of chromium in programmed {{reversing current}} (RC), {{was investigated in}} the regime of high cathodic current density (77 A dm- 2) and anodic current density (55 A dm- 2). The ratio of the cathodic and anodic time (60 : 1) was used. Chromium was deposed on a steel substrate from a <b>chromic-sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> solution, during one hour. Anode and cathode were suited {{in a system of}} parallel plates. Basic properties of deposits, like thickness, morphology, microhardness, brightness were examined. Surface distribution of the deposits was obtained from the measurements of the thicknesses of the deposits (between 32 and 67 µm). A ferromagnetic non-destructive method was used in the measurements. Based on the results, graphic models of deposit surface distribution were made. Two ranges of the thickness could be seen on the model (range 1 - average thickness 35. 1 µm and range 2 - average thickness 57. 81 µm). These results were statisticaly analysed by colums, rows and by the whole surface. For the whole specimens, the average thickness was 45. 39 µm with a coefficient of variation of 0. 2582. The basic properties of the deposits did not change with a variation of the thickness. Because of this, the coatings deposited with the reversing current could be much more considered reliable in wear and corrosion protection systems than ones deposited by direct current...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} get {{approval}} of adhesive bonding as a reliable joining method in the automotive industry, {{a better understanding of}} the interfacial interactions between aluminium surfaces and adhesives is important. It is also important to get {{a better understanding of the}} degradation mechanisms of the bonded systems in humid environments, as humidity is known to have a detrimental effect. This work has been focused on an aluminium alloy and a one-component epoxy adhesive that are of particular interest to the automotive industry. Pretreatment of the aluminium substrates before adhesive bonding is essential. However, the most successful pretreatment processes involve the use of hexavalent chromium, which will be banned from use within few years due to environmental considerations. Alternative pretreatments need to be developed. A literature study identified silanisation with GPS as a pretreatment method with the potential to obtain good durability. On the basis of research performed by SINTEF Materials Technology, AC anodising in hot phosphoric and sulphuric acid solutions were also identified as interesting pretreatment methods. A modified version of the Boeing wedge test was used to determine the durability of adhesively bonded joints tested in hydrothermal environments. The joints were made of AA 6060 -T 6 aluminium alloy and Betamate XD 4600 epoxy adhesive. Both silane films and anodic oxides were investigated using reflection-absorption FT-IR spectroscopy. Other techniques of surface analysis were also used (SEM, TEM, WLI, XPS, ToF-SIMS and contact angle measurements). The environmental durability of pretreated AA 6060 -T 6 substrates was significantly improved after silanisation with GPS. The grit-blasting + GPS pretreatment process resulted in considerable higher durability then the <b>chromic-sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> FPL-etch. The general understanding is that silanisation improves the durability through the formation of strong, covalent bonds between the aluminium surface and the adhesive. FT-IR spectroscopy strongly indicated that a chemical reaction took place between GPS films and amine curing agents. Particularly interesting was the reaction with dicyandiamide, which is a common curing agent in one-component epoxy adhesives. The amines also catalysed the condensation of SiOH groups, resulting in higher degree of SiOSi crosslink density in the siloxane films. However, chemical reaction is not necessary for improved durability. The hydrophobicity of the bonded surface is also an important factor. This effect has not been studies extensively earlier. Exposure of GPS films to degrading environments showed that the silane desorbed from the surface in acidic solutions, but it was stable in alkaline solutions. The durability of adhesive joints was also reduced in acidic environments. The two models for the degradation of the silanised aluminium surface in acidic environments were proposed: hydrolysis of the siloxane network and corrosion of the underlying aluminium surface. The environmental durability of substrates that were AC anodised in hot phosphoric and sulphuric acid solutions was good, almost as good as the well-established FPL + PAA pretreatment. DC anodising in sulphuric acid gave inferior durability. FT-IR spectroscopy showed that the anodic films formed in sulphuric acid contained significant amounts of sulphate. This can have a significant negative effect on the long-term properties of bonded joints. The anodic films released water during curing of the adhesive. The observations suggested that a transformation from the hydroxide to the oxide state took place. Adhesive bonding in wet environment of substrates that were anodised in sulphuric acid had a negative effect on durability. The effect was more pronounced for DC anodised, than for AC anodised substrates. Bonding in wet environment also resulted in changed adhesive properties close to the oxide surface. Very little thixotropic agent was present in a ~ 200 nm wide region in the adhesive. This was explained by desorption of water from the oxide during curing of the adhesive. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of aluminium}} in automotive and transport applications is primarily driven by its high strength to weight ratio, enabling substantially improved fuel economy and reduced CO 2 emissions when substituted for heavier materials. However, the change of material presents new challenges with respect to design and methods of joining. Structural adhesive bonding offers several advantages compared with welding, but a major limitation is concern about the durability of joints in wet and corrosive environments. The pre-treatment of the aluminium surface prior to bonding {{is the key to}} long service life. Pre-treatments successfully employed by the aerospace industry cannot be used in automotive production, where cheaper and more environmentally friendly pre-treatments are required. Specifically, the use of chromates is unacceptable. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop chromate-free pre-treatments that will consistently provide the required level of performance, while being acceptable both in terms of general engineering practice and economy. To accomplish this task, basic knowledge of the processes occurring on the aluminium surface during pre-treatment, properties of the modified surface, and mechanisms of joint degradation are necessary. The purpose of the present work has therefore been to contribute to a better understanding of how the aluminium substrate affects the formation and properties of conversion coatings for adhesive bonding. In particular, a commercial chromate-free fluorotitanate/zirconate based process has been investigated and compared with conventional chromate treatment. The materials chosen for this work were commercially extruded AA 6060 -T 6 aluminium and a structural single-part epoxy adhesive. To complement the studies of the commercial alloy, model analogues of the AA 6060 aluminium matrix and α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si phase particles present in the commercial alloy were also investigated. It was observed that the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles played an essential role in the formation and properties of Ti-Zr oxide conversion coatings on AA 6060 aluminium. The particles were significantly nobler than the aluminium matrix in the pre-treatment solution. An alkaline diffusion layer therefore developed around the particles during pre-treatment due to oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions. As Ti-Zr oxide precipitation was favoured at high pH, the conversion layers normally deposited at and in the vicinity of the cathodic particles. The conversion layers formed consequently exhibited considerable lateral variations in thickness. In addition to substrate microstructure, bulk pH and agitation of the conversion bath were important factors controlling the extent of Ti-Zr oxide deposition and its distribution on the surface. On areas well away from the cathodic particles coverage was generally very poor, although a high density of small (< 50 nm) oxide particles was deposited, presumably with a composition similar to the continuous conversion layer close to the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles. The cathodic activity of the particles was only slightly reduced by formation of the Ti-Zr oxide conversion coating. In combination with poor coverage of the aluminium matrix, these conversion coatings are therefore not expected to improve the corrosion resistance of aluminium significantly. In contrast to the above mechanism, the chromate conversion coating (CCC) formed by a redox reaction between chromate ions and aluminium. A relatively thick, porous chromium oxide layer developed over the aluminium matrix of AA 6060, while a significantly thinner film was formed on the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles. The morphology of the CCC covering the matrix was influenced by the hardening Mg 2 Si phase, primarily by promoting nucleation of the CCC. Despite the thin film (< 50 nm) formed on the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles by chromating, the cathodic activity was significantly reduced. Inhibition of the cathodic reactivity at these particles is suggested as an important factor contributing to the high performance of chromate pretreatments on aluminium. Testing of epoxy-bonded AA 6060 aluminium joints in humid environment showed that Ti-Zr based pre-treatment provided improved adhesion relative to alkaline etching and deoxidation only. However, Ti-Zr based pre-treatment was inferior to chromating. Rapid, interfacial crack growth during wedge testing was particularly observed for adherends with a relatively thick Ti-Zr oxide deposit, suggesting that excessive Ti-Zr oxide deposition should be avoided. Furthermore, as the substrate microstructure (i. e. type, area fraction and distribution of cathodic sites) strongly affected the Ti-Zr oxide deposition, the pre-treatment conditions should be adapted to the specific alloy in order to achieve optimum performance. In the presence of chlorides, degradation of adhesive-bonded joints may be accelerated by a filiform corrosion (FFC) type of mechanism. The α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles in AA 6060 played a crucial role in promoting FFC, as demonstrated by complete FFC immunity of the iron-free AA 6060 model analogue alloy. Ti-Zr based pre-treatment provided less protection against FFC relative to chromate pre-treatment. The good FFC resistance of CCCs was partly attributed to a better inhibition of the cathodic activity at the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles. The cathodic α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles present on the surface of AA 6060 aluminium could be effectively removed by different etch treatments. However, selective removal of surface intermetallics did not prevent FFC because filament growth was supported by cathodic activity on particles that become exposed in the filament tail as a result of the corrosion process. Based on lap shear testing, hot AC anodising in sulphuric acid to a film thickness of about 0. 2 µm showed promise as another chromate-free pretreatment for durable adhesive bonding. The performance was better than a conventional <b>chromic-sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> based etch treatment. While hot AC anodising did not significantly inhibit the cathodic activity on the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles, good resistance against FFC was still obtained due to the oxide film covering the whole aluminium matrix. Based also on separate durability data recently available, hot AC anodising is considered as a robust alternative to chromating for adhesive bonding of aluminium in certain industrial applications. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
