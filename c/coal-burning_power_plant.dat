25|$|Various {{industrial}} {{businesses are}} located in Hannover. The Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles Transporter (VWN) factory at Hannover-Stöcken is the biggest employer {{in the region and}} operates a huge plant at the northern edge of town adjoining the Mittellandkanal and Motorway A2. Jointly with a factory of German tire and automobile parts manufacturer Continental AG, they have a <b>coal-burning</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> Continental AG, founded in Hanover in 1871, is one of the city's major companies, as is Sennheiser. Since 2008 a take-over is in progress: the Schaeffler Group from Herzogenaurach (Bavaria) holds the majority of the stock but were required due to the financial crisis to deposit the options as securities at banks.|$|E

2500|$|Rochester is in Olmsted County, one of {{only four}} {{counties}} in Minnesota without a natural lake. Artificial lakes exist in the area, including Silver Lake, a dammed portion of the South Fork Zumbro River just below the convergence with Silver Creek near the city center. [...] Silver Lake was once used as a cooling pond when the <b>coal-burning</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> was operated by Rochester Public Utilities at the lake. [...] When operational, the RPU coal plant's heated water output prevented the lake from generally freezing over during the winter months; attracting large numbers of migrating giant Canada geese.|$|E
2500|$|Coal is a {{sedimentary}} rock formed primarily from accumulated plant matter, {{and it includes}} many inorganic minerals and elements which were deposited along with organic material during its formation. [...] As {{the rest of the}} Earth's crust, coal also contains low levels of uranium, thorium, and other naturally occurring radioactive isotopes whose release into the environment leads to radioactive contamination. While these substances are present as very small trace impurities, enough coal is burned that significant amounts of these substances are released. A 1,000 MW <b>coal-burning</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> could have an uncontrolled release of as much as 5.2 metric tons per year of uranium (containing [...] of uranium-235) and 12.8 metric tons per year of thorium. In comparison, a 1,000 MW nuclear plant will generate about 30 metric tons of high-level radioactive solid packed waste per year. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much uncontrolled radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island incident. The collective radioactivity resulting from all coal burning worldwide between 1937 and 2040 is estimated to be 2,700,000 curies or 0.101 EBq. During normal operation, the effective dose equivalent from coal plants is 100 times that from nuclear plants. Normal operation however, is a deceiving baseline for comparison: just the Chernobyl nuclear disaster released, in iodine-131 alone, an estimated 1.76 EBq [...] of radioactivity, a value one order of magnitude above this value for total emissions from all coal burned within a century, while the iodine-131, the major radioactive substance which comes out in accident situations, has a half life of just 8 days.|$|E

25|$|A furor {{was raised}} {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that the Intermountain Rural Electric Association (an energy cooperative that draws a significant portion of its electricity from <b>coal-burning</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants)</b> donated $100,000 to Patrick Michaels and his group, New Hope Environmental Services, and solicited additional private donations from its members.|$|R
5000|$|Texas emits more {{carbon dioxide}} into the {{atmosphere}} than any other state. And if Texas were a country, {{it would be the}} seventh-largest carbon dioxide polluter in the world [...] Texas's high carbon dioxide output and large energy consumption is primarily a result of large <b>coal-burning</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> and gas-guzzling vehicles.|$|R

25|$|Environmental cooperation– One of {{the biggest}} successes of {{environmental}} cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the Montreal Protocol, {{in order to stop}} ozone depletion.

The plan entailed far-reaching regulations that seek to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation especially by <b>coal-burning</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> The plan has been tied up in legal proceedings since it was finalized in 2015; Ebell argues that the plan is harmful to the economy and illegal.|$|R

40|$|Pellets {{made of a}} high-surface-area {{composite}} of silica and titania have shown promise as means of removing elemental mercury from flue gases. With further technical development and commercialization, this material could become economically attractive as a more effective, less-expensive alternative to activated carbons for removing mercury from exhaust streams of <b>coal-burning</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> which are the sources of more than 90 percent of all anthropogenic airborne mercury...|$|R
