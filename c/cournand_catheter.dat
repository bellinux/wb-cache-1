40|$|Ultrasound {{contrast}} on {{the left}} side of the heart without the need for left heart catheterisation was achieved by hand injections of 8 to 10 ml 5 per cent dextrose solution through a catheter in the pulmonary wedge position. Injections were performed in 18 patients undergoing routine cardiac catheterisation and M-mode or two-dimensional echocardiography was used. An adequate wedge position was attained in 17 of the 18 patients. Nine had injections through Cournand catheters, three through Swan-Ganz catheters, and five through both. In 11 of these 17 patients left atrial or left ventricular echocardiographic contrast was seen immediately after wedge injection. Two patients showed diminished or absent contrast on later injections from the same position. Better results were obtained with the <b>Cournand</b> <b>catheter</b> (11 / 15 positive) than with the Swan-Ganz (1 / 8 positive) catheter. Pulmonary artery injections proximal to the wedge position did not cause left-sided contrast. No complications were observed. The safety of this method remains to be determined...|$|E
40|$|Acetylcholine has {{received}} much attention of late as a potential, clinically useful, dilator {{agent of the}} pulmonary vascular bed. Right heart intracardiac infusion of acetylcholine has been em-ployed as the method of drug administration. Recognition of the various parameters that must be kept constant to permit conclusions as to pulmonary vasodilator or vasoconstrictor activity (Fritts and Cournand, 1959) has led to studies in man in which cardiac output and rate, systemic arterial pressure, and central blood volume were measured, and animal studies in which alveolar and intrapleural pressures were evaluated. Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure has been equated with left atrial pressure in these investigations. Previous studies in this laboratory have illustrated {{some of the problems}} associated with interpretation of pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (Bernstein et al., 1960). The {{purpose of this study is}} to report the effect of intracardiac right heart acetylcholine infusion upon directly measured left atrial and left ventricular pressures. METHODS AND SUBJECTS Combined right and left heart catheterization was performed in 14 patients with rheumatic heart disease and mitral and or aortic stenosis. The diagnoses are given in Table I. Acetylcholine was infused at a constant rate via the middle lumen of a triple lumen <b>Cournand</b> <b>catheter</b> or via th...|$|E
40|$|In {{studies of}} gas {{exchange}} between the lung and the pulmonary circulation it is gen-erally {{assumed that the}} principal exchange {{takes place at the}} level of the pulmonary cap-illaries. The work presented here shows that some gaseous exchange can occur as well be-tween the lung and vessels of macroscopic size. Hydrogen gas when administered to a subject by inhalation can be detected in the pulmonary artery wedge position within two seconds after the inhalation of hydrogen. Methods The technique used in this study was originally described by Clark 1 and subsequently used by others. 2 " 7 The method consists of inserting a bare platinum electrode into the vascular system on the end of a standard catheter. The appearance of hydrogen gas at the electrode is signaled by the development of a potential between the plati-num electrode and a silver electrode placed on the subject's skin. The response time is practically instantaneous as illustrated in figure 1. Catheters were wedged in the pulmonary artery of 34 patients. Successful wedging of the cathe-ter was determined by the inability to advance the catheter further, by a pressure level and contour that was consistent with the wedge, and by a good "spring " on withdrawing the catheter. In all patients a double lumen <b>Cournand</b> <b>catheter</b> size 9 F was used, being introduced in small chil-dren through the saphenous vein and in larger children and adults through a medial antecubita...|$|E
40|$|Three {{patients}} with repetitive supraventricular paroxysmal tachycardia are described, {{one of them}} with an atrial septal defect in addition. All three patients were asymptomatic; two, however, had a striking cardiomegaly (one {{of these is the}} patient with atrial septal defect). The electrocardiogram showed supraven-tricular tachycardia of medium frequency as the predominant rhythm, interrupted by phases of normal sinus rhythm of varying duration. The P waves were present during tachycardia and suggested a left atrial pace-maker. This was confirmed by comparison of right and left atrial (or pulmonary arterial wedge, respectively) pressure curves during both normal sinus rhythm and supraventricular tachycardia. Parkinson and Papp (I 947) defined the clinical and electrocardiographic criteria of repetitive paroxys-mal tachycardia. The ectopic pacemaker in this form of tachycardia may be located in the atria, in the atrioventricular junction, and in the ventricles. Chronicity, relatively slow frequency, and easy identification of P waves allow discrimination of the repetitive from the more usual form of supra-ventricular tachycardia. Within the past few years, we have seen 7 {{patients with}} supraventricular repetitive paroxysmal tachy-cardia whose electrocardiograms fulfilled the cri-teria for left atrial origin of the ectopic focus. In 3 of these patients, diagnostic heart catheterization was performed and confirmed the site of the ectopic pacemaker in the left atrium. Methods The electrocardiograms were registered by means of a Siemens Cardiorex 6 T recorder. Right and left atrial or pulmonary arterial wedge pressures were measured consecutively using <b>Cournand</b> <b>catheters</b> (No. 6 or 7 F) or simultaneously (Case 2) using a Courmand double lumen catheter. They were recorded together with one or several standard electrocardiogra-phic leads on a photographic recorder (Electronics for Medicine). Statham transducers P 23 Db were used as pressure transducers. Subjects The 3 patients were referred for diagnostic evaluation because of an irregular heart...|$|R
