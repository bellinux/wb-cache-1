These investments were originally scheduled for 20072014, but the pace of development is slower than expected, and delays of a year to two had been observed by 2010. The required superstructure is planned to be funded through build-operate-transfer contracts and public–private partnerships. The investments made since 2007 and those planned as of 2011 are aimed at increasing the port's throughput from 8 to 10million tonnes of cargo per year.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II and the Paris Peace Treaties, Rijeka {{became a}} part of Croatia and Yugoslavia. This {{provided}} the Port of Rijeka with a new market and sparked further development. A bulk <b>cargo</b> <b>terminal</b> was completed in 1967, followed by warehouses in Škrljevo in 1978. In 1979, a container terminal in Sušak, a phosphate terminal in Rijeka and a timber terminal in Bršica were added. Joining them were a livestock terminal in Bršica and a general <b>cargo</b> <b>terminal</b> with a roll-on/roll-off ramp in the Bakar area in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The greatest volume of cargo was recorded in 1980, when 20.2million tonnes, including 13.1million tonnes of liquid cargo, were transported. The port suffered another period of stagnation in the 1990s due to the Croatian War of Independence, when a portion of the port's shipping switched to Trieste and Koper. Since 1996, the volume of operations of the Port of Rijeka has again been gradually growing.|$|E

Funding of €91million was approved on November 20, 2006, consisting of a €58.8million loan from the World Bank, a €11.2million loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a provision of €21million by Croatia.

Subcontractors that operate the liquid <b>cargo</b> <b>terminal</b> facilities are Naftni Terminali Federacije d.o.o. and Luka Ploče Trgovina d.o.o., while passenger and vehicle transit is handled by Jadrolinija. Jadrolinija ferries sail between Ploče and Trpanj on the Pelješac peninsula and the D415 state road. In 2009, the ferry line carried annual average daily traffic of 143 vehicles.

5|$|The Port of Rijeka {{development}} master plan, {{devised by}} Rotterdam Maritime Group, specifies further expansion of port facilities by 2030, including {{the construction of}} a large container terminal in Omišalj on Krk Island, near the JANAF Omišalj oil terminal. The container terminal would increase the annual capacity of the port by 2.5million TEUs. The plan requires construction of a high performance railway to Zagreb and a rail link planned by Croatian Railways to the proposed island terminal. The new line entails building a new bridge to Krk Island in addition to the existing Krk Bridge. The plan also includes expansion of the existing terminals, and is estimated to require an additional US$150 million. Likewise, an expansion of the Liquid <b>Cargo</b> <b>Terminal</b> is planned, as well as an expansion of the Bakar Bay facility, where a car terminal is planned. The expansion of the port, improvement of transportation links and the strategic partnership are aimed at establishing Rijeka as the largest container port on the Adriatic Sea.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Cargo</b> <b>terminals</b> are {{as one of}} {{the main}} {{components}} of road transport system that by which we can provide services and facilities to the drivers and the fleet of transportation, centralized and coherent, and so we can make policy, conduct, and have necessary control and supervision the system of road transportation. One of the main problems in the transport sector of kohgiloyeh & Boyer Ahmad’s province is wandering trucks for finding and loading of the goods in urban areas that it caused {{to increase the number of}} accidents, environmental pollution and noise pollution, and so on. It also undermines the possibility of supervision on their activities. Considering the present situation, organizing the transportation of goods was a necessity, that as <b>cargo</b> <b>terminals</b> localization in the province of Kohgiloyeh & Boyer Ahmad were studied. Methods used to locate <b>cargo</b> <b>terminals</b> are regional planning techniques including, spatial analyses of land use and traffic flow analysis in the major roads. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is used to visualize the results clearly. The findings of the above mentioned techniques in totally gave the priority of construction of the <b>cargo</b> <b>terminals</b> to the roads of Yasuj-Babamaidan weighing 40, Yasuj-samirom weighing 36, Dogonbadan-Behbahan weighing 28, Dogonbadan-Babamaidan weighing 27, Dogonbadan-Behbahan weighing 25, and Yasuj-Sepidan weighing 25, respectively.
