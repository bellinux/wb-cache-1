25|$|Eisenhower had {{followed}} up an original request on 6 December 1942 after the North African {{experience with a}} requirement for five vessels of fourteen foot draft or less and about 275 feet in length. The U.S. Army Services of Supply assigned the task to the Transportation Corps (TC). After consideration the TC recommended a design that was originally a <b>coastal</b> <b>transport</b> and of which fourteen were being built under Navy contract. The Army wanted the diesel version, the Maritime Commission type N3-M-A1, while Navy wanted {{to give up the}} steam (N3-S-A1) version. At a meeting of the Navy's Munitions Assignments Committee the Army, Navy and Royal Navy all ruled the steam versions as unsuitable. Eventually a clear European requirement for five port repair ships manned by Army Engineers. After considerable dispute during which Navy proposed N3-M-A1 vessels being built for the British, the British objected and the matter was taken to the Combined Chiefs of Staff vessels were obtained and conversions begun.|$|E

500|$|Key Biscayne, {{although}} named a [...] "key", is not geologically {{part of the}} Florida Keys, but is {{a barrier}} island composed of sand eroded from the Appalachian Mountains, carried to the coast by rivers and then moved along the coast from the north by coastal currents.

The <b>coastal</b> <b>transport</b> of sand southward ends at Key Biscayne. In the 1850s Louis Agassiz noted that [...] "outh of Cape Florida no more silicacious sand is to be seen." [...] (The beaches in the Florida Keys, by contrast, consist primarily of finely pulverized shells.) Geologists believe that the island emerged around 2000 BCE, soon after the sea level stopped rising, as the sand built up to form new barrier islands on the southern Florida coast.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1993 {{wildfire}} {{stripped the}} surrounding mountains of their earth-hugging chaparral, torrential rainstorms in early 1994 caused a massive mudslide near Las Flores Canyon that closed {{down the main}} <b>coastal</b> <b>transport</b> artery, Pacific Coast Highway, for months. Thousands of tons of mud, rocks, and water rained down on the Pacific Coast Highway like a sluicebox. The destruction to property and infrastructure was exacerbated by the narrow constriction of the road at that point, with beachside houses abutting the highway {{with little or no}} frontage land acting as a buffer to the mudslide. [...] Another large mudslide occurred on Malibu Canyon Road, between the Pepperdine University campus and HRL Laboratories LLC, closing down Malibu Canyon for two months. Yet another behemoth slide occurred on another main canyon road, Kanan-Dume Road about one mile (1.6km) up the canyon from the Pacific Coast Highway. This last road closure lasted over a period of many months, with Kanan finally fixed by the California Department of Transportation (Cal-Trans) over a year after the road collapse.|$|E

This was subsequently improved by raising the surface, deepening the water, and adding pilings and ship camels.

Due to the presence of a strongly curved coastline and complex intertidal bathymetries, a large spatial variation in supply is to be expected at the Sand Motor, which makes the area particularly suitable for a field experiment on this subject.

By calculating <b>coastal</b> {{sediment}} <b>transport</b> {{rate and}} analyzing historical {{data in this}} paper, the effect on trend of coastal geomorphological evolution after {{the construction of the}} artificial islands in Longkou Bay is studied.

The deposited rate caused by sediments that the Jie River carried and <b>coastal</b> sediment <b>transported</b> in the channel between land and islands is about 12. 5 cm/a after the construction of artificial islands...|$|R
50|$|The US Navy {{generally}} favoured custom-built warships {{to civilian}} conversions, {{but in the}} first months of World War II the acute shortage of vessels for coastal defence and anti-submarine work {{led to the formation of}} a mosquito fleet.

These however were confined to coastal waters and not rated for offensive or convoy escort duties. A further 70 tuna clippers were called up as minesweepers (Amc designation), 10 as harbour patrol craft (YP) and 50 as <b>coastal</b> <b>transports</b> (Apc).

5000|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} a {{significant}} amount of attention was paid to <b>coastal</b> sediment <b>transport.</b> In part, due to the National Sea Grant College Program and the U.S. Congress Mandated Sea Grant Act of 1976.

[...] From this request for research, the Office of Sea Grant reviewed, accepted, and funded the Nearshore Sediment Transport Study (NSTS).

40|$|Existing aeolian {{transport}} formulae tend {{to overestimate}} the sediment <b>transport</b> volumes in <b>coastal</b> environments. Supply limiting factors like moisture content, shell patches, sediment sorting, vegetation and morphological features {{are believed to}} explain these overestimations. These supply limitations act {{on a variety of}} spatio-temporal scales that hinder relating supply and transport. Probabilistic graphical models (PGM) can be used to cope with the variety and complexity of these relations. A long term measurement campaign is started to feed such probabilistic models with data on the complex interaction between supply limitations and their influence on <b>coastal</b> aeolian <b>transport</b> and subsequently dune growth. The variety of spatio-temporal scales involved in supply limited <b>coastal</b> aeolian <b>transport</b> generally is not fully captured by traditional measurement techniques. This campaign uses, apart from traditional in-situ techniques, remote sensing and image analysis techniques to cover a variety of spatio-temporal scales that are related to <b>coastal</b> aeolian <b>transport</b> and supply limitations in particular. We aim to construct a dataset that contains long term and high resolution grid data as well as binary time series and a variety of in-situ measurements on (local) wind forcing, beach surface properties and aeolian transport. The probabilistic graphical models will be used to consolidate the dataset towards practical instruments to model the large scale and long term (LSLT) behavior we are finally interested in.
