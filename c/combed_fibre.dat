40|$|Hemp fibre {{nonwovens}} {{are developed}} in the research work with a goal to the materials surface modification applying metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. It is planned to investigate the electrical properties of nonwovens to determine their ability to serve as radiation insulation. Fibres were cut into 5 cm long, some of them passed through Laroche Cadette equipment twice that opens the fibres and part manually combed before making nonwovens. Carded webs were formed from prepared fibres by parallel-laid carding method. The fibres were opened by using Laroche Cadette equipment, web was formed web only by mixing hemp fibres with 15 % Tencel fibres. Clean hemp fibres webs were created from manually <b>combed</b> <b>fibres.</b> Hemp fibres nonwovens were created by using hydroentanglement method...|$|R
50|$|Bilateral {{trade between}} India and Macedonia totaled US$62.24 million in 2015, a slight decline from $68.36 million in 2014. India {{exported}} $48.41 {{million worth of}} goods to Macedonia, and imported $13.83 million. The main commodities exported by India to Macedonia are gas oils of petroleum or bituminous minerals, agricultural and forestry tractors, partly or wholly stemmed pre-stripped flue-cured tobacco, coffee, sesamum seeds, single cotton yarn of <b>combed</b> <b>fibres,</b> medicaments, plates, sheets, film, foil and strip of non-cellular polymers of propylene, and pneumatic elevators and conveyors. The major commodities imported by India from Macedonia are ferro-alloys, marble, travertine, electrical machinery and equipment, and plastics.|$|R
50|$|The iron combs {{typically}} used for torture were sturdy instruments {{with one or}} two rows of teeth, each a few inches in length and designed to prepare wool and other fibres for woolen spinning. Used for <b>combing</b> rough <b>fibres,</b> these instruments resembled miniature garden rakes.|$|R
5000|$|A sliver (rhymes with diver) {{is a long}} {{bundle of}} fiber that is {{generally}} used to spin yarn. A sliver is created by carding or <b>combing</b> the <b>fibre,</b> which is then drawn into long strips where the fibre is parallel. [...] When sliver is drawn further and given a slight twist, it becomes roving.|$|R
40|$|In this study, 100 % cotton {{knitted fabrics}} made from combed cotton and combed pima cotton were dyed with {{reactive}} dye, with different dye concentrations. Colour properties such as CIE L*a*b* values {{as well as}} dyeing uniformity of the dyed fabrics were measured. The relationships between colour properties and the ultraviolet protection afforded by cotton knitted fabrics were investigated. Experimental results revealed that dye concentration {{is the most important}} factor. In addition, only L* values have a direct mathematical relationship with the ultraviolet protection factor; a* and b* values and dyeing uniformity were not found to have a significant correlation with ultraviolet protection factor values. Meanwhile, knitted fabric made from <b>combed</b> cotton <b>fibre</b> has better ultraviolet protection performance than fabric made from <b>combed</b> pima cotton <b>fibre.</b> Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the physical structure of flax fibres on the mechanical properties of polypropylene (PP) composites. Due to their composite-like structure, flax fibres have relatively weak lateral bonds which are in particular present in flax fibres that are often used in natural fibre mat reinforced thermoplastics (NMT). These weak bonds can be partly removed by <b>combing</b> the <b>fibres.</b> In order to study {{the influence of}} the physical structure of flax fibres on NMT tensile and flexural properties, uncombed and <b>combed</b> flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced PP composites were manufactured via a wet laid process. The influence of improved fibre-matrix adhesion was studied using maleic-anhydride grafted PP. Results indicated that the flax physical structure has a significant effect on flax-PP composite properties and that the flax fibre reinforced PP properties are similar to values predicted with existing micromechanical models. The tensile modulus of flax-PP composites can fairly compete with commercial glass mat reinforced thermoplastic (GMT) modulus, the strength, however, both tensile and flexural, can not. In order to rise the strength of flax fibre reinforced PP composites to the level of GMT strength, the flax fibres have to be further isolated to elementary flax fibres...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} effect of {{selected}} bacterial strains on hemp water-retting and properties of retted fibre. Methods and Results: The trials were performed in laboratory tanks. The traditional water-retting process, without inoculum addition, was compared to a process modified by inoculating water tanks with two selected pectinolytic bacteria: the anaerobic strain Clostridium sp. L 1 / 6 and the aerobic strain Bacillus sp. ROO 40 B. Six different incubation times were compared. Half the fibre obtained from each tank was combed. Micromorphological analyses were performed by scanning electron microscopy on uncombed and <b>combed</b> <b>fibres.</b> Moreover, organoleptic and chemical analyses of uncombed fibres were performed. Conclusions: The inoculum, besides speeding up the process, significantly improved the fibre quality. The fibre was not damaged by mechanical hackling, thanks to the good retting level obtained {{by the addition of}} selected strains, differently to what happened with the traditionally retted fibre. The best fibre quality was obtained after 3 - 4 days of retting with the addition of the bacterial inoculum. Significance and Impact of the Study: Retting is the major limitation to an efficient production of high-quality hemp fibres. The water-retting process and fibre quality were substantially improved by simultaneously inoculating water tanks with two selected pectinolytic strains...|$|R
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The <b>combed</b> <b>fibres</b> are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|R
50|$|The Ropery {{consists}} of Hemp Houses (1728 extended 1812), Yarn Houses and a double Rope House with attached Hatchelling House. Hatchelling is <b>combing</b> the hemp <b>fibres</b> to straighten them out before spinning. This {{was the first}} stage of the ropemaking process. The Ropery is still in use, being operated by Master Ropemakers Ltd.|$|R

25|$|The fleece is cut in {{one piece}} from the sheep.This is then skirted to remove the soiled wool, and baled. It is graded into long wool where the fibres can be up to 15 in, but {{anything}} over 2.5inches is suitable for <b>combing</b> into worsteds. <b>Fibres</b> less than that form short wool and are described as clothing or carding wool.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively <b>combed</b> <b>fibres,</b> which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. [...] This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). [...] The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant.|$|R
25|$|<b>Combing</b> {{straightens}} the <b>fibres,</b> isolates {{the long}} ones (tops) for spinning and discards the short ones (noil). There are {{various types of}} combing machines here, including the French comb, the Lister comb and the Holden comb. The Noble comb {{was the most popular}} as it would comb long, medium and fairly short staple wool, but the slivers needed special preparation in a punching machine beforehand.|$|R
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially <b>combing</b> the <b>fibres</b> which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle <b>comb</b> gives the <b>fibres</b> a secondary <b>combing,</b> removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the <b>fibres</b> their final <b>combing</b> by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|R

This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
