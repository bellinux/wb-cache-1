The demand-side has traditionally been a price taker while the supply-side actively adjusts the output of the market <b>clearing</b> <b>unit</b> to fluctuations in consumption. Currently, there is a transition toward active demand participation that can adequately respond to market conditions. However, private knowledge of demand adjustments, such as the impact of modifying behavior or the availability to do so, creates asymmetry of information between the active supply side and the passive demand. This paper proposes a revelation mechanism that will prompt the demand-side to choose the best option for themselves among a menu of incentives. Rational behavior of consumers implies that demand will only shift when the benefit of doing so is higher than the costs of modifying consumption patterns. Given differences among demand participants and the objectives of the market operator, an analysis of the rationale of each market agent shows the feasible options for demand incentives. This study enables the design of appropriate market mechanisms aimed to discover customer categories and determine the adequate incentives for each case. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the European {{monetary}} system instituted in Dec. 1978. It became a result of the long lasting search for stabilizing currency relations between member states of the European Community. Therefore, also the said search is discussed in consideration of the Treaty of Rome provisions of 1957. Particular emphasis wa slaid on theses of the Werner report on the economic-monetary union and of the Tindemans report on the European union. Much attention was focused on the so-called „currency serpent" which was mentioned in the both reports as a prerequisite to achieve the monetary stability. The initiative of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and of Helmut Schmidt to constitute the European monetary system was indicated. The system was established by the decission of the European Council of Dec. 1978. The article discusses functions of the European monetary system and its specific parts. The evolution of <b>clearing</b> <b>unit</b> effected in the ECU (European Currency Unit) is presented. The way of calculating ECU, scope of its application is explained together with postulates to modify it and transform into a European currency. There are three types of crediting member states related to the monetary system as well as the system of currency intervention what can prove the range of monetary cooperation among the central banks of the Communities' member states. In the concluding remarks there are several postulates expressed as to improvements in functioning the European monetary system as well as reservations to the possibility of their realization.

Basement lithology down to 170 mbsf {{is divided into three}} major units: Unit 1 = massive flow, Unit 2 = pillow breccia, and Unit 3 = intermixed pillows and thin flows.

Chemical stratigraphic differences among the three units at this site are <b>clear.</b> <b>Unit</b> 3 rocks have the highest FeO/MgO ratio and HFSE concentration, and Unit 2 lavas have the lowest. Unit 2 lavas also have the highest Y/Zr ratios. Unit 1 is separated into lower and upper flow units based on differences in HFSE content. Clearly, there were significant differences in the petrogenetic processes that created these units. Compositional and lithologic differences among the basement units correlate with differences in physical properties among the units described by the Leg 200 Shipboard Scientific Party.

The standardization hypothesis purports that goods manufactured by specialists exhibit less variation than products manufactured by more generalized, household-level producers. V. Gordon Childe posited that as specialization increases in a society, mensuration systems grow more accurate as precision becomes a paramount concern. I apply both of these hypotheses to the extant architecture of Paquime, the cultural center of the Casas Grandes region of Northern Mexico and the American Southwest, in order to determine if the gridded, planned nature of the site was the product of specialist architects and builders using a formalized unit of measure. Statistical analysis of three architectural features at Paquime - the Mound of the Cross, the I-shaped ballcourt and the assemblage of rooms designated Unit 12 - shows that a <b>clear</b> <b>unit</b> of measure of approximately 70 cm can be identified at the site. I therefore conclude that specialized production of architecture did indeed exist in the Casas Grades culture, reflecting a culture with substantial political complexity, and further possibly reflecting a diffusion of measurement systems from Mesoamerica...|$|R
