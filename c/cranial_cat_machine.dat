40|$|Backround and Purpose: Delayed {{cerebral}} ischemia (DCI) {{remains the}} most relevant cause of neurological worsening after acute aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Underlying mechanisms causing DCI include cortical spreading depression (CSD). Analgosedation is a fundamental part of neurointensive care and helps optimizing clinical key parameters like arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow while simultaneously reducing cerebral oxygen consumption. It {{has been shown that}} sedative and analgesic substances influence receptor mediated spreading depolarisation and thus may result in neuroprotection. Nonetheless sedation itself could also negatively influence the course of SAH patients as it potentially cause complications. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the influence of sedation, in particular of Ketamine on the occurrence of DCI-related cerebral infarctions in patients with acute SAH with particular focus on the potential complications. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with acute aneurysmal SAH. Sixty five patients matched the inclusion criteria. The clinical course as well as the <b>cranial</b> <b>CAT</b> scan imaging results were analysed. The treatment course on the intensive care unit (ICU) was characterized analysing the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), complications of sedation as well as other clinical parameters including typical complications. Neurological outcome was analysed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Results: The median length of ventilation treatment was 20. 9 days (1 to 46 days, SD 7. 09). The median length of stay on the Intensive Care Unit was 23. 5 days (5 to 43 days, SD 6. 8). DCI-related cerebral infarctions occurred in nine patients (14 %). DCI-related cerebral infarctions occurred significantly less often in the patient cohort treated with sedation including Ketamine (7. 3 % versus 25 % in the non-Ketamine group, p= 0. 04). The rate of major complications was 7, 7 %. Outcome was not different regarding the groups being treated with different combinations of sedation. Conclusions: The rate of DCI-related cerebral infarctions following acute aneurysmal SAH was significantly lower in the patient group that received Ketamine...|$|R

Background: Three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has rapidly gained prominence and exposure in the dental community {{over the last}} few years, and is quickly becoming the routine imaging modality for many orthodontic clinics. However, questions remain about the amount of radiation patients are exposed to during the multiple scans needed for the associated advanced diagnostic and treatment techniques. Objective: To determine the amount of radiation potentially absorbed by a patient during routine orthodontic imaging with the Next Generation i-CAT® cone-beam computed tomography machine with various scan settings. Also, to evaluate the amount of radiation patients at the University of Minnesota Division of Orthodontics are exposed to during a routine two-year treatment including cone-beam scans for diagnosis and for SureSmile® treatment. Methods: Twenty-four thermoluminescent dosimeters placed at anatomic sites inside a RANDO® phantom were scanned using various scan protocols on a Next Generation i- <b>CAT</b> <b>machine</b> and digital panoramic and cephalometric xray machine. Effective doses were calculated using the 2007 International Commission on Radiological Protection recommended tissue weighting factors. Results: The effective doses ranged from 108 - 129 mSv for standard resolution CBCT scans at various voxel size and field of view settings; 196 - 212 mSv for enhanced or highresolution full field of view scans; and measured 252 mSv for a high-resolution landscape scan as would be used for SureSmile® therapy. Digital panoramic xray dose was 39 mSv and lateral cephalogram was 25 mSv. Discussion: Cone-beam CT, while providing proven diagnostic and therapeutic benefits, also exposes patients to a higher level of radiation than with standard digital 2 D examinations. It is important for the clinician to weigh the benefits against the risks when determining their imaging protocol...|$|R

40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} is used daily {{in hospitals and}} clinics to perform diagnostic imaging procedures. For {{the purposes of this}} fact sheet, the word radiation refers to ionizing radiation. The most commonly mentioned forms of ionizing radiation are x rays and gamma rays. Procedures that use radiation are necessary for accurate diagnosis of disease and injury. They provide important information about your health to your doctor and help ensure that you receive appropriate care. Physicians and technologists performing these procedures are trained to use the minimum amount of radiation necessary for the procedure. Benefits from the medical procedure greatly outweigh any potential small risk of harm from the amount of radiation used. Which types of diagnostic imaging procedures use radiation? In x-ray procedures, x rays pass through the body to form pictures on film or on a computer or television monitor, which are viewed by a radiologist. If you have an x-ray test, it will be performed with a standard x-ray machine or with a more sophisticated x-ray machine called a CT or <b>CAT</b> scan <b>machine.</b> In nuclear medicine procedures, a very small amount of radioactive material is inhaled, injected, or swallowed by the patient.

40|$|The {{cruciate}} ligaments contain mechanoreceptors which putatively {{contribute to}} knee function and dysfunction. However, {{the interpretation of}} studies showing neural responses to traction loads applied to the <b>cat</b> <b>cranial</b> cruciate ligament (CCL-analogous to the anterior cruciate ligament in humans) depends upon demonstrating that non-CCL periarticular receptors are not stimulated. We assessed the capability to rigidly fix the knee against traction loads applied to the feline CCL. The tibia and femur were fixed either with clamps or Steinmann pins. Motion of the bones was monitored with liquid metal strain gauges (LMSG) and {{the activity of the}} posterior articular nerve (PAN) was recorded while traction loads of up to 20 - 30 N were applied to the CCL. Joint afferents recorded from the PAN were insensitive to the CCL loads in the rigidly fixed preparation. Motion of the proximal tibia and distal femur was less than 100 micrometers for both methods of fixation, with neither method demonstrating more rigid fixation. In contrast, we observed vigorous discharges with focused light pressure on the capsule and under conditions allowing 200 - 500 micrometers of tibial displacement on the femur. This suggests that clinically undetectable instability may give rise to aberrant mechanoreceptor activity contributing to dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was conducted}} within the project Language Toolkit, {{which has the}} aim of integrating the worlds of work and university. In particular, it consists of the translation into English of documents commissioned by the Italian company TR Turoni and its primary purpose is to demonstrate that, {{in the field of}} translation for companies, the existing translation support tools and software can optimise and facilitate the translation process. The work consists of five chapters. The first introduces the Language Toolkit project, the TR Turoni company and its relationship with the CERMAC export consortium. After outlining the current state of company internationalisation, the importance of professional translators in enhancing the competitiveness of companies that enter new international markets is highlighted. Chapter two provides an overview of the texts to be translated, focusing on the textual function and typology and on the addressees. After that, manual translation and the main software developed specifically for translators are described, with a focus on computer-assisted translation (<b>CAT)</b> and <b>machine</b> translation (MT). The third chapter presents the target texts and the corresponding translations. Chapter four is dedicated to the analysis of the translation process. The first two texts were translated manually, with the support of a purpose-built specialized corpus. The following two documents were translated with the software SDL Trados Studio 2011 and its applications. The last texts were submitted to the Google Translate service and to a process of pre and post-editing. Finally, in chapter five conclusions are drawn about the main limits and potentialities of the different translations techniques. In addition to this, the importance of an integrated use of all available instruments is underlined. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe medical {{profession}} {{has changed dramatically}} {{in the past decade}} due to the advances in engineering innovations. Traditionally, medical doctors relied solely on their training and experience for diagnosis and interpretation of medical conditions captured through a variety of imaging techniques. Typically, these images are produced from <b>CAT</b> scan <b>machines,</b> MRI, or X-rays. Today, computer aided techniques are designed to enhance the visual quality of biomedical images to better help humans discriminate regions of interest, such as the presence of cancer. Since these enhanced images are intended to assist the {{medical profession}}al in making a diagnosis or to track the progress of a treatment, it is important that abnormalities presented in the images are actual objects and not artifacts resulting from the enhancement process that could lead to an inaccurate diagnosis. Too much information presented can be distracting for the viewer and too little information presented could be disastrous for the patient, should a life-threatening abnormality be missed or filtered out. Therefore, the dilemma lies in answering the question: “What is the best image to use?” The answer has always been subjective due to the perspective of the human observer and what constitutes the desired target object to be detected. For instance, some doctors looking at a scan may be interested in masses; another doctor may want to focus on calcifications or, even perhaps, the blood vessels. In this special issue, articles are presented that address this question for several different biomedical image processing applications. Several novel quantifiable evaluation methods that can rank the quality of a processed image in accordance with human visual perception are introduced. These metrics are rigorously compared to evaluations obtained from human evaluators using the “Mean Opinion Score” (MOS), along with other standard benchmarking techniques. The innovative approaches presented in this issue are sure to lead the biomedical image processing field beyond one of an “assistive technology” to one that creates a reliable, accurate autonomous technology for use in distance and robot vision applications. Achieving these goals will forge new groundbreaking paths that will reach into and serve remote populations of the world...|$|R

He receives {{a vision of the}} radioactive spider that bit him also biting Cindy Moon, and learns what happened to her afterwards. Spider-Man immediately goes on to search for Cindy to break her out of the facility Ezekiel had kept her. After freeing Cindy, she attacks Spider-Man in a fit of rage saying that he has doomed them all. Spider-Man calms Cindy down by telling her that Morlun is dead. Cindy makes her way out of the facility to finally see the city of New York, stopping only to make a costume out of her webbing. She tells Spider-Man to refer to her as Silk. Silk is heartbroken to find that her family has moved. Silk and Peter also find that they are powerfully attracted to each other due to their shared Spider-Sense. Silk finds out that Morlun might be still alive, which causes her to attack Peter. However, their attraction to each other leads to sex. Peter stops as soon as Cindy begins to remove his mask, after which they move back to Peter and Anna Maria’s apartment. Afterwards, Peter and Cindy go to the Fact Channel’s news station where they are attacked by Black Cat and Electro. While Silk is easily able to dodge Electro’s lightning bolts thanks to her “hyper-spider-speed and senses,” Spider-Man isn’t as lucky. Black Cat then goes after the paralyzed superhero and begins to unmask him in front of live TV. Thankfully, J. Jonah Jameson hogged up too much space in front of the camera, preventing the camera (and anyone else) from seeing Peter’s face. Silk quickly spins a temporary mask for Peter and escapes with him back into Peter and Anna Maria’s apartment. At the waterfront where Parker Industries will be holding the demonstration for their new device meant to cure Electro, Cindy spins Peter some Electro-insulated webbing to prevent what happened during their last fight with Electro from happening again. When the fight begins, Black <b>Cat</b> sabotages the <b>machine</b> which causes Electro to go out of control and hit a helicopter. Silk hurries and begins spinning porous webs to catch the crashing helicopter. She then creates an insulated web-pod to contain the inevitable explosion of energy coming from Electro. The entire incident ends with a depowered Electro and a missing Black Cat. Afterwards, Cindy gets accepted for a job at the Fact Channel where she intends to use the information center in order to find her family.|$|R
