40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe Consumable Asset Reutilization Program (CARP) is an {{organization}} established under Naval Supply Systems Command to provide a specific warehousing service for excess material generated by commands operating under the Navy Working Capital Fund. This warehousing service would receive excess <b>consumable</b> <b>material</b> that had possible future demand, and hold that material until demand on that item was realized. Annually, CARP processes approximately 70, 000 excess offload transactions from aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, and naval air stations. Of the three, aircraft carriers are the largest customer of this service. This MBA project employs exploratory research to empirically analyze material that is offloaded from aircraft carriers to CARP, and to identify drivers of the high volume of excess <b>consumable</b> <b>material</b> that is generated on-board aircraft carrier inventories. This project proposes policy-level changes to both the allowancing and offload processes for aircraft carriers, and, through statistical modeling and analysis, estimates the outcomes of these changes on inventories and costs.

Production of oxygen from lunar materials is of particular interest and is very attractive possibility. The kinetics and mechanism of reduction of ilmenite by carbon monoxide and hydrogen at 800 to 1100 C were investigated. The temporal profiles of conversion for carbon monoxide have a sigmoidal shape and indicate the presence of three different stages (induction, acceleration, and deceleration) during the reduction reaction. The apparent activation energy decreases from 18 kcal/mole at 10 percent conversion to 10 kcal/mole at 50 percent conversion. The reaction is first order with respect to carbon monoxide under the experimental conditions studied. Both SEM and EDX analysis show that the diffusion of Fe product away from the reaction front and through the TiO 2 phase, followed by the nucleation and growth of a separate Fe phase are important steps affecting the process kinetics. The results from hydrogen reduction show that the mechanism of ilmenite reduction by hydrogen is similar to that by carbon monoxide. However, the titanium dioxide can be further reduced by hydrogen at 800 to 1000 C. The detailed comparison and theoretical modeling of both reduction processes is presented...|$|E
