5|$|The bill {{provided}} for the recognition of unmarried partnerships, both same-sex and opposite-sex cohabiting couples. It defined eligibility for a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> {{and the process of}} registering a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership.</b> Rather than listing all the rights of a civil partner, it specified that all the rights of marriage would apply to anyone in a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership.</b> However, it specifically defined the dissolution process and the process for recognising foreign civil partnerships.|$|E
5|$|Certain foreign {{partnerships}} and same-sex marriages are recognised as civil partnerships since 13 January 2011. While Glenn Cunningham and Adriano Vilar are {{often cited as}} the first same-sex couple to have their <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> formally recognised in Ireland, in fact several hundred couples were recognised together at the exactly the same time. The couple formed a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> at a ceremony in Northern Ireland in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the <b>Civil</b> <b>Partnership</b> and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{overseas}} territories have not indicated {{plans to introduce}} <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships.</b> The British Crown dependency of Jersey has <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> available. Both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples within the Falkland Islands, Isle of Man and Gibraltar have civil marriage and <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> available as of 2016.|$|R
5000|$|In England and Wales, <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> are {{permitted}} for clergy. [...] "Neither the Church in Wales nor the Church of England {{are opposed to}} clergy being in <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships.</b> The Church of England requests that clergy in <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> vow to remain sexually chaste, but the Church in Wales has no such restriction." [...] The Church of England has allowed priests to enter into same-sex <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> since 2005. The Anglican Church of Australia {{does not have an}} official position on homosexuality. The Church of Ireland recognizes same-sex <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Additionally, [...] "Anglican churches in Brazil, South Africa, New Zealand and Scotland have moved to recognize same-sex relationships." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> must be solemnised by an {{authorised}} marriage officer. Government officials (primarily magistrates and Home Affairs civil servants) who {{are appointed}} as marriage officers under the Marriage Act are also automatically appointed to solemnise <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Religious marriage officers may not solemnise <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships.</b> (They may, however, solemnise marriages under the Civil Union Act.) Government marriage officers {{who have an}} objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> may note this objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs, {{and then they will}} be exempted from doing so.|$|R
5|$|Following Ireland's {{legalisation}} {{of same-sex}} marriage in 2015 (see below), {{the ability to}} enter into a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> was closed off. As of 16 November 2015, no further civil partnerships are granted in Ireland and existing civil partners only retain that status if they do not marry. Any <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> converted into a marriage is dissolved.|$|E
5|$|Tax codes were amended in July 2011 {{under the}} Finance (No. 3) Act {{to take account}} of <b>civil</b> <b>partnership.</b> The Act, in the main, is {{retrospective}} to 1 January 2011 and it creates virtual parity, in taxation matters, between civil partners {{on the one hand and}} married people on the other hand. The Social Welfare Code had already been amended in December 2010 {{to take account of}} <b>civil</b> <b>partnership.</b>|$|E

2500|$|For gay clergy, {{the church}} does allow <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships.</b> The church has stated, officially, that [...] "The Church of England {{recognises}} that same-sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality ... <b>Civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> enable these Christian virtues to be recognised socially and legally in a proper framework." [...] While not officially allowed, some gay priests have converted their <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> into legal marriages and have kept their positions.|$|R
25|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> were {{introduced}} in South Africa by the Civil Union Act, 2006, which also legalised same-sex marriage. <b>Civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> can be formed by opposite-sex couples and by same-sex couples, and have the same rights, responsibilities and legal consequences as marriages.|$|R
50|$|From March 2014 to October 2015, {{approximately}} 15,000 {{same-sex couples}} wed in England and Wales. Of these, 7,366 were new marriages while 7,732 accounted for conversions from <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships.</b> 55% of these marriages were between female couples and 45% were between male couples. During {{that same time}} period, the number of couples opting for <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> fell significantly. In Cheshire, for example, around 70 <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> were recorded each year. In 2015, however, that number was only 4.|$|R

5|$|Civil {{partnerships}} discontinued {{on the day}} {{same-sex marriage}} legislation came into effect in November 2015, though civil partners are permitted to retain their relationship status, {{as there is no}} automatic upgrade from a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> to marriage.|$|E
5000|$|Queensland first allowed <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> {{with the}} option of an {{official}} ceremony, commonly known as civil unions, for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples from February 2012 under the Bligh Labor Government. Subsequent changes by the Newman LNP Government watered down <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships,</b> replacing them with [...] "registered relationships" [...] and eliminating official ceremonies from June 2012 onwards. In December 2015, the Palaszczuk Labor Government restored <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> and official ceremonies. [...] The historical developments are detailed below.|$|R
2500|$|Tatchell {{has pledged}} {{his support for}} opposite-sex couples {{to be allowed to}} have <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships,</b> stating that some opposite-sex couples dislike the [...] "sexist, {{homophobic}} history of [...] marriage", and allowing them into <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> [...] "is simply a matter of equality".|$|R

5|$|Though most {{same-sex}} couples seeking to marry {{are required to}} give three months notice (as {{is the case for}} opposite-sex couples), {{same-sex couples}} already in a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> are allowed to make use of a 5-day fast track provision in the legislation.|$|E
40|$|The Lesbian and Gay Psychology Section of the British Psychological Society (BPS) {{welcomes the}} {{move by the}} British Government to {{introduce}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Partnerships</b> in December 2005. However, <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> {{are not the same}} thing as marriage. We also agree with the resolution by the American Psychological Association (APA), which argues that laws against same-sex marriage are a form of discrimination based on sexual orientation. In spite of the introduction of <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships,</b> laws against same-sex marriage still operate in the United Kingdom. ...|$|R

5|$|The French PACS is not included, nor {{are some}} other legal {{relationships}} – for example, the Dutch <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> {{and some of the}} domestic partnerships in the United States.

5|$|With the {{entering}} of the Green Party into Government in 2007, {{a commitment}} to legislation introducing civil partnerships was agreed in the Programme for Government in June of that year.
