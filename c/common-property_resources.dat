40|$|The {{problem of}} the commons is more {{important}} to our lives and thus more central to economics than a century ago when Katharine Coman led off the first issue of the American Economic Review. As the U. S. and other economies have grown, the carrying-capacity of the planet — in regard to natural resources and environmental quality — has become a greater concern, particularly for <b>common-property</b> and open-access <b>resources.</b> The focus of this article is on some important, unsettled problems of the commons. Within the realm of natural resources, there are special challenges associated with renewable resources, which are frequently characterized by open access. An important example is the degradation of open-access fisheries. Critical commons problems are also associated with environmental quality. A key contribution of economics has been the development of market-based approaches to environmental protection. These instruments are key to addressing the ultimate commons {{problem of the}} twenty-first century — global climate change. <b>common-property</b> <b>resource,</b> open-access resource, fisheries, global climate change...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{begins by}} {{distinguishing}} open-access resources from <b>common-property</b> <b>resources,</b> {{the use of}} which is subject to communal rules. In practice, {{it is suggested that}} these cases are the outcomes of a spectrum of property rights. The standard economic theory of the use of open-access resources as developed by Western economists is outlined and ways in which it has limited applicability to developing countries are suggested. This theory does not, for example, consider the possibility that incomes in open-access situations may fall to subsistence levels, as appears to be common in developing countries. A model is presented in which the long-run equilibrium involves a subsistence level of income which may be at or near a poverty level. This seems more relevant for developing countries. It is shown that governments in developing economies may be unable to find workable policies that will extricate communities from such a poverty trap. Reasons why governments in developing countries may allow such a situation to occur are discussed. The limitations of using new technologies to increase harvesting productivity and reduce poverty are discussed. Implications of the analysis for the type of aid that developed countries should give to developing countries are specified.

In particular, land tenure arrangements undergo a major transformation towards more individualized forms with the consequence that property rights in land are increasingly defined without regard for equity and insurance concerns...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{consider}} a <b>common-property</b> <b>resource</b> sold in imperfectly competitive markets. There {{is a dynamic}} externality (current harvests lower future stocks, raising future harvest costs) and a static (crowding) externality. Increasing industry size raises costs but lowers prices; thus, it has ambiguous welfare effects. The optimal industry size typically changes over time, so that a first-best outcome cannot be obtained with a fixed number of firms. Single-firm exploitation is optimal only under special circumstances. The socially optimal open loop steady-state industry size corresponds to the static optimum; both generally differ from the closed-loop steady-state optimum. ...|$|R

We focus on Markov-perfect strategies under truthful revelation of beliefs. For reasonable initial conditions, exogenously shifting the prior beliefs of one player toward more pessimism about the potential of natural resources to reproduce can create anti-conservation incentives. The single player whose beliefs have been shifted toward more pessimism exhibits higher exploitation rate than before. In response, all other players reduce their exploitation rates in order to conserve the resource. However, the overall conservation incentive is weak, making the aggregate exploitation rate higher than before the pessimistic shift in beliefs of that single player. Due to this weakness in strategic conservation responses, {{if the number of}} players is relatively small, then in cases with common priors, jointly shifting all players’ beliefs toward more pessimism exacerbates the commons problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —The {{fisheries}} literature embodies critical {{assumptions about}} fisherman attitudes and motivations. Common assumptions are that populations of fishermen are homogeneous in mo-tivation {{and decision making}} and that they behave in a myopic fashion, ignoring the effects of their fishing activities on the fishery resource. The results of a survey of trawl vessel captains challenge these assumptions. We document a heterogeneous population of captains who hold a diverse set of views toward work, risk, and the ocean environment. We discuss {{the implications of these}} survey results for the design and implementation of fishery regulations, and for the ratio-nalization of fisheries. We note the potential costs of misrepresenting fishermen in models of fishery resource use. Implicit in models of open-access fisheries are assumptions about the behavior of resource users.

40|$|Economic {{theories}} of managing renewable resources, such as fisheries and forestry, traditionally assume that individual harvesters are perfectly rational and thus able {{to compute the}} harvesting strategy that maximizes their discounted profits. The current paper presents an alternative approach based on bounded rationality and evolutionary mechanisms. It is assumed that individual harvesters face a choice between two harvesting strategies. The evolution {{of the distribution of}} strategies in the population is modeled through a replicator dynamics equation. The latter captures the idea that strategies yielding above average profits are demanded more than strategies yielding below average profits, so that the first type ends up accounting for a larger part in the population. From a mathematical perspective, the combination of resource and evolutionary processes leads to complex dynamics. The paper presents the existence and stability conditions for each steady-state of the system and analyzes dynamic paths to the equilibrium. In addition, effects of changes in prices are analyzed. A main result of the paper is that under certain conditions both strategies can survive in the long-run.

40|$|Abstract: Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans {{seeks to}} manage British Columbia’s prawn fishery by {{limiting}} the season length, vessel entry, {{and the number of}} prawn traps per vessel. However, fishers can still adjust their effort by increasing the number of trap lifts during the season. This study examines the effect of trap soak-time on size-selectivity, looks at how it translates to by-kill, and reviews the traditional management responses. The management recommendations in this paper focus on optimizing the interaction between CPUE, by-kill, enforcement costs, and fisher responses. Peer’s law (the solution to a problem changes the problem) predicts that trying to solve a fishery <b>common-property</b> <b>resource</b> problem only changes the problem’s expression. Thus, limiting entry changes a too-many-fishers issue to a capital-stuffing problem, limiting gear changes a capital-stuffing problem to a gear-use issue, and regulating gear use leads to other problems and ever more micro-management. Thus, regulation and related costs have become part of the problem of rent dissipation and poverty in fishery dependent communities. Efforts to fine-tune regulations in BC’s prawn fishery have led to an ever expanding spiral of costly, clumsy, and intrusive regulations, enforcement, and related procedures that dissipate resource rents, frustrate fishers, and ultimately are ineffective in protecting the resource and/or the associated jobs. The best way out of this morass appears to be for managers of sedentary species to confine their efforts to macro-management regulations that focus on limiting the consequences of fishing and ensuring that individual fishers endure the consequences of their actions...|$|R
