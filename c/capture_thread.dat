40|$|Spiders' webs and gossamer threads {{are often}} paraded as {{paradigms}} for lightweight structures and outstanding polymers. Probably {{the most intriguing}} of all spider silks is the araneid <b>capture</b> <b>thread,</b> covered with tiny glycoprotein glue droplets. Even if compressed, this thread remains surprisingly taut, a property shared with pure liquid films, allowing both thread and web {{to be in a}} constant state of tension. Vollrath and Edmonds proposed that the glue droplets would act as small windlasses and be responsible for the tension, but other explanations have also been suggested, involving for example the macromolecular properties of the flagelliform silk core filaments. Here we show that the nanolitre glue droplets of the <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> indeed induce buckling and coiling of the core filaments: microscopic in-vivo observations reveal that the slack fibre is spooled into and within the droplets. We model windlass activation as a structural phase transition, and show that fibre spooling essentially results from the interplay between elasticity and capillarity. This is demonstrated by reproducing artificially the mechanism on a synthetic polyurethane thread/silicone oil droplet system. Fibre size is the key in natural and artificial setups which both require micrometer-sized fibres to function. The spools and coils inside the drops are further shown to directly affect the mechanical response of the thread, evidencing the central role played by geometry in spider silk mechanics. Beside shedding light on araneid <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> functionality, we argue that the properties of this biological system provide novel insights for bioinspired synthetic actuators.

40|$|International audienceAn {{essential}} {{element in the}} web-trap architecture, the capture silk spun by ecribellate orb spiders consists of glue droplets sitting astride a silk filament. Mechanically this thread presents a mixed solid/liquid behaviour unknown to date. Under extension, capture silk behaves as a particularly stretchy solid, owing to its molecular nanosprings, but it totally switches behaviour in compression to now become liquid-like: it shrinks with no apparent limit while exerting a constant tension. Here, we unravel the physics underpinning the unique behaviour of this " liquid wire " and demonstrate that its mechanical response originates in the shape-switching of the silk filament induced by buckling within the droplets. Learning from this natural example of geometry and mechanics, we manufactured novel programmable liquid wires that present novel pathways {{for the design of}} new hybrid solid-liquid materials. H ybrids made of different materials often display effective properties far exceeding those of their components (1) : zinc-coated steel is both strong and corrosion-resistant, metal foams (hybrids of metal and air) are stiff, light and crush-able at the same time, making them perfect candidates to absorb energy in a car crash (2, 3). Nature also provides many exquisite examples of hybrid design such as the seashell nacre, both stiff and tough thanks to its inner 'brick-and-mortar' structure composed of rigid, though brittle, inclusions surrounded by a crack arresting soft organic matrix (4), or the bamboo stem with its hollow core and honeycomb-shaped cells that maximize the ratio of bending rigidity over weight (5). A most interesting natural hybrid material is the spi-der's <b>capture</b> <b>thread,</b> which consists of a core filament that supports glue droplets. Here we report on the arresting mechanical behaviour of this <b>capture</b> <b>thread,</b> that changes from solid-like in extension to liquid-like in compression. We trace this behaviour back to the core filament's buckling inside the droplets. A synthetic version of this natural system then allows us to copy the remarkable properties of spider's <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> to a novel type of hybrid material. Spiders use different kinds of silk to build their webs, and a typical ecribellate orb-web combines dry and smooth radial threads with wet and droplet-covered spiral threads (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The adhesive nature of these droplets enables the spiral <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> to perform its primary function of catching insect preys (6). Apart from being sticky, these capture threads also prove to be particularly resilient to tensile tests: extensive studies on their mechanical behaviour (11, 6) revealed that, when stretched, the thread elongates to three times its web-length without breaking and recoils back with no noticeable hysteresis or sagging when relaxed (12). This stretchiness confers spider silk a strength tenfold that of natural or synthetic rubber (13, 14). These remarkable extensional properties rely on the macromolecular architecture of capture silk (15, 16). The ability to cope with stretch is crucial for spider capture threads for it provides their unusually large toughness (energy required for rupture), which in turn allows them to absorb the kinetic energy of incident preys without breaking. Far less understood is the behaviour of the thread when compressed: unlike any solid fibre that sags or buckles, it keeps taut and self-adapts to compression. Figure 1 illustrates this singular behaviour, reminiscent of the response of liquid films to compression events: liquid films do not buckle upon squeezing, but rather self-adapt (17). And as for liquid films, self-adaptation for the <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> is an indication for fibre self-tension. This liquid-like behaviour in compression suggests that more than merely endowing the web with adhesion, capture silk might well have the additional mechanical function of preserving the web structural integrity. Indeed, without self-adaptation, single sticky strands would touch during relaxation events and thereby irremediably damage the web. With sagging suppressed, the sticky strands are secured apart...|$|E

40|$|Concurrent {{programs}} {{consist of}} multiple threads executing {{at the same}} time. This makes detecting errors extremely difficult in a multi-threaded program due to the non-determinism that it can exhibit. This thesis looks at identifying these errors by generating suitable test sequences using a concurrent program’s specification. In essence, a specification should provide formal documentation that allows a high-level of precision for designing systems and because of this, we would expect that test sequences generated from the specification would be invaluable for testing purposes. Currently, specification techniques such as Finite State Processes (FSP) and Object-Z do not provide sufficient detail to effectively <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> behaviour. This thesis proposes extensions to these techniques so that thread behaviour can be captured and used for generating test sequences. The extensions and methods for test sequence generation were both devised by analysing two case studies, Producer-Consumer and Single-Lane Bridge. It was found that specification techniques can be extended to <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> behaviour and that the test sequences generated from the specifications are suitable for the case studies. A significant finding from the work is that the test sequence generation methods can possibly be automated due to the structured nature of the specifications. Because of this, the possibility of quick and efficient testing of complex concurrent programs using specifications can be developed in future work.

40|$|Spider silk {{production}} {{has been studied}} intensively during the last years due to their mechanical properties. However, spiders do not only produce silk with outstanding mechanical properties: Some of them, the cribellate spiders, are specialized in producing nanofibres as their capture threads. In general, these threads are highly interesting, because their production involves not only a controlled arrangement of three types of silks with one being nanofibres (cribellate fibres), but also a special comb-like structure on the metatarsus of their fourth legs (calamistrum). There are several hypotheses about how this thread assembly takes place, {{but none of them}} is able to explain all shapes in which capture threads of different species occur. Hence, the cribellate thread {{production has}} to be examined more closely to establish a model describing the process in general. Evaluating the structure of the <b>capture</b> <b>thread,</b> I found the cribellate fibres organized as a mat, forming the typical puffy structure of cribellate threads. Due to this shape, they enclosed two larger parallel fibres (axial fibres). Mat and axial fibres were linked to each other between two puffs presumably by the action of the median spinnerets. This linkage alone cannot lead to the typical puffy shape of a cribellate thread. After removing the calamistrum, a functional <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> was still produced, but the puffs of the thread were not shaped anymore. Therefore, the calamistrum is not necessary for the extraction or combination of fibres, but for further processing of the cribellate fibres. Using data from Uloborus plumipes I was able to develop a model of the cribellate thread production, connecting morphological data with the movement of the single limbs and determining the influence of this action on the structure of the thread. Although I was not able to determine, how cribellate fibres are processed by the calamistrum to form the puffy structure of the <b>capture</b> <b>thread,</b> I was able to refute some hypotheses, for example that Coulomb-forces are involved in keeping the nanofibres separated. The main features of the cribellate thread production were found conserved between species of very distant related families, suggesting the model to be generally valid. Differences in the morphology of the calamistrum were found to be an adaption to the web producing behaviour, not influencing the processing of the cribellate fibres. A teeth-like structure for example might help picking up fibres for transportation of threads after production in non-orb-weaving spiders. Only the asynchronous movement of the posterior spinnerets observed for Kukulcania hibernalis has {{to have an impact on}} the thread structuring according to the previously established model. Indeed their threads showed a pronounced looping structure, probably established by fewer linkages between axial fibres and the cribellate mat...|$|E

One or more trap lines extend from the retreat to the orb web. The sticky prey <b>capture</b> <b>threads</b> of orb-webs are critical to web performance. By retaining insects that strike the web, these spirally designed threads allow a spider time to locate their prey.

If the spider is in need of food immediately, the insect is taken back to the retreat where the soft parts of the animal are eaten and the remaining parts thrown from the web.|$|R

40|$|Intensification of land-use in {{agricultural}} landscapes {{is responsible for}} a decline of biodiversity which provide important ecosystem services like pest-control.

By controlling for environmentally confounding factors, we here demonstrate that the orb web spider Araneus diadematus alters its web building behaviour in response {{to changes in the}} composition of agricultural landscapes. Thereby, the species increases its foraging efficiency (i. e. investments in silk and web asymmetry) with an increase of agricultural land-use at intermediate spatial scales. This intensification is also related to a decrease in the abundance of larger prey. A negative effect of landscape properties at similar spatial scales on spider fitness was recorded when controlling for relative investments in <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> length.

Webs are constructed {{by means of}} a succession of behaviours, which are often considered as instinctive and stereotyped. Anomalies in web structure are considered to be a consequence of variability in behaviour. In order to assess the variability in web structure, the spider Zygiella x-notata was allowed to build webs in the laboratory under standardized conditions. Webs (n = 127) were examined for anomalies, which were defined as modifications in the geometrical structure. Ten anomalies in the structure of webs produced by females, aged from 16 to 21 days after their adult moult, are described. The frequency of anomalies per web varies from 5 to 98. A very low percentage of the spiral elements of a web (less than 5 %) were affected. Anomalies in the radii were less numerous (mean = 3 +/- 3) than those in the sticky spiral (mean = 21 +/- 11). Anomalies in the sticky spiral were different and more frequent in the peripheral than central parts of the webs. They were also relatively more numerous in the upper than in {{the lower part of the}} webs. Total number of anomalies was positively correlated with particular web characteristics (capture area, length of <b>capture</b> <b>thread,</b> width of the lower part of the web and mean distance between two spiral turns in the lower part) but not to the physical characteristics of the spiders (mass and size). Our results indicate that the orb webs of spiders, which are considered to be perfect geometrical structures, include anomalies mainly in the structure of the sticky spiral. These anomalies were the result of variability in behaviour during web building. In conclusion, their identification and description enable one to use them in spider webs as an index of behavioural variability...|$|E
40|$|Stereotyped {{behaviors}} {{have been}} routinely used as characters for phylogeny inference, {{but the same}} cannot {{be said of the}} plastic aspects of performance, which routinely are taken as a result of ecological processes. In this paper we examine the evolution of one of these plastic behavioral phenotypes, thus fostering a bridge between ecological and evolutionary processes. Foraging behavior in spiders is context dependent in many aspects, since it varies with prey type and size, spider nutritional and developmental state, previous experience and, in webweavers, is dependent on the structure of the web. Reeling is a predatory tactic typical of cobweb weavers (Theridiidae), in which the spider moves the prey toward her by pulling the <b>capture</b> <b>thread</b> (gumfoot) to which it is adhered. Predatory reeling is dependent on the gumfoot for its expression, and has not been previously reported in orbweavers. In order to investigate the evolution of this web dependent behavior, we built artificial, pseudogumfoot lines in orbwebs and registered parameters of the predatory tactics in this modified web. Aspects of the predatory tactics of 240 individuals (12 species in 4 families) were measured, and the resulting data were optimized on the phylogeny of Orbiculariae. All species perform predatory reeling with the pseudogumfoot lines. Thus, predatory reeling is homologous for the whole Orbiculariae group. In nature, holes made by insects in ecribellate orbs produce pseudogumfoot lines (similar to out experimentally modified webs), and thus reeling occurred naturally in ecribellates. Nevertheless, outside lab conditions, predatory reeling does not occur among cribellate orbweavers, so that this behavior could not have been selected for in the cribellate ancester of orbweavers. Cribellate spiders are flexible enough as to present novel and adaptive predatory responses (reeling) even when exposed {{for the first time to}} conditions outside their usual environment. Thus, the evolution of reeling suggests and alternative mechanism for the production of evolutionary novelties; that is, the exploration of unusual ecological conditions and of the regular effects these abnormal conditions have on phenotype expression.

40|$|Gluing can be {{a highly}} {{efficient}} mechanism of prey capture, as it should require less complex sensory-muscular feedback. Whereas {{it is well known}} in insects, this mechanism is much less studied in arachnids, except spiders. Soil-dwelling harvestmen (Opiliones, Nemastomatidae) bear drumstick-like glandular hairs (clavate setae) at their pedipalps, which were previously hypothesized to be sticky and used in prey capture. However, clear evidence for this was lacking to date. Using high-speed videography, we found that the harvestman Mitostoma chrysomelas was able to capture fast-moving springtails (Collembola) just by a slight touch of the pedipalp. Adhesion of single clavate setae increased proportionally with pull-off velocity, from 1 μN at 1 μm s⁻¹ up to 7 μN at 1 mm s⁻¹, which corresponds to the typical weight of springtails. Stretched glue droplets exhibited characteristics of a viscoelastic fluid forming beads-on-a-string morphology over time, similar to spider <b>capture</b> <b>threads</b> and the sticky tentacles of carnivorous plants. These analogies indicate that viscoelasticity is a highly efficient mechanism for prey capture, as it holds stronger the faster the struggling prey moves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy of snap-frozen harvestmen with glued springtails revealed that the gluey secretions have a high affinity to wet the microstructured cuticle of collembolans, which was previously reported to be barely wettable for both polar and non-polar liquids. Glue droplets can be contaminated with the detached scaly setae of collembolans, which may represent a counter-adaptation against entrapment by the glue, similar to the scaly surfaces of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera (Insecta) facilitating escape from spider webs. 10 page(s...|$|R

Catenanes, rotaxanes, knots and Borromean rings have all been successfully accessed by methods in which metal ions play a pivotal role.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{computer}} architecture research has moved towards execution-driven simulation, due to the inability of traces to <b>capture</b> timing-dependent <b>thread</b> execution interleaving. However, trace-driven simulation has many advantages over execution-driven that are being missed in multithreaded application simulations. We present a methodology to properly simulate multithreaded applications using trace-driven environments. We distinguish the intrinsic application behavior from the computation for managing parallelism. Application traces capture the intrinsic behavior in the sections of code that are independent from the dynamic multithreaded nature, and the points where parallelism-management computation occurs. The simulation framework is composed of a trace-driven simulation engine and a dynamic-behavior component that implements the parallelism-management operations for the application. Then, at simulation time, these operations are reproduced by invoking their implementation in the dynamic-behavior component. The decisions made by these operations {{are based on the}} simulated architecture, allowing to dynamically reschedule sections of code taken from the trace to the target simulated components. As the captured sections of code are independent from the parallel state of the application, they can be simulated on the trace-driven engine, while the parallelism-management operations, that require to be re-executed, are carried out by the execution-driven component, thus achieving the best of both trace- and execution-driven worlds. This simulation methodology creates several new research opportunities, including research on scheduling and other parallelism-management techniques for future architectures, and hardware support for programming models.

A clock of {{a variable}} in this context, is the {{totally ordered set}} of instants at which events occur on that variables. However, the notion of instant here is logical as opposed to real-time instants. The instants of different clocks may be partially ordered. The executable code synthesis from Polychronous specifications relies on computation of schedules through clock calculus. Unfortunately, it is often hard to distinguish from true causal loops which cause deadlocks from apparent causal loops which do not. The SIGNAL compiler in the Polychrony tool-set currently rejects all programs with apparent causal loops, thus rejecting a large set of valid specifications. A recently developed polychronous formalism MRICDF and its tool-set EmCodeSyn do the same. Even in the Polychrony literature, the deadlock causing loop detection based on Boolean satisfiability {{is not enough to}} discern all possible false loops, thereby still rejecting a lot of valid specifications.

Due to recent interests in SMT solvers, a number of efficient solvers are available which offer a greater expressiveness in dealing with non Boolean constraints and allow us to discern false loops from realizable causalities in reasonable computation time.

40|$|In {{a modern}} chip-multiprocessor system, memory is a shared {{resource}} among multiple concurrently executing threads. The memory scheduling algorithm should resolve memory contention by arbitrating memory access {{in such a}} way that competing threads progress at a relatively fast and even pace, resulting in high system throughput and fairness. Previously proposed memory scheduling algorithms are predominantly optimized for only one of these objectives: no scheduling algorithm provides the best system throughput and best fairness at the same time. This paper presents a new memory scheduling algorithm that addresses system throughput and fairness separately with the goal of achieving the best of both. The main idea is to divide threads into two separate clusters and employ different memory request scheduling policies in each cluster. Our proposal, Thread Cluster Memory scheduling (TCM), dynamically groups threads with similar memory access behavior into either the latency-sensitive (memory-non-intensive) or the bandwidth-sensitive (memory-intensive) cluster. TCM introduces three major ideas for prioritization: 1) we prioritize the latency-sensitive cluster over the bandwidth-sensitive cluster to improve system throughput, 2) we introduce a "niceness 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 metric that <b>captures</b> a <b>thread</b> 2 ̆ 7 s propensity to interfere with other threads, 3) we use niceness to periodically shuffle the priority order of the threads in the bandwidth-sensitive cluster to provide fair access to each thread in a way that reduces inter-thread interference. On the one hand, prioritizing memory-non-intensive threads significantly improves system throughput without degrading fairness, because such "light 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 threads only use a small fraction of the total available memory bandwidth. On the other hand, shuffling the priority order of memory-intensive threads improves fairness because it ensures no thread is disproportionately slowed down or starved. We evaluate TCM on a wide variety of multiprogrammed worklo- - ads and compare its performance to four previously proposed scheduling algorithms, finding that TCM achieves both the best system throughput and fairness. Averaged over 96 workloads on a 24 -core system with 4 memory channels, TCM improves system throughput and reduces maximum slowdown by 4. 6...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{analyses}} possible {{approaches for}} eye fatigue detection based on eye blinking. We have found multiple approaches for eye blink detection. The approach based on consequent images acquired from {{a video camera}} is the least invasive for the user and does not require additional hardware, hence we analysed multiple methods of this approach. The method which gave best results detects eye blinks by analysing movements on two consequent images. The second method which also gives satisfactory results detects eye blinks using open eye template matching. The third method detects eye blinks by analysing the amount of black color in the eye region. This method showed {{that the amount of}} black color does not decrease enough to reliably detect eye blinks, since the surface of eyelashes increases the amount of black color in the eye area when the eye is closed. For these methods we have built a framework which in one <b>thread</b> <b>captures</b> images at maximum speed of the camera and saves them {{at the end of a}} linked list. In the second thread, the framework takes the images from the beginning of the linked list and transmits them to the method for processing. That makes it possible to detect very short eye blinks and to use a method which does not run in real time all the time. When the method detects low eye blink rate, it informs the user with an audio signal. We developed a solution for personal computers with the Linux operating system and smartphones with the Android operating system. ...|$|R
40|$|A growing {{segment of}} British legal literature, {{identified}} by the label Critical Legal Studies UK might be explained as a delayed reflection of the „movement" of that name originating in the United States. The {{purpose of this article}} is to attempt an assessment of the value which a „critical" approach might hold for English family law. It is not easy to <b>capture</b> the essential <b>thread</b> of critical legal studies. „Critical" legal writers would reject a view of law which saw legal decisions as formal deductions from established premises, and systems of law as emanations of systems of values which have inherent, objective validity. Instead, the „critical" legal conclusion — scarcely a revelation — is that the law is „inextricably mixed in the totality of social relations and institutions". As far as family law is concerned, „critical" legal writers would claim that „at the root of a critical theory is the, public/private dichotomy". The author questions the usefulness of that dichotomy as a tool of contemporary legal analyses. Then, he tries to prove that one feature of „critical" legal theory not shared by "non-critical (liberal) " theory is that the critical writer inserts an explicit ideological stance into his or her legal analysis. If this is so — claims the author — the "critical" approach reverts to a political programme, and is jurisprudentially irrelevant. If the "critical" writer is less concerned about exploring the doctrinal and empirical problems of achieving coherence within the multitude of legal and institutional mechanisms and is surer of the answers to the value-conflicts than the "non-critical" scholar, i. e. if his/her "currency is commitment rather than truth", one may truly ask whether the movement has appropriated to itself theepithet "critical" under false pretences.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the {{increase}} in global research output has been driven largely by an increase in international research collaborations (highlighted by the need to solve major global problems, for example in medicine and the environment). It is evidenced in increasing rates of co-publication, co-patenting and mobility of labour between countries and fields of research. Such international efforts are generally of a larger scale, and exhibit increased quality and impact, than purely domestic research. Matters of national significance are relying more and more on globally conducted research to provide solutions, since international cooperation enables the pooling of resources, reduces risks, allows for knowledge sourcing, aids in globalization efforts, and many other tangible and intangible benefits. The increasing connectedness of events globally, and the rapidity of transmission of their manifestations and consequences (e. g. the Asian and, more recently, Global Financial Crisis, diseases such as SARS and Swine Flu, Internet crime etc.), demands that if research is {{to be a part of}} the solution (i. e. understanding as a basis for preparedness, prevention/mitigation and response) then the international links need to be capable of rapid and flexible configuration and re-configuration. FEAST’s reflection on the global strategic aspects of these challenges prompted an exploratory paper looking at the implications of these challenges for national research and innovation policies as well as international science diplomacy. The paper provided the underpinning idea for a symposium that was jointly hosted by FEAST and The University of Queensland (UQ), in Brisbane on 24 – 25 March 2011, titled Enhancing interoperability in the emerging global research order. The symposium’s objectives were to: 1. 	Refine and develop the notion of interoperability as a new strategic objective in facilitating international cooperation in science and technology; 2. Consider the implications of the geopolitical dimension to international cooperation in science and	technology	for	delivering	enhanced interoperability; 3. 	Develop and propose improved policy stances able to balance the inherently international role of public science against the national competition-driven emphasis on innovation; 4. Explore new forms of agile contractual templates able to facilitate interoperability, and; 5. In the light of the above, agree a joint stakeholder statement and cooperative action plan for refining and	demonstrating	the	interoperability-based approach in a politically sensitive geopolitical context. This Discussion Paper, focussing on defining interoperability in a global research sense, is the first of two that will <b>capture</b> the main <b>threads</b> of discussion from the recent symposium hosted jointly by FEAST and The University of	Queensland	(UQ). Full details of the symposium, including speaker biographies and presentations, further references, and other resources are available on the FEAST website at www. feast. org/symposium 2011.
