5|$|<b>Congolese</b> {{troops of}} the Force Publique fought {{alongside}} British forces in the East African Campaign, and a <b>Congolese</b> medical unit served in Madagascar and in the Burma Campaign. <b>Congolese</b> formations also acted as garrisons in Egypt, Nigeria and Palestine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Congolese</b> {{soldiers}} of the Force Publique were involved in fighting with Italian forces during the East African Campaign and were instrumental to forcing Italian forces out of Abyssinia, suffering 500 casualties. 13,000 <b>Congolese</b> troops served under British command in Nigeria. Detachments of <b>Congolese</b> soldiers also served in the Middle East and Burma. In total, the Force Publique comprised approximately 40,000 men and was racially segregated meaning that blacks could not become officers. Throughout the war, therefore, it was commanded by white officers.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 Élisabethville {{massacre}} is {{a recurrent}} theme in <b>Congolese</b> art and folklore, {{and was later}} incorporated into the popular <b>Congolese</b> anti-colonial narrative. The importance of <b>Congolese</b> uranium during the war caused the Soviet Union to become interested in the territory; it was subsequently an area of Soviet interest during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the <b>Congolese</b> government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black <b>Congolese</b> replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many <b>Congolese</b> people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E
5|$|On 8–9 July 1960, the {{soldiers}} were invited to appoint black officers, and 'command of the army passed securely {{into the hands of}} former sergeants,' as {{the soldiers}} in general chose the most-educated and highest-ranked <b>Congolese</b> army soldiers as their new officers. Most of the Belgian officers were retained as advisors to the new <b>Congolese</b> hierarchy, and calm returned to the two main garrisons at Leopoldville and Thysville. The Force Publique was renamed the Armée nationale congolaise (ANC), or <b>Congolese</b> National Armed Forces. However, in Katanga Belgian officers resisted the Africanisation of the army.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after its}} secession, South Kasaian and <b>Congolese</b> troops clashed after the <b>Congolese</b> central {{government}} ordered an offensive against it. The offensive, {{planned to be}} the first act of an offensive against Katanga, was accompanied by widespread massacres of Baluba and a refugee crisis termed a genocide by some contemporaries. The state was rapidly overrun by <b>Congolese</b> troops. The violence in the suppression of Kasai provided much legitimacy to Joseph Kasa-Vubu's deposition of Patrice Lumumba from the office of Prime Minister in late 1960 and Lumumba's later arrest and assassination. As a result, South Kasai remained on relatively good terms with the new <b>Congolese</b> government from 1961. Its leaders, including Kalonji himself, served in both the South Kasaian government and the <b>Congolese</b> parliament. South Kasai continued to exercise quasi-independence while <b>Congolese</b> and United Nations troops were able to move through the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian gendarmerie. In April 1961, Kalonji took the royal title Mulopwe ("King of the Baluba") to tie the state more closely to the pre-colonial Luba Empire. The act divided the South Kasaian authorities and Kalonji was disavowed by the majority of South Kasai's parliamentary representatives in Léopoldville. In December 1961, Kalonji was arrested on a legal pretext in Léopoldville and imprisoned. UN and <b>Congolese</b> troops occupied South Kasai. In September 1962, shortly after his escape from prison and return to South Kasai, Kalonji was ousted by a military coup d'état which forced him into exile and brought the secession to an end.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} demands {{placed on}} the <b>Congolese</b> population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots {{and other forms of}} resistance, particularly from the indigenous <b>Congolese.</b> These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by <b>Congolese</b> uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>Congolese</b> Su-25K {{crashed on}} 30 June 2007 during an Independence Day display, {{near the city}} of Kisangani, killing the pilot. Investigations {{revealed}} that the crash was due to an engine failure.|$|E
5|$|At {{independence}} on 30 June 1960, {{the army}} {{suffered from a}} dramatic deficit of trained leaders, particularly in the officer corps. This was because the Force Publique had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government {{made no effort to}} train <b>Congolese</b> commissioned officers until {{the very end of the}} colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school. The highest rank available to <b>Congolese</b> was adjutant, which only four soldiers achieved before independence. Though 14 <b>Congolese</b> cadets were enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963. Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the Congo Crisis. Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, the Force Publique commander, wrote during a meeting of soldiers that 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring cold water on the soldiers' desires for an immediate raise in their status.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{agreement}} and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the <b>Congolese</b> government have remained tense. A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers {{to continue its}} illegal exploitation of <b>Congolese</b> minerals. Meanwhile, Kagame blamed Kabila for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in North and South Kivu provinces. Two major insurgencies {{have occurred in the}} eastern provinces: the first, from 2005 to 2009, was led by <b>Congolese</b> Tutsi Laurent Nkunda, while the second, carried out by the March 23 Movement (M23) under leader Bosco Ntaganda, began in 2012; Ntaganda gave himself up to the International Criminal Court in early 2013, and peace talks have taken place, but as of May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming. Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda, a charge Kagame denies. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23; this report cites Kagame's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Lihau {{attended}} the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium {{with the help}} of sympathetic Jesuit educators, becoming the first <b>Congolese</b> to study law. While there he encouraged <b>Congolese</b> politicians to form an alliance that allowed them to secure the independence of the Congo from Belgium. He served briefly as a justice official and negotiator for the <b>Congolese</b> central government before being appointed to lead a commission to draft a permanent national constitution. He was made dean of law faculty at the University of Lovanium in 1963. The following year he helped deliver the Luluabourg Constitution to the <b>Congolese,</b> which was adopted by referendum. In 1965 Joseph-Desiré Mobutu seized total control of the country and directed Lihau to produce a new constitution. Three years later Lihau was appointed First President of the new Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo. He retained the position, advocating for judicial independence, until 1975 when he refused to force a harsh sentence upon student protesters. Lihau was summarily removed from his post by Mobutu and placed under house arrest. Becoming increasingly opposed to the government, he helped found the reform-oriented Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social. Mobutu responded by suspending his rights and banishing him to a rural village.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July 2009, three <b>Congolese</b> men resettled in Norwich {{under the}} {{programme}} {{were killed in}} a car crash on the A1 road. The Home Office released a promotional video in October 2009 that highlighted the success of the programme in resettling the first 15 <b>Congolese</b> families in Norwich in 2006. In 2011, the Home Office stopped using Norwich as a resettlement location in favour of locations in Yorkshire and Lancashire, reportedly to the disappointment of the local council.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} census of the <b>Congolese</b> {{population}} {{was made in}} 1924, there is a consensus among historians that accurate predictions of the population fall or number of deaths is impossible.|$|E
5|$|The army {{grew from}} 10,000 to 25,000 by 1978. Amin's army {{was largely a}} {{mercenary}} force. Half the soldiers were South Sudanese and 26 percent <b>Congolese,</b> with only 24 percent being Ugandan, mostly Muslim and Kakwa.|$|E
5|$|The land {{forces are}} made up of about 14 {{integrated}} brigades, of fighters from all the former warring factions which have gone through a brassage integration process (see next paragraph), and a not-publicly known number of non-integrated brigades which remain solely made up from single factions (the <b>Congolese</b> Rally for Democracy (RCD)'s Armée national congolaise, the ex-government former <b>Congolese</b> Armed Forces (FAC), the ex-RCD KML, the ex-Movement for the Liberation of Congo, the armed groups of the Ituri conflict (the Mouvement des Révolutionnaires Congolais (MRC), Forces de Résistance Patriotique d'Ituri (FRPI) and the Front Nationaliste Intégrationniste (FNI)) and the Mai-Mai).|$|E
5|$|The {{participation}} of {{soldiers from the}} Belgian Congo was, however, largely forgotten following <b>Congolese</b> independence in 1960 and decades of subsequent war. In recent years {{the profile of the}} veterans has been raised by exhibitions creating greater public awareness.|$|E
5|$|The speech {{begins with}} Lumumba {{addressing}} {{his speech to}} the <b>Congolese</b> people and praising independence as {{the culmination of the}} struggle of the nationalist movement, rather than the result of Belgian concessions.|$|E
5|$|Their {{second son}} {{was born with a}} {{deformed}} hand, leading a cartoon to depict Leopold holding the child surrounded by <b>Congolese</b> corpses with their hands sliced off: the caption said Vengeance from on high.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} {{large numbers of}} United Nations troops stationed in the DRC. The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), on had a strength of over 19,000 peacekeepers (including 16,998 military personnel) and has a mission of assisting <b>Congolese</b> authorities maintain security. The UN and foreign military aid missions, the most prominent being EUSEC RD Congo, are attempting to assist the <b>Congolese</b> in rebuilding the armed forces, with major efforts being made in trying to assure regular payment of salaries to armed forces personnel and also in military justice. Retired Canadian Lieutenant General Marc Caron also served for a time as Security Sector Reform advisor {{to the head of}} MONUC.|$|E
5|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 161 of 21 February 1961, {{called for}} the {{withdrawal}} of Belgian officers from command positions in the ANC, and the training of new <b>Congolese</b> officers with UN help. The various efforts made by ONUC to retrain the ANC from August 1960 to their effective end in June 1963 are described in Arthur House's book , pages 145-155. By March 1963 however, after the visit of Colonel Michael Greene of the United States Army, and the resulting 'Greene Plan,' the pattern of bilaterally agreed military assistance to various <b>Congolese</b> military components, instead of a single unified effort, was already taking shape.|$|E
5|$|When South Kasai seceded, {{government}} {{troops from the}} Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC) were already fighting Katangese troops in the Kasai region. South Kasai held important railway junctions needed by the <b>Congolese</b> army for its campaign in Katanga, and therefore soon became an important objective. South Kasai also had important mineral wealth which the central government was anxious {{to return to the}} Congo. The central government also misunderstood the South Kasaian position, believing that, like Katanga, the region had declared full independence from the Congo and rejected <b>Congolese</b> sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|With the {{official}} {{agreement and the}} <b>Congolese</b> declaration {{of support for the}} Allies, the economy of the Congo and in particular its production of important raw materials, was placed at the disposal of Belgium's Allies, particularly Britain and the United States.|$|E
5|$|After the Allied {{victory in}} Abyssinia, the Force Publique was redesignated the 1st Belgian Colonial Motorised Brigade {{and served in}} as a {{garrison}} in Egypt and in British Palestine between 1943 and 1944. 13,000 <b>Congolese</b> soldiers also served in Nigeria as a garrison force.|$|E
5|$|Bangui has a rich music {{tradition}} and showcases the country's music. Its musicians also perform {{in many countries}} abroad. The Bangui band groups were influenced by Zokela in the 1980s. The innovative music is based on dance bands who have adopted the <b>Congolese</b> music with electronic support. The music is rhythmic and blends with the <b>Congolese</b> rumba (soukous), which was influenced by son cubano, cha-cha-cha, and merengue. Popular Central African music groups or dance bands who perform in the city are Musiki, Zokela, Makembe, Cool Stars, Cannon Stars, and Super Stars. Bokassa, during his tenure as President, established a music recording studio in Bangui and employed musicians to sing his praise with songs extolling his qualities as an emperor and to develop his cult image among his people.|$|E
5|$|Despite these atrocities, {{the main}} cause of the {{population}} decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably African sleeping sickness, smallpox, swine influenza and amoebic dysentery, ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone it was estimated that half-a-million <b>Congolese</b> had died from sleeping sickness. Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while excess deaths rose.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was a {{participant}} in the November 1960 Congo Crisis, a period of political upheaval and conflict in Congo-Kinshasa. The Ivorian leader supported President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, an opponent of Lumumba, and followed France in supporting the controversial <b>Congolese</b> Prime Minister Moise Tshombe. Tshombe, disliked by much of Africa, was passionately defended by Houphouët-Boigny and was even invited into OCAM in May 1965. After the overthrow of Kasa-Vubu by General Mobutu in November 1965, the Ivorian president supported, in 1967, a plan proposed by the French secret service which aimed to bring the deposed <b>Congolese</b> leader back into power. The operation was a failure. In response, Houphouët-Boigny decided to boycott the fourth annual summit of the OAU held in September 1967 in Kinshasa.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, a three sided pyramid {{was erected}} in Faradje, Belgian Congo {{to commemorate the}} actions of the <b>Congolese</b> in Ethiopia. Each face of the pyramid was inscribed with the name of each major {{location}} of fighting, including Saïo. Many locations throughout the country (presently the Democratic Republic of the Congo) are named for the battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Prime Minister Milton Obote and Amin were {{implicated in}} a deal to smuggle ivory and gold into Uganda from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The deal, as later alleged by General Nicholas Olenga, an {{associate}} of the former <b>Congolese</b> leader Patrice Lumumba, {{was part of an}} arrangement to help troops opposed to the <b>Congolese</b> government trade ivory and gold for arms supplies secretly smuggled to them by Amin. In 1966, the Ugandan Parliament demanded an investigation. Obote imposed a new constitution abolishing the ceremonial presidency held by Kabaka (King) Mutesa II of Buganda, and declared himself executive president. He promoted Amin to colonel and army commander. Amin led an attack on the Kabaka's palace and forced Mutesa into exile to the United Kingdom, where he remained until his death in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, the <b>Congolese</b> army {{carried out}} a joint {{operation}} with UN troops in the Masisi and Walikale territories of the North Kivu province. In the process, they liberated over 20 villages and a mine from the control of two rebel groups, the Mai Mai Cheka and the Alliance for the Sovereign and Patriotic Congo.|$|E
5|$|Kalonji went {{to great}} lengths to secure {{international}} recognition and support for the state of South Kasai. The former colonial power, Belgium, distrusted the <b>Congolese</b> central government and supported both the governments of South Kasai and Katanga. Like Katanga, South Kasai had important mineral deposits, including diamond fields, and Belgian companies had large sums of money tied up in mines in the area. A Belgian company, , was the state's principal supporter and received concessions from South Kasai in exchange for financial support. The comparatively large income from these companies meant that South Kasai was able to support significant public services and cope with large numbers of internally-displaced Luba refugees. In the context of the Cold War, Kalonji was supported by Western powers and moderates in the <b>Congolese</b> government who viewed him as both a moderate pro-Westerner and anticommunist. Although both Katanga and South Kasai were supported by South Africa, France and the Central African Federation, neither state ever received any form of official diplomatic recognition.|$|E
5|$|Marcel Antoine Lihau or Ebua Libana la Molengo Lihau (29 September 1931 – 9 April 1999) was a <b>Congolese</b> politician, jurist, and law {{professor}} {{who served as}} the initial First President of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo from 1968 until 1975 and was involved in the creation of two functional constitutions for the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1960, in {{response}} to requests by Prime Minister Lumumba, the UN Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 143. This called upon Belgium to remove its troops and for the UN to provide 'military assistance' to the <b>Congolese</b> forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening to seek help from the Soviet Union {{if they did not}} leave within two days. The UN reacted quickly and established the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's mandate. Because the <b>Congolese</b> army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba wanted to use the UN troops to subdue Katanga by force. Referring to the resolution, Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, 'From these texts it is clear that, contrary to your personal interpretation, the UN force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.' Secretary General Hammarskjöld refused. To Hammarskjöld, the secession of Katanga was an internal <b>Congolese</b> matter and the UN was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. Disagreements over what the UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda and Uganda were allies {{during the}} First Congo War against Zaire, with both {{countries}} being {{instrumental in the}} setting up of the AFDL and committing troops to the war. The two nations joined forces again {{at the beginning of}} the Second Congo War, but relations soured in late 1998 as Museveni and Kagame had very different priorities in fighting the war. In early 1999, the RCD rebel group split into two, with Rwanda and Uganda supporting opposing factions, and in August the Rwandan and Ugandan armies battled each other with heavy artillery in the <b>Congolese</b> city of Kisangani. The two sides fought again in Kisangani in May and June 2000, causing the deaths of 120 soldiers and around 640 <b>Congolese</b> civilians. Relations slowly thawed in the 2000s, and by 2011 the two countries enjoyed a close friendship once more.|$|E
5|$|Steve Zakuani (born 9 February 1988) is a <b>Congolese</b> former footballer. He {{was born}} in Zaire—now the Democratic Republic of the Congo—and grew up in London. He had a {{successful}} college career before playing for Seattle Sounders FC and the Portland Timbers.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Rejaf, or the Battle of Bedden, {{was fought}} on 17 February 1897 between the Belgian-led {{forces of the}} Congo Free State and Mahdist rebels in South Sudan. The battle {{resulted}} in a <b>Congolese</b> victory and the permanent expulsion of the Mahdists from the Lado Enclave, {{as well as the}} establishment of a Belgian outpost along the Nile.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) was {{initially}} welcomed by Lumumba and the central government who believed the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. ONUC's initial mandate, however, only covered peacekeeping. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, Hammarskjöld refused to use UN troops to assist the central <b>Congolese</b> government against them; he argued that doing so would represent a loss of impartiality and breach <b>Congolese</b> sovereignty. Lumumba also sought {{the assistance of the}} United States government of Dwight D. Eisenhower, which refused. Frustrated, he turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support. Around 1,000 Soviet military advisors soon landed in the Congo. Lumumba's actions distanced him {{from the rest of the}} government, especially Kasa-Vubu, who feared the implications of Soviet intervention. The Americans also feared that a Soviet-aligned Congo could form the basis of a major expansion of communism into central Africa.|$|E
