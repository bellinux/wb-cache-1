5000|$|In Catholic canon law, a {{validation}} of marriage or <b>convalidation</b> of marriage is the {{validation of}} a Catholic putative marriage. A putative marriage is one when {{at least one}} party to the marriage wrongly believes it to be valid. [...] Validation involves the removal of a canonical impediment, or its dispensation, or the removal of defective consent. However, the children of a putative marriage are legitimate.|$|E
50|$|Canon law {{stipulates}} canonical {{impediments to}} marriage. A diriment impediment prevents a marriage from being validly contracted {{at all and}} renders the union a putative marriage, while a prohibitory impediment renders a marriage valid but not licit. The union resulting is called a putative marriage. An invalid marriage may be subsequently convalidated, either by simple <b>convalidation</b> (renewal of consent that replaces invalid consent) or by sanatio in radice ("healing in the root", the retroactive dispensation from a diriment impediment). Some impediments may be dispensed from, while those de jure divino (of divine law) may not be dispensed.|$|E

In upper level classes, and until this year, the school offered two curricular options: the Spanish national <b>convalidation</b> Selectividad program (which also granted the Spanish Diploma to students) or the American Diploma one. Starting the 07/08 academic year, ASB has also offered the International Baccalaureate (IB Diploma). It {{is one of}} the only that offers this diploma in Barcelona in English. The language of instruction is English, except for courses offered in Spanish or Catalan. Staff specialties range from Counseling to Learning Disabilities and the school offers many special programs and extracurricular activities: dance, drama, PE, newspaper, student council, community service, soccer, and basketball. Furthermore, it offers the following examinations: ISA, MAP, PSAT, Selectividad and IB.|$|E

SRH) i Socijalističke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije (akr. SFRJ), ipso iure i ipso facto predstavlja nelegitiman čin djela pobunjenih Srba. Identična je kvalifikacija ovoga čina i sa stajališta odredaba međunarodnog prava. Zbog toga, Republika Srpska Krajina nikada nije postala međunarodno-pravni subjekt. Također, normativne aktivnosti pobunjenih Srba, koje su bile osnova procesu osnivanja i ustrojavanja srpskih autonomnih oblasti i Republike Srpske Krajine na području Republike Hrvatske, bile su sub colore iuris, odnosno nelegitimne. By {{analyzing}} all normative {{decisions of}} the Republic of Srpska Krajina, {{it is easy to}} conclude that most legal decisions were compiled on the basis of positive legislation of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in force at the time. Activities of the Krajina authorities aimed at making legal and sub-legal acts, cannot really be qualified as normative activities, because many of such acts were adopted contrary to the provisions of Articles 366 and 367 of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and contrary to the provisions of Articles 293, 296 and 298 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. In addition, most of the legislative corpus of the Republic of Srpska Krajina was passed between the beginning of 1992 and mid 1995, i. e. in the period when the Republic of Croatia was a recognized subject of international law. The legislative procedure in the Republic of Croatia (the procedure of passing laws) is regulated by the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and the Standing Orders of the Croatian Parliament. Considering the afore said, the activity of the rebel Serbs, pertaining to the making of their legal and sub-legal acts, may only be defined as a quasi-normative activity, since it had no constitutional hold in the above three constitutions. Despite this fact, authorities of the Republic of Croatia respected high democratic and legal standards with regard to normative activities of the Republic of Srpska Krajina. For that reason, Croatian authorities passed the Law on <b>Convalidation</b> which, along with other three sub-legal texts, regulated the <b>convalidation</b> of the regulations of the Republic of Srpska Krajina. Namely, the <b>convalidation</b> of the monetary acts of the Republic of Srpska Krajina was not possible because the latter were contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and Rights of Ethnic or National Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia and other laws of the Republic of Croatia. In other words, it means that, argumento a contrario, all the acts of the Republic of Srpska Krajina have the same legal significance they had prior to the passing of the <b>convalidation</b> regulations and after that they were and still are legally non-existing acts, in terms of both positive legal regulations of the Republic of Croatia and the provisions of international law. Their legal/actual effect accounts for a temporary hindering of the competence of the Croatian authorities to regularly conduct their duties on the temporarily occupied territories of the Republic of Croatia...|$|E
40|$|A {{large portion}} of the PhD {{education}} in Sweden is dedicated to courses. This made it interesting to explore potential course supervision challenges in the PhD programme. A multiple-case study was conducted to identify such challenges and explore how these are perceived by students and supervisors at the Faculty of Engineering of Lund University. By interviewing students and supervisors in five different research groups, insights were gained into how the main stakeholders reason about courses. The findings indicate that courses that are {{to be included in the}} education are characterized by a large degree of freedom tailored to individual student needs and preferences. However, the type, timing, availability, value, and <b>convalidation</b> of courses are challenges that limit this freedom...|$|E
