5|$|John von Neumann's work on {{functional}} analysis and topology in broke new ground {{in mathematics and}} economic theory. It also left advanced mathematical economics with fewer applications of differential <b>calculus.</b> In particular, general equilibrium theorists used general topology, convex geometry, and optimization theory more than differential <b>calculus,</b> because the approach of differential <b>calculus</b> had failed to establish {{the existence of an}} equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{discrete}} {{equivalent of}} differentiation is finite differences. The study of differential <b>calculus</b> is unified with the <b>calculus</b> of finite differences in time scale <b>calculus.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tintin {{and his dog}} Snowy {{visit their}} friends Captain Haddock and Professor <b>Calculus</b> at Marlinspike Hall. There, they learn that Bianca Castafiore, her maid Irma, pianist Igor Wagner and the detectives Thomson and Thompson have been imprisoned in San Theodoros for {{allegedly}} attempting to overthrow the military government of General Tapioca. Tapioca's government have further alleged that the plot was masterminded by Tintin, Haddock, and <b>Calculus</b> themselves. Tapioca invites the trio to visit San Theodores, promising them safe passage, but Tintin deems {{it to be a}} trap, leaving Haddock and <b>Calculus</b> to go alone. Once there, the Captain and Professor are taken to a rural villa, where they are closely monitored by the security services.|$|E
5|$|After {{these four}} primary expository sections, {{almost as an}} afterthought, Bernoulli {{appended}} to Ars Conjectandi a tract on <b>calculus,</b> which concerned infinite series. It was a reprint of five dissertations he had published between 1686 and 1704.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Bunkamura Museum of Art in Tokyo staged an {{exhibition}} of original Hergé drawings {{as well as of}} the submarine and rocket ship invented in the strips by Professor <b>Calculus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Professor <b>Calculus,</b> Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Calculus' {{assistant}} Frank Wolff are aboard {{an atomic}} rocket-powered spacecraft leaving the Earth {{bound for the}} Moon. Soon after takeoff they discover that the detectives Thomson and Thompson have accidentally stowed away onboard, putting a strain on the oxygen supply. The detectives accidentally turn off the nuclear motor, disrupting the artificial gravity and sending everyone floating until Tintin corrects the problem. They then suffered a relapse of the Formula 14 drug (seen in Land of Black Gold (1950)), resulting in their hair growing rapidly in multiple colours. <b>Calculus</b> subsequently administers a cure. Haddock, who has smuggled whisky aboard the rocket, gets drunk and takes an impromptu spacewalk, during which he briefly becoming a satellite of the asteroid Adonis (at which point, Professor <b>Calculus</b> humorously says he will tell Earth that Adonis has a new satellite {{by the name of}} Haddock) but Tintin is able to rescue him.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Calculus</b> Affair began {{serialisation}} in Tintin magazine's Christmas edition on 22 December 1954, {{and continued}} {{to appear in the}} pages of that publication until 22 February 1956. It would be the first of The Adventures of Tintin to be serialised without interruption since Red Rackham's Treasure (1944). Serialisation began in the French edition of Tintin in February 1955. It was subsequently published in single form as L'Affaire Tournesol by Casterman in 1956. For this volume Hergé had designed a front cover; initially, it simply showed Tintin and Haddock hiding <b>Calculus</b> from Bordurian soldiers, but he subsequently added shattered yellow glass {{around the edges of the}} image for dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of infinitesimal <b>calculus</b> {{was at the}} forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying <b>calculus</b> became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} {{concept of}} a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and <b>calculus</b> from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of <b>calculus</b> to be used.|$|E
5|$|Though Gleason's {{mathematics}} {{education had}} gone {{only so far}} as some self-taught <b>calculus,</b> Yale mathematician William Raymond Longley urged him to try a course in mechanics normally intended for juniors.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and Haddock {{meet the}} detectives Thomson and Thompson, who {{reveal that the}} wounded man at Marlinspike was Syldavian. Tintin surmises that <b>Calculus</b> had invented an {{ultrasonic}} device capable of {{being used as a}} weapon of mass destruction, which both Syldavian and Bordurian intelligence agents are now seeking to obtain. Discovering that Bordurian spies have kidnapped <b>Calculus</b> and are holding him hostage in their Rolle embassy, Tintin and Haddock seek to rescue him, but during the attempt he is captured by Syldavian agents, who are able to escape by plane to their home country. The next morning, Tintin and Haddock learn that Bordurian fighter aircraft forced down the Syldavian plane and captured <b>Calculus,</b> who is now being held in Borduria. They travel to Borduria's capital, Szohôd, intent on rescuing him.|$|E
5|$|Tintin barely escapes {{the ship}} with his life, {{and he and}} Haddock alert the authorities; but the abductors evade the police and take <b>Calculus</b> to the Andes {{mountain}}s. Tintin and Haddock pursue them to the mountain town of Jauga, where they board a train that is sabotaged {{in an attempt to}} kill them. When they attempt to investigate the whereabouts of <b>Calculus,</b> the local Indios prove to be peculiarly tight-lipped, but then Tintin befriends a young Quechua boy named Zorrino after saving him from Spaniard bullies. A mysterious man observes this act of kindness and gives Tintin a medallion, telling him that it will save him from danger. Zorrino informs Tintin that <b>Calculus</b> is taken to the Temple of the Sun, which lies deep within the Andes, and offers to take them there.|$|E
5|$|Tintin joins {{his friends}} {{a few days}} later, where he points out to Haddock and <b>Calculus</b> that their villa is bugged. He {{recognises}} one of the staff as Pablo, {{a man who had}} saved his life in The Broken Ear. From Pablo, Tintin learns that the entire scenario is a plot organised by Colonel Sponsz, a figure in the Bordurian military who is assisting Tapioca's government in order to gain revenge against Tintin for the events of The <b>Calculus</b> Affair.|$|E
5|$|Young {{reporter}} Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and friend}} Captain Haddock arrive in Callao, Peru. There, {{they plan to}} intercept {{the arrival of the}} Pachacamac, a ship carrying their friend Professor <b>Calculus,</b> who is being held by kidnappers. Tintin boards the ship and learns from Chiquito, the former assistant of General Alcazar and one of the abductors, that <b>Calculus</b> is to be executed for wearing a bracelet belonging to the mummified Incan king Rascar Capac.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{differential}} <b>calculus</b> is a subfield of <b>calculus</b> {{concerned with}} {{the study of the}} rates at which quantities change. It is one of the two traditional divisions of <b>calculus,</b> the other being integral <b>calculus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Multivariable <b>calculus</b> (also {{known as}} multivariate <b>calculus)</b> is the {{extension}} of <b>calculus</b> in one variable to <b>calculus</b> with functions of several variables: the differentiation and integration of functions involving multiple variables, rather than just one.|$|E
25|$|Differential <b>calculus</b> and {{integral}} <b>calculus</b> {{are connected}} by the fundamental theorem of <b>calculus,</b> {{which states that}} differentiation is the reverse process to integration.|$|E

25|$|Lambda <b>calculus</b> has {{applications}} {{in many different}} areas in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. Lambda <b>calculus</b> has {{played an important role}} in the development of the theory of programming languages. Functional programming languages implement the lambda <b>calculus.</b> Lambda <b>calculus</b> also is a current research topic in Category theory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Calculus</b> (from Latin <b>calculus,</b> {{literally}} 'small pebble', {{used for}} counting and calculations, like on an abacus) is the mathematical study of continuous change, {{in the same}} way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations. It has two major branches, differential <b>calculus</b> (concerning rates of change and slopes of curves), and integral <b>calculus</b> (concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves). These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of <b>calculus.</b> Both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit. Generally, modern <b>calculus</b> is considered to have been developed in the 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, <b>calculus</b> has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Calculus</b> of {{variations}} deals with extremizing functionals, {{as opposed to}} ordinary <b>calculus</b> which deals with functions.|$|E
25|$|Sequent <b>calculus</b> is one {{of several}} extant styles of proof <b>calculus</b> for expressing line-by-line logical arguments.|$|E
25|$|Sequent <b>calculus</b> {{is related}} to other axiomatizations of propositional <b>calculus,</b> such as Frege's propositional <b>calculus</b> or Jan Łukasiewicz's axiomatization (itself {{a part of the}} {{standard}} Hilbert system): Every formula that can be proven in these has a reduction tree.|$|E
25|$|Today, Leibniz and Newton {{are usually}} both {{given credit for}} {{independently}} inventing and developing <b>calculus.</b> Newton {{was the first to}} apply <b>calculus</b> to general physics and Leibniz developed much of the notation used in <b>calculus</b> today. The basic insights that both Newton and Leibniz provided were the laws of differentiation and integration, second and higher derivatives, and the notion of an approximating polynomial series. By Newton's time, the fundamental theorem of <b>calculus</b> was known.|$|E
25|$|Deductive lambda <b>calculus</b> – The {{consideration}} of {{the problems associated with}} considering lambda <b>calculus</b> as a Deductive system.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{considerable}} body of programming idioms for lambda <b>calculus.</b> Many of these were originally developed {{in the context of}} using lambda <b>calculus</b> as a foundation for programming language semantics, effectively using lambda <b>calculus</b> as a low-level programming language. Because several programming languages include the lambda <b>calculus</b> (or something very similar) as a fragment, these techniques also see use in practical programming, but may then be perceived as obscure or foreign.|$|E
25|$|This {{deduction}} theorem (DT) is {{not itself}} formulated with propositional calculus: {{it is not}} a theorem of propositional <b>calculus,</b> but a theorem about propositional <b>calculus.</b> In this sense, it is a meta-theorem, comparable to theorems about the soundness or completeness of propositional <b>calculus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Binary lambda <b>calculus</b> – A {{version of}} lambda <b>calculus</b> with binary I/O, a binary {{encoding}} of terms, and a designated universal machine.|$|E
25|$|For certain {{formulations}} (i.e. variants) of the sequent <b>calculus,</b> a proof {{in such a}} <b>calculus</b> is isomorphic to an upside-down, closed analytic tableau.|$|E
25|$|What Leibniz {{actually}} {{intended by}} his characteristica universalis and <b>calculus</b> ratiocinator, {{and the extent}} to which modern formal logic does justice to <b>calculus,</b> may never be established.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} lambda <b>calculus</b> terms act as {{functions}} on other lambda <b>calculus</b> terms, {{and even on}} themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda <b>calculus.</b> Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda <b>calculus</b> terms? The natural semantics {{was to find a}} set D isomorphic to the function space D → D, of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such D can exist, by cardinality constraints because the set of all functions from D to D has greater cardinality than D, unless D is a singleton set.|$|E
25|$|Default logics, non-monotonic logics and {{circumscription}} are {{forms of}} logic {{designed to help}} with default reasoning and the qualification problem. Several extensions of logic {{have been designed to}} handle specific domains of knowledge, such as: description logics; situation <b>calculus,</b> event <b>calculus</b> and fluent <b>calculus</b> (for representing events and time); causal calculus; belief calculus; and modal logics.|$|E
