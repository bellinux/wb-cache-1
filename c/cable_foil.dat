5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial cables use braided {{copper wire}} forming the shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, {{but it also means}} there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield. The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other shield designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the <b>cable.</b> When a <b>foil</b> shield is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the shield termination easier.|$|R
40|$|The next {{generation}} of cryodetector arrays for direct WIMP searches will aim to achieve large increases in WIMP-nucleon scattering target mass, {{an order of magnitude}} or more greater than existing detector arrays. The implementation of high-resolution measurements and background suppression by event discrimination will remain of paramount importance. Hardware development must be undertaken to increase the availability and density of read out channels while maintaining low-noise, low-heatload, high-radiopurity cryodetector performance. This thesis describes the development of scalable cryogenic cabling using etched metal foil fabrication techniques and the development of low-temperature high-voltage power supply for scintillation light readout using photomultiplier tubes. Etched metal <b>foil</b> <b>cables</b> were developed for cryodetector read out. Fabrication techniques for low-heatload, low-cost cabling were developed and commissioning tests were carried out to verify low-noise performance in both low-impedance and high-impedance cryodetector read out schemes. SQUID readout cabling with a heatload cost 24 times lower than existing cabling was installed and mean SQUID noise of 5. 5 pAHz-l/ 2 was measured with low- impedance input. Photomultiplier tubes can be used for cryogenic scintillation light measurement, a key technique in cryodetector event discrimination. A low-heatload, low-noise photomultiplier tube power supply circuit was developed. Measurements of cryogenic scintillation light from a CaW 04 crystal were carried out using a CWG/PMT module cooled to 0. 95 mK. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The mechanical strength is relatively good, especially considering that the material is not reinforced by a woven support, and make ETFE foils suitable for load bearing envelopes characterised by small spans or supported by <b>cables</b> [1]. ETFE <b>foils</b> are traditionally used for multilayer pneumatic cushions, however, in recent projects the application of single skin ETFE foils has been successfully investigated. This innovative application opens new areas of interest in the area of the building envelope, such as a protective secondary facade. In addition, the growing demand for reducing the heating costs has recently increased the demand for ETFE foils with pigments or surface treatments able to improve the environmental performance of lightweight envelopes based on ETFE foils [2]. This research paper describes the thermal performance of an existing ETFE roof in Verona and the subsequent retrofitting of the structure in order to meet the targets of solar shading specified by the client. The paper includes the data obtained through the monitoring of the structure before and after the installation of a new set of cushions manufactured with a bespoke silver ETFE designed in order to reduce the solar gains and improve the overall level of comfort during the warm season...|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} the Schleuniger Group {{as it is known}} today started in 1991 when Dr. Gerhard Jansen (Chairman BOD until 2009) and Martin Strehl (CEO until 2009) {{acquired}} Sutter Electronic AG located in Thun, Switzerland. At that time Sutter Electronic AG had 30 employees and generated a revenue of 5 million CHF with wire processing machines and other processing equipment. In 1993 the new owners acquired Schleuniger Productronic AG, which had been founded in Solothurn, Switzerland. This company also produced wire processing machines, but additionally had access to the international market. Both companies were then integrated into a group under the already internationally established name [...] "Schleuniger". In 1999, the Schleuniger Group took over their previously independent distributor [...] "L+H Kabeltechnik" [...] and secured direct access to Germany - its most important European market. Taking over the Swiss-based Kirsten AG in 2000 opened the crimping market for the Schleuniger Group and two years later Schleuniger entered the market for Plastic Optical Fiber (POF) and Flat <b>Foil</b> <b>Cables</b> (FFC / FPC) with the foundation of Schleuniger Flexon AG in 2002. Another 2 years later, Schleuniger took over the activities of the German [...] "Grote+Hartmann Engineering GmbH" [...] (GHWE) from the American Lear Corporation Inc., and developed fully automatic crimping machines, which are now produced by Schleuniger Automation GmbH in Radevormwald, Germany. Having been active in China through an independent representative for many years, Schleuniger opened a representative office in Shanghai in 2005, which was transformed into a trading company in 2007. In 2008, the Swiss Metall Zug Group took over the Schleuniger Group. The same year, Schleuniger took over PAWO Systems AG which became Schleuniger Solutions in 2009. In August 2009, Christoph Schüpbach succeeded Martin Strehl as CEO and Calvin Grieder succeeded Gerhard Jansen as Chairman in November 2009. A substantial investment was made in 2013 with the acquisition of the former Tianjin Haofeng Electrical Equipment Co., Ltd. headquartered in Tianjin, China. The new owners integrated the newly founded Schleuniger Haofeng (Tianjin) Machinery Co., Ltd. into the Schleuniger Group. Schleuniger Haofeng produces high-quality machinery for the wire processing industry. Prior to their acquisition, Tianjin Haofeng Electrical Equipment's 2012 posted sales were the equivalent of approx. 5 million Swiss Francs. Another acquisition was completed in Spring 2015 when the Cirris Solutions GmbH, headquartered in Jettingen/Germany became part of the Schleuniger Group. Due to its fully automated testing systems, Cirris Solutions is one of the global leaders in the field of applied testing technology and testing automation. Cirris Solutions GmbH has approximately 40 employees and generated translated sales of 7.2 million Swiss Francs in 2014 (currency exchange rate from Dec. 31, 2014).|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Agricultural {{implement}} draft requirements {{depend on}} forces necessary to compress, shear, displace, accelerate and sometimes pulverize soil. These forces depend on (a) implement operating parameters, (b) soil properties and (c) implement geometry (James et. al., 1996). Experimental and theoretical analyses techniques {{are essential to}} develop efficient tillage or soil cutting tools. Soil bin, an experimental system, is a generic term for a test facility for studying soil dynamics, specifically for soil-machine interaction research in agriculture (Mahadi, 2005). Considerable experimental analysis has been done using indoor soil bin test systems under controlled soil condition. However, the parameters resulting from controlled soil conditions will not meet the actual field soil conditions. Thus, {{the objective of this}} research is to design and install a portable in-situ soil bin test system, and to use this system for experimentation with six different ploughshare geometries. This will give information on how geommetry and working conditions affect draught and power requirements for soil manipulations under actual field soil conditions. In the experimental design it is foreseen that the experimentation will be undertaken at three plough planes i. e. surface, at 20 cm depth, and at 40 cm depth. At each plane, ploughing will be undertaken at three different angles of the ploughshare i. e. 80, 150, and 240 representing primary, secondary, and tertiary tillage. Following experimentation and the signal analysis,, multi linear and linear regression are to be performed tocorrelate draught force with soil physical and mechanical properties, tillage tool geometry, travel speed, tillage depth, tillage angle, and furrow profile. The soil physical and mechanical properties are: bulk density, moisture content, penetration resistance, clay content, and silt content. Deliverables: D 1 : Design and installation of in-situ portable Soil Bin Test System is documented D 2 : Values about Tillage Depth, Tillage Angle, Travel Speed, Furrow Profile of the three planes at three different angles of plough with replicas from three sites at wet and dry conditions are reported Milestone: M 1 : Effect of Moisture Content, Bulk Density, Tillage Depth, Tillage Angle, Travel Speed, Furrow Profile, Soil Compaction, Clay Content, and Silt Content on Draught Requirement is investigated. M 2 : Effect of tool geometry on draught and soil manipulation is investigated INTRODUCTION The term tillage embraces all operations of seedbed preparation that optimize soil and environmental conditions for seed germination, seedling establishment and crop growth (FAO, 1994). The primary objectives of tillage are seedbed preparation, provision of a good medium for plant roots, water infiltration and retention, erosion and weed control (FAO, 1993). Tillage modifies soil surface structure, total porosity, macro-porosity, pore continuity and pore size distribution and therefore has great influence on the hydrology of an agricultural catchments (Mwendera, 1992). A granular structure is desirable to allow rapid infiltration and good retention of rainfall to provide adequate moisture and air exchange capacity within the soil and to minimize resistance to root penetration (Kelemu, 2001). A good seedbed generally implies finer particles and greater firmness {{in the vicinity of the}} seeds. However, the mechanical manipulation of soil (Kaumbutho et al., 2004) should be done carefully and adequately; otherwise, it leads to extreme soil disturbance, which in turn results in deteriorative consequences. The new tillage systems and the need for improved energy efficiency of tillage operations do put an emphasis for optimizing tillage tool design. This can be done by two different techniques, namely by experiment and by theoretical analysis techniques (Plouffe et al., 1999 a & b; Mouazen and Neményi, 1998). These methodologies could significantly assist in optimizing the implement designs and operational conditions aiming at minimum draught requirement and best soil manipulation performance. Soil bin test system technique is a means of experimental verification essential to develop efficient tillage or soil cutting tools. The requirement of such efficient tillage technique is to consume less energy and provide a satisfactory soil condition for crop emergence and growth. The field experiment allows prototype verification with specialized instrumented equipment (McLaughlin et al., 1993). Various researchers studied the draught requirement with respect to different soil and tillage parameters (Gill and Vanden Berg, 1967; Eradat Oskoui et. al 1982; Ayers and Perumpral, 1982; Koolen and Kuipers, 1983; Kydd et al., 1984; Upadhyaya et al. 1984; Busscher and Sojka, 1987; Young et al. 1988; Mouazen and Ramon, 2002; Bernier et al., 1989; Erbach et al., 1992; Oni et al., 1992; Shirin et al., 1993; Evans et al., 1996; Fielke, 1996; McKyes and Maswaure, 1997; Onwualu and Watts, 1998; Al-Janobi and Al-Suhaibani, 1998; Mapfumo and Chanasyk, 1998; Unger and Jones, 1998; Manian et al., 2000; Shrestha et al., 2001; Gratton et al., 2003; McLaughlin and Campbell, 2004). Although several reports on the effects of draught on the performances of different tillage tools and implements are available in the literature, there is dearth of information on experimentation of maresha plough with soil bin test system. Hence, the aim of this research is thesis aims to: (i) review research attempts on animal drawn implements; and soil bin test systems, techniques, and applications; (ii) describe the development of a mobile in-situ soil bin testing device; (iii) report the observations and insights gained from the field experiments; (iv) investigate the effect of maresha plough geometry on draught requirement and soil loosening; and (v) lay platform for further research. To do this, the design and installation of a portable and in-situ soil bin test system allows for controlled experimentation under field conditions. 1. 1 Why portable and in-situ soil bin test system Indoor soil bins provide tremendous benefits to researchers. But there are limitations with indoor soil bin test systems i. e. Indoor soil bins are built under dimensional constraints. Indoor soil bins have a limit in maximum loads. Most indoor soil bins are in a closed confinement. Replicate measurements on indoor bins always occur on disturbed and artificially conditioned soil Indoor soil bin does not consider the existence of vegetation and crop residue that affect the actual performance which cannot be replicated in an indoor soil bin. MATERIALS AND METHODS The portable and in-situ soil bin test system is designed and implemented by integrating measurement system (sensors, and data acquisition system). Draught is to be measured using force sensors (load cells), and online measurement of tillage speed and tillage depth using encoders and LVDT. Using core samplers, soil samples will be taken from field at 2 m interval, and accordingly bulk density, moisture content, clay content, and silt content are to be determined in laboratory. Soil penetration mesaurements are also done at these locations. Experimental Design The experimental design of in-situ and portable soil bin test sytem will consider six geometries: maresha without wing, maresha with wing, tenkara kind, duck foot plough, two modified plough geometries (modified plough 1, modified plough 2). Experiments will be undertaken at three planes to gain information of effect of soil compaction layers: surface ploughing, ploughing at 20 cm depth, ploughing at 40 cm depth. At each plough plane, ploughing will be undertaken at three different angles of ploughing/attack i. e. 80, 150, and 240 for the respective geometries. The soil bin consists of a carriage on which the instruments and plough shares are mounted. The carriage itself moves on an adapted rail track. The rail has 20 m length, and at both ends 2 m length is excavated to 60 cm depth for the start and end of a test run. This yields 16 m effective ploughing length and accordingly the starting and ending of ploughing is defined. The online parameters to be measured are draft force, tillage depth, and speed. At 2 m interval, soil samples will be taken to determine bulk density and moisture content in the laboratory. Penetration resistance and furrow areas and shapes will be measured at same distance interval. Tests in the dry season allow for controlled moisture conditioning of the soil: the soil shall get wet using partition dams with water application of 100 lt/m 2, and to be covered with plastic for three days. Two experimental designs which will be applicable at three sites with different soil types are proposed and are under review. 2. 2 Design and establishment of portable and in-stiu Soil Bin Test System Design and construction of rail and carriage system: The portable soil bin test system is designed and the components are pair of rails having 20 m length, carriage, and treated wooden footings. For experimental purpose, three rows are established, and the schematic layout is presented below. Design of sensor attachments: Design of measurement system for portable soil bin test system is performed. The soil bin test system incorporates load cell attachments for surface, at 20 cm depth, and at 40 cm depth ploughings. The load cells are connected by a cable to a data logger; and data presentation is displayed by means of PC running data acquisition system and DasyLab software package. Analog to Digital conversion System: The computer-based instrument acquires data in a rather straightforward system. A load cell picks up the force deformation and this analog information is received by the data acquisition hardware and digitized. The digitized value is sent to the computer and received by the data acquisition software. The software then interprets the value, conditions, scales, and displays and stores the data. The data acquisition hardware is from IOtech and composed of DBK 43 A (8 -channel strain gage module), DagBook/ 2000 E (Ethernet 16 -bit, 200 -kHz data acquisition system; includes DaqView software), DBK 203 (Screw-terminal adapter board in rugged metal enclosure for DaqBoard/ 2000 series; P 1 /P 2 /P 3, analog and digital I/O expansion ports), DBK 34 A (uninterruptible Power Supply for DC powered systems), and CA- 37 - 3 T (expansion cable from DaqBook to DBK modules). A software program called DASYLab, windows-based graphical data acquisition software package, is usede for data acquisition. The DASYLab uses icon-based flowchart, the job of communicating with the hardware is taken care of by a driver. Data Analyses: After suitable filtering to remove measurement noise, the force and speed signals are available for analysis. Multi linear and linear regression are to be performed to correlate draught force with moisture content, bulk density, tillage depth, tillage angle, travel speed, penetration resistance, furrow profile, clay content, and silt content. 3 Ph. D. STATUS The doctoral research is based on experimentation using portable and in-situ soil bin test system, and instrumentation of two-wheel tractor. Literature review has been undertaken, and the in-situ and portable soil bin test system is designed and installed in Mekelle University, Ethiopia. Attachement which helps to plough at three planes i. e. surface, 20 cm depth, and 40 cm are designed, manufactured and tested. Experimentation was undertaken at three plough planes: surface, at 20 cm depth, and 40 cm depth; and at three different angle of plough. The respective depths are prepared by removing strip of 40 cm width soil so as to investigate the effect of hardpan on soil tillage. Soil samples were also taken at 2 m interval using core samplers to determine moisture content and bulk density. Preliminary data analyses were also undertaken. The progress of the work was presented on seminar held on Nov 17, 2010 at KU Leuven. The following points were raised: experimental design with randomization; changing the pulling rope with steel chain because of elasticity; and topography of the selected plot which need to be plain enough, and start of ploughing somehow from relatively bottom so that to avoid inertia effect of the carriage. Besides, instead of measuring tillage depth manually and caluclating speed as function of total distance travelled and time elapsed, it is recommended to incorprate encoder and LVDT so that to have online data measurement. With regard to wheel slip, two encoders recommended to be incorporated on the design, one to be attached at the drive wheel and the other one at the free wheel. In order to avoid noise on measurement, grounding the -ve of battery, and sheilding of all <b>cables</b> with aluminium <b>foil</b> and grounding to the same point was recommended; with this, data was taken and displayed data was seen with lesser noise. For further data measurement and signal analyses, it is recommended to design filter in order to avoid noise on measrement, and the process is on progress. Experimental design and daily basis work plan is submitted and it is on review. From Feb 2011 to Sep 2011, in Mekelle University - Ethiopia, the measurement system will be modified to incorporate the above mentioned recommendations and intensive data will be taken from three sites. Data analyses and interpretation will then follow from Oct 2011 up to Mar 2012 at KU Leuven. status: accepte...|$|R
