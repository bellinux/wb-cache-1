5|$|One {{section of}} the M11 {{extension}} was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead. Residents had believed that this would save their green, and a 250-year-old sweet chestnut tree that grew upon it, but {{because this was a}} <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> tunnel, this required the tree to be cut down.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, Turner Construction {{was awarded}} the $105 million {{construction}} contract to build and finish Capitol Hill station's interior and entrances. Turner began interior construction in March 2013, using an unusual steel truss support system to pour concrete for station elements. Construction on the west entrance and its <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> tunnel under Broadway began in November 2013 and required lane shifts on Broadway throughout 2014. By the summer of 2015, work on Capitol Hill station was declared 90 percent complete, and the construction wall was gradually removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened on 30 May 1870 by the DR (now the District line) when the railway {{extended}} its line from Westminster to Blackfriars. The {{construction of the}} new section of the DR was planned {{in conjunction with the}} building of the Victoria Embankment and was achieved by the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> method of roofing over a trench. Due to its proximity to the South Eastern Railway's Charing Cross station, the station was originally called Charing Cross.|$|E
60|$|A groan {{of horror}} and pity {{burst from the}} seaman when he beheld the almost insensible form of a {{powerful}} negro, whose back was lacerated with innumerable ragged <b>cuts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> with clotted blood.|$|R
50|$|Depending on wind direction, {{wind speed}} trend and weather {{forecast}} the trains can operate in winds of 60 to 75 mph. As the train approaches the top station it enters a 250 m <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> tunnel taking {{it up to}} the top platform hidden in the hillside.|$|R
50|$|Octoberflame VI {{took place}} in October 25 and 26, 2013 at City National Grove of Anaheim. The two {{back-to-back}} shows were advertised as Tiger Army's last shows of 2013. The Octoberflame events have become known for varied set lists that explore deep <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> songs, special guests and diverse support acts running the gamut of rock, alt-rock, punk, hardcore, psychobilly, industrial, rockabilly and more.|$|R
5|$|As the Market {{was being}} built, a <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> railway tunnel was {{constructed}} underground City street level {{to create a}} triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{suspended}} {{planning for}} the Portage Bay tunnel in 2000 after it received construction bids that were $171 million higher than expected and found, through soil testing, that a deeper tunnel would be required. The project's costs overall rose $1 billion over budget and the schedule was delayed by three years, due to unrealistic cost and time estimates made during previous stages of planning. Capitol Hill businesses, while initially supportive of the light rail station's placement, later pulled their support of the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> option due to the longer period required for construction. Sound Transit, faced with budget issues and further schedule delays, deferred construction of the segment between Downtown Seattle and the University District in 2001 while re-evaluating alignment options.|$|E
5|$|The Suburbs Line runs between Bondi Junction in Sydney's {{east and}} Eveleigh, {{just south of}} the Sydney central {{business}} district. It is mostly underground, and consists of 7 kilometres of bored tunnels and 1.5 kilometres of <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> tunnels, with only 2 kilometres above ground. In the Eastern Suburbs, three tunnels proceed in a westerly direction from Bondi Junction via Edgecliff and Kings Cross; in each of these tunnels there are stations. Between Bondi Junction and Edgecliff there is a short open-air cutting in Woollahra, and between Edgecliff and Kings Cross there is a short viaduct over Rushcutters Bay.|$|E
40|$|The left {{internal}} mammary artery is the conduit {{of choice}} for coronary artery bypass grafting. In the traditional (“clipped-artery”) harvesting technique, this artery is prepared as a pedicle; the distal part is clipped, <b>cut,</b> <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> with a papaverine-soaked cloth until anastomosis is performed. In modified (“nonclipped-artery”) harvesting, the prepared artery is kept in situ and left connected to the systemic circulation until anastomosis. Better outcomes from use of the nonclip technique have been reported. In order to determine comparative endothelial integrity and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, we performed an immunohistochemical study of arterial graft segments that were procured by each technique...|$|R
25|$|Randall {{first came}} to note as a cover fielder, as one-day cricket forced fielding {{standards}} to improve. His run out of Gordon Greenidge in the 1979 Cricket World Cup final highlighted this, and his partnership with David Gower was {{a feature of the}} successful England team of the immediate post-Packer era. Known for his eccentric movement at the crease, Randall was a determined batsman, specialising in hooks, pulls, <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> drives, the former being used most memorably against Dennis Lillee in the Centenary Test in Melbourne in 1977 when he made 174, the highest Test score by any Nottinghamshire batsman in the history of Test cricket.|$|R

5|$|The {{station was}} opened as Westminster Bridge on 24 December 1868 by the steam-operated District Railway (DR) (now the District line) when the railway opened {{the first section}} of its line from South Kensington. It was {{originally}} the eastern terminus of the DR and the station cutting ended at a concrete wall buffered by timber sleepers. The approach to the station from the west runs in <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> tunnel under the roadway of Broad Sanctuary and diagonally under Parliament Square. In Broad Sanctuary the tunnel is close to Westminster Abbey and St Margaret's church and care was required to avoid undermining their foundations when excavating in the poor ground found there.|$|E
5|$|Three {{construction}} {{options were}} evaluated during the project's Environmental Impact Study for {{the portion of}} the line between 11th Street and Hanover Square. One option known as the Shallow Chrystie Option would mainly use <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover,</b> while the Deep Chrystie Street and Forsyth Options would use a combination of tunneling by Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPBMs) and <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover.</b> The Shallow Chrystie Option would have used the existing Confucius Plaza tunnel section between Canal and Division Streets, and like the plan from the 1970s, {{there would have been a}} cross-platform transfer to the existing Grand Street station, with the transfer expected to be heavily used. However, this option would require digging up Sara Delano Roosevelt Park to the east as Chrystie Street is not wide enough to fit four tracks. Under this option, a track connection would be built to allow trains from Second Avenue to run via the Manhattan Bridge north tracks to allow service to Brooklyn. The Forsyth Option would curve below the park to Forsyth Street and the station would be built under Forsyth Street, requiring a 200-foot transfer passageway that would be less convenient than the other options. The Deep Chrystie Option would have the Second Avenue Subway run deeper underground, running underneath the existing Grand Street station, with a mezzanine in between the two stations. In order to allow for sufficient room for stairways to transfer to the Second Avenue Line, the Grand Street station would be widened to have twenty foot wide platforms. No track connection would be built under this option, and the Confucius Plaza tunnel section would not be used for subway service, but it instead might be used for ancillary subway facilities. Currently, this is the preferred option.|$|E
5|$|When the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western {{expanded}} the Kingsland Shops in 1903, a new station depot was constructed of brick {{along with a}} <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> tunnel. The tunnel itself cost $71,500 (1903 USD) and permitted the local street, Schuyler Avenue to cross over the rail line. The new station depot was built on Ridge Road over the tracks, with platforms crossing over the new bridge. The design of the station depot located above the tracks was later replicated by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western's Montclair Branch for its Watsessing Avenue station in Bloomfield, New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|After {{two years}} of {{intensive}} work Russian metallers returned with a brand new album called “The Labyrinth Of Penumbra”.

5000|$|The [...] "official purpose" [...] of Camp Century, as {{explained}} by the United States Department of Defense to Danish government officials in 1960, was to test various construction techniques under Arctic conditions, explore practical problems with a semi-mobile nuclear reactor, as well as supporting scientific experiments on the icecap. A total of 21 trenches were <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> with arched roofs within which prefabricated buildings were erected. With a total length of 3000 m, these tunnels also contained a hospital, a shop, a theater and a church. The total number of inhabitants was around 200. From 1960 until 1963 the electricity supply was provided {{by means of the}} world's first mobile/portable nuclear reactor, designated PM-2A and designed by Alco for the U.S. Army. Water was supplied by melting glaciers and tested to determine whether germs such as the plague were present.|$|R
40|$|Herbrand's theorem {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} insights in logic. From the syntactic point of view it suggests a compact representation of proofs in classical first- and higher-order logic by recording the information which instances have been chosen for which quantifiers, known in the literature as expansion trees. Such a representation is inherently analytic and hence corresponds to a cut-free sequent calculus proof. Recently several extensions of such proof representations to proofs with cut have been proposed. These extensions are based on graphical formalisms similar to proof nets and are limited to prenex formulas. In this paper we present a new approach that directly extends expansion trees by <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>covers</b> also non-prenex formulas. We describe a cut-elimination procedure for our expansion trees with cut that is based on the natural reduction steps. We prove that it is weakly normalizing using methods from the epsilon-calculus...|$|R
5|$|Also {{announced}} in November 1896 was {{a bill to}} be presented by the District Railway (DR) for a tube railway to be constructed beneath its existing sub-surface line between Gloucester Road and Mansion House stations. The DR operated a steam railway, running in <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> tunnels, and planned to ease congestion along its heavily used route by constructing an express line with just a single intermediate station at Charing Cross (now Embankment). The express line was to surface west of Gloucester Road and connect to the DR's existing line at Earl's Court. Since, like the B, the DR's deep tube line would be operated with electric trains, the DR planned to build a generating station adjacent to its Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway). The bill received assent on 6 August 1897 as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1897.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{revisited}} the routing issue during community {{meetings in}} 1997 and 1998, proposing an alternate route through Eastlake, South Lake Union, and the Seattle Center if engineering of the Capitol Hill tunnel would jeopardize the project's budget. The project's draft environmental impact statement, released in December 1998, {{determined that the}} Capitol Hill tunnel would be feasible and recommended its inclusion in the plan. Sound Transit proposed that Capitol Hill's <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> station be located under Broadway south of East John Street, with several entrances to serve nearby Seattle Central Community College and the Broadway business district. From the station, trains would continue south to a station in First Hill before entering the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel; and north under Portage Bay to the western University District. An additional Capitol Hill station, near Broadway and East Roy Street, was proposed by Seattle representatives but {{left out of the}} preferred alternative due to cost concerns. In November 1999, Sound Transit finalized its preferred alternative, adding a crossover north of Capitol Hill station near East Thomas Street.|$|E

The singer chose Bart Walsh, a Los Angeles, CA player who had {{previously}} performed {{as a part of}} the Van Halen tribute band, The Atomic Punks. The setlists on the DLR Band tour relied heavily on Van Halen material, with some older solo <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> various <b>covers</b> sprinkled in.|$|R
5000|$|While many country LPs {{during this}} period were often haphazardly {{assembled}} collections of studio <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> songs to support a hit single or two, the quality of Haggard's albums {{during this period}} were remarkably high. In his 2013 biography Merle Haggard: The Running Kind, David Cantwell gives part of the credit to producer Ken Nelson: [...] "Nelson wasn't a musician himself, and he wasn't a knob-twirling auteur, either...Nelson had an ear for talent and material and for sounds...He was an old school A&R man, {{and he had the}} role's key skill: he could hear pop." [...] Another key ingredient in Haggard's sound during this period was the guitar blend of James Burton and Roy Nichols. As Haggard explained to Downbeat in 1980, [...] "James was doing this thing called 'chicken pickin'. But he wasn't really bending the strings. Roy, on the other hand, was doing the string bending but wasn't doing the chicken' pickin'... Our guitar style came out of a marriage between the styles." ...|$|R

25|$|LDDC {{also built}} Limehouse Link tunnel, a <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> road tunnel linking the Isle of Dogs to The Highway (the A1203 road) {{at a cost}} of over £150 million per kilometre, one of the most {{expensive}} stretches of road ever built.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, Auckland City Council commissioners gave {{approval}} to widening the approach motorway for the bridge through Onehunga Bay, but opposed the new interchange design {{north of the}} bridge favoured by Transit, which intended to construct it around 7 m high over Gloucester Park and the Hopua volcanic tuff ring. The Council's preferred version was to build the interchange at ground level with part of the motorway in a <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> tunnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{same year}} the first {{underground}} station was opened in Erandio, {{on the existing}} Bilbao-Plentzia railway. In 1989 construction began in the city centre, where the main Moyúa square was closed to pedestrians until 1997. Construction was especially complicated in the neighbourhoods of Deusto and San Inazio, where the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> tunnel excavation damaged some buildings, was very noisy, and caused severe traffic disruptions. This method of excavation contrasted with the tunnel-boring machines used elsewhere in the city.|$|E
