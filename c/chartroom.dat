The main advantage of e-learning is that it increases the engagement; attendance and motivation of students which are requisite for learning. By advent of Web and internet; English learning (EL) improved because internet had its own language and logic and was not limited to one culture. Indeed; learning English via internet challenges traditional from of learning. Internet is a virtual English environment. People become autonomous by using internet and they can independent from books and teacher such as <b>chartrooms</b> and mass media which increase the oral proficiencies of learners. the use of mass media such as books and manuscripts and internet media (like blogs; message boards; podcasts; and video sharing) are another faces of e-learning.

The research aims in this dissertation focus on the extend to which specific e-style characteristics are found in different CMC modes and whether the internet is emerging as a homogeneous linguistic medium or as a collection of distinct varieties, reflecting the different needs, purposes and attitudes of its users. Results have shown that these still rather new modes of communication have fostered new norms of expression and developed innovative ways of written language, particularly in the case of e-mail and chatrooms. Language use in CMC has been proven to be adapted to suit the particular conditions according to level of synchronicity, means of expression and situation in the respective communicative settings. A number of linguistic features are shown to be characteristic of the modes of CMC investigated in this study. This dissertation concludes that although there are a few linguistic properties which the three different internet situations analyzed in this study share, these do not make a very strong case for a view of internet Afrikaans as a new variety of Afrikaans. It is proposed that the kind of language which is used on the internet in its different situations should rather be regarded as a new linguistic medium - something fundamentally different from both writing and speech, as traditionally understood.

2500|$|The Fairmile is {{a wooden}} hulled {{passenger}} vessel. Her hulls-form is very fine for a vessel of her type; {{it is based}} on a destroyer hull, albeit much smaller, as her original speed was some 20 knots. The hull is split into watertight compartments, the midships compartment is the engine room, housing twin Gardner diesels, and an aft compartment contains the toilet facilities. The main deck has a forward open passenger deck. Aft of this, the forward deckhouse contains a chart room. [...] In the centre of the main deck is a raised open deck area, surrounding the funnel, and with the open flybridge above the <b>chartroom.</b> [...] Aft of the funnel is the main passenger lounge, originally the sick-bay, now named [...] "Churchill's", in honour of Winston Churchill. [...] The saloon is decorated with memorabilia of Churchill, including his profile etched on the side windows, and contains a bar. Both of the deckhouses are surrounded by an open passenger promenade deck. [...] At the stern of the vessel, the former open deck has been enclosed with an awning.|$|E
2500|$|The new-build {{grain ship}} MACs {{were based on}} the Ministry of War Transport's {{standard}} tramp hull which could just accommodate the Admiralty's revised requirement for a flight deck of not less than [...] length and [...] breadth: they were eventually built with flight decks of between [...] [...] The standard design used for the new-build tankers enabled a longer flight deck of approximately [...] with minor variations between individual ships. [...] An important enhancement was specified for the MACs' machinery. [...] A standard diesel tramp engine developed [...] to give a service speed of 11kn. but to provide some margin for flying operations, all the new-build MACs were fitted with engines rated at [...] which, in the grain ships, produced a speed of about 12kn. [...] The new-build tankers with their higher displacements were still capable of 11kn. while the pre-existing 'Triple Twelves' had a service speed of about 10.5kn. [...] The most obvious modification was the flight deck and its supporting structure which was arranged in sections (three on the grain ships; four in the case of tankers) with expansion joints between each. [...] The flight deck was built at the level that would normally have been occupied by the wheelhouse and in the 'Triple Twelves' this entailed removal of the existing wheelhouse and the funnel. [...] The space immediately under the flight deck was utilised for the arrester gear mechanisms, four wires to each MAC with an additional unit fitted to the tankers to operate the trickle wire and safety barrier. [...] A small island structure contained the bridge and wheelhouse and, in the tanker MACs, a <b>chartroom</b> that {{could be used as a}} pilots' briefing room. Less apparent modifications included; accommodation for 107 crew (about 50 more than normal); improved internal subdivision; additional ventilation, including exhaust arrangements that could be adjusted to vent to the leeward side; changes to lifeboat positions; and magazines for the safe stowage of bombs, depth charges, ammunition and pyrotechnics. [...] There were minor variations between the types. [...] In the grain MACs, [...] the armament sponsons or 'zarebas' could not project outboard of the moulded line of the hull which necessitated them encroaching onto the flight deck area so that the ship would not be prevented from using commercial berths, but this constraint did not apply to the tankers whose zarebas were extended outboard of the side. [...] One centre cargo tank in each tanker was adapted for the carriage of aircraft fuel (or 'Avgas') but in the grain ships this necessitated a special compartment containing two pressurised fuel tanks, together with a control room and associated piping.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{of technology and}} internet has diverted company direction to retain customer e-loyalty. Customer loyalty is becoming an area of great interest for companies and customer loyalty has {{a direct impact on}} the revenue and profitability of a company. With regard to customer loyalty’s importance, we investigate three main research problems that are the most important barriers for e-businesses to survival, which are customer too much switching, switching cost, and competition. To overcome this barriers: companies had to invest on building loyal customer in long- time relationship. Also, in this research, the influential factors of customer e-loyalty were investigated, which are e-satisfaction, e-trust, and e-quality. In this research, e-loyalty and e-satisfaction models are elaborated, then, with regard to limitations, the conceptual e-loyalty model are assumed that investigate the relationship between the e-satisfaction, e-trust, and e-quality as basic constructs of model as well as the relationship between each constructs and e-loyalty. In this study, quantitative research is best to this thesis because of linear structure between e-loyalty and its constructs. In addition, research purpose and research questions indicate that this thesis is primarily exploratory then descriptive. Since the aim of this research is to investigate the relationship of variables and to test some predefined hypothesizes among a number of e-stores, survey is selected as research strategy. The aim of this research is to identify influential factors of customer e-loyalty in Iranian e-stores which are focus on selling Book and CDs. Thus, the sample of this survey consists of online buyers who have deals with three e-stores. The names of e-stores were considered anonymous due to owner's request since they feel free to give us customer's information. Moreover, the size of the population under this study is the sample size that has been determined 280 under formula: still, 352 questionnaires were gathered out which 322 were eventually accepted. The result of this research shows that delivery time, distribution system, specific invoice as well as convenience and flexibility of online shopping is very underlying factor of e-satisfaction from customer point of view. In addition, giving Personal Data, Reliable information, Credit card information, and having Physical location have a very influential effect on E-trust from customer point of view. Also, e-stores brand name as well as previous user’s recommendations is the most underling factors which bring about good word of mouth and finally lead to trust in online shopping. Moreover, Experience of members in communities and <b>chartrooms</b> leads to developing E-trust among members. Besides, need fulfillment, advertisement / promotions, and customized attention are the influential factors of E-quality from customer perspective. Also, sending reminder, relevant information, and share of business with customer are the most underlying factors which affect cultivation and increase customer attention in online shopping and consequently increase e-quality. Moreover, one-stop shop and carry a wide selection of products are the most prominent issues which lead to e-quality. In conclusion, all factors which increase E-satisfaction and E-quality lead to e-loyalty so E-satisfaction as well as E-quality considered as two influential factors of customer E-loyalty. Also, since significant relationship between E-trust with E-loyalty and E-satisfaction rejected, we can say that preparing e-trust solely has no effect on E-loyalty and E-satisfaction. In other words, trust is sufficient condition for any e-business for transactions with customer which is not lead to e-loyalty, exclusively. Beside, since there is significant and positive relationship between E-trust and E-quality, and because E-quality has direct effect on E-satisfaction and E-loyalty, we can conclude that E-trust in companion with E-quality will lead to E-satisfaction and E-loyalty.

60|$|That {{species of}} fowl {{is not to}} be shooed off as easily as a chicken. Fooled, cheated, deceived, led on, outraged, mocked at-- beak and claws! A {{sinister}} bird! The lieutenant had no mind to become the talk of the Archipelago, as the naval officer who had had his face slapped by a girl. Was it possible that she really loved that rascally trader? He tried not to think, but, worse than thoughts, definite impressions beset him in his retreat. He saw her--a vision plain, close to, detailed, plastic, coloured, lighted up--he saw her hanging round the neck of that fellow. And he shut his eyes, only to discover that this was no remedy. Then a piano began to play near by, very plainly; and he put his fingers to his ears with no better effect. It was not to be borne--not in solitude. He bolted out of the <b>chartroom,</b> and talked of indifferent things somewhat wildly with the officer of the watch on the bridge, to the mocking accompaniment of a ghostly piano.|$|E
60|$|Next, {{it must be}} {{recorded}} that {{the same day the}} gunboat Neptun, steering east, passed the brig Bonito becalmed in sight of Carimata, with her head to the eastward, too. Her captain, Jasper Allen, giving himself up consciously to a tender, possessive reverie of his Freya, did not get out of his long chair on the poop to look at the Neptun which passed so close that the smoke belching out suddenly from her short black funnel rolled between the masts of the Bonito, obscuring for a moment the sunlit whiteness of her sails, consecrated to the service of love. Jasper did not even turn his head for a glance. But Heemskirk, on the bridge, had gazed long and earnestly at the brig from the distance, gripping hard the brass rail in front of him, till, the two ships closing, he lost all confidence in himself, and retreating to the <b>chartroom,</b> pulled the door to with a crash. There, his brows knitted, his mouth drawn on one side in sardonic meditation, he sat through many still hours--a sort of Prometheus in the bonds of unholy desire, having his very vitals torn by the beak and claws of humiliated passion.|$|E
6000|$|Though he was {{stifling}} {{under the}} lighter's sail which Nostromo had unwittingly lowered {{on top of}} him, {{he did not even}} dare to put out his head till the very moment of the steamer striking. Then, indeed, he leaped right out, spurred on to new miracles of bodily vigour by this new shape of danger. The inrush of water when the lighter heeled over unsealed his lips. His shriek, [...] "Save me!" [...] was the first distinct warning of the collision for the people on board the steamer. Next moment the wire shroud parted, and the released anchor swept over the lighter's forecastle. It came against the breast of Senor Hirsch, who simply seized hold of it, without in the least knowing what it was, but curling his arms and legs upon the part above the fluke with an invincible, unreasonable tenacity. The lighter yawed off wide, and the steamer, moving on, carried him away, clinging hard, and shouting for help. It was some time, however, after the steamer had stopped that his position was discovered. His sustained yelping for help seemed to come from somebody swimming in the water. At last a couple of men went over the bows and hauled him on board. He was carried straight off to Sotillo on the bridge. His examination confirmed the impression that some craft had been run over and sunk, but it was impracticable on such a dark night to look for the positive proof of floating wreckage. Sotillo was more anxious than ever now to enter the harbour without loss of time; the idea that he had destroyed the principal object of his expedition was too intolerable to be accepted. This feeling made the story he had heard appear the more incredible. Senor Hirsch, after being beaten a little for telling lies, was thrust into the <b>chartroom.</b> But he was beaten only a little. His tale had taken the heart out of Sotillo's Staff, though they all repeated round their chief, [...] "Impossible! impossible!"
