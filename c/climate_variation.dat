25|$|The first prehistoric lake {{to follow}} the Sedom Lagoon is named Lake Amora, {{followed}} by Lake Lisan and finally by the Dead Sea.

25|$|The {{relative}} increase in solar irradiation at closest {{approach to the}} Sun (perihelion) compared to the irradiation at the furthest distance (aphelion) is slightly larger than four times the eccentricity. For Earth's current orbital eccentricity, incoming solar radiation varies by about 6.8%, while {{the distance from the}} Sun currently varies by only 3.4% (5.1millionkm). Perihelion presently occurs around January 3, while aphelion is around July 4. When the orbit is at its most eccentric, the amount of solar radiation at perihelion will be about 23% more than at aphelion. However, the Earth's eccentricity is always so small that the variation in solar irradiation is a minor factor in seasonal <b>climate</b> <b>variation,</b> compared to axial tilt and even compared to the relative ease of heating the larger land masses of the northern hemisphere.|$|E

2500|$|The giant {{impact theory}} hypothesizes that the Moon {{resulted}} from {{the impact of a}} Mars-sized body, Theia, with the very young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its axial tilt and velocity of rotation. Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes photosynthesis viable. The Rare Earth hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the orbital plane). A planet with a large tilt (inclination) will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate, unfriendly to complex life. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that <b>climate</b> <b>variation</b> provides. In this view, the Earth's tilt is [...] "just right". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the variation in tilt would be chaotic, probably making complex life forms on land impossible.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} interdecadal <b>climate</b> <b>variations</b> over the Pacific Ocean are unclear.

Various mechanisms are described herein by which the oceanic biological response to Pacific interdecadal climate forcing may organize a significant feedback to the physical climate system. The oceanic biological processes considered in this paper appear {{to be able to}} sensitize the coupled ocean-atmosphere climate system predominantly through changes in upper-ocean absorption of radiation due to phytoplankton and to changes in dimenthylsulfide (DMS) fluxes to atmospheric cloud systems.

The developments in observational networks during recent decades have helped us to quantify the strength and variability {{of most of the}} ocean general circulations responsible for the transports. Those are discussed in detail in individual sections covering each tropical basin separately with a special emphasis on recent research results. Shallow overturning cells observed in all three tropical basins as well as the deep Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are such examples that are linked to ocean and <b>climate</b> <b>variations</b> on multiple timescales. In addition, tropical ocean–atmosphere interactions associated with oceanic planetary waves cause large-scale <b>climate</b> <b>variations</b> such as El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole, Atlantic Niño, and ENSO Modoki.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} <b>climate</b> <b>variations</b> on bacillary {{dysentery}} incidence have gained more recent concern. However, the multi-collinearity among meteorological factors affects {{the accuracy of}} correlation with bacillary dysentery incidence. Methods As a remedy, a modified method to combine ridge regression and hierarchical cluster analysis was proposed for investigating the effects of <b>climate</b> <b>variations</b> on bacillary dysentery incidence in northeast China. Results All weather indicators, temperatures, precipitation, evaporation and relative humidity have shown positive correlation with the monthly incidence of bacillary dysentery, while air pressure had a negative correlation with the incidence. Ridge regression and hierarchical cluster analysis showed that during 1987 – 1996, relative humidity, temperatures and air pressure affected the transmission of the bacillary dysentery. During this period, all meteorological factors were divided into three categories. Relative humidity and precipitation belonged to one class, temperature indexes and evaporation belonged to another class, and air pressure was the third class. Conclusion Meteorological factors have affected the transmission of bacillary dysentery in northeast China. Bacillary dysentery prevention and control would benefit from by giving more consideration to local <b>climate</b> <b>variations.</b> </p...|$|R
