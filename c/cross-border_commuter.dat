The latter bring about configurations {{of the social}} and territorial dimensions of human action which break up the traditional comprehension of societal spaces. The concept of the transnational social space is helpful to overcome the unity of territorial and social space and to study social figurations anchored in different national states.

In the highly populated areas of Western-Central Europe {{a large population}} will be exposed to these changes. In particular Luxembourg—with its dense population and the large <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuter</b> flows—is vulnerable to changing thermal stress. Based on climate change projections we assessed the impact of climate change on human thermal comfort over the next century using two common human-biometeorological indices, the Physiological Equivalent Temperature and the Universal Thermal Climate Index. To account for uncertainties, we used a multimodel ensemble of 12 transient simulations (1971 – 2098) with a spatial resolution of 25 [*]km. In addition, the regional differences were analysed by a single regional climate model run with a spatial resolution of 1. 3 [*]km. For the future, trends in air temperature, vapour pressure, and both human-biometeorological indices could be determined. Cold stress levels will decrease significantly {{in the near future}} up to 2050, while the increase in heat stress turns statistically significant in the far future up to 2100. This results in a temporarily reduced overall thermal stress level but further increasing air temperatures will shift the thermal comfort towards heat stress...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how {{the dynamic}} context of mobility, more {{specifically}} the commute {{to and from}} work in the region of Luxembourg, can be changed through gamified mobile applications. The goal is to get {{a better understanding of the}} innovative application area of gamified mobility and its potential, as well as to describe its implications for research and practice. This applied research is inspired by a participatory design approach, where information is gained by adopting a user perspective and through the process of conceptualising and applying methods in empirical studies. The four empirical studies described in this thesis employed a mixed-methodology approach consisting of focus group interviews, questionnaires and mobile applications. Within these studies four prototypes were developed and tested, namely Coffee Games, Driver Diaries, Commutastic and Leave Now. The studies show concrete possibilities and difficulties in the interdisciplinary field of gamifying mobility behaviour. This dissertation is composed of seven chapters: Chapter I introduces the topics mobility, games and behaviour; Chapter II presents a proof of concept study (Using Gamification and Metaphor to Design a Mobility Platform for Commuters); Chapter III explains the development and validation of a mobility research tool (Driver Diaries: a Multimodal Mobility Behaviour Logging Methodology); Chapter IV describes the development of a new gamified mobility application and its evaluation (Studying Commuter Behaviour for Gamifying Mobility); Chapter V provides an empirical assessment of the relevance of gamification and incentives for the evaluation of a mobile application (Changing Mobility Behaviour through Recommendations) and Chapter VI is a summary on how to change mobility behaviour through a multilevel design approach (Using Gamification to change Mobility Behaviour: Lessons Learned from two Approaches). The four prototypes help to address the primary goal of this thesis, which is to contribute to new approaches to urban mobility by exploring gamified mobility applications. Coffee games is a proof of concept, low-fidelity implementation of a real-life game that tests gamification elements and incentives for changing indoor-mobility behaviour. The findings of two iterations with a total of 19 participants show the adaptability of the concept to different contexts. The approach to change indoor-mobility behaviour with this mock-up game was successful. Driver Diaries is a methodology to assess mobility behaviour in Luxembourg. The aim with this mobile, digital travel diary is to study features of <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuter</b> mobility and activities in Luxembourg in order to identify suitable elements (activities etc.) for a gamified mobility application, such as Commutastic. After two rounds of data collection (Android and iOS) the records of 187 participants were analysed and the results illustrate the mobility habits of the target audience. Commutastic is a mobility game application that motivates users to avoid peak-hour traffic by proposing alternative after work activities. Analysing the data of 90 participants, we find that the timely offer of an activity in the proximity along with gamification elements involves users and motivates a third of them to engage in alternative mobility behaviours. Leave Now is a gamified recommendation application, which rewards users for leaving their workplace outside of their usual schedule and explores the role of specific gamification elements on user motivation. The study, which was conducted with 19 participants, shows differences between an individual play and a group play condition regarding leaving time changes. The contributions of this thesis to gamification and mobility research and practice span from mobility participations as a game and integral part of our everyday life to methodologies of its successful implementation in the Luxemburgish context. The results show the advantages, disadvantages, and restrictions of gamification in urban mobility contexts. This is an important step towards gamifying mobility behaviour change and therefore towards research aiming at a wellbeing in a better urban life...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{economic}} impact of cross-border work on the communes of residence of the <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuters.</b> At the French-luxembourgish border, many people live in France and have a job in Luxembourg. For some communes of Lorraine, most of 80 % of the employed population works abroad. The impacts of this cross-border activity not only on demographic evolution, but also on unemployment or economic activity are interesting to examine at the municipal level through quantitative datasets. What are the recent evolutions of the number of cross-border workers in the French communes? Is there an effect of the rise of <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuters</b> on unemployment or on economic activity near the borders? Finally, can the proximity of the borders be seen as an engine of regional development, or on the contrary as a disruptive element? This exploratory analysis leads to interesting first results showing the interdependencies between France and Luxembourg regarding cross-border labour. The closer to the border the communes are, the higher the percentage of <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuters</b> is. Moreover, during the last five years, the rate of people working abroad particularly rose in the communes near the borders, but also in farther communes with an easy access to Luxembourg (by road or train). But on the other hand, despite their proximity to the border, and their high rate of <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuters,</b> some communes have high unemployment rates. One part of the population doesn’t match the needs of the labour market, and especially the Luxembourgish one that requires now more and more specific and highly qualified profiles. The 2011 and 2006 census data from INSEE available at the municipal level will be used to build maps, and conduct multivariate analysis. This quantitative analysis will be completed by a focus on the French commune of Longwy, interesting by its geographic position (in the immediate vicinity of the border) and economic situation (formerly one of the main steel-industry areas of France) ...|$|R

50|$|However, {{before these}} {{provisions}} could fully take effect, the SED removed {{the problem of}} cross-border commuting in the Berlin area by building the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961. At this time, there were still 12,000 East <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuters</b> employed in East Berlin, including 6,000 at the Deutsche Reichsbahn (East German Railways). The rest were mostly active as artists (70% of the soloistic staff of the Deutsche Staatsoper on Unter den Linden were West Berliners), or as scientists, technicians or doctors. Because {{of the absence of}} payments made by East <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuters,</b> the Wage Compensation Fund had to adjust its payments to the East cross-border commuters; they were faced with the alternatives of giving up their jobs in the east, or migrating to the east.

40|$|The {{location}} of Switzerland {{in the center}} of Europe without being member of the European Union implies that wages can be greatly influenced by trans-border labor markets which are of different relevance for various regions. Moreover, since 1 st June 2002 the Swiss labor market is experiencing a transition period where the Free Movement of Persons between Switzerland and the European Union member states will be gradually introduced and fully implemented within 12 years. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate wage differentials in Switzerland as an important topic of analysis. The dissertation is composed of three related essays. The first one analyses wage differentials among Swiss regions. We decompose the regional wage differentials in two components (i. e. endowment and remuneration) applying a method proposed by Yun (2005) in an extension of the Blinder-Oaxaca methodology for a detailed decomposition. The other two essays focus on the Swiss border Canton of Ticino. The second essay investigates wage differentials among natives and foreigners in a trans-border labor market segmented by task. Two methodologies have been used to decompose the gap into endowment and unexplained component: the traditional parametric Blinder-Oaxaca approach and a nonparametric propensity score matching technique. Finally the third essay analyzes the impact of <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuters</b> on Swiss labor market in view of its liberalization. This is a particular labor market with high levels of foreign workers and a regulatory discontinuity across two inside regions. The possibility to distinguish two areas where <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuters</b> can be employed or not is the key of this analysis. Taking into account immigration endogeneity as well as the limited mobility of local labor supply, local workers wages have been compared across the regulatory discontinuity in order to understand if <b>cross-border</b> <b>commuters</b> may generate a downward wage pressure on Swiss workers...|$|R
