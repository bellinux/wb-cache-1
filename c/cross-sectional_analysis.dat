In 2016 the murder rate {{increased}} by 8.6%, with 17,250 murders that year. The national clearance rate for homicides in 2015 was 64.1%, compared to 90% in 1965. In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980. [...] In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations. A <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>analysis</b> of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States [...] "homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher."

[...] It {{was performed by}} the Concentrance Consulting Group and published in March 2005 (herein, the [...] "Concentrance study"). [...] Unlike the earlier OIG reports, the Concentrance study was based largely on a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>analysis</b> of data collected in interviews with individual homebuyers, sellers and various types of real-estate professionals in ten metropolitan areas. [...] Their findings corroborated some of the claims made by the nonprofit organizations, particularly that the typical recipient {{was a person who}} would not otherwise have been able to become a home owner. [...] But the interviewees also generally corroborated some of the claims made by detractors of the programs—that sellers were routinely raising their sales prices to recoup the payment made to the nonprofit organization, and that the price increases led to higher loan costs for the buyers along with a higher risk of default on their loans. [...] The study was not restricted to the Nehemiah Program; no particular program was singled out {{in the body of the}} report. [...] However, the appendices gave summary results of questionnaire answers from real-estate professionals. [...] These results indicated that the Nehemiah Program was the most active program in the ten metropolitan areas covered by the study.|$|E

The oral health goal of retaining at least 20 teeth at age 80 years was achieved by 25% of the population or less in most countries.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between return and beta for Islamic unit trusts using the <b>cross-sectional</b> regression <b>analysis.</b> The estimation of return and beta without differentiating between positive and negative excess market returns produces a flat unconditional relationship between return and beta. Using the conditional CAPM and <b>cross-sectional</b> regression <b>analysis,</b> the evidence in this paper tends to support a significant positive relationship in an up-market and a significant negative relationship in a down-market. This paper suggests that beta could be used as a tool in explaining cross-sectional differences in Islamic unit trusts returns and as a measure of market risk. Based on the adjusted-R and standard error of the conditional relationship between returns we find that beta is higher in a downmarket than in an up-market. Therefore, both statistics are appropriate measurements of conditional relationships...|$|R

50|$|In {{statistics}} and econometrics, a cross-sectional regression {{is a type}} of regression in which the explained and explanatory variables are associated with one period or point in time. This type of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>analysis</b> is in contrast to a time-series regression or longitudinal regression in which the variables are considered to be associated with a sequence of points in time.|$|E
50|$|In economics, <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>analysis</b> has the {{advantage}} of avoiding various complicating aspects of the use of data drawn from various points in time, such as serial correlation of residuals. It also has {{the advantage}} that the data analysis itself does not need an assumption that the nature of the relationships between variables is stable over time, though this comes at the cost of requiring caution if the results for one time period are to be assumed valid at some different point in time.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of intellectual property}} and intellectual property rights in today’s economy steadily increases. By conducting event studies this report investigates whether the market is efficient {{when it comes to}} the granting and the invalidation of non-qualitative patents, hypothesizing that the granting and invalidation should not have an impact on abnormal returns. By non-qualitative patents it is meant patents that first have been granted and then later invalidated due to reasons that should not lead to the patent being granted from the beginning. An extensive <b>cross-sectional</b> regression <b>analysis</b> is conducted to further investigate what actually drives abnormal returns. The hypotheses set out in the report are confirmed by the event study. The granting of the non-qualitative patent do not have a positive effect on abnormal returns and the invalidation of the non-qualitative patent do not have any effect on abnormal returns. The <b>cross-sectional</b> regression <b>analysis</b> concludes that what drives abnormal returns is not the granting of the non-qualitative patent; instead it is efficiency in terms of asset turnover and knowledge capital in terms of intangible assets to total assets...|$|R
