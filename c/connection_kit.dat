50|$|Ardour's {{recording}} {{abilities are}} limited by only the hardware it is run on; there are no built in limits in the software. When recording on top of existing material, Ardour can do latency compensation, positioning the recorded material where {{it was intended to}} be when recording it. Monitoring options include monitoring with external hardware (a feature dependent on sound card support), monitoring with Ardour itself, and monitoring with JACK Audio <b>Connection</b> <b>Kit</b> (JACK). Monitoring with Ardour makes it possible to apply plug-in effects to the signal while it is recorded in real-time, although with some unavoidable, yet ideally unnoticeable, amount of latency. Using the audio server JACK, Ardour can record both from the audio card and JACK-compatible software concurrently.|$|E

An adapter to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors. Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector.

Various Newton applications had full import/export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and PIM (Personal Information Manager) application file formats, primarily by making use of Apple's bundled Newton Connection Utilities (or the older Newton <b>Connection</b> <b>Kit,</b> which had been sold separately for Newton devices that used the 1.x versions of the OS).|$|E
5000|$|Rigid {{line is a}} {{coaxial line}} formed by two copper tubes {{maintained}} concentric every other meter using PTFE-supports. Rigid lines can not be bent, so they often need elbows. Interconnection with rigid line is done with an inner bullet/inner support and a flange or <b>connection</b> <b>kit.</b> Typically rigid lines are connected using standardised EIA RF Connectors whose bullet and flange sizes match the standard line diameters, for each outer diameter either 75 or 50ohm inner tubes can be obtained. Rigid line is commonly used indoors for interconnection between high power transmitters and other RF-components, but more rugged rigid line with weatherproof flanges is used outdoors on antenna masts, etc. In the interests of saving weight and costs, on masts and similar structures the outer line is often aluminium, and special {{care must be taken}} to prevent corrosion.With a flange connector it is also possible to go from rigid line to hard line. Many broadcasting antennas and antenna splitters use the flanged rigid line interface even when connecting to flexible coaxial cables and hard line.Rigid line is produced {{in a number of different}} sizes: ...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{implement}} the Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modem modules for the Software Defined Radio (SDR), using different Linux sound Application Programming Interfaces (API's). The FSK modulation scheme, uses coherent detection with matched filters. The modules are implemented using the Linux operating system and the programming language used is C/C++. Simulation is performed first and then followed by implementation in real-time, using APIs. The APIs used are Open Sound System (OSS), Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), Jack Audio <b>Connection</b> <b>Kit</b> (JACK) and PortAudio (PA). In real-time two computers are used, one acting as the modulator and the other as the demodulator. The two sound cards are connected by an audio cable. Results obtained using OSS, ALSA and JACK are satisfactory. Recommendations are subsequently made for the suitable API(s). Both ALSA and JACK are the best APIs for the implementation. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die doel van hierdie tesis is om modules vir 'n frekwensieskuif-sleuteling (FSK) modem vir 'n Sagteware-gedefinieerde Radio (SDR) te implementeer, deur gebruik te maak van verskillende Linux klankargitekture (API's). Die FSK modulasieskema gebruik koherente deteksie met aangepaste filters. Die modules is geïmplementeer met behulp van die Linux bedryfstelsel en CjC++ is gebruik as programmeringstaal. Simulasies is eers gedoen, gevolg deur 'n reële-tyd implementasie. Die klankargitekture wat gebruik is, is Open Sound System (OSS), Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), Jack Audio <b>Connection</b> <b>Kit</b> (JACK) en PortAudio (PA). Twee rekenaars is gebruik vir die reële-tyd stelsel, waar een as die modulator optree en die ander een as die demodulator. Die twee klankkaarte is verbind deur 'n klankkabel. Bevredigende resultate is verkry met behulp van OSS, ALSA en JACK. Aanbevelings is gevolglik gemaak vir toepaslike API's. Beide ALSA en JACK is die geskikste API's vir die implementasie...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Apple iPad is {{a popular}} tablet device {{presented}} by Apple in early 2010. The idiosyncracies of this new portable device {{and the kind of}} data it may store open new opportunities in the field of computer forensics. Given that its design, both internal and external, is very similar to the iPhone, the current easiest way to obtain a forensic image is to install an SSH server and some tools, dump its internal storage and transfer it to a remote host via wireless networking. This approach may require up to 20 hours. In this paper, we present a novel approach that takes advantage of an undocumented feature so {{that it is possible to}} use a cheap iPad accessory, the Camera <b>Connection</b> <b>Kit,</b> to image the disk to an external hard drive attached via USB connection, greatly reducing the required time...|$|E
