25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a <b>clevis</b> <b>pin,</b> Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the back of his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E
5000|$|A clevis {{fastener}} is a three-piece fastener system {{consisting of}} a clevis, <b>clevis</b> <b>pin,</b> and tang. The clevis is a U-shaped piece that has holes {{at the end of}} the prongs to accept the <b>clevis</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> is similar to a bolt, but is only partially threaded or unthreaded with a cross-hole for a split pin. The tang is a piece that fits in the space within the clevis and is held in place by the <b>clevis</b> <b>pin.</b> [...] The combination of a simple clevis fitted with a pin is commonly called a shackle, although a clevis and pin is only one of the many forms a shackle may take.|$|E
5000|$|A bolt can {{function}} as a <b>clevis</b> <b>pin,</b> but a bolt {{is not intended to}} take the lateral stress that a <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> must handle. Normal bolts are manufactured to handle tension loads, whereas clevis pins and bolts are designed to withstand shearing forces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clevis</b> <b>pins</b> {{should be}} closely fitted to {{the holes in}} the clevis to limit wear and reduce the failure rate of either the <b>pin</b> or the <b>clevis.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Split pins are {{frequently}} used to secure other fasteners, e.g. <b>clevis</b> <b>pins,</b> {{as well as}} being used in combination with hardboard discs as a traditional joining technique for teddy bears. A common application of this is when used to secure a castellated nut.|$|R

50|$|Mousing (pronounced mouzing) is the {{application}} of a molly or safety wire, called mousing wire in this use, to secure a threaded <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> to a shackle. This is done by passing a couple of turns of mousing wire through the reach-hole provided for this purpose in the unthreaded end of the <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> and around the body of the shackle's hoop. Alternatively, some threaded shackles are provided with a hole through the threaded end of the pin beyond where it emerges from the threaded hole. A cotter pin or a couple of loops of mousing wire through this hole serves the same purpose and secures the shackle in a closed position. Nylon zip ties are also commonly used in applications where the shackle must be secured, but easy removal is required.|$|E
50|$|The {{boosters}} {{were composed}} of seven individually manufactured steel segments. These were assembled in pairs by the manufacturer, and then shipped to Kennedy Space Center by rail for final assembly. The segments were fixed together using circumferential tang, clevis, and <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> fastening, and sealed with three O-rings (two {{prior to the}} Challenger Disaster in 1986) and heat-resistant putty.|$|E
40|$|Scale-up {{studies were}} {{performed}} in which microwave heating {{was used to}} fabricate reaction-bonded silicon nitride and sintered reaction-bonded silicon nitride (SRBSN). Tests were performed in both a 2. 45 GHz, 500 liter and a 2. 45 GHz, 4, 000 liter multimode cavities. A variety of sizes, shapes, and compositions of silicon preforms were processed in the studies, including bucket tappets and <b>clevis</b> <b>pins</b> for diesel engines. Up to 230 samples were processed in a single microwave furnace run. Data were collected which included weight gains for nitridation experiments, and final densities for nitridation and sintering experiments. For comparison, nitridation and sintering studies were performed using a conventional resistance-heated furnace...|$|R
5000|$|R-clips are {{commonly}} used to secure the ends of round shafts such as axles and <b>clevis</b> <b>pins.</b> The straight leg of the R-clip is pushed into a hole near {{one end of the}} shaft until the semicircular [...] "belly" [...] {{in the middle of the}} other, bent leg of the R-clip grips one side of the shaft resisting any force removing the R-clip from its hole. To assist insertion the end of the bent leg is angled away from the straight leg. This angled end rides the side of the shaft and opens the [...] "belly" [...] mouth enough to pass the widest part of the shaft as the R-clip is inserted.|$|R

50|$|Higher voltage {{transmission}} lines usually use modular suspension insulator designs. The wires are suspended from a 'string' of identical disc-shaped insulators that attach {{to each other}} with metal <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> or ball and socket links. The advantage of this design is that insulator strings with different breakdown voltages, for use with different line voltages, can be constructed by using different numbers of the basic units. Also, {{if one of the}} insulator units in the string breaks, it can be replaced without discarding the entire string.|$|E
50|$|A shackle, {{also known}} as a gyve, is a U-shaped piece of metal secured with a <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> or bolt across the opening, or a hinged metal loop secured with a {{quick-release}} locking pin mechanism. The term also applies to handcuffs and other similarly conceived restraint devices that function in a similar manner. Shackles are the primary connecting link in all manner of rigging systems, from boats and ships to industrial crane rigging, as they allow different rigging subsets to be connected or disconnected quickly. A shackle is also the similarly shaped piece of metal used with a locking mechanism in padlocks.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} <b>pin</b> <b>clevis</b> joints, and more particularly, to zero play <b>pin</b> <b>clevis</b> joints for connecting structural members of a deployable space structure. A joint includes a pin, a tang, and a shackle. The pin is tapered at the same angle as the bores extending through the projections of the shackle and the tang. A spring washer biases the tang onto the tapered sidewall of the pin. The invention solves the free play problem associated with deployable space structures by using a tapered pin which is held in tapered holes by the spring washers...|$|R
50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, {{wobbling}} will not cause a ceiling fan to fall. Ceiling fans are secured by <b>clevis</b> <b>pins</b> locked with either split pins or R-clips, so wobbling won't {{have an effect}} on the fan's security, unless of course, the pins/clips were not secured. To date, there are no reports of a fan wobbling itself off the ceiling and falling. However, a severe wobble can cause light fixture shades or covers to gradually loosen over time and potentially fall, posing a risk of injury to anyone under the fan, and also from any resulting broken glass. It is also worth mentioning that when the MythBusters were designing a fan with the goal of chopping off someone's head, Scottie used an edge finder to find the exact center of their blades with the aim of eliminating potentially very dangerous wobbling of their steel blades. It is important that, when installing the fan, the installer closely follows the manufacturer's instructions with regard to using proper mounting screws. It is also important that all screws (especially the set screws which hold twist-on downrods in place) be tight, and any ceiling fan light fixtures are properly assembled with their shades and covers securely attached.|$|R
50|$|A clevis hanger {{consists}} of one U-shaped clevis {{and a second}} V-shaped clevis {{with a hole in}} a flattened section {{at the base of the}} V, joined together with a bolt or <b>pin.</b> <b>Clevis</b> hangers are used as a pipe attachment providing vertical adjustment for pipes.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of clevis pins: {{threaded}} and unthreaded. Unthreaded clevis pins have a domed head {{at one end and}} a cross-hole at the other end. A cotter pin (USA usage) or split pin is used to keep the <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> in place. Threaded clevis pins have a partially threaded shank on one end and a formed head on the other. The formed head has a lip, which acts as a stop when threading the pin into the shackle, and a flattened tab with a cross-hole. The flattened tab allows for easy installation of the pin and the cross-hole allows the pin to be moused.|$|E
5000|$|In sailing, pintles insert into {{gudgeons}} {{that are}} normally {{affixed to the}} transom of a boat. Normally, the corresponding pintle fitting on the rudder slides, lowers or clips into the gudgeon. There are variations where gudgeons are mounted to the rudder and boat, and a pivot <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> is inserted into these gudgeons, or the pintles are fastened to the boat, and gudgeons {{are attached to the}} rudder. In any case, the fitting with the hole is referred to as a gudgeon. They are used to attach the rudder to the boat so that it can swing freely. The rudder can then be turned with the tiller. There must be at least two gudgeon/pintle sets for stability in the rudder's attachment to the transom. The pintles must face the same direction for insertion into the gudgeons and usually one is a bit longer so it can be the first into its gudgeon, giving some stability for the insertion of the other pintle. To prevent the rudder from rising out of the gudgeons there is often some preventer such as rudder weight or a locking device slid across the path of the pintle's removal from the upper gudgeon (also referred to as a Rudder Stop).Really good installations (gudgeons) have bushings, (plain bearing) either a solid sleeve, flanged or clenched. This will allow for smoother operation of the helm and preserve the pintles and gudgeons. A bushing can be seen as [...] "consumable".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an analysis {{to predict the}} gap and contact pressure existence in segment joint used in Solid Rocket Boosters using 3 -D finite element (FE) as a general nonlinear problem. The relevant components, the tang, the <b>clevis</b> and <b>pin</b> are modeled individually and assembled. The FE modeling includes O-Rings as integral part of joint, which brings out the deformation of seals and contact pressure (CP) between O-Rings and the casings {{as a function of}} external loads. The general purpose FE package ABAQUS for analysis and HYPERMESH for pre- and post- processing are employed. The CP between the O-Rings and the slot walls in the joint depends very much on the material properties. The initial CP induced during assembly of segments is higher for lower ambient temperatures and lower for higher temperatures. Keywords: Contact Pressure, Segment joints, nonlinear, O-Ring...|$|R
40|$|Fabric-reinforced {{cementitious}} matrix (FRCM) composites made of dry-fiber fabric {{embedded in}} an inorganic matrix are advanced cement-based materials designed for retrofitting masonry or concrete structures. Characterization of the tensile behavior of FRCM composites provides the parameters {{needed for the}} design of the structural reinforcement and has given rise to numerous research studies on the aspects that influence its mechanical properties. To obtain the tensile behavior characteristics of this composite under different boundary conditions, two test setups were investigated. A <b>clevis</b> grip (<b>pin</b> action) was used to reproduce field boundary conditions from typical installation and to obtain design parameters. A clamping grip was used to obtain a complete characterization of the composite by inducing a tensile failure of each constituent material. Several FRCM systems made with different fabrics were used for the investigation: polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole (PBO), carbon (C), and glass (G), plus carbon and glass with a special protective coating. This paper offers a critical analysis of the experimental results and provides recommendations for the tensile characterization of FRCM material...|$|R

Intended to replace hydraulic actuator. Actuator rests on stand and imparts axial force to part attached to clevis inside or below stand. Technician turns control screw {{at one end}} of lever. Depending on direction of rotation of control screw, its end of lever driven downward (for compression) or upward (for tension). Lever pivots about <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> at end opposite of control screw; motion drives downward or upward link attached via shearpin at middle of lever. Link drives coupling and, through it, clevis attached to part loaded...|$|E
40|$|An {{aluminum}} platform {{serves as}} a storage shelf for experiments transported on the space shuttle. This platform {{is attached to the}} shuttle storage area through several supports, each consisting of an attachment fitting, a monoball bearing, a <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> and a support strut. The experiments must be temperature controlled during and after launch. Consequently, heat loss through the plate, attachment fitting, monoball bearing, and strut are important. The overall conductance of the monoball bearing was determined by an experimental method of heating the outer ring with a nichrome resistance wire and cooling the inner ball with propylene glycol. Temperature differences across the bearing were measured for various heat fluxes. The overall conductance is 0. 42 Watts/C (0. 80 BTU/hr F), This yields a 16 watt loss for a 38 C temperature difference across the bearing...|$|E
40|$|Figure 1 shows a {{prototype}} of a large pressure vessel under development for eventual use as a habitable module for long spaceflight (e. g., for transporting humans to Mars). The vessel is a hybrid that comprises an inflatable shell attached to a rigid central structural core. The inflatable shell is, itself, a hybrid that comprises (1) a pressure bladder restrained against expansion by (2) a web of straps made from high-strength polymeric fabrics. On Earth, pressure vessels like this could be used, for example, as portable habitats that could be set up quickly in remote locations, portable hyperbaric chambers for treatment of decompression sickness, or flotation devices for offshore platforms. In addition, {{some aspects of the}} design of the fabric straps could be adapted to such other items as lifting straps, parachute straps, and automotive safety belts. Figure 2 depicts selected aspects of the design of a vessel of this type with a toroidal configuration. The bladder serves as an impermeable layer to keep air within the pressure vessel and, for this purpose, is sealed to the central structural core. The web includes longitudinal and circumferential straps. To help maintain the proper shape upon inflation after storage, longitudinal and circumferential straps are indexed together at several of their intersections. Because the web is not required to provide a pressure seal and the bladder is not required to sustain structural loads, the bladder and the web can be optimized for their respective functions. Thus, the bladder can be sealed directly to the rigid core without having to include the web in the seal substructure, and the web can be designed for strength. The ends of the longitudinal straps are attached {{to the ends of the}} rigid structural core by means of clevises. Each <b>clevis</b> <b>pin</b> is surrounded by a roller, around which a longitudinal strap is wrapped to form a lap seam with itself. The roller is of a large diameter chosen to reduce bending of the fibers in the strap. The roller also serves to equalize the load in the portions of the strap on both sides of the <b>clevis</b> <b>pin.</b> The lap seam is formed near the clevis by use of a tapered diamond stitch: This stitch is designed specifically to allow fibers in the stitch and strap to relax under load in such a manner that the load becomes more nearly evenly distributed among all fibers in the stitch region. Thus, the tapered diamond stitch prevents load concentrations that could cause premature failure of the strap and thereby increases the strength of the strap/structural-core joint. The lap seam can be rated at > 90 percent of the strength of the strap material...|$|E
