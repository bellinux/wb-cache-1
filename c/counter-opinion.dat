In the {{thoughts}} of all three nations, the idea is precisely the same, and the word used for the idea by each nation therefore accurately translates {{the word of the}} other: [Greek: *eleupheria*]--libertas--franchise--reciprocally translate each other. Leonidas is characteristically [Greek: *eleupheros*] among Greeks; Publicola, characteristically liber, among Romans; Edward III. and the Black Prince, characteristically frank among French. And that common idea, which the words express, as all the careful scholars among you will know, is, with all the three nations, mainly of deliverance from the slavery of passion. To be [Greek: *eleupheros*], liber, or franc, is first to have learned how to rule our own passions; and then, certain that our own conduct is right, to persist in that conduct against all resistance, whether of <b>counter-opinion,</b> counter pain, or counter-pleasure. To be defiant alike of the mob's thought, of the adversary's threat, and the harlot's temptation,--this is in the meaning of every great nation to be free; and the one condition upon which that freedom can be obtained is pronounced to you in a single verse of the 119th Psalm, [...] "I will walk at liberty, for I seek Thy precepts." ...|$|E

This study uses primary data collected by interviews and secondary data gathered by studying document obtained from the official website of ALBA, financial institutions in Latin American countries as well as website for analysis about Latin America. The results showed that the presence of Sucre on the economy of Venezuela is less effective at improving economy of Venezuela. This is caused partly because ALBA is ineffective in promoting Sucre to all its member states and strong <b>counter-opinions</b> made by United States towards ALBA...|$|R

[...] He is said to have believed that Shakespeare was far superior to Goethe and Schiller. He had a copy of 's 1925 translation of Shakespeare's collected works. He was fond of quoting certain lines throughout his life. Copies of Goethe, Schiller, Dante, and Schopenhauer may have been destroyed by Allied bombing so {{there is no way of}} knowing for certain whether his collection was lacking. His collection is said to have included [...] "first editions of works by philosophers, historians, poets, playwrights, and novelists." [...] He owned illustrated copies of Don Quixote and Robinson Crusoe, which he ranked among Gulliver's Travels and Uncle Tom's Cabin as the great works of world literature. Hitler himself was a voracious reader: he claimed to read at least one book a night, if not more. He was also frequently given books as gifts by females of his acquaintance. [...] "The only outstanding classical literary text found in his library today is the collected writings of Kleist [...] " ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of the article is a {{standard}} cosmological model of the Universe. Contemporary opinion regarding origin, structure, and evolution of the Universe is of great interest. The {{answer to the question of}} the Universe origin is given by the Big Bang Theory. Is it possible to be sure in this theory correctness, which persuading of the Universe origination from the singularity fluctuation, when the World had appeared from nowhere, that is from abstract nothingness, further accelerated expansion of the Universe following the Big Bang, and its development up to present with inexplicable source of energy for that. However, in the extreme end of the meta-universe the speed of stellar formations runaway is about the light velocity. Further, there is a new problem, the finiteness of the Universe. There are two <b>counter-opinions,</b> if the expanding Universe is finite or infinite. A very important question arises here, the question regarding isolatedness of the Universe as a system. The problem of the Universe heat death (when the matter will stop its movement) is closely connected with it. For this reason it is the time to discuss the Universe entropy. There is a short description of notions and problems with reference to this branch of knowledge, as well as of Doppler and Ritz effects alongside with Habble Law. The authors’ detailed interpretation of an entropy is also suggested. The analysis of the existing model is followed by the idea of the authors about the Universe organization. The style of the article is popular-science. In the first part of the article the existing concept of the Expanding Universe Theory and the dynamical Friedmann-Lemaitre models are described; it deals with the existing concept of the Big Bang Theory as well as the dark energy and the dark matter notions. In the second part the author gives detailed interpretation of an entropy. In the last part the problem of theoretical basis and fact nonconformity within the Expanding Universe Model Theory and the authors’ idea about the Universe organization are considered...|$|R

40|$|Change in our {{language}} when deceiving {{is attributable to}} differences in the affective and cognitive experience of lying compared to truth telling, yet these experiences are also subject to substantial individual differences. On the basis of previous evidence of cultural differences in self-construal and remembering, we predicted and found evidence for cultural differences in {{the extent to which}} truths and lies contained self (versus other) references and perceptual (versus social) details. Participants (N = 320) of Black African, South Asian, White European and White British ethnicity completed a catch-the-liar task in which they provided genuine and fabricated statements about either their past experiences or an opinion and <b>counter-opinion.</b> Across the four groups we observed a trend for using more/fewer first-person pronouns and fewer/more third-person pronouns when lying, and a trend for including more/fewer perceptual details and fewer/more social details when lying. Contrary to predicted cultural differences in emotion expression, all participants showed more positive affect and less negative affect when lying. Our findings show that liars deceive in ways that are congruent with their cultural values and norms, and that this may result in opposing changes in behaviour...|$|E
