He {{has been a}} visiting {{professor}} or lecturer at Hebrew University of Jerusalem; National Police Academy (Tokyo); University of Tokyo; University of Buenos Aires; the Leiden University; and the University of Amsterdam. He was appointed counsel to numerous city, state, and federal commissions and special prosecutors investigating public corruption, including the Iran/Contra investigation, where among other responsibilities he briefed and argued the prosecution position in the appeal of Oliver North. He briefed and argued cases in federal appellate courts, including the Supreme Court, and as a cooperating attorney with the American and New York <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Unions.</b> He also has extensive experience as a defense attorney {{in state and federal}} cases.|$|R
2500|$|Reed was {{considered}} a moderate and often provided the critical fifth vote in split rulings. He authored more than 300 opinions, and Chief Justice Warren Burger said [...] "he wrote with clarity and firmness...." [...] Reed was an economic progressive, and generally supported racial desegregation, <b>civil</b> <b>liberties,</b> trade <b>union</b> rights and economic regulation. On free speech, national security and certain social issues, however, Reed was generally a conservative. He often approved of federal (but not state or local) restrictions on <b>civil</b> <b>liberties.</b> Reed also opposed applying the Bill of Rights to the states via the 14th Amendment.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} essay {{examines how}} {{a right to}} food has arisen from People’s <b>Union</b> for <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> v. <b>Union</b> of India & Others, an ongoing public interest litigation trial (PIL) in India. Examining the relative success of the “right to food case” in India enables {{an understanding of the}} conditions under which the judiciary serves as a viable pathway through which the poor may gain their right to food. I find that the differential success of the current Indian RTF case is due to a highly organized, broad-based social movement initiated by the RTF Campaign. This movement capitalized on and organized around legal opportunities for social and economic rights that arose in the late 1990 s in India. Through its varied tactics and its dynamic relationship with the Supreme Court, it has ensured a constant stream of court orders and their implementation at the regional level. I predict that the People’s <b>Union</b> for <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> v. <b>Union</b> of India & Others case has altered the judicial terrain and opened an even wider legal opportunity structure for the adjudication and realization of other social and economic rights in India. The case also signals the great influence that social movements may have on adjudication. Finally, the case points to new avenues for the “legalization of policy” and rights-based development...|$|R

In the letter, representatives for the NYCLU wrote that CityBridge could be retaining too much information about LinkNYC users.

50|$|On April, 2004 the Indian National Congress Party {{announced}} Sajjan Kumar, Jagdish Tytler, R. K.

5000|$|In April 2001, the People’s <b>Union</b> for <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> (PUCL) {{initiated}} {{the public interest}} litigation (Civil) No. 196/2001, People’s <b>Union</b> for <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> v. <b>Union</b> of India & Others - popularly known as the [...] "right to food" [...] case. The PUCL argued that article 21 - [...] "right to life" [...] of the Indian constitution when read together with articles 39(a) and 47, makes the right to food a derived fundamental right which is enforceable {{by virtue of the}} constitutional remedy provided under article 32 of the constitution. The PUCL argued that excess food stocks with the Food Corporation of India should be fed to hungry citizens. This included providing mid day meals in primary schools. The scheme came into force with the supreme court order dated 28 November 2001, which requires all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide cooked midday meals.|$|R

Bordaberry, at the time, had been a minor political figure; he exercised little independent standing as a successor to Pacheco other than being Pacheco's handpicked successor. He continued Pacheco's authoritarian methods, suspending <b>civil</b> <b>liberties,</b> banning labor <b>unions,</b> and imprisoning and killing opposition figures. He appointed military officers to most leading government positions.|$|R

We argue that the development and success of the PUCL litigation have depended in part on provisions of the Indian Constitution amenable to the incorporation and promotion of economic and social rights as well as on a unique relationship between civil society and judicial institutions. Analyzing the fulfillment of the right to rood in the Indian context, we argue that successes achieved by the case are directly attributable both to distinctive aspects of the Indian Constitution and to a unique interaction between civil society, the PUCL litigation, and the Commission appointed by the Supreme Court to monitor enforcement of PUCL interim orders...|$|R

50|$|The Hon’ble Supreme Court has {{upheld the}} {{constitutional}} validity of interceptions and monitoring under Section 5(2) of the Act through its order dated 18.12.1996 in Writ Petition (C) No.256/1991 by People’s <b>Union</b> for <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> (PUCL) Vs. <b>Union</b> of India. It has also {{observed that the}} right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of one’s home or office without interference can certainly be claimed as “Right to Privacy”, and accordingly, held that telephone tapping would infringe the Right to Life and Right to Freedom of Speech & Expression enshrined in Articles 21 and 19(1)(a) respectively of the Constitution of India, unless it is permitted under the procedure established by law. The Hon’ble Court further observed that Section 5(2) of the Act clearly provides that ‘occurrence of any public emergency’ or ‘interest of public safety’ is a sine qua non for the application of these provisions. Neither of these are secretive conditions or situations. Either of the situations would be apparent to a reasonable person.|$|R

5000|$|Under {{the close}} {{supervision}} of Senator John Little McClellan, the Chairman of the Committee {{for which he}} worked, Blakey drafted the [...] "RICO Act," [...] Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, {{signed into law by}} Richard M. Nixon. While in law school, Blakey edited a student note on the unsuccessful prosecution of attendees at the Apalachin Meeting, which first sparked his interest in organized crime; he also wrote a note that analyzed <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> in the <b>union</b> movement. In 1960, after law school, Blakey joined the United States Department of Justice under its Honor Program, and he became a Special Attorney in the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division of the Department. After Robert F. Kennedy became Attorney General, the Department began a major effort to bring criminal prosecutions against organized crime members, corrupt political figures, and faithless union officials. The Section assigned Blakey to the effort. He remained at Justice until 1964, leaving the summer after the November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy.|$|R
5|$|Legally, the ACLU {{consists}} of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations: the American <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union,</b> a 501(c)(4) social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity.

50|$|In New York City, {{political}} organizer Roger Nash Baldwin {{and attorney}} Albert DeSilver established the National <b>Civil</b> <b>LIberties</b> Bureau {{to coordinate the}} work of liberal and radical lawyers in the legal defense of this new class of American political criminals, who by 1918 numbered more than 1,500. This {{was not the only}} effort at coordinating legal defense efforts for the hundreds of members of Socialists, Wobblies, and conscientious objectors facing prosecution. Believing the <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> Bureau was not equal to the task of nationally organizing publicity and fundraising efforts on behalf of political prisoners, a stillborn effort called the <b>Liberty</b> Defense <b>Union</b> was made by IWW organizer Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.|$|R

5|$|After the {{revolution}} in Russia in 1917, the communist movement gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the First Red Scare of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US. In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even the American <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union</b> (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Pennsylvania law {{required}} that school students read Bible verses {{to start the}} day. The Abington School District added another requirement that the students read the Lord's Prayer. Several Unitarians in Abington, a suburb of Philadelphia, objected and held a protest against it. One of them, Ellery Schempp, contacted the American <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union</b> about the issue. The ACLU and Schempp's parents believed the school prayer law violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The ACLU's lawyers saw Sawyer as the best choice to argue it, given his skill as a litigator and his success in the Deutch case. Sawyer agreed and filed suit in federal district court.|$|E
5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union,</b> its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E
