50|$|JFJ’s newfound {{injection}} moulding capabilities, which were virtually unique {{at the time}} for a company of its size, led to a radical rethinking of its manufacturing activities. Its work became centred upon producing parts for the expanding television market such as <b>cable</b> <b>assemblies,</b> <b>connectors</b> and, most notably, set-top antennas. With this change of focus came a change of name and in 1952 the business began trading as the Panorama Radio Company.|$|R

40|$|Cathodic {{delamination}} failure {{is believed to}} be caused by the production of OH- at the polymer/metal interface via oxygen reduction reactions. In <b>cable</b> <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the use of manufacturing processes and materials that are resistant to cathodic {{delamination failure}}s is highly desirable. Also, {{there is a need for}} an accelerated testing regime for assessing the resistance of polymer-to-metal composites to cathodic delamination failures. <b>Cable</b> <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies</b> are employed in marine environments for structural terminations and circuit interconnection of electrical power and signal cabling systems. They are found on offshore sea beds, ROV’s, vessels and submarines and are prone to cathodic delamination related failures particularly when the <b>cable</b> <b>assemblies</b> are coupled to dissimilar metal appurtenances in seawater, e. g., zinc anodes. The resistance to cathodic delamination failures of selected metal substrates and polymeric materials used in the manufacture and sealing of <b>cable</b> <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies</b> have been investigated. Materials and methods of surface preparation by grit blasting to enhance polymer-to-metal adhesion, thus increasing the service life-time expectation of <b>cable</b> <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies</b> have been elucidated. Methods of accelerated testing of polymer/metal bond durability using salt spray test and the validation of the results in seawater immersion tests and potentiostatic experiments have been described. Also, a novel accelerated test chamber for cathodic delamination tests was designed and manufactured. Applied potential was observed to be the factor that had the most negative effect on test samples while silicon carbide grit was found to produce the most effective surface cleanliness and roughness combination required for durable polymer-to-metal bonds.

50|$|When used in {{relation}} to communications wiring, RS-422 wiring refers to cable made of 2 sets of twisted pair, often with each pair being shielded, and a ground wire. While a double pair cable may be practical for many RS-422 applications, the RS-422 specification only defines one signal path and does not assign any function to it. Any complete <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> with <b>connectors</b> should be labeled with the specification that defined the signal function and mechanical layout of the connector, such as RS-449.|$|R
50|$|Hybrid {{connectors}} have housings with inserts {{that allow}} the intermixing of many connector types, such as those mentioned above. These housings may also allow intermixing of electrical and non-electrical interfaces, examples of the latter being pneumatic line connectors, and optical fiber connectors. Because hybrid connectors are modular in nature, they tend to simplify assembly, repair, and future modifications. They also allow the creation of composite <b>cable</b> <b>assemblies</b> that can reduce equipment installation time by {{reducing the number of}} individual <b>cable</b> and <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|MIL-DTL-32139 {{describes}} nanominiature connectors [...] terminated on {{printed circuit}} boards or attached to <b>cable</b> <b>assemblies.</b> These <b>connector's</b> contacts are densely packed with 0.64 mm (0.025 inch) spacing between contact centers in the same row. These connectors are intended for interconnections on printed wiring board (PWB), PWB-to-cable, cable-to-panel, or cable-to-cable on miniaturized equipment sub-assemblies with low power requirements. The connectors are militarily unique because of requirements to operate satisfactorily under sinusoidal vibrations of 10-to-2000 Hz at up to 20 g’s, to withstand 48-hours of salt spray without exposure of base metals affecting performance or causing pitting/porosity of the finish; to withstand 100 g’s of shock with no electrical discontinuity; and to operate at temperatures of -55 to +125 degrees Celsius. The insert arrangements are provided in the associated specification sheets.|$|R
5000|$|Special [...] "octal" [...] {{connectors}} {{with either}} 8 or 11 pins, {{almost identical to}} octal relay sockets or tube sockets, were used to connect power supplies to some tube audio amplifiers, transmitters and tranceivers (especially in amateur radio models). Female sockets were installed on the power supply and male sockets (with exposed pins) on the radio equipment. <b>Cable</b> <b>assemblies</b> with mating <b>connectors</b> were also readily available. These connections transferred anode positive voltage (typically 600 VDC for Heathkit, 800 VDC for Collins), grid negative bias (-130 VDC), 6.3 and 12.6 VAC for heaters (filaments), and control functions (remote mains switching).|$|R
40|$|A {{process for}} making RF {{shielded}} <b>cable</b> <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{and the resulting}} structures is described. The process basically consists of potting wires of a shielded cable between the cable shield and a connector housing to fill in, support, regidize, and insulate the individual wires contained in the cable. The formed potting is coated with an electrically conductive material so as to form an entirely encompassing adhering conductive path between the cable shield and the metallic connector housing. A protective jacket is thereby formed over the conductive coating between the cable shield and the connector housing...|$|R

50|$|Field-mountable {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} {{are used to}} join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one singlemode fiber. These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies</b> and multiple-jointed <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies.</b> According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> is a <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> where {{there is only one}} spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies</b> are made from factory-assembled optical fiber connector plugs. A multiple-jointed <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> is a <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> where {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together.

50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> is the {{composition}} {{of one or more}} electrical cable(s) and one or more <b>connectors.</b> A <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> is not necessarily suitable for connecting two devices but can be a partial product (e.g. to be soldered onto a printed circuit board with one side, the connector mounted to the housing). <b>Cable</b> <b>assemblies</b> can also take the form of cable trees, used to connect many electrical components. In all cases the combination of the electrical cable and the connector determines the performance of the <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> as a whole.|$|R
40|$|The SLAC 2 -mile linear {{accelerator}} uses {{a wide variety}} of pulse kicker systems that require high voltage cable and connectors to deliver pulses from the drivers to the magnet loads.
