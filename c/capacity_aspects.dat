40|$|Policy {{options in}} some key areas will vary among {{countries}} depending on country capacity and burden. For this, understanding {{the relationship between}} the country-level noncommunicable disease (NCD) burden and country health system capacity is useful for tailoring the policy options developed from this framework and prioritizing efforts that align with country capacity. Thus, a general estimate of countrylevel burden and capacity and a map of their relationship was developed (Box A 4. 1). Using this capacity index score and mapping it with the percentage of the total country burden due to NCDs (in forgone disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]), a generally increasing capacity with increasing NCD burdens is seen as a distribution, relative to South Asia, of countries from lower burden/capacity to higher burden and higher capacity).

The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Six block combinations were implemented: block 1 (no-beef cattle integration), block 2 (1 -year beef cattle integration), block 3 (2 -year beef cattle integration), block 4 (3 -year beef cattle integration), block 5 (4 -year beef cattle integration), and block 6 (5 -year beef cattle integration). Spatial separated integration of beef cattle were implemented on the peanut and maize crop of dryland farming. A major advantage of the integrated system of crop and beef cattle is that nutrients from the wastes can be recycled efficiently on the farm. The results showed that there was an increase in productivity and efficiency of farm enterprises, as well as an increase in the environment carrying capacity. The impact of beef cattle integration was that, it improved the enterprises productivity (75 %) of dryland farming (during 5 years period) and created sustainable agriculture.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{medium access control}} {{protocol}} for ad hoc wireless networks called Synchronous Collision Resolution (SCR) 2. The protocol assumes that nodes in the network are synchronized, thus, nodes with data to send can contend simultaneously for the channel. Nodes contend for access using a synchronous signaling mechanism that achieves two objectives: it arbitrates contentions locally and it selects a subset of nodes across the network that attempt to transmit simultaneously. The subset of nodes that survive the signaling mechanism {{can be viewed as}} an orchestrated set of transmissions that are spatially reusing the channel shared by the nodes. Thus the ‘quality ’ of the subset of nodes selected by the signaling mechanism is a key factor in determining the spatial capacity of the system. In this paper, we propose a general model for such synchronous signaling mechanisms and recommend a preferred design. We then focus via both analysis and simulation on the spatial and capacity characteristics of these access control mechanisms. Our work is unique in that it specifically focuses on the spatial <b>capacity</b> <b>aspects</b> of a MAC protocol, as would be critical for ad hoc networking, and shows SCR is a promising solution. Specifically, it does not suffer from congestion collapse as the density of contending nodes grows, it does not suffer from hidden or exposed node effects, it achieves high capacities with a spatial usage exceeding 1 (i. e. more than one packet exchange in the area covered by a transmission), and it facilitates the integration of new physical layer capacity increasing technologies...|$|E

In particular, the limited existing capacity means that to guarantee {{an acceptable level}} of quality, the infrastructure manager must cancel some train services on the expense of others. In this article, we study the conflict between commercial long-distance trains and subsidized commuter trains with a socio-economic perspective (i. e. travelers and train operators). The study attempts {{to answer the following}} question: What is the socio-economic effect of modifying the timetable of a commuter service?The case study treats the commuter train services in Stockholm. Trip data was collected from the local commuter train operator. An entropy maximization-based model was implemented to estimate the dynamic network Origin-Destination (OD) matrix. This dynamic matrix, of one full working day, was then used to estimate the number of travelers per train, and further converted for use in the microscopic simulation tool RailSys. Travel and waiting time are estimated for each OD pair and with that the generalized costs for the travelers and operators. The effect of crowding in the trains is included in the estimation. The article can be considered as an initiation to a novel method to calculate effects of changes in commuter train timetables. This novel approach enables to price commercial train slots in the capacity allocation process such as in an auction. It provides a new way to estimate the local train operator´s valuation of the different parameters (i. e. waiting, travel time and interchanges).

This {{research}} project investigated {{the potential of}} African drumming to enhance the emotional and social well-being of children in residential care. Sixteen children from the Epworth Children’s Village in South Africa were purposively selected {{to participate in the}} study. The majority of participants had been exposed to some form of neglect and/or abuse and displayed high levels of anger, anxiety, depression and/or disruptive behaviour. Mixed in terms of gender and ethnicity, they fell within the middle childhood stage of development. The participants attended weekly sessions of African djembe drumming over a period of four months. Principles and practices of indigenous African music making formed the foundation of the drum circle facilitation approach used. Gestalt theory, as applied in Gestalt play therapy, provided the theoretical framework from which the therapeutic dimensions of African drumming were explored. A mixed methods approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection and analysis, was employed. For the quantitative component, participants completed the Beck Youth Inventories, measuring self-concept, anxiety, depression, anger and disruptive behaviour, before and after the project. Concerning the qualitative aspects, focused observations were conducted wherein all video-recorded workshops were regularly and systematically analysed to assess the children’s emotional and social functioning. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with relevant staff members and children, respectively, in an attempt to explore the value and feasibility of presenting such a programme within the residential care setting. According to the Inventories’ pre- and post-test results, the intervention did not appear to significantly impact upon the participants’ self-concept or levels of depression, anger or disruptive behaviour. Anxiety, on the other hand, increased. Qualitative findings nevertheless suggest that the workshops substantially enhanced the children’s emotional and social functioning, albeit only {{for the duration of the}} sessions. The workshops markedly improved participants’ self-esteem and self-confidence, pro-social behaviour, enjoyment, concentration and manifestation of musical <b>capacity</b> (<b>aspects</b> which reflect Gestalt concepts of awareness, contact, self-regulation, self-expression and mastery).

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the design of}} low-complexity coding schemes for wireless relay networks and multiple access channels. The {{first part of the}} thesis is on wireless relay networks and the second part is on multiple access channels. Distributed space-time coding is a well known technique to achieve spatial diversity in wireless networks wherein, several geographically separated nodes assist a source node to distributively transmit a space-time block code (STBC) to the destination. Such STBCs are referred to as Distributed STBCs (DSTBCs). In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we focus on designing full diversity DSTBCs with some nice properties which make them amenable for implementation in practice. Towards that end, a class of full diversity DST-BCs referred to as Co-ordinate Interleaved DSTBCs (CIDSTBCs) are proposed for relay networks with two-antenna relays. To construct CIDSTBCs, a technique called co-ordinate vector interleaving is introduced wherein, the received signals at different antennas of the relay are processed in a combined fashion. Compared to the schemes where the received signals at different antennas of the relay are processed independently, we show that CIDSTBCs provide coding gain which comes in with negligible increase in the processing complexity at the relays. Subsequently, we design single-symbol ML decodable (SSD) DSTBCs for relay networks with single-antenna nodes. In particular, two classes of SSD DSTBCs referred to as (i) Semi-orthogonal SSD Precoded DSTBCs and (ii) Training-Symbol Embedded (TSE) SSD DSTBCs are proposed. A detailed analysis on the maximal rate of such DSTBCs is presented and explicit DSTBCs achieving the maximal rate are proposed. It is shown that the proposed codes have higher rates than the existing SSD DSTBCs. In the second part, we study two-user Gaussian Multiple Access Channels (GMAC). Capacity regions of two-user GMAC are well known. Though, capacity regions of such channels provide insights into the achievable rate pairs in an information theoretic sense, they fail to provide information on the achievable rate pairs when we consider finitary restrictions on the input alphabets and analyze some real world practical signal constellations like QAM and PSK signal sets. Hence, we study the <b>capacity</b> <b>aspects</b> of two-user GMAC with finite input alphabets. In particular, Constellation Constrained (CC) capacity regions of two-user SISO-GMAC are computed for several orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access schemes (abbreviated as O-MA and NO-MA schemes respectively). It is first shown that NO-MA schemes strictly offer larger capacity regions than the O-MA schemes for finite input alphabets. Subsequently, for NO-MA schemes, code pairs based on Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) are proposed such that any rate pair on the CC capacity region can be approached. Finally, we consider a two-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) fading MAC and design STBC pairs such that ML decoding complexity is reduced...|$|E
