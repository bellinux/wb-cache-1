40|$|Urothelial {{carcinoma}} of the upper urinary tract is relatively uncommon but may develop {{as a manifestation of}} the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC), which is characterized by mutations in a number of DNA mismatch repair genes and detectable as microsatellite instability or loss of the respective protein by immunostaining. No well-established screening test is available for urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract, and little is known of the clinical impact of screening for HNPCC in patients with upper urinary tract cancer. We describe herein a patient with a urothelial {{carcinoma of}} the ureter and a strongly positive <b>history</b> <b>of</b> cancer, who was subsequently found to have HNPCC. Our findings reinforce the importance <b>of</b> obtaining a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> cancer in <b>patients</b> with urothelial {{carcinoma of the}} renal pelvis and ureter. Subsequent identification of individuals with HNPCC enables the patient and at-risk relatives to benefit from targeted surveillance and management programs...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Nocturnal sleep disturbances, {{including}} insomnia and recurrent nightmares, represent common distressing sleep {{complaints that}} might have important prognostic and therapeutic implications in psychiatric patients. The present study aimed at investigating nocturnal sleep disturbances {{in relation to the}} risk of suicide attempts in a consecutive cohort of psychiatric outpatients. Method: Participants attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic in Hong Kong were recruited into the study with a detailed sleep questionnaire assessment. The questionnaire was distributed between May and June 2006. Relevant clinical information, with a <b>comprehensive</b> clinical <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> since their attendance at psychiatric services and 1 year after completion of their questionnaires, was reviewed. Results: The final study population consisted of 1, 231 psychiatric outpatients {{with a mean age of}} 42. 5 years (SD = 11. 3; range, 18 - 65). Both frequent insomnia and recurrent nightmares were significantly and independently associated with an increased incidence of suicide attempts 1 year after questionnaire assessment (insomnia: OR = 6. 96; 95 % CI, 1. 21 - 39. 97; recurrent nightmares: OR = 8. 17; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 63. 13) and an increase in lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts (insomnia: OR = 1. 55; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 2. 25; recurrent nightmares: OR = 2. 43; 95 % CI, 1. 51 - 3. 91). Comorbid insomnia and nightmares had increased odds of lifetime prevalence (OR = 2. 43; 95 % CI, 1. 53 - 3. 85) and 1 -year incidence of suicidal risk (OR = 17. 08; 95 % CI, 2. 64 - 110. 40). Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR = 1. 52; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 2. 25), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (OR = 2. 10; 95 % CI, 1. 15 - 3. 83), heterocyclics (OR = 2. 78; 95 % CI, 1. 21 - 6. 42), and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (OR = 1. 54; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 2. 33) were independently associated with recurrent nightmares after adjustment for confounding variables. Conclusions: Nocturnal sleep disturbances, particularly frequent insomnia and recurrent nightmares, were independently associated with enhanced suicidal risk among psychiatric patients. Future studies are warranted to investigate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism and interventional responses. © Copyright 2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

40|$|Ubiquitous {{access to}} patient medical records is an {{important}} aspect <b>of</b> caring for <b>patient</b> safety. Unavailability <b>of</b> sufficient medical information at the point-ofcare could possibly lead to a fatality. The U. S. Institute of Medicine has reported that between 44, 000 and 98, 000 people die each year due to medical errors, such as incorrect medication dosages, due to poor legibility in manual records, or delays in consolidating needed information to discern the proper intervention. In this research we propose employing emergent technologies such as Java SIM Cards (JSC), Smart Phones (SP), Next Generation Networks (NGN), Near Field Communications (NFC), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and Biometric Identification to develop a secure framework and related protocols for ubiquitous access to Electronic Health Records (EHR). A partial EHR contained within a JSC can be used at the point-of-care {{in order to help}} quick diagnosis <b>of</b> a <b>patient’s</b> problems. The full EHR can be accessed from an Electronic Health Records Centre (EHRC) when time and network availability permit. Moreover, this framework and related protocols enable patients to give their explicit consent to a doctor to access their personal medical data, by using their Smart Phone, when the doctor needs to see or update the patient’s medical information during an examination. Also our proposed solution would give the power to patients to modify the Access Control List (ACL) related to their EHRs and view their EHRs through their Smart Phone. Currently, very limited research has been done on using JSCs and similar technologies as a portable repository of EHRs or on the specific security issues that are likely to arise when JSCs are used with ubiquitous access to EHRs. Previous research is concerned with using Medicare cards, a kind of Smart Card, as a repository of medical information at the patient point-of-care. However, this imposes some limitations on the patient’s emergency medical care, including the inability to detect the patient’s location, to call and send information to an emergency room automatically, and to interact with the patient in order to get consent. The aim of our framework and related protocols is to overcome these limitations by taking advantage of the SIM card and the technologies mentioned above. Briefly, our framework and related protocols will offer the full benefits of accessing an up-to-date, precise, and <b>comprehensive</b> medical <b>history</b> <b>of</b> a <b>patient,</b> whilst its mobility will provide ubiquitous access to medical and patient information everywhere it is needed. The objective of our framework and related protocols is to automate interactions between patients, healthcare providers and insurance organisations, increase patient safety, improve quality of care, and reduce the costs...|$|R
