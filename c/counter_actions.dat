40|$|This study {{offers an}} {{explanation}} of a recently observed effect of destabilization of free convective flows by weak rotation. After studying several models where flows are driven by a simultaneous action of convection and rotation, it is concluded that the destabilization is observed in the cases where centrifugal force acts against main convective circulation. At relatively low Prandtl numbers this <b>counter</b> <b>action</b> can split the main vortex into two counter rotating vortices, where the interaction leads to instability. At larger Prandtl numbers, the <b>counter</b> <b>action</b> of the centrifugal force steepens an unstable thermal stratification, which triggers Rayleigh-Bénard instability mechanism. Both cases can be enhanced by advection of azimuthal velocity disturbances towards the axis, where they grow and excite perturbations of the radial velocity. The effect was studied considering a combined convective/rotating flow in a cylinder with a rotating lid and a parabolic temperature profile at the sidewall. Next, explanations of the destabilization effect for rotating magnetic field driven flow and melt flow in a Czochralski crystal growth model were derived...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{a technique called}} Adaptive Inverter Chain Based Clock Scheduling, which can observe and compensate delay variations in pipelined structures. The main idea behind the method is to expose the data and the clock to the same variations such that the register data sampling process is not disturbed by variations. The proposed scheme also includes a mechanism to detect time failures and to take <b>counter</b> <b>actions</b> to recover from such situations. When compared with other {{state of the art}} proposals, which require the augmentation of the registers, our proposal requires a relative smaller area overhead {{due to the fact that}} it is focussed on clock and not on data. Moreover our simulations indicate that, depending on the specific delay variations and pipeline logic delay sensitivity to input data patterns, it can enable an up to 46 % performance improvement.

We primarily focus on developing schemes to locate free riders and on determining policies {{that can be used}} to take actions against them. We propose a model in which each peer monitors its neighboring peers, makes decisions if they exhibit any kind of free-riding, and takes appropriate actions if required. We specify three types of free riding and their symptoms observable from the activities of the neighboring peers. We employ sim-ple formulas to determine if a peer exhibits any kind of free riding. The <b>counter</b> <b>actions</b> to be applied to the free riders are dened.
