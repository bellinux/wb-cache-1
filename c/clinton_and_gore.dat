25|$|Incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton was ineligible {{to serve}} a third term due to term {{limitations}} in the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution, and Vice President Gore was able to secure the Democratic nomination with relative ease. Bush {{was seen as the}} early favorite for the Republican nomination and, despite a contentious primary battle with Senator John McCain and other candidates, secured the nomination by Super Tuesday. Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his. Both major party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> often did not campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from the Lewinsky sex scandal two years prior.|$|E

Clinton committed himself to regular lunch meetings, recognized Gore as a principal adviser on nominations, and appointed some of Gore's chief advisers to key White House staff positions.

Through their weekly lunches and daily conversations, Gore became the president's [...] "indisputable chief adviser".|$|E
500|$|According to Leslie Budd, {{author of}} E-economy: Rhetoric or Business Reality, this {{economic}} success was due, in part, to Gore's continued {{role as an}} Atari Democrat, promoting the development of information technology, {{which led to the}} dot-com boom (c. 1995–2001). <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> entered office planning to finance research that would [...] "flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry."

500|$|After the 1992 presidential election, Browner {{served as}} {{transition}} director for Vice President-elect Gore. [...] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992. [...] While both <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign, {{the selection of}} Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having [...] "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" [...] – {{was seen as an}} indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset. [...] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named. [...] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration. [...] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore. [...] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, the Capitol Steps {{performed}} at the White House for <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore.</b> After the Lewinsky scandal became public they were not invited to perform at the White House again, since their humor (like that of most American comedians of the time) focused on the allegations of Clinton's womanizing and coverups.

2500|$|These {{initiatives}} {{were discussed}} {{in a number}} of venues. Howard Rheingold argued in the 1994 afterword to his noted text, The Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier, that these initiatives {{played a critical role in}} the development of digital technology, stating that, [...] "Two powerful forces drove the rapid emergence of the superhighway notion in 1994 [...] The second driving force behind the superhighway idea continued to be Vice-President Gore." [...] In addition, <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> submitted the report, Science in the National Interest in 1994, which further outlined their plans to develop science and technology in the United States.

2500|$|Gore had {{a chance}} to fulfill this promise when he and President Clinton participated in John Gage's NetDay'96 on March 9, 1996. <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> spent the day at Ygnacio Valley High School, as part of the drive to connect California public schools to the Internet. In a speech given at YVH, Clinton stated that he was excited to see that his {{challenge}} the previous September to [...] "Californians to connect at least 20 percent of your schools to the Information Superhighway {{by the end of this}} school year" [...] was met. Clinton also described this event as part of a time of [...] "absolutely astonishing transformation; a moment of great possibility. All of you know that the information and technology explosion will offer to you and to the young people of the future more opportunities and challenges than any generation of Americans has ever seen." [...] In a prepared statement, Gore added that NetDay was part of one of the major goals of the Clinton administration, which was [...] "to give every child in America access to high quality educational technology by the dawn of the new century." [...] Gore also stated that the administration planned [...] "to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2000."

[...] They planned to finance research [...] "that will flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry."

2500|$|After the convention, <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> began a {{bus tour}} around the United States, while the Bush/Quayle {{campaign}} began to criticize Clinton's character, highlighting accusations of infidelity and draft dodging. The Bush campaign emphasized {{its foreign policy}} successes such as Desert Storm, {{and the end of}} the Cold War. Bush also contrasted his military service to Clinton's lack thereof, and criticized Clinton's lack of foreign policy expertise. However, as the economy was the main issue, Bush's campaign floundered across the nation, even in strongly Republican areas, and Clinton maintained leads with over 50 percent of the vote nationwide consistently, while Bush typically saw numbers in the upper 30s. As Bush's economic edge had evaporated, his campaign looked to energize its socially conservative base at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. At the Convention, Bush's primary campaign opponent Pat Buchanan gave his famous [...] "culture war" [...] speech, criticizing Clinton's and Gore's social progressiveness, and voicing skepticism on his [...] "New Democrat" [...] brand. After President Bush accepted his renomination, his campaign saw a small bounce in the polls, but this was short lived, as Clinton maintained his lead. The campaign continued with a lopsided lead for Clinton through September, until Ross Perot decided to re-enter the race. Ross Perot's re-entry in the race was welcome by the Bush campaign, as Fred Steeper, a poll taker for Bush, said, [...] "He'll be important if we accomplish our goal, which is to draw even with Clinton." [...] Initially, Perot's return saw the Texas billionaire's numbers stay low, until he was given the opportunity to participate in a trio of unprecedented three-man debates. The race narrowed, as Perot's numbers significantly improved as Clinton's numbers declined, while Bush's numbers remained more or less the same from earlier in the race as Perot and Bush began to hammer at Clinton on character issues once again.|$|E
