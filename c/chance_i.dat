25|$|While in Paris, Kelly had {{continued}} to paint the figure but by May 1949, {{he made his first}} abstract paintings. Observing how light dispersed on the surface of water, he painted Seine (1950), made of black and white rectangles arranged by chance. In 1951 he started a series of eight collages titled Spectrum Colors Arranged by <b>Chance</b> <b>I</b> to VIII. He created it by using numbered slips of paper; each referred to a colour, one of eighteen different hues to be placed on a grid 40 inches by 40 inches. Each of the eight collages employed a different process.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a <b>chance.</b> <b>I</b> will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

After the assassination, actor Frank Mordaunt wrote that Lincoln admired Booth, whom Lincoln had repeatedly invited (without success) {{to visit the}} White House. Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, writing in his diary afterwards: [...] "What an excellent <b>chance</b> <b>I</b> had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{relative}} antiquity by 1970, the song's lyrics lent themselves {{well to the}} themes of spiritual salvation and friendship that define All Things Must Pass, being consistent with the karmic subject matter {{of much of the}} album. In his 1980 autobiography, Harrison explains: [...] "'Isn't It a Pity' is about whenever a relationship hits a down point... It was a chance to realise that if I felt somebody had let me down, then there's a good <b>chance</b> <b>I</b> was letting someone else down." [...] His lyrics adopt a nonjudgmental tone throughout: ...|$|E

The catch exceeded the then-previous record of three pounds, six ounces made on the same size tippet back in 1986. LeMond confessed, [...] "I always pack my fly fishing equipment when I travel to bike events. I fish every <b>chance</b> <b>I</b> get." ...|$|E

500|$|Eliza, a {{homemaker}} and a devout Baptist, struggled {{to maintain a}} semblance of stability at home, as Bill was frequently gone for extended periods. She also put up with his philandering and his double life, which included bigamy. Thrifty by nature and necessity, she taught her son that [...] "willful waste makes woeful want". John did {{his share of the}} regular household chores and earned extra money raising turkeys, selling potatoes and candy, and eventually lending small sums of money to neighbors. He followed his father's advice to [...] "trade dishes for platters" [...] and always get the better part of any deal. Bill once bragged, [...] "I cheat my boys every <b>chance</b> <b>I</b> get.

The song reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 on February 27, 2009. Overall, eight songs from the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100, including [...] "56 Bars (Intro)", [...] "I'm Illy" [...] and [...] "My Life Your Entertainment", despite not being singles.

500|$|For the Test {{series against}} Pakistan, Trescothick {{was offered the}} {{captaincy}} once more due to an injury to Vaughan. He was unsure whether to accept but realised that as [...] "unofficial second in command...I believe {{it was the right}} thing to step up. It is exciting to think I could be in charge for a few weeks...I know there is a <b>chance</b> <b>I</b> maybe won't be a one-match wonder this time – it could be the whole series, but being very close to Michael, I've seen the things it [...] does to you." [...] As it transpired, Trescothick scored 193 in the first innings (although England lost the match), and Vaughan returned for the second Test. Trescothick had considered leaving the tour early when his father-in-law had a serious accident, but stayed in Pakistan as fellow opener Andrew Strauss returned home to attend the birth of his first child.|$|E

[...] In October 2008, 20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman said [...] "a Daredevil reboot is something we are thinking very seriously about." [...] Rothman added that [...] "what it really needs is, it needs a visionary at the level that Chris Nolan was. It needs someone, it needs a director, honestly, who has a genuine vision." [...] By February 2010, 20th Century Fox and New Regency were looking to develop the reboot with News Corp., with Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script. On March 15, 2011, it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot, [...] but he later had to drop out due to other obligations.

500|$|The band {{formed in}} Dublin on 25 September 1976. [...] Larry Mullen Jr., then a 14-year-old student at Mount Temple Comprehensive School, posted {{a note on}} the school's notice board in search of musicians for a new band—six people responded. Setting up in his kitchen, Mullen was on drums, with Paul Hewson ("Bono") on lead vocals; David Evans ("the Edge") and his older brother Dik Evans on guitar; Adam Clayton, a friend of the Evans {{brothers}} on bass guitar; and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen. Mullen later described it as [...] "'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any <b>chance</b> <b>I</b> had of being in charge." [...] Martin, who had brought his guitar and amplifier to the first practice but could not play, did not remain with the group, and McCormick was dropped within a few weeks. The group settled on the name [...] "Feedback" [...] because {{it was one of the}} few technical terms they knew. Most of their initial material consisted of cover songs, which the band admitted was not their forte. Some of the earliest influences on the band were emerging punk rock acts, such as the Jam, the Clash, Buzzcocks, and Sex Pistols. The popularity of punk rock convinced the group that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to success.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again". In an {{interview}} with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album [...] "sound more personal than {{they might have been}} a few years ago", and she responded by saying [...] "Some of that could be just <b>chance!</b> <b>I</b> wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. Maybe people know me better now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right". The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, [...] "Chocolate" [...] is [...] "packed with saccharine innuendo". [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing. Ballads like [...] "Obsession" [...] deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship.|$|E

2500|$|... "Alan Jones {{made sure}} we practised the basics, {{but he did}} not tell us how toplay. What he did do was make us believe we were the best in the world. As a tactician, one of Jones' strong points was his ability to spot {{opposition}} weaknesses. Before we played Wales in 1984, he suggested we play the blinds. He had noticed the Welsh No. 8 Eddie Butler, had not played for three weeks and he had a hunch he would not be fit. So the first <b>chance</b> <b>I</b> got I went down the blind side and from that we scored under the posts." ...|$|E
