40|$|The cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway in Hevea brasiliensis latex is the {{conventionally}} accepted pathway {{which provides}} isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) for <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> (rubber) biosynthesis. However, the plastidic 2 -C-methyl-D-erythritol 4 -phosphate (MEP) pathway {{may be an}} alternative source of IPP since its more recent discovery in plants. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) expression profiles of genes from both pathways in latex showed that subcellular compartmentalization of IPP for <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> synthesis {{is related to the}} degree of plastidic carotenoid synthesis. From this, the occurrence of two schemes of IPP partitioning and utilization within one species is proposed whereby the supply of IPP for <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> from the MEP pathway is related to carotenoid production in latex. Subsequently, a set of latex unique gene transcripts was sequenced and assembled and they were then mapped to IPP-requiring pathways. Up to eight such pathways, including <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> biosynthesis, were identified.

40|$|Natural rubber {{from the}} {{para rubber tree}} Hevea brasiliensis is one of world’s most {{important}} natural resources. Despite its use {{in the manufacture of}} a wide range of essential items the mechanisms by which natural rubber is synthesised is poorly understood. Natural rubber is a long chain <b>cis-polyisoprene,</b> composed of units of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) which is contained within rubber particles. Rubber particles consist of a hydrophobic polyisoprene interior surrounded by a monolayer membrane. Due to the insoluble nature of rubber the only place that polymerisation could occur is on this membrane by a hypothetical membrane bound rubber transferase. Whether this is a single enzyme or complex is currently unknown. Cis-prenyltransferases (CPTs) are a group of enzymes responsible for the polymerisation of <b>cis-polyisoprene.</b> The first plant CPTs were identified in Arabidopsis which paved the way for the identification of two Hevea CPTs, HRT 1 and HRT 2. HRT 2 is able catalyse the formation of long chain polyisoprene products in the presence of rubber particles and is the focus of this thesis. Hevea takes at least 4 years to reach maturity. Its long life cycle coupled with the difficulty of genetic transformation meant that direct study on Hevea was not feasible for this project. Instead transient expression in N. benthamiana as well as some preliminary work in L. sativa was used to characterise rubber associated proteins. HRT 2 was found to be a cytosolic protein and in theory incapable of polymerising natural rubber on the surface of rubber particles. The scope of the project was therefore widened to include possible interactors that could act to bring it to a membrane. These interactors were identified and cloned based on existing literature and included small rubber particle protein (SRPP), rubber elongation factor (REF), rubber biosynthesis stimulator protein (RBSP) and a newly characterised cis-prenyltransferase like (CPTL) protein, HevNogo. Whilst HRT 2 on its own was unable to associate with a membrane, expression with HevNogo induced its subsequent localisation to the plasma membrane. This interaction initially took place on the endoplasmic reticulum. The HRT 2 /HevNogo complex may be part of a rubber transferase complex, however it is likely that additional components are required. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: For type-A polymer chains having type-A dipoles {{parallel}} {{along the}} chain backbone (such as <b>cis-polyisoprene),</b> a theoretical {{analysis was conducted}} for the rheodielectric response to relate this response to the chain dynamics. The rheodielec-tric response in the shear gradient direction (y direction) under steady shear was an-alyzed {{on the basis of}} a Langevin equation. It turned out that the relaxation time is exactly the same for the rheodielectric relaxation function and the end-to-end vector autocorrelation function defined in the shear gradient direction and that the relaxa-tion mode distribution also coincides for these functions at least up to second order of the shear rate (corresponding to the lowest order of nonlinearities of these functions). Consequently, the Green-Kubo theorem holds satisfactorily, and the rheodielectric in-tensity is proportional to the squared chain size in y direction, hR 2 yi, averaged over the time-independent conformational distribution function under steady shear. The situation is more complicated under large amplitude oscillatory strain (LAOS) because the conformational distribution function fLAOS is synchronized with LAOS to oscillate at the LAOS frequency, X.

40|$|For {{miscible}} blends of moderately entangled <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> (PI) and poly(p-tert-butyl styrene) (PtBS), viscoelastic and {{dielectric properties}} were examined {{over a wide}} range of temperature (T) to discuss the thermo–rheological behavior of respective components. Because PI has the type-A dipole, whereas PtBS does not, the slow dielectric response of the blends was exclusively attributed to the global motion of the PI chains therein. In most of the blends examined, the viscoelastic relaxation was much slower than the dielectric relaxation, and PI and PtBS behaved as the fast and much slower components, respectively. In those blends, the PI relaxation was thermo–rheologically complex because the slow PtBS chains quenched the dynamic frictional heterogeneity in the time scale of the PI relaxation. In contrast, the viscoelastic response of PtBS was thermo–rheologically simple because the fast PI chains smeared the heterogeneity for PtBS. Nevertheless, PtBS showed no ordinary relaxation associated with the entanglement plateau but did exhibit Rouse-like relaxation slower than the entanglement-free Rouse process. This slow Rouse-like relaxation was attributed to the pseudo-constraint release mechanism for the PtBS chains activated by the global motion of the PI chains.

40|$|The Kremer-Grest (KG) bead-spring {{model is}} a near {{standard}} in Molecular Dynamic simulations of generic polymer properties. It owes its popularity to its computational efficiency, rather than its ability to represent specific polymer species and conditions. Here we investigate how to adapt the model to match the universal properties {{of a wide range}} of chemical polymers species. For this purpose we vary a single parameter originally introduced by Faller and Müller-Plathe, the chain stiffness. Examples include polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, <b>cis-polyisoprene,</b> polydimethylsiloxane, polyethyleneoxide and styrene-butadiene rubber. We do this by matching the number of Kuhn segments per chain and the number of Kuhn segments per cubic Kuhn volume for the polymer species and for the Kremer-Grest model. We also derive mapping relations for converting KG model units back to physical units, in particular we obtain the entanglement time for the KG model as function of stiffness allowing for a time mapping. To test these relations, we generate large equilibrated well entangled polymer melts, and measure the entanglement moduli using a static primitive-path analysis of the entangled melt structure as well as by simulations of step-strain deformation of the model melts.

Macromolecules 2004, 37, 6619] {{in order to}} test the validity of the dynamic tube dilution (DTD) picture and to determine the most appropriate value of the dilution exponent α. We conclude that the DTD picture with α = 1 is more appropriate at short times, while at longer time, a larger exponent of α = 4 / 3 gives a better description of the experiments. Furthermore, between these two time regions, a broad crossover zone is found, going from an effective α = 1 to an effective α = 4 / 3. On the basis of this result, we propose to consider a new relaxation process, which is combined with the classical DTD picture with α = 1 to give the experimentally observed effective α = 4 / 3 at long times. This extra relaxation process results from the tension equilibration along the long chains, which takes place thanks to the blinking feature of release/reformation of the long-short entanglements and leads to a partial disorientation of the primitive path itself within the dilated tube. We have formulated the relaxation function considering this tension equilibration and demonstrated its validity for description of the experiments in the entire range of time. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E

The Lennard-Jones 12 - 6 potential was implemented to describe the polymer–silica interactions. The thickness H of the produced PI–silica film has been varied in a wide range, 1 2 ̆ 6 lt;H/R g 2 ̆ 6 lt; 8, where R g is the individual PI chain radius of gyration measured under the imposed confinement. After a thorough equilibration, the PI film stratified structure and polymer segmental dynamics have been studied.

Tremendous slowing down of the polymer segmental dynamics has been observed in the film surface layers, with the segmental relaxation more than 150 times slower as compared to that in a PI bulk. This effect increases with decreasing the polymer-film thickness. The segmental relaxation in the PI film middles shows additional relaxation process which is absent in a PI bulk.

Based on a preliminary selection from among more than 960 accessions, {{the aim of this}} work was to propose new SALB-resistant genotypes for South Americanplantations. Agronomic traits (SALB resistance, growth, production) and characters related to latex pro-duction, such as sucrose and inorganic phosphorus, along with structural traits of the bark of nine Heveagenotypes resistant to SALB (TP 875, FDR 5788, MDX 608, PMB 1, CDC 429, CDC 312, FDR 4461, MDF 180,SIAL 893) were evaluated {{during the course of a}} 12 -year trial located in the Michelin plantation (Bahia,Brazil). These genotypes presented a quantitative resistance to SALB characterized by partially sporu-lating lesions (anomorph stage). No sexual form of M. ulei (stromata, teleomorph stage) was found inFDR 5788, MDF 180, CDC 312, PMB 1. Only FDR 5788 genotypes presented a higher NR yield than genotypeTP 875 used as a control. For FDR 5788, MDX 608, CDC 312 and PMB 1, the estimated yields of 12 -year-oldtrees were, respectively 2. 6, 2. 0, 1. 8 and 1. 2 t year? 1 ha? 1. In all genotypes, medium sucrose and inorganicphosphorus concentrations were related to intermediate metabolism for <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> synthesis. Thelow yield of genotypes SIAL 893 and MDF 180 is related to the limited number of vessel rings, limitedtranslocation of sucrose in the latex, and a slow metabolism indicated by low average concentrations ofinorganic phosphorus in the latex.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We use {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to examine the}} dielectric relaxation of polar macromolecules with dipoles parallel to the chain backbone. Analysis of the simulation trajectories closely follows the treatment of Watanabe and co-workers for experimental results of dipole-inverted <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> solutions (Macromolecules 1995, 28, 6443). The important observable quantity in experiments and simulations is the dielectric loss spectrum ′′(ö), whose shape reflects the distribution of relaxation processes for the global chain motion. The observed broadening of the spectra with increasing polymer concentration, classically attributed to overlapping of the chains, is analyzed quantitatively using a local correlation function C(n,t;m)) 1 /a 2 〈u(n,t) âu(m, 0) 〉, where u(n,t) is the bond vector of the nth segment of the chain at time t, and a 2) 〈u 2 〉. At long times, C(n,t;m) can be expanded as a sum of its eigenmodes: C(n,t;m)) 2 /N∑p) 1 n fp(n) fp(m) exp(-t/ôp), where N {{is the size of}} the chain and ôp and fp are the relaxation time and the eigenfunction of the pth mode. From simulations we calculate the time correlation functions and dielectric loss spectra of multi-inverted and asymmetrically inverted polar polymers. We compute the relaxation times ôp and the eigenfunctions of C(t,n;m). The relaxation times follow a power-law dependence ôp ∝ p-ç, with ç = 2. 08, and the ratios ôp/ô 1 remain independent of the concentration, a behavior predicted by the Rouse model. On the other hand, the dependence of fp on n deviates progressively with increasing density from the Rouse model sinusoidal prediction. The results reveal that the broadening of the spectra is a result of changes in the distribution of eigenmodes (fp), and not in the relaxation time span ç. Our findings are consistent with the experimental observations, clearly demonstrating the adequacy of simulations for investigating the dynamic behavior of macromolecular systems. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{thin-film}} dielectric {{response of}} organic films confined within a surface forces apparatus (SFA) and also between parallel sheets of atomically smooth mica is {{reported for the}} first time. Analysis is presented to infer dielectric properties of the organic film from the measured capacitance of the total system: sample, and mica sheets intervening between sample and electrodes. Measurements concerned the frequency dependence of normal-mode dielectric relaxation of <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> having dipoles aligned {{in the same direction}} along the chain backbone. We find that in thin-film geometries the peak frequency, f(peak), of normal mode dielectric loss (epsilon") is moderately lower than for bulk samples and that, more important, the expected terminal tail, observed in the bulk sample (epsilon"proportional to f for f < f(peak)), is not observed even at the lowest frequency examined. Thus the slow normal mode distribution is much broader and the terminal relaxation time is much longer for chains in the thin layers. These dielectric features are attributed to spatial constraints on global chain motion in the thin layers and also to adsorption of chains on mica surfaces when the layer thickness is comparable to the unperturbed chain dimension. Independent measurements of shear relaxation, performed using a SFA modified for measurement of dynamical mechanical shear rheology, found a tremendously retarded viscoelastic response relative to bulk samples. There is the possibility that the broad distribution of the dielectric response of individual polymer chains may correspond to the observed retarded viscoelastic relaxation. However, we cannot rule out the other possibility that the dielectrically detected relaxation of individual chains is still faster than the terminal viscoelastic relaxation and that the latter thus corresponds to the collective motion of many confined chains. open 333...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis and {{incorporation}} of functionalized materials continues to generate significant research interest in academia and in industry. If chosen correctly, a functional group when {{incorporated into a}} polymer can deliver enhanced properties, such as adhesion, water solubility, thermal stability, etc. The utility of these new materials has been demonstrated in drug-delivery systems, coatings, membranes and compatibilizers. Two approaches exist to functionalize a material. The desired moiety {{can be added to}} the monomer either before or after polymerization. The polymers used range from low glass transition temperature elastomers to high glass transition temperature, high performance materials. One industrial example of the first approach is the synthesis of Teflon(reg. sign). Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE or Teflon(reg. sign)) is synthesized from tetrafluoroethylene, a functionalized monomer. The resulting material has significant property differences from the parent, poly(ethylene). Due to the fluorine in the polymer, PTFE has excellent solvent and heat resistance, a low surface energy and a low coefficient of friction. This allows the material to be used in high temperature applications where the surface needs to be nonabrasive and nonstick. This material has a wide spread use in the cooking industry because it allows for ease of cooking and cleaning as a nonstick coating on cookware. One of the best examples of the second approach, functionalization after polymerization, is the vulcanization process used to make tires. Natural rubber (from the Hevea brasiliensis) has a very low glass transition temperature, is very tacky and would not be useful to make tires without synthetic alteration. Goodyear's invention was the vulcanization of polyisoprene by crosslinking the material with sulfur to create a rubber that was tough enough to withstand the elements of weather and road conditions.

40|$|For an {{entangled}} Cayley-tree-type <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> (CT-PI) {{composed of}} two classes of arms, trifunctionally branched inner arms each carrying two outer arms (Mi = 24. 7 × 103 and Mo = 12. 3 × 103 for each inner and outer arm, respectively), the molecular picture of dynamic tube dilation (DTD) was examined through viscoelastic and dielectric data. The global motion of the arms was dielectrically active because they had the so-called type A dipole parallel along their backbone. The dielectric relaxation function Φ(t) thus measured for CT-PI enabled us to experimentally evaluate the survival fraction of the dilated tube φ′(t), a key quantity in the DTD picture. In the conventional picture of full-DTD, relaxed portions of the arms are regarded as a simple solvent, thereby allowing the number of mutually equilibrated entanglement segments per dilated segment, β(t), to fully increase {{to that in a}} corresponding solution, βf-DTD(t) = {φ′(t) }−d with d = 1. 3 for PI. The corresponding full-DTD relationship between φ′(t) and the normalized viscoelastic relaxation function μ(t), μf-DTD(t) = {φ′(t) } 1 +d, did not hold for the φ′(t) and μ(t) data of CT-PI. In contrast, in the molecular picture of partial-DTD, β(t) is determined through competition of the constraint release (CR) motion of the focused chain and the motion of surrounding chains, the former determining the maximum possible βCR(t) value in a given time scale, t. In this picture, the length and time scales are consistently coarse-grained {{on the basis of the}} CR mechanism. The partial-DTD relationship, μp-DTD(t) = φ′(t) /β*(t) with β*(t) = min[βf-DTD(t), βCR(t) ], was found to hold for the φ′(t) and μ(t) data satisfactorily. In addition, analysis of the φ′(t) data unequivocally indicated that the inner arm hardly relaxed until the outer arm relaxation completed; i. e., the hierarchical relaxation occurred through partial-DTD. These results suggested the importance of the consistent coarse graining in molecular description of the dynamics of branched chains in general...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} {{energy and the}} entropy components of the elastic restoring force in rubbers were determined for natural rubber up to an extension ratio of about 3. 0. Four different experimental measurements were necessary to determine these components: (1) the force-temperature coefficient at constant temperature and length; (2) the force-pressure coefficient at constant temperature and length; (3) the thermal expansion coefficient at constant length; and (4) the isothermal compressibility at constant length. The force-temperature and the force-pressure coefficients were functions of strain whereas the expansion coefficients and the isothermal compressibilities were independent of strain. These measurements gave an {{internal energy}} contribution of 23 % for natural rubber independent of the strain over the range of extensions studied. To describe the thermal {{as well as the}} elastic behavior of rubbers a new phenomenological description of elastomers based on a generalized measure of strain was developed. The incompressible form of the strain energy function correctly described the elastic data on various elastomers (natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, chlorinated ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber) in both homogeneous and non-homogeneous deformation fields. For a given rubber the same set of parameters fitted the data in simple tension, simple compression, equal biaxial tension and pure shear up to the point of rupture. The compressible form of the strain energy function also described the thermoelastic data on natural rubber. The thermoelastic data on chlorinated ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber, taken out of the literature, were also predicted. From the new strain energy function it was possible to determine the interchain interactions. For natural rubber the interchain energy effects were found to be small (4 %) as compared to the intrachain energy effects. The experimental results on natural rubber established the range of validity of the statistical mechanical (molecular) and the continuum mechanical (phenomenological) theories. The temperature coefficient of the unperturbed dimensions of natural rubber determined from the internal energy component of the force yielded the conformational energies associated with the <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> chain...|$|E
40|$|PhDA {{detailed}} electron microscopic {{study of}} the morphology and kinetics of crystallization of trans- 1, 4 -polyisoprene with cis isoprene units varying from Of to 19. 8 has been carried out. Two crystal structures of trans 3., 4 -polyisoprene (LIS and in p) were generally observed. In an unstrained film, lamellar single crystals which developed into hedrites, sheaves and spherulites of both crystal modifications were observed. The morphology attained {{was determined by the}} growth rate and the nucleation density of the crystals. Electron diffraction study suggests that the lamellar crystals have a chain-folded configuration. In a strained film, a row nucleation morphology was observed LIT and FIMP lamellar crystals were observed to nucleate from the same central 'backbones'. The row nucleation density of the lamellar crystals increases with strain. The growth habits of the lamellar crystals in, both strained and unstrained films were dependent on the film thinness, and on the proximity and the orientation of the neighbouring crystals. Models for the observed growth habits were discussed. The lamellar thickness data agrees with the kinetic theory of chain folding. The lamellar thickness of both crystal structures increases with decreasing degree of supercooling. The fold surface free energies estimated were 45. 1 x 10 - 3 J/n 2 and 60. 1 x 10 - 3 J/m 2 for the LIT and F ULF crystals of gotta percha respectively. The growth kinetics data of the lamellar crystals determined agrees with the existing theories of crystal growth. At the range of temperature from 400 to 560, the HMF crystal has a faster growth rate than the LMF crystallized at the same temperature. At the same degree of supercooling, the LMF crystal has a faster growth rate. The growth rates of both the LMF and HMF crystals decrease as the cis content on a trans polymer chain increases. With 66 cis units, the growth rate of the isomerized specimen decreased to a value of 1 / 6 to 1 / 8 of that for gutta percha (0 f cis), whereas in <b>cis-polyisoprene,</b> the growth rate is retarded by 100 times with the inclusion of trans isoprene unit. This, difference in behaviour is discussed in terms of the possibility of including non-crystallizable units in the crystal lattice. The growth rate analysis showed the importance of determining the equilibrium melting temperature and glass transition temperature for each isomerized specimen to obtain meaningful estimates o...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{dielectric}} analysis {{suggested that}} entangled linear <b>cis-polyisoprene</b> (PI) chains in monodisperse bulk exhibit, {{in the terminal}} relaxation regime, reptation/contour length fluctuation (CLF) along a partially dilated tube with its diameter being determined by the constraint release (CR) activated tension equilibration along the chain backbone (Matsumiya et al. Macromolecules 2013, 46, 6067). In relation to this finding, we re-examined the dielectric and viscoelastic terminal relaxation times of components in linear PI blends having various component molecular weights and volume fractions, Mi and υi (i = 1 and 2 for the short and long components). In entangling blends with M 2 ≫ M 1 and large υ 2 (>critical volume fraction υ 2 e for the onset of long−long entanglement), the relaxation time τ 2,b of the long chain decreases with decreasing υ 2 but stayed considerably larger than τ 2,soln of the same long chain in a solution having the same υ 2. This result suggested that the CR-activated tension equilibration retards the reptation/CLF motion of the long chain in such blends. A simple “solution model” considering this retardation due to the CR relaxation of short−long entanglements was formulated. Utilizing data for the CR relaxation time τdil‑ 2,CR of dilute long chains (with υ 2 υ 2 e very well. Nevertheless, this model could {{not apply to the}} cases where M 2 and M 1 are rather narrowly separated and the short−long entanglements considerably survive in the time scale of the long chain relaxation. For this case, a “blend model” was formulated to consider self-consistently, though in an approximate way, the CR relaxation of all species of entanglements (short−short, short−long, long−short, and long−long entanglements) thereby mimicking coupled relaxation of the long and short chains. The component relaxation times deduced from this model (again {{on the basis of the}} τdil‑ 2,CR data) were surprisingly close to the data, not only for the PI/PI blend having narrowly separated M 2 and M 1 but also for those with M 2 ≫ M 1 (the latter being described satisfactorily also with the solution model), suggesting that reptation/CLF of the components in the terminal relaxation regime occurs along partially dilated tube with the diameter being determined by the CR-activated tension equilibration. Furthermore, the “blend model” worked satisfactory also for literature data for polystyrene blends having various M 2 /M 1 ratios. These results demonstrate the importance of CR-activated tension equilibration in the blends, which is consistent with the finding for monodisperse bulk...|$|E
