5|$|In Yellowstone's hot waters, {{bacteria}} form mats {{of bizarre}} shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria {{are some of}} the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other arthropods live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from sulfur.

5|$|In 1924, Einstein {{received}} {{a description of}} a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms {{as well as to the}} proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of <b>Colorado</b> <b>at</b> <b>Boulder.</b> Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.|$|E

5000|$|The starshade is a {{spacecraft}} designed by Webster Cash, an astrophysicist at the University of <b>Colorado</b> <b>at</b> <b>Boulder's</b> Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy. The proposed spacecraft {{is designed to}} work in tandem with space telescopes like the James Webb Telescope or a new 4-meter telescope. It would fly 72000 km {{in front of a}} space telescope (between the telescope and a target star) and approximately 238,600 mi away from Earth, outside of Earth's heliocentric orbit. When unfurled, the starshade resembles a sunflower, with pointed protrusions around its circumference. The starshade acts as a very large coronagraph: it blocks light of a distant star, making it easier to observe associated planets. The unfurled starshade could reduce collected light from bright stars by as much as 10 billion-fold. Light that [...] "leaks" [...] around the edges would be used by the telescope as it scans the target system for planets. With the reduction of the harsh light, astronomers will be able to check exoplanet atmospheres tens of trillions of miles away for the potential chemical signatures of life.|$|R

50|$|The {{reported}} {{absence of}} the diterpenes led Richard Spjut to conclude that a key difference in V. tuberculata was the absence the diterpenes; (-)-16 α-hydroxykaurane however, upon preparing to return specimens on loan from the University of <b>Colorado</b> Herbarium <b>at</b> <b>Boulder,</b> he noted two specimens from the type locality that had been determined by him to have (-)-16 α-hydroxykaurane with only trace amounts of zeorin. Evidently the authors in the original publication may have confused (-)-16 α-hydroxykaurane with zeorin. A correction by Spjut was noted on World botanical Associates web page. In 2004, Bowler and Marsh retained the species in Niebla, while also indicating that secondary metabolites were usnic acid and unidentified triterpenes.The triterpene zeorin is frequently absent or in trace amounts {{in a number of}} species in the subgenus Vermilacinia, whereas (-)-16 α-hydroxykaurane is found in all species taking into the correction.

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{is in an}} {{operational}} configuration and nearing final assembly. With its maturity and diverse payloads onboard, the opportunity exists to extend the orbital lab into a facility to exercise and demonstrate Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN). DTN is an end-to-end network service providing communications through environments characterized by intermittent connectivity, variable delays, high bit error rates, asymmetric links and simplex links. The DTN protocols, also known as bundle protocols, provide a store-and-forward capability to accommodate end-to-end network services. Key capabilities of the bundling protocols include: the Ability to cope with intermittent connectivity, the Ability {{to take advantage of}} scheduled and opportunistic connectivity (in addition to always up connectivity), Custody Transfer, and end-to-end security. <b>Colorado</b> University <b>at</b> <b>Boulder</b> and the Huntsville Operational Support Center (HOSC) have been developing a DTN capability utilizing the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) payload resources onboard the ISS, <b>at</b> the <b>Boulder</b> Payload Operations Center (POC) and at the HOSC. The DTN capability is in parallel with and is designed to augment current capabilities. The architecture consists of DTN endpoint nodes on the ISS and <b>at</b> the <b>Boulder</b> POC, and a DTN node at the HOSC. The DTN network is composed of two implementations; the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) and the open source DTN 2 implementation. This paper presents the architecture, implementation, and lessons learned. By being able to handle the types of environments described above, the DTN technology will be instrumental in extending networks into deep space to support future missions to other planets and other solar system points of interest. Thus, this paper also discusses how this technology will be applicable to these types of deep space exploration missions...|$|R

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} a connection between hand sanitization and infection control in numerous settings such as extended care facilities, schools, and hospitals. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effectiveness of both a hand hygiene message campaign and the use of an alcohol gel hand sanitizer in decreasing the incidence of upper respiratory illness (URI) among students living in university residence halls. Methods: This study involved a total of 430 students recruited from four residence halls during the Fall Semester at the University of <b>Colorado</b> <b>at</b> the <b>Boulder</b> campus. Dormitories were paired into control and product groups. In the product groups, alcohol gel hand sanitizer dispensers were installed in every room and bathroom and in dining halts. The data were statistically analyzed for the differences between product and control groups in reported symptoms, illness rates, and absenteeism from classes. Results: The overall increase in hand hygiene behavior and reduction in symptoms, illness rates, and absenteeism between the product group and control group was stetistically significant. Reductions in URI symptoms ranged from 14. 8 % to 39. 9 %. Total improvement in illness rate was 20. 0 %. The product group had 43 % less missed schooVwork days. Conc/usion: Hand hygiene practices were improved through increased frequency of handwashing through increasing awareness of the importance of hand hygiene, and the use of alcohol gel hand sanitizer in university dormitories. This resulted in fewer URI symptoms, lower illness rates, and lower absenteeism...|$|R
