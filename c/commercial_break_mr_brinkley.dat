6000|$|... "But I can't {{go on in}} the dark," [...] {{retorted}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> [...] "You can't {{think in}} the dark, much less talk! Can you, Mrs. Pasmer?" [...] Mrs. Pasmer, with Alice next to her, sat just in front of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and quite}} {{right to do}} it," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> [...] "I don't know {{that we should be}} very proud {{ourselves}} if we confessed just what caught our fancy in our husbands. For my part I shouldn't like to say how much a light hat that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> happened to be wearing {{had to do with the}} matter." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> {{went out}} upon the seaward {{verandah}} {{of the hotel}} with this bitterness of Mrs. Pasmer's smile in her thoughts; and it disposed her to feel more keenly the quality of Miss Pasmer's smile. She found the girl standing there at a remote point of that long stretch of planking, and {{looking out over the}} water; she held with both hands across her breast the soft chuddah shawl which the wind caught and fluttered away from her waist. She was alone, said as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley's</b> compunctions goaded her nearer, she fancied that the saw Alice master a primary dislike in her face, and put on a look of pathetic propitiation. She did not come forward to meet <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> who liked better her waiting to be approached; but she smiled gratefully when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> put out her hand, and she took it with a very cold one.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Cotton was so {{bewildered by}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley's</b> {{interpretation}} of Alice's latent motives that {{she let the}} truculent hostility of her aspiration pass unheeded. She looked helplessly about, and seemed faint, so that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> without appearing to notice her state, interposed {{the question of a}} little sherry. When it had been brought, and Miss Cotton had sipped the glass that trembled in one hand while her emotion shattered a biscuit with the other, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> went on: [...] "I'm glad the engagement is broken, and I hope it will never be mended. If what you tell me of her reason for breaking it is true--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> {{hastened to}} make the mention of Miss Anderson as impersonal as possible.|$|R
60|$|The ladies were in {{a scream}} of {{laughter}} as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> lumbered heavily to their group.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> felt bound, of course, {{since there}} was no open enmity between them, to meet the Pasmers on the neutral ground of the Hygeia with {{conventional}} amiability. She was really touched by the absent wanness of the girls look, and by the later-coming recognition which shaped her mouth into a pathetic snide. Alice did not look like death quite, as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had told her husband, with the necessity her sex has for putting its superlatives before its positives; but she was pale and thin, and she moved with a languid step when they all met at night after <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had kept out of the Pasmers' way during the day.|$|R
60|$|All {{the ladies}} {{joined in the}} laugh with which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> herself led off. But Miss Cotton stopped {{laughing}} first.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> was {{certainly}} amused at this. [...] "It {{seems to me}} that there you've been anticipated by nature--not to mention art." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} be dear to nature, and to nature's children," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> [...] "Perhaps because their digestions are strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Van Hook stopped, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> said, [...] "And yet {{she always}} seemed to me {{particularly}} practical and level-headed--as the men say." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> made an inarticulate noise for comment, {{and assumed}} the contemptuous sneer which some men find {{convenient}} for shaving the lower lip.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we have so}} far," [...] he {{answered}} modestly; and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> laughed with him. This was the first entertainment at Trevor cottage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, quite," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> {{with a short}} breath, and {{not knowing}} whither this tended. Alice did not leave her in doubt.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had theorised Alice Pasmer {{as simply}} and primitively selfish, {{like the rest}} of the Pasmers in whom the family traits prevailed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't admit that!" [...] cried Miss Cotton, {{glad to have}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> go too far, and {{plucking}} up courage {{from her}} excess.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> {{looked at}} him for an instant as if she really thought him capable of it. Then she joined him in his laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I always {{wonder what}} {{that kind of}} people think of us kind of people," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> with her eye on the photographer's subjects.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I understand," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> [...] "What a pity she couldn't {{be made to}} {{feel that}} that didn't deepen the {{obligation}} at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> disappointedly. [...] "I {{think the}} sudden {{departure}} of the Van Hooks must {{have had something to}} do with Dan Mavering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> [...] "nothing is more {{appropriate}} to a picnic than conundrums; they always have them. Choose a good tough one." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a bright}} sun shining, and the ache was gone out of Dan's heart. He began to chatter gaily with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> about Washington.|$|R
6000|$|... "If Miss Anderson for example," [...] pursued <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> [...] "felt aggrieved with you. But really I've {{no right}} to enter into your affairs, Miss Pasmer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} she hadn't," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> remembering how Alice had marked an {{increasing}} ignorance of any part she might {{have had in the}} affair from the first moment of her reconciliation with Dan; she had the effect of feeling that she had sacrificed enough to Mrs. Brinkley; and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had been restored to all the original strength of her conviction that she was a solemn little unconscious egotist, and Dan was as unselfish and good as he was unequal to her exactions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I took {{a notion}} {{to come right}} on after I wrote, and I started on the same train with it. But {{they said it was}} no use {{trying to get into the}} Hygeia, and I stopped last night at the little hotel in Hampton. I've just walked over, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> told me you were out here somewhere. That's the whole story, I believe." [...] He gave his nervous laugh, but it seemed to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> that it had not much joy in it.|$|R
6000|$|Dan's face showed above most of {{the heads}} and {{shoulders}} about him; it was flushed, and looked troubled and excited. He caught sight of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> and his eyes brightened joyfully. He slipped quickly through the crowd, and bowed over her hand, while he stammered out, without giving her a chance for reply till the end: [...] "O <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> I'm {{so glad to see}} you! I'm going--I want to ask a great favour of you, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> I want to bring--I want to introduce some friends of mine to you--some ladies, Mrs. Brinkley; very nice people I met last summer at Portland. Their father--General Wrayne--has been building some railroads down East, and they're very nice people; but they don't know any one--any ladies--and they've been looking at the pictures ever since they came. They're very good pictures; but it isn't an exhibition!" [...] He broke down with a laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I doubt it. Mr. Trevor," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> to the host, who {{had come}} up for her congratulations, [...] "do you always have such {{brilliant}} performances?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> fanning herself. [...] "Tourguenief. That man gave me {{the worst}} {{quarter of an hour}} with his 'Lisa' that I ever had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't very {{customary}} in {{the nineteenth}} century," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> [...] "But you might kiss her fan. He might kiss her fan, mightn't he, Mrs. Pasmer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{book ends}} with a marriage; there's no denying that," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> with a reserve in her tone which caused Mrs. Pasmer to {{continue}} for her-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really," [...] cried <b>Mrs</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> casting her sandals from her, [...] "I {{will not}} be enslaved to rubbers in such a sylvan scene as this, at any rate." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> sacredly {{pledged to}} secrecy, listened with a {{sufficiently}} dismaying {{air to the}} story which Miss Cotton told her in the extremity of her fear and doubt.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of John "Chicken George" Brinkley, native of Catalina Island, behind a house, ca. 1885. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> stands {{with his hands}} to his sides an his hat on, in front of some dying bushes. A tall, adobe house stands in the background behind him, partially obscured by trees. A tall hill is visible still further in the background, behind it. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> had only been off of the island once in his lifetime, and worked for Shatto. Picture file card reads: "Chicken George", however, "Chicken Johnny" was found in an earlier record...|$|R
60|$|Guests kept {{arriving}} till midnight. Among the latest, when Dan {{had lost}} himself far from Boston in {{talk with a}} young lady from Richmond, who spoke with a slur of her vowels that fascinated him, came <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> He felt himself grow pale and inattentive to his pretty Virginian. That accent of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley's</b> recalled him to his history. He hoped {{that she would not}} see him; but in another moment he was greeting her with a warmth which Bostonians seldom show in meeting at Boston.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo, Corey!" [...] {{said this}} stout gentleman, whom <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brinkley</b> at once {{introduced}} as Mr. Bellingham, and whose salutation Corey returned with [...] "Hallo, Charles!" [...] of equal intimacy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello, Mavering!" [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> {{coming up}} and taking his hand into his fat grasp. [...] "On your way to Fortress Monroe? Better come with us. Why; Munt!" ...|$|R
