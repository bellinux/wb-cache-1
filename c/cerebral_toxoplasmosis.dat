40|$|Protozoal infections, though {{endemic to}} certain regions, {{can be seen}} all around the world, because of the {{increase}} in travel and migration. In addition, immunosuppression associated with various conditions, particularly with HIV infection, favors the occurrence of more severe manifestations and failure to respond to treatments.

Despite information obtained from clinical, laboratory, and imaging procedures that help to narrow the differential diagnosis of intracranial infections, there are cases that need confirmation with biopsy or autopsy. Predominant presentations are meningoencephalitis (trypanosomiasis), encephalopathy (cerebral malaria), or as single or multiple pseudotumoral enhancing lesions (toxoplasmosis, reactivated Chagas' disease).

The protocol enables simultaneous visualization of fluorescently labelled immune cells, the pial microvasculature and extracellular structures such as collagen fibres at high spatial and temporal resolution. Intracranial structures are exposed through a cranial window, and physiologic conditions are maintained during extended imaging sessions via continuous superfusion of the brain surface with artificial cerebrospinal fluid.

However, these protective effects occur independently of autophagosome formation. Thus, the in vivo role of classic autophagy in protection conferred by adaptive immunity and how adaptive immunity triggers autophagy are incompletely understood. Employing biochemical, genetic and morphological studies, we found that CD 40 upregulates the autophagy molecule Beclin 1 in microglia and triggers killing of Toxoplasma gondii dependent on the autophagy machinery. Infected CD 40 (-/-) mice failed to upregulate Beclin 1 in microglia/macrophages in vivo. Autophagy-deficient Beclin 1 (+/-) mice, mice with deficiency of the autophagy protein Atg 7 targeted to microglia/macrophages as well as CD 40 (-/-) mice exhibited impaired killing of T. gondii and were susceptible to <b>cerebral</b> and ocular <b>toxoplasmosis.</b> Susceptibility to toxoplasmosis occurred despite upregulation of IFN-γ, TNF-α and NOS 2, preservation of IFN-γ-induced microglia/macrophage anti-T. gondii activity and the generation of anti-T. gondii T cell immunity.

These studies identified CD 40 -p 21 -Beclin 1 as a pathway by which adaptive immunity stimulates autophagy.

METHODS: A retrospective study of 32 patients infected with HIV who had focal CNS lesions on MRI {{as a result of}} either lymphoma or toxoplasmosis. RESULTS: 18 patients had lymphoma, 12 had toxoplasmosis, and two had both. Toxoplasma IgG antibodies were detected in only seven patients [...] four with toxoplasmosis, two with lymphoma, and one with both diagnoses. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in CSF of all six patients with lymphoma and none of two with toxoplasmosis. MRI showed multiple lesions in 23 patients, appearances did not discriminate between lymphoma and toxoplasmosis; nine patients had single lesions, of these eight had lymphoma (p = 0. 044, two tailed Fisher's exact test) 201 Tl SPET showed accumulation in 17 with lymphoma and six with toxoplasmosis (p = 0. 034, two tailed Fisher's exact test). Of nine patients with single lesions on MRI and 201 Tl SPET with focal accumulation eight had lymphoma. 201 Tl SPET uptake ratios of > or = 2. 9 were only seen with lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of patients' toxoplasma serostatus does not aid discrimination between lymphoma and toxoplasmosis. Single lesions on MRI with focal accumulation of 201 Tl strongly suggest lymphoma.

A prospective analysis was then performed with 203 consecutive clinical specimens received at the laboratory of Parasitology of Saint-Louis Hospital during a 4 -month period. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in two patients was made according to the TaqMan-AF-PCR whereas the B 1 -PCR–ELISA failed to make diagnosis.

Controls consisted of 24 HIV infected patients with tissue culture proven T gondii parasitaemia and 57 HIV infected patients without toxoplasmosis. PCR was positive with both targets in 20 of 24 samples (84 %) from patients with parasitaemia. Three of 57 samples (5 %) from patients without toxoplasmosis were PCR positive with either target, but none was positive with both targets. Only three of the 19 patients (16 %) with <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> had a positive PCR with both targets before the start of specific treatment. PCR performed in blood is of little diagnostic value in cases of <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> but could be useful in patients with disseminated infection...|$|E
40|$|Highly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy (HAART) {{has resulted}} in a reduction of morbidity and mortality in HIV-associated cerebral opportunistic infection. Before HAART, up to 50 % of all HIV-infected patients in Europe developed <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> an encephalitis caused by reactivation of Toxoplasma gondii infection. Although potent therapeutical options exist, the prognosis is still poor. We describe the course of 36 AIDS patients with <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> and present a review of clinical signs, diagnosis, therapy, and survival times. The main criteria for differential diagnosis from other secondary neuromanifestations such as primary CNS lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy, abscesses, and ischemic infarctions are described.

40|$|Toxoplasmosis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} with the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasmosis is generally a late complication of HIV infection and usually occurs in patients with CD 4 + T-cell counts below 200 /μl. Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole) {{is the most common}} drug used in India for the treatment of AIDS-associated <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis.</b> Other alternative drugs used for the treatment of <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> are clindamycin plus pyrimethamine and clarithromycin with pyrimethamine. A 30 -year-old male known case of retroviral disease presented to Kasturba Medical College, India, with complaints of fever, headache and vomiting. Computed tomography scan of his brain showed irregular ring enhancing lesion in the right basal ganglia. Toxoplasma serology revealed raised IgG antibody levels. Based on the CT features and serology, diagnosis of <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> was made. He was treated with clindamycin alone as he had historyof sulfonamide allergy. The patient was symptomatically better after 48 hours. After 21 days, repeat CT of brain was done which was normal. The patient showed good clinical improvement within 48 hours and the lesion resolved completely within 3 weeks. The authors recommend using clindamycin without pyrimethamine in resource poor settings and in patients who do not tolerate sulfa drugs...|$|E
40|$|Neurologic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} may represent the initial presentation of AIDS in 10 - 30 % of patients. Movement disorders {{may be the result}} of direct central nervous system infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or the result of opportunistic infections. We report the case of a 59 years old woman who had hemichorea-hemiballismus subsequently found to be secondary to a <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> infection revealing HIV infection. Movement disorders, headache and nausea were resolved after two weeks of antitoxoplasmic treatment. Brain MRI control showed a marked resolution of cerebral lesion. Occurrence of hemichorea-ballismus in patient without familial history of movement disorders suggests a diagnosis of AIDS and in particular the diagnosis of secondary <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis.</b> Early recognition is important since it is a treatable entity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Holmes tremor {{is a rare}} {{symptomatic}} movement disorder. Currently suggested pathophysiological {{mechanisms of}} the disease are mostly derived from stroke cases. Although rare, <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> may strengthen the pathophysiologic mechanism of disease. Case presentation A case of Holmes tremor secondary to <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> in an AIDS patient is presented. A relevant literature search was performed, using pubmed and several entries for Holmes tremor as labelled in the literature. The unifying feature of our case {{and those of the}} literature is the involvement of either the cerebello-thalamo-cortical and/or the dentato-rubro-olivary pathways. The abscess or the extension of surrounding edema beyond these two circuits may account for the superimposed dysfunction of the nigrostriatal system in some but not all cases. The short delay observed in our observation and the dramatic response to treatment may indirectly support the secondary neuronal degeneration theory in the mechanism of Holmes tremor. Conclusion Cases of <b>cerebral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> in AIDS patients also provide arguments for the role of the thalamo-cortical and/or the dentato-rubro-olivary pathways dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Holmes tremor. Involvement of the nigro-striatal pathway may not be crucial in the development of this syndrome. Our case also brings additional indirect arguments for the role of secondary neuronal degeneration in the mechanism of Holmes tremor. </p...|$|E
