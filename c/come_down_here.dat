500|$|... 2006: Honored with {{a star on}} the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 16; {{located at}} 6915 Hollywood Boulevard {{and it was the}} 2,321st star awarded in its history; at the reception, he stated, [...] "I used to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and look at these stars and I could never quite figure out what you were {{supposed}} to do to get one...time has passed and now here I am doing this, and I'm still excited. I'm still excited to be an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow. Who knows {{what would have happened}} in that next lap? We had a top-five car [...] and we didn't finish in the top five, so that's a bummer. We had a car that could've won the Daytona 500. We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side– we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fifth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus commented, [...] "I think finally, finally after pulling this off Jimmie {{will get the}} respect that he deserves. Knowing {{what we had to}} do— <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and beat them— and we beat them." [...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had a great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his head in disbelief. [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? You should <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> more often, I do that every week." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris came {{to assist}} with the {{translation}} in February 1828 [...] Around this time, Smith reportedly confided to Emma's uncle that he had doubts about whether or not he should translate the plates, because despite the commandment from God, [...] "he was afraid of the people" [...] Thus, when Harris arrived, he reportedly had to convince Smith to continue translating, saying, [...] "I have not <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> for nothing, and we will go on with it" [...]|$|E
2500|$|Just after 3pm on Sunday, 4 December 2005, {{police were}} called to North Cronulla Beach {{following}} a report of an assault on two off-duty surf lifesavers by four {{members of a group}} of eight Middle Eastern men. A verbal exchange had taken place after three lifesavers approached a group of four young Lebanese men on Cronulla Beach with both groups accusing the other of staring at them. One of the Lebanese men reportedly responded to the accusations, [...] "I'm allowed to; now fuck off and leave our beach", to which a lifesaver responded, [...] "I <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> out of my own spare time to save you dumb cunts from drowning; now piss off, you scum".|$|E

2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. <b>Come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E
2500|$|After touring {{through the}} spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered Bear Creek Studio in Woodinville, Washington, with {{producer}} Gil Norton to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, {{the rest of the}} band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's [...] "drum tracks with his own for all but two songs." [...] During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, [...] "Dude, don't <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> I'm recording some of the drum tracks". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording [...] "some" [...] of the tracks. Mendel asked, [...] "Is that what he told you?"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, [...] "No, man, he did them all".|$|E
