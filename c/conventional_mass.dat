The developments are displayed {{as an extension of}} <b>conventional</b> chloride <b>mass</b> balance (CMB) techniques to account for transient as well as space-dependent water fluxes. The <b>conventional</b> chloride <b>mass</b> balance has been used over two decades to estimate recharge over large time scales in arid environments. In this mass balance approach, the chloride concentration in the pore water, originating from atmospheric fallout, is inversely proportional to the flux of water through the sediments. The CMB method is especially applicable to arid and semi-arid regions where evapotranspirative enrichment of the pore water produces a distinct chloride profile in the unsaturated zone. The solutions presented allow incorporation of transient fluxes and boundary conditions in CMB analysis, and allow analysis of tracer profile data which is not constant with depth below extraction zone in terms of a rational water transport model. A closed-form inverse solution is derived which shows uniqueness of model parameter and boundary condition (including paleoprecipitation) estimation, for the specified flow model. Recent expressions of the <b>conventional</b> chloride <b>mass</b> balance technique are derived from the general model presented here; the conventional CMB is shown to be fully compatible with this transient flow model and it requires the steady-state assumption on chloride mass deposition only (and not on water fluxes or boundary conditions).

40|$|In <b>conventional</b> {{buildings}} thermal <b>mass</b> is {{a permanent}} building characteristic depending on the building design. However, none of the permanent thermal mass concepts are optimal in all operational conditions. We propose a concept that combines the benefits of buildings with low and high thermal mass by applying hybrid adaptable thermal storage (HATS) systems and materials to a lightweight building. The HATS concept increases building performance and the robustness to changing user behavior, seasonal variations and future climate changes. Building performance simulation is used to investigate {{the potential of the}} novel concept for reducing heating energy demand and increasing thermal comfort. Simulation results of a case study in the Netherlands show that the optimal quantity of the thermal mass is sensitive to the change of seasons.

Calculations show heating energy demand reductions of up to 35 % and increased thermal comfort compared to <b>conventional</b> thermal <b>mass</b> concepts...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "radical media" [...] was {{introduced}} by John D. H. Downing in his 1984 study of rebellious communication and social movements emphasizing alternative media's political and goal-oriented activism. Radical media manifests New Social Movements’s individualistic, and humanistic socio-political model of disintermediation. [...] While the coverage of this term coincides with other branches of alternative media, namely tactical and activist media, it differs from <b>conventional</b> <b>mass</b> media {{in terms of its}} ideological and behavioural practices, making radical media significant in terms of its amplification of social movements. Downing describes Radical Media as being [...] "generally small-scale and in many different forms, that express an alternative vision to hegemonic policies, and perspectives." [...] Hence, the term categorizes various forms of alternative media that are progressive, reformist, progressive, and post-materialistic. Some media that are categorized by radical media include, but are not restricted to, community media, student media, tactical media, subcultural media, social movement media, citizen media, and alternative journalism. Groups that fall under radical media emphasize egalitarian channels characterized by inclusive, action-driven, prefigurative, and marginal practices that challenge conventional media.|$|E
5000|$|Normally, {{the effect}} of air {{buoyancy}} on objects of normal density {{is too small to}} be of any consequence in day-to-day activities.

Furthermore, variations in barometric pressure will rarely affect one’s weight more than ±1 part in 30,000. However, in metrology (the science of measurement), the precision mass standards for calibrating laboratory scales and balances are manufactured with such accuracy that air density is accounted for to compensate for buoyancy effects. Given the extremely high cost of platinum-iridium mass standards like the International Prototype Kilogram (the mass standard in France that defines the magnitude of the kilogram), high-quality [...] "working" [...] standards are made of special stainless steel alloys with densities of about 8,000 kg/m3, which occupy greater volume than those made of platinum-iridium, which have a density of about 21,550 kg/m3. For convenience, a standard value of buoyancy relative to stainless steel was developed for metrology work and this results in the term [...] "conventional mass". <b>Conventional</b> <b>mass</b> is defined as follows: [...] "For a mass at 20 °C, ‘conventional mass’ is the mass of a reference standard of density 8,000 kg/m3 which it balances in air with a density of 1.2 kg/m3."
