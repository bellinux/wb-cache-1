In eastern Washington and northern Idaho, soil acidification tends to be worse in areas that are annually cropped, do not include nitrogen-fixing legumes in the crop rotation, and in areas that were historically forested.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to empirically analyze the {{competing}} effects of social interactions and conversion subsidies on {{the adoption of}} organic farming practices for two samples of olive and <b>cereal</b> <b>growers</b> in Greece and Germany, respectively. To this end we construct two alternative indicators to capture informational cascades created in rural areas, one based on demographic characteristics and one on profitability considerations. Building upon the theoretical findings of Foster and Rosenweig (1995), Munshi (2004), Bandiera and Rasul (2006) and Weber (2012), we find that informational cascades are indeed important in revising farmers' perceptions and adoption behavior in both rural areas of Europe.

40|$|Motivated by {{the policy}} trend of exposing European Union farmers to more market risk by {{reducing}} price support, this paper evaluates the compensation required by EU <b>cereal</b> <b>growers</b> {{to accept the}} complete removal of price support. Additional considerations are whether this policy change also includes the removal of set-aside, or features only a partial removal of price support. A model is developed which captures the main on- and off-farm factors influencing grower perceptions {{of the impact of}} this policy change. This model is subjected to a numerical analysis which shows that divergent assessments of the expected profitability of releasing to production land previously set-aside mean growers are unlikely to agree whether compensation is even required. It is concluded that the retention of set-aside for environmental purposes is likely to mean growers are more united in their perception of the need for, and amount of compensation to accept the removal of price support...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{agricultural}} producers’ {{profits are}} dependent on the decisions they make about farm productivity systems. They may use recommendations and information provided by government agencies and private consultants. For <b>cereal</b> <b>growers,</b> success is dependent on decisions made about selection of crop varieties suitable for their agronomic and climatic conditions. This paper reports on research which aimed to evaluate some current eAgriculture methodologies for their application in the Western Australian agricultural industry. In particular the paper illustrates the findings from a project which aimed to explain the variability seen in crop varieties grown in Western Australia. The problems associated with crop variability have been recognised by crop researchers for many years. However {{it is only through}} recent advances in computer technology, and the application of large-scale data mining techniques and tools, that it has been possible to address the complexity of these environments. Western Australia environments are unique in that agricultural practices are greatly influenced by water/rainfall, soil and its land use. By applying data mining techniques and tools to information which is publicly available to growers, researchers can identify the major sources of variability which in turn can be used by growers as part of their risk management strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of plant breeding and management to increased grain yield achieved by <b>cereal</b> <b>growers</b> {{is estimated to}} be about 35 % and 65 %, respectively. For malting barley, yields are severely limited when grown under low soil fertility conditions in order to achieve malting specifications, that prescribe low protein levels. This paper is based on experiments designed to explore (1) the potential of using inherently low-protein genotypes in grain protein management, and (2) an alternative approach to grain yield improvement in which genetic manipulation of inherent grain protein concentration allows barley to be grown under conditions of high fertility or as part of crop rotations previously thought to result in nitrogen levels too high for malting purposes. In the first experiment, eight barley lines representing diverse commercial and advanced selections from breeding programs were grown under four levels of nitrogen fertiliser applications. The eight genotypes were clustered into three entry groups, corresponding to low, moderate and high-protein genotypes. There was little difference among groups in the rate of response to N application. However, the genotype group with inherently low GPC maintained the lower protein over those with higher grain protein at the different rates of N application...|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} Sahelian zone, {{grasshoppers}} {{are generally not}} considered serious pests in Africa and are therefore rarely controlled with pesticides. For that reason, {{it was only in}} the Sahel that serious efforts were undertaken to promote Green Muscle for grasshopper control. In a number of countries, and especially Niger, <b>cereal</b> <b>growers</b> are organised in village brigades that are charged with controlling pests that surpass the capacity of individual growers. Green Muscle was given to some of these after training in its correct application. After initial disappointment with its slow action, villagers usually became satisfied with the final results. However, the price proved to be a serious obstacle. At that time, the cost of producing one kg of Green Muscle was about $200. A dosage of 50 g/ha translated into a price of $10 per hectare. The price of conventional products was then approximately $5/ha. Though growers were prepared to pay a premium of up to $2 for the fact that Green Muscle was harmless to their health and that of their livestock, they were not going to pay $10. Another problem was that no producer had yet been identified for the West African market and the availability of the product could therefore not be guaranteed.|$|R
40|$|Cereal straw {{currently}} has end-uses such as animal bedding and feeding, {{but there are}} no official statistics regarding the fraction of straw that is not used. Although cereal straw is an abundant source of biomass still largely unexploited for energy purposes, the feedstock market interplay with current straw uses (e. g. animal bedding and feeding) and on-farm practices (e. g. chopped and incorporated) is still unknown. This research used farmers' stated preferences to assess the supply curve (i. e. amount and price) of cereal straw for bio-energy purposes. In addition, we performed an econometric regression on the straw price demanded by farmers (willingness to accept). A sample of data gathered in 2014 from 203 <b>cereal</b> <b>growers</b> in Apulia region (southern Italy) was used, and the results show {{that more than half of}} respondents would sell their cereal straw on the feedstock market, and that the preferred sales method is in-swath.

40|$|Small-scale {{irrigation}} {{is playing}} {{an important role}} in adapting to climate change, achieving food security, and improving household incomes. The Ethiopian Government considers irrigated agriculture as a primary engine of economic growth and plans to increase the current level of irrigation infrastructure three-fold by the end of 2015. However, there has been concern regarding the performance and management of existing small-scale irrigation. Based on the assessment of 52 small-scale irrigation schemes, and three case study sites, we describe the challenges and interventions required to improve irrigation water management in Ethiopia. Though most schemes are operational, many do not operate at full capacity, due to design failures, excessive siltation, poor agronomic and water management practices, and weak local institutions. In addition to low returns, there is competition for irrigation water between upstream and downstream users, vegetable <b>growers</b> and <b>cereal</b> <b>growers,</b> and between farmers with large irrigable plots and those with small plots. Despite these challenges, our field assessment revealed that small scale irrigation increases crop yields, improves crop diversification, and reduces the risk of crop failure. We emphasize in this paper the need for incentives to improve productivity and minimize conflicts, while enhancing innovation capacity, developing scheme-specific intensification strategies, and promoting collective action. We also describe how benefits from water investments could be substantially increased by overcoming design constraints, strengthening water user associations, and protecting catchments...|$|R
40|$|Considerable scope {{exists for}} the {{reduction}} of the primary and secondary costs associated with crop protection, by the formulation of judicious fungicide application regimes. The design, building and operation of a farm-level computer-based information system is described, the purpose of which is to help the farmer make rational spraying decisions. The system makes use of a simulation model built in 1978 which is capable of accurate prediction of the yield loss induced by epidemics of Puccinia hordei Otth on Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Zephyr. Extensions were made to this model to enable crop growth and disease to be projected into the future. Increased disease intensity occurs in response primarily to certain meteorological conditions; a model was built to carry out the probabilistic simulation of key weather variables. The Bayesian revision of yield reduction probability distributions provides the conceptual basis for the information system. The two strategies open to a decision maker as the season proceeds, those of spraying immediately and delaying application, were assessed using various decision criteria. Validation work was performed. Risk attitudes for a small sample of <b>cereal</b> <b>growers</b> were investigated; the importance of risk in the spraying decision is shown to be marginal. A low-cost method of implementation is illustrated; decision tables are derived on the basis of extensive simular experimentation and representative attitudes to risk. It is concluded that such an information system has the potential for the provision of timely recommendations. Areas for further research are identified; an. information system incorporating the major diseases of cereals in Canterbury is conceptualised, built around a general disease/crop skeleton model...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{knowledge}} about fertilization, inadequate income to purchase fertilizers, limited access to the right type of fertilizers, and national policies have been identified as prerequisites of Sub-Saharan smallholder farmers' low yield and food insecurity. This paper presents how the smallholder access to phosphorus (SMAP) method was developed in a transdisciplinary process in Kenya, and what insights have been gained in a first application of the SMAP method. The transdisciplinary SMAP method comprises (1) farmers' participation in a transdisciplinary process including extension officers and local scientists to construct farm-specific fertilization strategies based on (2) farm-specific soil testing and (3) the construction of cooperative strategies for purchasing fertilizers involving farmers, traders, and financial institutions in a timely manner. The method aims to improve farmers' participation in the value chain. The development of the method followed the Zurich 2000 conception of transdisciplinarity. The development co-led by representatives of a <b>cereal</b> <b>growers</b> association and scientists from local and international universities included main actors of the national and local (phosphorus) fertilizer supply-demand chain. The first application of the SMAP method was evaluated by embedding an ANOVA (analysis of variance) study design following the ideas of experimental action research. There were significant effects of soil testing and a marginal significant effect of the transdisciplinary construction of farm-specific fertilization strategies. This paper presents the initial transdisciplinary project plan for developing the SMAP method, how the transdisciplinary process worked in reality, what obstacles were met in practice, and the benefits of practice and science that resulted from this transdisciplinary project...|$|R
40|$|Since 1965 I {{have been}} {{employed}} as a nematologist by the Victorian Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, based at the Plant Research Institute, Burnley. My major responsibilities have included: (1) From 1965 - 1975, funded exclusively by the Wheat Industry, to conduct research on the biology and ecology of the cereal cyst nematode (Heterodera avenae Woll.), and to advise on methods for controlling the disease it causes in wheat and other cereals. (2) From 1975, in addition to research on H. avenae, to conduct research on nematode diseases of other agricultural and horticultural crops in Victoria. My research has always been directed at achieving methods of control which are both practical, and economic to apply. Prior to 1965, cereal cyst nematode was recognised as {{a major cause of}} disease in cereals in the southern wheatbelt of Australia; its distribution was known to be related to well structured soils; knowledge of its biology and ecology under Australian conditions was limited; and, crop rotation was the only recommended method of control. There were no sources of resistance suitable for use in breeding programs; the existence of pathotypes was unknown; and, the extent and magnitude of yield losses had not been determined. My research has culminated in the adoption by <b>cereal</b> <b>growers,</b> of several new control strategies, and the results have lead to the establishment of a new pesticide market (valued at millions of dollars per year), and economic benefits from the use of nematicides are already being obtained by rural communities in Victoria and South Australia.

40|$|Oat (Avena sativa L.) is {{a widely}} grown cereal crop that is used for human {{consumption}} and livestock feed. Canada is the second largest producer of oat worldwide, with Saskatchewan leading annual Canadian production with 1. 7 million tonnes. As market prices for oat are usually lower than other <b>cereals,</b> <b>growers</b> tend to forgo the use of certified seed or crop inputs (e. g. seed treatment) when growing oat. This can have significant repercussions {{when it comes to}} diseases that affect both {{the quality and quantity of}} the crop. One such disease is loose smut of oat, caused by the basidiomycete pathogen Ustilago avenae (Pers.) Rostr. This study investigated loose smut resistance present in ‘CDC Dancer’ using an F 4 : 7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross ‘CDC Dancer’ x ‘AC Morgan’ (DM). The goals were to: 1) phenotypically characterize, linkage map and identify putative marker(s) linked to loci governing resistance, and 2) to assess whether resistance from this population conferred a negative yield effect in the absence of the pathogen. A linkage map was constructed with data from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of the population, in conjunction with both field and greenhouse the phenotypic disease assessments. The map was comprised of 34 linkage groups (LGs), with a major resistance gene mapping to the terminus of linkage group (LG) 11 and a minor resistance gene mapping to LG 19. Investigation of allelic effects underlying each QTL revealed that lines possessing the ‘CDC Dancer’ allele at either QTL had a lower loose smut disease reaction score. Analysis of both QTL indicated an interaction (P < 0. 05) in disease reaction scores. The markers linked to these two QTL will be useful to oat breeders wishing to incorporate this resistance into future oat cultivars. Evaluation of two genetically similar RILs from the DM population, which differed in their reaction to loose smut, indicated no difference in mean yield between the lines. As such, the absence of yield effects from the U. avenae resistance gene investigated in this study means that incorporation of this source of loose smut resistance is a viable option for oat breeders...|$|R

40|$|As in {{many parts}} of the {{developing}} world, the share of high value crops in agricultural gross domestic product (AgGDP) has increased substantially in Nepal. We contribute to the literature on trends in agricultural development in the poorest countries by answering the research question on “Does transition from traditional to high-value agriculture reduce rural poverty in poor developing countries”? We also identified the drivers leading to this transition. The study uses survey data from three rounds of the nationally representative Nepal Living Standard Surveys: NLSS I (1994 / 1995), NLSS II (2004 / 2005) and NLSS III (2010 / 2011). Multi-level model was used to study the determinants of agricultural diversification. To estimate the causal impact of agricultural diversification on welfare measures, propensity score matching and instrumental variable techniques were used. Results indicate that there has been a rightward shift in the distribution of the share (percent) of high-value crops between 1995 and 2004 and between 2004 and 2010, respectively. The area as well as the shared by major cereals (paddy, maize, and wheat) is declining over years. However, it is increasing for high-value crops (potato, vegetables, spices/condiments, and fruits). The percentage increase in share of the high-value crops was higher in or adjacent to urbanized districts between 1995 and 2010. The factors positively associated with the agricultural diversification are female-headed households, caste, mother's education, net-buyer status, urban region, remittance, farm size, kitchen garden, improved seeds, telephone and refrigerator. We found positive impact of agricultural diversification towards high-value crops on rural poverty and monthly per capita consumption expenditure.

40|$|Due to the {{pressure}} on <b>cereal</b> margins <b>growers</b> are seeking ways of reducing their costs of production. Reduced cultivation may provide cheaper and faster crop establishment, {{but in the past}} has been subject to problems with (poor crop establishment) weeds and soil compaction. With modern cultivation and sowing technology and methodology {{it may be possible to}} overcome these difficulties. In addition reduced cultivation is considered to be more environmentally friendly and sustainable than the conventional plough-based system. With these considerations in mind it was decided to start an experiment in autumn 2000 to compare the conventional system (PL) with reduced cultivation (RC) for crop establishment, and to examine the effect of incorporating the straw into then soil or baling and removing it. The treatments were assessed on winter wheat, and winter and spring barley. The parameters assessed included – crop establishment, yield and quality effects on disease levels, invertebrate pests and beneficials (aphids, slugs, earthworms, beetles), and soil conditions. The work reported here was conducted on four trial sites at Oak Park, Carlow and Knockbeg, Co. Laois from 2000 to 2003. the objectives were to establish the efficacy of RC compared with PL and to its effects on the parameters outlined above. Plant establishment was lower after RC in most of the experiments. Winter wheat yields were good irrespective of the number of plants established and there were no significant differences between cultivation or straw disposal method. The relative yields of the PL and RC treatments in winter barley varied over the three years; in 2001 there was no difference, in 2002 PL yielded 1 t/ha more than RC, while in 2003 the PL area produced 2 t/ha extra. Spring barley yields were similar on the PL and RC treatments. Broadleaved weeds were not a problem on the PL or RC treatments but there were more annual grass weeds on the RC plots. This was particularly serious in the winter barley experiments where sterile brome (Bromus sterilis) had a big effect on yield by 2003. annual meadow grass (Poa annua) was a problem in both PL and RC areas if not controlled by timely herbicide application; this was particularly so on the headland areas in the spring barley field. Disease assessment on the winter wheat trail showed no significant differences in Take-all or Eyespot levels between cultivation or straw disposal methods, although Take-all levels tended to be lower on the RC plots. Soil strength as measured by cone penetrometer and shear vane was higher on the RC treatments. In the winter wheat there was no difference in slug numbers between any of the treatments. Leaf damage by slugs increased in RC relative to PL but not significantly, in 2003. No below ground slug damage was found. Earthworm numbers in the winter barley increased significantly on the RC treatment relative to the PL as the study progressed. Straw incorporation increased earthworm numbers on both PL and RC treatments. Allolobophora chlorotia was the most common species in 2004. In the winter wheat the RC and straw incorporation increased earthworm numbers. Cultivation method had a greater effect on ground beetle numbers than method of straw disposal. Large species (e. g. Pterostichies malanarius) were favoured by RC while smaller species (e. g. Bembidon species) were more numerous in the PL plots. Molecular studies on virus diseases, vectors and vector-predators are underway in progress. In the invertebrate pests and beneficials investigations the RC winter barley had 11 % fewer aphids and 27 % less BYDV than the PL. Incorporating straw reduced aphid numbers and virus incidence by 36 % and 32 % respectively; the comparable values for the PL + straw treatment were 15 % and 15 %. In the winter wheat there was less BYDV in the RC plots than the PL + less were the straw was incorporated than where the straw was removed. Aphid infestation of wheat ears was low in the three years of the experiment. The insecticide seed treatment imidacloprid significantly reduced aphid numbers and virus incidence in winter barley but was less effective than a single insecticide spray in controlling the disease. The seed treatment was more effective in controlling BYDV in RC than in the PL plots. Estimations of slug numbers in the winter barley showed that the dominant species was the grey field slug (Deroceras reticulatum). Slug numbers increased significantly on all treatments between 2001 and 2004. In November 2004, slugs were significantly more numerous in the RC treatments than in the PL areas. Leaf damage was proportional to slug populations, but the slugs did not damage the barely seed or reduce plant populations in continuous winter barley under RC. Root and stem diseases (Take-all and Eyespot) were not nay worse under RC than after PL. In fact there was a tendency towards lower disease levels on the RC areas and there was significantly less sharp eyespot on the RC treatment. End of Project Repor...|$|R
