40|$|A three storey {{building}} with a mat foundation consisting of a slab on a grid of grade beams performed poorly on clay soil. Cracking of the slab became progressively worse due to incorrect design and to fluctuations in groundwater pressure under the foundation. The cyclic presence and absence of water rusted steel reinforcement, and the sulfates in the clay soil caused formation of ettringite in the concrete. Plastic hinges formed in the slab, and settlements occurred, causing damage to the beams. The situation is still in progress and may lead the structure to collapse under normal service conditions. The geotechnical and structural investigations performed to survey and assess the aforementioned problems are described in this paper. The causes {{and the consequences of}} the detected anomalies are analyzed, and a prediction of potential future structural problems is provided. A strengthening procedure is proposed, and an estimate of the cost to realize it is provided.

40|$|Abstract: Earthing is an {{important}} aspect of every substation <b>construction.</b> Earth <b>Mat</b> is preferable to large substations because of space saving on the ground level due to substantial reduction of earth pits which leads to ease of coordination. Earth Mat minimizes the danger of high step or touch voltages in critical operating areas or places that are frequently used by people. Thus properly designed earthing system capable of dissipating large currents safely to earth is required, regardless of the fault type. This paper presents the design of earthing systems for the 132 / 33 Kv substation in Rivers state of Nigeria and the review of substation practices with special reference to safety and development criteria for safe design. A real time case study has been considered and the design was done using ETAP (Electrical Transients Analyzer Program).

40|$|Shallow-marine, siliciclastic depositional {{systems are}} governed by {{physical}} sedimentary processes. Mineral precipitation or penecontemporaneous cementation play minor roles. Today, coastal siliciclastic environments may be colonized {{by a variety of}} epibenthic, mat-forming cyanobacteria. Studies on microbial mats showed that they are not randomly distributed in modern tidal environments. Distribution and abundancy is mainly function of a particular sedimentary facies. Fine-grained sands composed of "clear" (translucent) quartz particles constitute preferred substrates for cyanobacteria. Mat-builders also favor sites characterized by moderate hydrodynamic flow regimes, which permit biomass enrichment and <b>construction</b> of <b>mat</b> fabrics without lethal burial of mat populations by fine sediments. A comparable facies relationship can be observed in ancient siliciclastic shelf successions from the terminal Neoproterozoic Nama Group, Namibia. Wrinkle structures that record microbial mats are present but sparsely distributed in mid- to inner shelf sandstones of the Nudaus Formation. The sporadic distribution of these structures reflects both the narrow ecological window that governs mat development and the distinctive taphonomic conditions needed to preserve the structures. These observations caution that statements about changing mat abundance across the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary must be firmly rooted in paleoenvironmental and taphonomic analysis. Understanding the factors that influence the formation and preservation of microbial structures in siliciclastic regimes can facilitate exploration for biological signatures in Earth's oldest rocks. Moreover, insofar as these structures can be preserved on bedding surfaces and are not easily mimicked by physical processes, they constitute a set of biological markers that can be searched for on Mars by remotely controlled rovers...|$|R
40|$|Bamboo {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} non-timber forest products in Bangladesh. Previous research, however, has focused mainly on its silvicultural aspects, with its socio-economic aspects remaining underexplored. In a study conducted between January and March in 2008, we surveyed 30 randomly selected bamboo-based entrepreneurs in a regional market in southern Bangladesh to identify employment and trade patterns, financial contributions, and marketing of bamboo and its products. Bamboo was found to be important in generating profits for entrepreneurs and employment for low-skilled rural workers. Bambusa balcooa, Melocanna baccifera, Bambusa tulda, and Bambusa vulgaris were found to be the most traded species, with Bambusa balcooa constituting 39 % of the market. Major uses of (secondary products from) bamboo were found to be <b>construction,</b> fences, <b>mats,</b> and domestic baskets and utensils. Operating costs varied across the enterprises according to their sales, workforce size, and purchases. Estimated net average incomes of the large, medium, and small enterprises were around Tk. 43, 000 ($ 625), Tk. 30, 000 ($ 435), and Tk. 19, 300 ($ 280), respectively, during the year 2007. Medium-sized enterprises earned the most (32 %) from the sale of secondary products. Three marketing channels were identified, with most of the bamboo in the area being found to be collected through intermediaries. Our discussion highlights the importance of bamboo and its secondary products in generating employment and profits in the area and also the presence of problems such as income variability throughout the year. Promoting the trade of bamboo and bamboo-based enterprises through appropriate technical and financial assistance to growers and entrepreneurs could be an effective strategy to improve local economies in Bangladesh. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple and fast {{approach}} for MAT generation in discrete form. It is used for manufacturability analysis in part modelling stage of injected parts. The method is a volume thinning method based on straight skeleton computation, modified and applied in 3 D on B-rep models in STL. The volume thinning of B-rep model is based on its boundary surfaces offset towards model interior. The surfaces' offset is done with an adequately proposed offset distance which makes some of non adjacent offset model surfaces overlap (they “meet” in mid-surface or MAT). Offset surfaces are used to reconstruct the topology of a new B-rep model (offset model). Overlapping surfaces in offset model are detected, separated and aggregated to MAT. For adequate MAT precision and adequate MAT radius function, we propose to treat B-rep model concave edges (vertices) as cylinders (spheres) of zero-radius and offset them in adequate way. On these bases, we present an iterative algorithm in which MAT is being constructed in incremental way by consecutive volume thinning of obtained offset models. <b>MAT</b> <b>construction</b> is finished when an empty offset model is obtained. An algorithm has been created and implemented in Visual C++. Some of obtained results are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Terns and skimmers nesting on {{saltmarsh}} islands often suffer large nest losses due to tidal {{and storm}} flooding. Nests {{located near the}} center of an island and on wrack (mats of dead vegetation, mostly eelgrass Zostera) are less susceptible to flooding than those near the edge of an island and those on bare soil or in saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). In the 1980 's Burgerand Gochfeld constructed artificial eelgrass mats on saltmarsh islands in Ocean County, New Jersey. These mats were used as nbsting substrate by common terns (Sferna hirundo) and black skimmers (Rynchops niger). Every year since 2002 | have transported eelgrass to one of their original sites to make artificial mats. This site, Pettit lsland, typically supports between 125 and 200 pairs of common terns. There has often been very little natural wrack present on the island {{at the start of the}} breeding season, and in most years natural wrack has been most common along the edges of the island. The terns readily used the artificial mats for nesting substrate. Because I placed artificial mats in the center of the island, the terns have often avoided the large nest losses incurred by terns nesting in peripheral ocations. However, during particularly severe flooding events even centrally located nests on <b>mats</b> are vulnerable. <b>Construction</b> of eelgrass <b>mats</b> represents an easy habitat manipulation that can improve the nesting success of marsh-nesting seabirds...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{of large}} {{structures}} on soil {{without the benefit}} of piles or caissons to transfer the building loads down to bedrock or other solid strata is sometimes done with much apprehension. There are savings to be gained so settlement studies were carried out on the Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto which is resting on a steel-reinforced concrete mat foundation. Total settlement under the center of the main wing of the building is about 0. 6 inches, much less than the predicted 5 inches from laboratory consolidation tests. The best laboratory value for modulus of elasticity in the stress range applied by the building loads is about 600 TSF. Laboratory and field values of modulus agree reasonably well if Poisson's ratio is between 0. 3 and 0. 4 but is poor if a modulus of 0. 5 is assumed. It is concluded that a mat foundation on a subsoil typical of the downtown Toronto area is completely satisfactory; the laboratory consolidation test overestimates the settlement of the structure on glacial till; compression of the soil under these loading conditions is mainly elastic; triaxial shear tests with cycled axial stress is a more accurate method of determining modulus of elasticity; improvements in modulus determination can result from larger specimens; 0. 5 is questioned as a value for Poisson's ratio; and at the time of <b>construction</b> the <b>mat</b> foundation for this building was the most economical under the stated design conditions.

Sports Exerc., Vol. 34, No. 1, 2002, pp. 130 – 138. Purpose: The {{purposes of this study}} were a) to develop a model of the foot capable of describing the foot motion during dynamic movements and b) to study the influence of different mats on foot motion during landing in gymnastics. Methods: Six female gymnasts (height: 1. 63 0. 04 m, weight: 58. 21 3. 46 kg) participated in this study. All six gymnasts carried out barefoot landings, falling from 80 and 115 cm onto three mats each with a different stiffness (hard, medium, and soft). Three synchronized digital high-speed video cameras (250 Hz) captured the motion of the left shank and foot. At the same time, the reaction forces between mat and foot at the forefoot and rearfoot were measured by two instrumented insoles (Paromed, 1000 Hz). The kinematics of the tibiotalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joints were examined. The lower leg and the foot were modeled by means of a multi-body system, comprising seven rigid bodies. For each joint, two joint coordinate systems attached on each of the connected segments were defined. Results: The mat stiffness did not show any influence on the maximal reaction forces or on the kinematics of the tibiotalar joint. For the soft mat, higher maximal eversion angles at the talonavicular and the calcaneocuboid joints were measured. Conclusions: The relative motion between forefoot and rearfoot was influenced by changing mat stiffness. Therefore, the <b>construction</b> of the <b>mat</b> influenced the motion of the foot. The observation of only the tibiotalar joint is not enough when studying the influence of different mats on foot motion. The functional benefit of the mechanica...|$|R

Training program content was based on topics covered in the introduction and literature review including the importance of accommodating diversity and developing creativity in society today; an explanation of the 4 MAT Model; an overview of typology and creativity research; and examination of implications for education. ^ Outlined in detail are scope and sequence of the training program, as well as measures of evaluation which included a content pre/post-test, a retrospective attitudinal survey, a lesson rating scale, and anecdotal commentary. Results were analyzed quantitatively not only in terms of new learning acquired, degree of attitudinal change, and quality of lesson plans, but also with regard to patterns of performance emerging among sub-groups categorized according to sex, grade level taught, work experience, previous training, learning styles, and attendance. ^ Results indicate that (1) during the course of the training there was a significant increase in positive attitude regarding the importance of accommodating diversity and creativity in educational settings; (2) that the training program prepared the majority of participants to develop lessons which integrated creativity and learning style theory, while satisfying 4 MAT criteria; (3) that performance on lesson plan design correlated more closely to attitude than to content; and (4) that gender and learning style of participants appeared to significantly affect assessment scores. ...|$|R
40|$|Mat-forming {{cyanobacteria}} {{are becoming}} a common weed problem in the Midwest, but {{little is known about}} their distribution and physiology. A survey was conducted of Indiana ponds, and mat-forming cyanobacteria were found at nuisance levels throughout the state, with one species, Oscillatoria limosa, being the most prevalent. Seven species (Oscillatoria limosa, O. jasorvensis, O. amoena, O. deflexoides, O. pseudogeminata, Phormidium ambiguum, and Lyngbya martensiana) of cyanobacteria were isolated and subjected to six different light irradiances (0, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 700 μmol photons·m- 2 ·S- 1) and three different temperature regimes (15, 25, and 35 °C). These species grow best at 25 °C to 35 °C and that they become light saturated at low light irradiances. ^ These seven species (and an additional isolate of O. amoena) were then tested for sensitivity to a potential new biological control agent, bacterium SG- 3. Bacterium SG- 3 lysed cells of all species tested. SG- 3 killed mats (algicidal activity) of O. amoena (# 5) and slowed the growth and spread (algistatic activity) of mats of the seven other isolates. Differences in sensitivity may be due to differences in <b>mat</b> <b>construction,</b> which may decrease penetration of the bacteria into the mat. Control was observed at 15, 25 and 35 °C and cutting mats of O. limosa into smaller pieces did not increase SG- 3 activity. Data indicated that applications of SG- 3 at 107 PFU·mL- 1 (plaque forming units·mL- 1) every 22 days should slow or prevent mat growth. ^ The planktonic cyanobacteria Pseudanabaena limnetica and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, were also sensitive to treatment with SG- 3. Two isolates of C. raciborskii were susceptible to low concentrations of SG- 3 (EC 50 = 1. 3 X 10 3 PFU·mL- 1), and the cyanobacterial populations tested were within population ranges normally encountered under bloom conditions. The data also indicated that slow or partial kill of a heavy bloom of C. raciborskii could be obtained by adjusting SG- 3 concentrations. ^ DNA sequence analysis (16 S rRNA) showed that SG- 3 is most closely related to Lysobacter brunescens (99 % homology). Experiments were conducted to determine the possible mode of action of SG- 3. The possibility that lytic activity is due to a bacteriophage or a secreted compound was not supported. The data suggested that like most lytic lysobacters, SG- 3 must come into brief contact with the cyanobacterial cell to cause lysis and that lysis may be due to enzymes present {{on the surface of the}} bacterium. Based on observations made from these studies, SG- 3 appears to be a viable candidate as an algaecide for many planktonic cyanobacteria and as an algistat for many mat-forming species. ...|$|R
