40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the details and}} results of the industrial scale experiments, motivated by theconstraint of integrating the low quality delayed coker light naphtha fraction stream into refinery. Practically all systems of the refinery processing structure were tested, looking for a suitablelocation for the further treatment of this light naphtha fraction. DCLN was processed in fourdifferent plants of the refinery: FCC unit, AV distillation unit, gas oil hydrotreater and finally in arevamped two-stage naphtha hydrotreating unit. As a final solution, blend of <b>coker</b> <b>naphtha</b> andstraight run naphtha was hydrotreated in two consecutive reactors over NiMo/Al 2 O 3 andCoMo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst respectively. A valuable feedstock, which is virtually free of diolefins, siliconand sulphur was produced from the inferior DCLN stream...|$|E
