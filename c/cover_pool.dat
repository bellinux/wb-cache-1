50|$|In their cover business, Pfandbrief banks grant {{property}} finance, public sector, {{ship and}} aircraft loans. Pfandbriefe {{have an average}} maturity of about five to seven years. While Pfandbriefe tend {{to be associated with}} asset-backed securities they are fundamentally different. Pfandbrief cover-assets remain on the bank's balance sheet. By contrast, asset-backed securities are typically off-balance-sheet transactions. Another difference: Pfandbrief cover pools are dynamic. Their composition can and usually does change over time, depending on the maturities and on the newly registered cover assets. Due to the stringent legal provisions that govern their issuance Pfandbriefe are deemed particularly safe. An independent <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> trustee appointed by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) records cover assets and cover asset replacements in the cover register. In the event of the Pfandbrief issuer's insolvency, Pfandbrief investors have a preferential claim on the cover assets in the cover register because <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> assets are not included in insolvency proceedings. There has not been a Pfandbrief default since 1901. Property financings may be included in the <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> only up to 60% of the prudently calculated mortgage lending value. The same holds true for ship and aircraft financings. Public sector loans are 100% eligible for cover.|$|E
40|$|Covered {{bonds are}} a {{specific}} example of senior secured debt. If the issuer of the bonds defaults {{the proceeds of}} the assets in the <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> are used for their debt service. If in this situation the <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> proceeds do not suffice for the debt service, the creditors of the bonds have recourse to the issuer's assets and their claims are pari passu with {{the claims of the}} creditors of senior unsecured debt. Historically, covered bonds have been very safe investments. During their more than two hundred years of existence, investors never suffered losses due to missed payments from covered bonds. From a risk management perspective, therefore modelling covered bonds losses is mainly of interest for estimating the impact that the asset encumbrance by the <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> has on the loss characteristics of the issuer's senior unsecured debt. We explore one-period structural modelling approaches for covered bonds and senior unsecured debt losses with one and two asset value variables respectively. Obviously, two-assets models with separate values of the <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> and the issuer's remaining portfolio allow for more realistic modelling. However, we demonstrate that exact calibration of such models may be impossible. We also investigate a one-asset model in which the riskiness of the <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> is reflected by a risk-based adjustment of the encumbrance ratio of the issuer's assets.

40|$|Yield spreads between German {{covered bonds}} (Pfandbriefe) and German {{government}} bonds usually have been interpreted as pure liquidity premia. In contrast, our analysis reveals that liquidity {{is the most}} important, but not the exclusive risk factor within the Pfandbrief market. We show that Pfandbrief yield spreads also depend {{on the quality of}} the issuer, the type of collateral, and the quality of the <b>cover</b> <b>pool.</b> In particular, it is surprising that the issuer’s default risk is priced considerably, even though Pfandbriefe are backed by high-quality mortgages or public-sector loans and a Pfandbrief default has never been occurred. Using recently published <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> data, we also show that the quality of the cover assets is less relevant in a normal market environment, but important in times of financial turmoil. Hence, Pfandbrief issuers with a sustainable <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> profit from lower refinancing cost, especially during market crises. JEL classification...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} risks in the Swedish mortgage portfolio, namely Swedish covered bonds, in a housing market decline. We develop a stress-model which estimates mortgages {{that needs to}} be withdrawn from the <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> to honor the covered bond contract. Further, we extend our model to restore the initial market risk profile in the <b>cover</b> <b>pool.</b> Lastly, we use S&P Globals ratings methodology to assess covered bonds’ credit ratings and credit enhancements. Our research suggest significant structural liquidity risk and maturity mismatch within the Swedish mortgage portfolio rather than credit risk. In a worst case scenario, a house price decline of 35 %, SEK 446 bn of cover assets would be withdrawn in order to honor the covered bond contract, an additional SEK 1380 bn to restore the market risk profile and SEK 286 bn to keep current ratings.

In this paper, we explore risk premia in the covered bond market and particularly investigate {{whether and how}} credit risk is priced. In extant literature, yield spreads between high-quality covered bonds and government bonds are often interpreted as pure liquidity premia. In contrast, we show that although liquidity is important, {{it is not the}} exclusive risk factor. Using a hand-collected data set of <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> information, we find that the credit quality of the cover assets is an important determinant of covered bond yield spreads.

40|$|Following the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, {{covered bonds}} (bank-issued debt instruments with credit en-hancements such as dual-recourse and dynamic <b>cover</b> <b>pool)</b> {{have been discussed}} {{as an alternative to}} mortgage-backed-securities (MBS) because of their potential of adding stability to the banking system. While being liquid is a key feature of the MBS market, the liquidity of covered bonds remains less well-understood by investors and academics. To better understand covered bonds, this project measures the liquidity of German covered bonds using transactional data and several common proxies. Results show that German covered bond liquidity is resilient: German covered bonds became less liquid after the Lehman Brothers default and recovered to the pre-crisis level in only one year. Surprisingly, jumbo covered bonds (a conventionally more liquid covered bond market) have lost their liquidity advantage since the onset of the financial crisis. Furthermore, al-though the covered bond market remained relatively liquid after the Lehman shock, the illiquidity risk premium has become larger post-Lehman compared to pre-Lehman, implying that investors require a higher compensation for holding illiquid covered bonds. The result of this study may have implications for countries that are new to covered bonds to emphasize on managing the liquidity of this market...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} explain {{different}} nature of the dynamics during the upward and downward part of the last house price cycle in Spain. Covered bonds are introduced as an instrument which may accelerate a house price boom, while it may {{also serve as a}} source of correction to overvalued house prices in downturn, where important rigidities may be present In a serious economic stress, lack of investment opportunities motivates investors to buy covered bonds due to the strong guarantees provided, which may in turn help to revitalize the credit and housing markets. To address such regime shift, house price dynamics is modelled within a framework of mutually related house price, credit and business cycles using smooth transition vector autoregressive model, in which volume of covered bonds issued is included. Linear behaviour of such system is rejected, indicating the need to model house prices in a nonlinear framework. Also, importance of modelling house prices in the context of credit and business cycles is confirmed and causality from issuance of covered bonds to house price dynamics is found in this nonlinear structure. Finally, potential threat to financial stability resulting from rising asset encumbrance both in the upward and downward part of the house price cycle is identified. It is suggested that the collateral valuation used for the dynamic adjustment of the <b>cover</b> <b>pool</b> is done using forward looking predictions of house prices and that the rate of asset encumbrance is monitored jointly with stress testing the house prices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [...] We {{evaluated}} summer habitat use {{of large}} brown trout Salmo trutta (TL> 380 mm) in pools and stream reaches of southeast Minnesota to test an earlier summer habitat model, to identify other important variables, {{and to develop}} a habitat quality classification to guide large trout management. We collected 224 large trout in 126 of 581 pools in 41 stream reaches during 2003 and 2004. The probability (P 2) that a large brown trout was present in a pool was positively associated with the pres-ence of water deeper than 90 cm, instream rock, overhead bank cover, and woody de-bris in a logistic regression model. Similarly, large trout abundance in pools was best predicted with a Poisson regression model with four variables (area of water deeper than 60 cm, length of overhead bank <b>cover,</b> <b>pool</b> width, and area of instream rock). Streambank riprap was not significantly associated with either large trout presence or abundance in pools. Large trout abundance in stream reaches increased linearly with mean P 2 -value, which explained 54 % of the variation among study reaches. We cate-gorized habitat quality of stream reaches into four classes based on mean P 2 -values. In large streams (> 0. 43 m 3 /s), with poor to fair habitat quality, habitat management should increase water deeper than 90 cm, instream rock, overhead bank cover, and woody debris. Habitat management for large trout in smaller streams (< 0. 43 m 3 /s) is more complex and may simply be more limited. Managers may have to recognize the limited biological potential in these systems and prioritize large trout management ob-jectives to larger streams...|$|E
40|$|Management of {{in-channel}} woody debris after wildfire is controversial. Post-fire {{increases in}} stream discharges can cause more frequent downstream flooding. The resulting heightened transport and accumulation of debris can wash out bridges and cause other damage. Inchannel debris is sometimes removed or cut into smaller pieces to expedite flushing {{through the system}} and to avoid debris jam formation. Biotic values of debris for fish <b>cover,</b> <b>pool</b> formation, sediment storage, and food sources for invertebrates and microorganisms are lost or reduced, however, when debris is removed or cut up. Information on debris dynamics after wildfire in the Sierra Nevada is scant. Changes in debris frequency, mobility, volume, aggregation, and carbon loading after a 1994 wildfire in the eastern Sierra Nevada were quantified by before and after comparative measurements at Badenaugh Creek in northern California, and by comparing selected attributes to a nearby “reference ” stream. Fifty-seven percent of wood volume, and 25 percent of the pieces, were consumed by the fire. The fire reduced aquatic carbon loading from about 2 to 1 times terrestrial loading after the fire. Although more pieces moved 1 year after the fire at Badenaugh Creek than in the control stream, the size and number of debris jams both immediately and 1 year after the fire were appreciably reduced from pre-fire levels, probably because fewer pieces were available to form aggregates. Decisions on the disposition of post-fire debris must consider the interaction between fire intensity, channel width, {{and the size of}} the remaining wood. If few pieces of channel-spanning length remain after a fire, they may pose relatively little downstream danger...|$|E

40|$|Scotts Creek, in Santa Cruz County, Calif., {{supports}} the southernmost extant population of Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in North America. In 1997, the California Department of Fish and Game (now Fish and Wildlife) conducted an extensive habitat typing survey of mainstem Scotts Creek, describing all habitat units {{from the top}} of the estuary to the limit of anadromy approximately 12 km upstream. I repeated this survey in 2013 to (1) assess changes in the quantity and quality of instream habitat, (2) compare the current condition to goals and standards established in the federal Central California Coast (CCC) Coho Salmon Recovery Plan, and (3) identify opportunities for possible future restoration. A comparison of the two surveys revealed an overall increase in mean canopy cover, mean bank vegetation, mean percentage instream <b>cover,</b> <b>pool</b> depth diversity, and percentage riffles since 1997, and decreases in mean residual pool depth, percentage flatwater, and number of primary pools. Overall, the percentage of the total mainstem classified as pool habitat did not change between the two survey periods. Results for individual habitat metrics were more variable when the stream was broken into discrete reaches delineated by major tributary junctions. Although a large woody debris (LWD) survey was not conducted as part of the 1997 survey, contrasting our results with data collected during intervening years indicated that instream LWD has become more abundant, primarily due to increases in hard-wood species (i. e., red alder [Alnus rubra] and California bay [Umbellularia californica]). When compared to habitat goals established in the federal CCC Coho Salmon Recovery Plan, Scotts Creek has adequate canopy cover and percentage pools, but is lacking in percentage riffles, instream cover, key pieces of LWD per 100 m, and percentage primary pools...|$|E
40|$|India's charismatic {{wildlife}} {{species are}} facing immense pressure from anthropogenic-induced environmental perturbations. Zoos {{play a major}} role in the conservation of threatened species, but their adaptation in captivity is posing a major challenge globally. Stress from inadequate adaptation could lead to suppression of cognitive functioning and increased display of stereotypic behaviour. It is thus necessary to measure biological traits like behaviour, stress physiology, and contextual factors driving the animals maintained at zoos. In this study, we assessed stereotypic behaviour and stress physiology employing standard behaviour scoring, non-invasive stress monitoring, and their contextual drivers in a sub-population of two large felid species managed in six Indian zoos. The prevalence and intensity of stereotypic behaviours and levels of faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) were ascertained among 41 Royal Bengal tigers Panthera tigris tigris and 21 Indian leopards Panthera pardus fusca between April 2014 and March 2015. Behavioural observations showed that tigers spent more time stereotyping (12 %) than leopards (7 %) during daylight hours. Stress levels assessed using FCM revealed that tigers (23. 6 ± 1. 62 ng/g) had marginally lower level of corticosterone metabolites than leopards (27. 2 ± 1. 36 ng/g). Stereotypic behaviour increased significantly with FCM level when the effect of heath status was controlled in tigers, and the effects tree cover, stone, den and keeper attitude controlled in leopards. Comparison of stereotypes of tigers with various biological and environmental factors using binary logistic regression revealed that stereotypic prevalence decreased with increased enclosure size, and enclosure enrichments like presence of pools and stones, when managed socially with conspecifics, and with positive keeper attitude, these factors accounting for 43 % of variations in stereotypic prevalence among tigers. Stereotype among leopards was significantly absent when associated with increased tree cover and presence of pool, and den in the enclosure, age and among zoo-born than wild-born ones. These factors explain 81 % of variations in stereotypic prevalence in them. A comparison of FCM levels with context-dependent factors revealed that stress levels among tigers decreased significantly with enclosure size and with individuals from nil to low, and severity of health issues. These factors explain 64 % of variations in FCM levels. In leopards, the presence of stones in the enclosure and keepers with positive attitude resulted in significant decrease in FCM levels, these factors together accounting for 94 % of variations. Multiple regressions on selected variables based on Factor Analysis of Mixed Data showed that in tigers the intensity of stereotype decreased significantly with enclosure size, sociality and positive keeper attitude and FCM level with health problems. Similarly, analyses in leopards revealed that intensity of stereotype decreased significantly with tree cover, age and FCM level with positive keeper attitude. Overall, our study suggests that to reduce stereotypes and stress level, tigers in captivity should be managed in larger enclosures enriched with pool, and stones, and in appropriate social conditions with adequate veterinary care. Leopards should be managed in enclosures with dense tree <b>cover,</b> <b>pool,</b> stones and den. Positive keeper attitude plays a crucial role in the welfare of both the species in captivity. Our study is promising and is comparable with their natural behaviour in the wild; for example, tigers require larger natural habitats, while leopards can manage even with smaller isolated patches but with dense vegetation cover...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were two fold; first to {{evaluate}} the degree of microbial contamination of the exposed and <b>covered</b> <b>pools</b> with selected groups of bacteria (major indices of water contamination) and second to assess the relationship between the degree of contamination and variables such as the mean value of residual chlorine, pH, temperature, etc. in the pools. Accordingly, numerous water samples were taken from all active pools and using the standard methods, were analyzed for bacteriologic and physicochemical properties. The data indicate that 51. 3 % of the total samples were contaminated with Pseudomonas. Furthermore, 16. 6, 11 and 7 % of the total samples were contaminated with Escherichia coli, fecal coliforms and streptococci, respectively. The mean value of residual chlorine in Pseudomonas contaminated samples was 0. 45 mg L - 1. However, the corresponding value for non-contaminated samples was 1. 052 mg L - 1 and the difference was statistically significant (p< 0. 02). Similarly, 26. 3 % of the samples collected from the <b>covered</b> <b>pools</b> and 53. 9 % of those collected from exposed pools were contaminated with Pseudomonas. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that {{there was a significant difference}} (p< 0. 02) between the degree of contamination with Pseudomonas in exposed pools as compared to that of <b>covered</b> <b>pools.</b> Additionally, our data show that the source of water supply is also a major determinant of the degree of contamination. Surprisingly, public pools filled with well water were found to be less contaminated with different germs as compared to those filled with normal tap water. Moreover, the mean value of residual chlorine in E. coli contaminated samples was significantly different (p< 0. 0008) from that of non-contaminated samples. Exposed pools were found to be more contaminated with E. coli than <b>covered</b> <b>pools.</b> However, this difference could be attributed to a significant difference between the mean values of residual chlorine in these two different types of pools. Similar observations were made for contaminated and non-contaminated samples with fecal streptococci and coliforms. There was an inverse relationship between the number of coliforms and the mean value of residual chlorine in the pools. In conclusion, the observation that public pools in Shiraz, apart from a few exceptions, were generally contaminated with different germs, calls for a more strict supervision on the pools by the health authorities. In the absence of such supervision, contaminated pools continue to pose a significant risk to the health of swimmers...|$|R
