50|$|Like the <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus,</b> the pygmy hippo {{emerges from}} the water at dusk to feed. It relies on game trails to travel through dense forest vegetation. It marks trails by vigorously waving its tail while defecating to further spread its feces. The pygmy hippo spends about {{six hours a day}} {{foraging}} for food.|$|R
50|$|While the <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> {{was known}} to Europeans since {{classical}} antiquity, the pygmy hippopotamus was unknown outside its range in West Africa until the 19th century. Due to their nocturnal, forested existence, they were poorly known within their range as well. In Liberia the animal was traditionally known as a water cow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{skeleton}} of C. liberiensis is more [...] {{than that of}} the <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus,</b> meaning their bones are proportionally thinner. The common hippo's spine is parallel with the ground; the pygmy hippo's back slopes forward, a likely adaptation to pass more easily through dense forest vegetation. Proportionally, the pygmy hippo's legs and neck are longer and its head smaller.|$|R

5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus,</b> H. lemerlei was much smaller, {{roughly the size of}} the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk through the process of insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> is semiaquatic, inhabiting rivers, {{lakes and}} {{mangrove}} swamps, where territorial bulls preside over {{a stretch of}} river and groups of five to thirty females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near {{each other in the}} water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land.|$|R
50|$|Pygmy hippos are herbivorous. They {{do not eat}} aquatic {{vegetation}} to {{a significant}} extent and rarely eat grass because it is uncommon in the thick forests they inhabit. The bulk of a pygmy hippo's diet consists of ferns, broad-leaved plants and fruits that have fallen to the forest floor. The wide variety of plants pygmy hippos have been observed eating suggests that they will eat any plants available. This diet is of higher quality {{than that of the}} <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> {{has been}} known to use dung middens as a social tool. The middens are created and {{maintained}} by bulls to mark territorial boundaries. To mark their scent upon a midden, the bull will approach the midden in reverse and simultaneously defecate and urinate on the mound, using its tail to disperse, or paddle, the excrement. This action is called dung showering and thought to assert dominance. The middens, usually several feet across, are constantly maintained during the bulls' travels in the night and day.|$|R
40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> (Hippopotamus amphibious Linn. 1758) {{contributes}} to the productivity of aquatic systems where it lives. This paper reviews ecological roles of the hippo in this regard. Desk review of available literature information complemented with field observations were employed in the data collection. The ecological roles of the <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> being presented draw examples from East, West, Central and South African sub regions. The nutritional importance of the amphibious hippopotamus to rural communities was highlighted. In Southern Ethiopia, the Bodi, Bacha and Mura tribes eat hippo meat and {{this has led to}} severe hunting consequences on the wild populations of the animal. The important relationships between the hippopotamus and fish were presented. Hippopotamuses usually defecate in water and their excrements enrich the nutrients in the water resulting in favourable conditions for large fish populations. Some fish, including Labeo spp. were observed to feed on the micro-organisms and algae that grow on the skin of the hippotamus. A strong case was made for hippo-cum-fish integrated farm development in Nigeria based on ecological relationships so observed between the amphibious mammals and fish. This is one of the meeting points of fisheries and wildlife management that should be exploited for the benefits of the teeming Nigerian populatio...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{living species}} of {{hippopotamus}} in two genera; the pygmy hippo, Choeropsis liberiensis {{of the forests}} of west Africa, and the <b>common</b> hippo, <b>Hippopotamus</b> amphibius.|$|R
50|$|The {{behavior}} of the pygmy hippo differs from the common hippo in many ways. Much of its behavior is more {{similar to that of}} a tapir, though this is an effect of convergent evolution. While the <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> is gregarious, pygmy hippos live either alone or in small groups, typically a mated pair or a mother and calf. Pygmy hippos tend to ignore each other rather than fight when they meet. Field studies have estimated that male pygmy hippos range over 1.85 km2, while the range of a female is 0.4 to(-) 0.6 km2.|$|R
50|$|The pygmy hippo is reclusive and nocturnal. It {{is one of}} {{only two}} extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being its much larger relative, the <b>common</b> <b>{{hippopotamus}}</b> (Hippopotamus amphibius). The pygmy hippopotamus displays many terrestrial adaptations, but like the hippo, it is semiaquatic and relies on water to keep its skin moist and its body temperature cool. Behaviors such as mating and giving birth may occur in water or on land. The pygmy hippo is herbivorous, feeding on ferns, broad-leaved plants, grasses, and fruits it finds in the forests.|$|R
50|$|The Jungle Cruise (known as the Safari Boat until 2011) is a {{short trip}} around Half Mile Lake.

The lake is also home to two <b>Common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> and a group of Californian sea lions and visitors may purchase food for the latter, which are commonly seen following the boats.|$|R
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> inhabits rivers, {{lakes and}} {{mangrove}} swamps, where territorial bulls preside over {{a stretch of}} river and groups of five to thirty females and young.

While hippopotamuses rest near {{each other in the}} water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land. The hippopotamus is a highly aggressive and unpredictable animal and has attacked humans. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> {{gives birth}} and mates {{only in the}} water, but pygmy hippos mate and give birth on both land and water. Young pygmy hippos can swim almost immediately. At birth, pygmy hippos weigh 4.5-6.2 kg (9.9-13.7 lb) with males {{weighing}} about 0.25 kg (0.55 lb) more than females. Pygmy hippos are fully weaned between six and eight months of age; before weaning they do not accompany their mother when she leaves the water to forage, but instead hide in the water by themselves. The mother returns to the hiding spot about {{three times a day}} and calls out for the calf to suckle. Suckling occurs with the mother lying on her side.|$|R

Monitoring of species for conservation is then essential, and the development of census protocols has to be chased. UAV technology is considering as one of the new perspectives for wildlife survey. Indeed, this technique has many advantages but its main drawback is the generation of a huge amount of data to handle. This study aims at developing an algorithm for automatic count of hippos, by exploiting thermal infrared aerial images acquired from UAV. This attempt is the first known for automatic detection of this species. Images taken at several flight heights can be used as inputs of the algorithm, ranging from 38 to 155 meters above ground level. A Graphical User Interface has been created in order to facilitate the use of the application. Three categories of animals have been defined following their position in water.

40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> Hippopotamus amphibius can {{significantly}} influence {{the dynamics of}} ecosystems and engender serious conflicts with people but, in Kenya, one of the species strongholds, it has been little studied or monitored. We surveyed the hippopotamus population in the Masai Mara National Reserve and the adjoining pastoral ranches in 2006 using foot counts along 155. 3 km of the main rivers. We counted 4, 170 hippopotamuses in 171 schools. Comparisons with earlier surveys suggest that this population increased by 169. 6 % between 1971 and 1980 within the reserve and, although it did not increase within the reserve during 1980 ‚Äì 2006, it increased by 359. 4 % outside the reserve during this period {{against a background of}} deteriorating habitat conditions. The overall density in 2006 was 26. 9 hippopotamuses km- 1 of river, equivalent to a biomass of 26, 677 kg km- 1 of river. The ratio of calves to 100 adults was 9 : 100 inside the reserve, 10 : 100 outside the reserve and 6 : 100 along tributaries of the Mara River, implying that the population is either increasing or that its spatial distribution is being compressed because of range contraction. The apparent increase in the hippopotamus population contrasts with marked contemporaneous declines in the populations of most other large mammalian herbivore species in the Reserve. We discuss possible reasons underlying the increase in the hippopotamus population. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} {{intake and}} digestibility studies in four <b>common</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> amphibius) and four pygmy (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) hippos from two zoological institutions, using acid detergent lignin as an internal marker for the quantification of faecal output. In {{the case of}} one pygmy hippo, where total faecal collection was also possible, there was no distinct {{difference between the two}} methods of faecal output quantification. Two animals from each species were tested on a conventional zoo diet of hay and concentrates (diet HC) and on hay only (diet H). The other two animals received fresh grass at two different levels of intake (diets G 1 and G 2). Dry matter (DM) intake was higher on HC than on H or G diets, and averaged 37 +/- 11 for common and 35 +/- 14 g/kg(0. 75) for pygmy hippos. There were no species differences in the average digestibility (aD) coefficients. Non-dietary faecal nitrogen averaged 65 +/- 4 % of total faecal nitrogen, aD of crude protein (CP) averaged 67 +/- 9 % and true protein digestibility 89 +/- 3 %. Average digestibility of DM and crude fibre averaged 54 +/- 11 % and 45 +/- 17 %, respectively. In comparison with ruminants, hippos generally achieve lower aD for DM, organic matter and fibre parameters, but equal or higher aD CP coefficients. This is most likely due to the absence of significant fermentative activity in the hindgut and the corresponding low metabolic faecal nitrogen losses. Digestible energy intake was higher on HC than on H or G diets and averaged 0. 30 +/- 0. 11 MJ/kg(0. 75) metabolic body mass. This value is extremely low for ungulates, supporting earlier suspicions that hippos have particularly low metabolic rates, and explains the proneness of this species to obesity in captivity when fed energy-dense pelleted feeds...|$|R
50|$|A moose's diet often {{depends on}} its location, {{but they seem to}} prefer the new growths from {{deciduous}} trees with a high sugar content, such as white birch, trembling aspen and striped maple, among many others. They also eat many aquatic plants such as lilies and water milfoil. To reach high branches, a moose may bend small saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth or body. For larger trees a moose may stand erect and walk upright on its hind legs, allowing it to reach plants 4.26 m off the ground. Moose are excellent swimmers and are known to wade into water to eat aquatic plants. Moose are thus attracted to marshes and river banks during warmer months as both provide suitable vegetation to eat and water to bathe in. Moose have been known to dive underwater to reach plants on lake bottoms, and the complex snout may assist the moose in this type of feeding. Moose are the only deer that are capable of feeding underwater.Hippopotamuses leave the water at dusk and travel inland, sometimes up to 10 km, to graze on short grasses, their main source of food. They spend four to five hours grazing and can consume 68 kg of grass each night. Like almost any herbivore, they consume other plants if presented with them, but their diet consists almost entirely of grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. The pygmy hippopotamus emerges from the water at dusk to feed. It relies on game trails to travel through dense forest vegetation. It marks trails by vigorously waving its tail while defecating to further spread its feces. The pygmy hippo spends about six hours a day foraging for food, and they do not eat aquatic vegetation to a significant extent and rarely eat grass because it is uncommon in the thick forests they inhabit. The bulk of a pygmy hippo's diet consists of ferns, broad-leaved plants and fruits that have fallen to the forest floor.

40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> (Hippopotamus amphibius) is {{endemic to}} Africa but {{threatened}} by range restriction, exploitation and competition with humans and domestic livestock {{for access to}} critical resources such as fresh water and grazing. Collectively these impacts have resulted in population declines throughout most of their range with the consequence that hippos are classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red list. Despite these threats to their persistence and their important ecological role as ecosystem engineers there have been surprisingly few studies concerning factors that influence their current distribution and habitat use. Such research is important for developing effective conservation and management plans to improve the protection of vulnerable and ecologically important species such as hippo. South Africa is {{home to one of}} a few growing hippo populations and one of the last persisting in an estuarine habitat. The St Lucia Estuary, one of three Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance located in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park (itself a UNESCO World Heritage site), in northern KwaZulu-Natal is not only the largest estuarine system in Africa, but is also home to one of South Africa's largest hippo populations. In this study I explore aspects of the spatial and behavioural ecology of hippo within the St Lucia Estuary. More specifically, I investigate select abiotic and biotic predictors of hippo presence and the frequency with which they return to their diurnal lie-up sites. I used binary logistic regression models to evaluate the effects of the selected habitat features on hippo occurrence at two spatial scales (broad and fine). I used a negative binomial with log-link model to evaluate the effects of the selected habitat features on the frequency of use of sites (hippo persistence) in the fine-scale study. In addition, I employed both instantaneous scan sampling and continuous sampling methods in an attempt to determine the diurnal activity budgets and social interactions of a single group near the mouth of the St Lucia Estuary. I used non-parametric tests to evaluate differences in behaviour with daytime and across sampling days with a view to an improved understanding of how the environment influences the behaviour of hippo in an environment subject to ongoing human modification...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePolystomatid flatworms (Platyhelminthes) are monogenean parasites that infect {{exclusively}} aquatic or semi-aquatic sarcopterygians {{such as the}} Australian lungfish, amphibians, {{freshwater turtles}} and the African <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus.</b> Previous studies on the phylogenetic relationships of these parasites, excluding Oculotrema <b>hippopotami</b> infecting <b>common</b> hippos, showed a global coevolution between hosts and their parasites at a macroevolutionary scale. These studies also demonstrated {{a strong correlation between}} the diversification of early neobatrachian polystomes and Gondwana breakup in the Mesozoic period. However the origin of chelonian polystomes is still in question as a switch from presumably primitive aquatic amniotes to turtles {{at the time of their}} first appearance, or soon after during their radiation, was assumed. In order to resolve this sticking point, we extended the phylogeny of polystomes with broader parasite sampling, i. e. 55 polystome species including Nanopolystoma tinsleyi a polystome infecting caecilians and O. hippopotami, and larger set of sequence data covering two nuclear and two mitochondrial genes coding for the ribosomal RNA 18 S and 28 S, the Cytochrome c Oxidase I and the ribosomal RNA 12 S, respectively. The secondary structure of nuclear rRNAs genes (stems and loops) was taken into account for sequence alignments and Bayesian analyses were performed based on the appropriate models of evolution selected independently for the four designed partitions. Molecular calibrations were also conducted for dating the main speciation events in the polystome tree. The phylogenetic position of chelonian parasites that are phylogenetically closer to N. tinsleyi than all other amphibian polystomes and molecular time estimates suggest that these parasites originated following a switch from caecilians, at a geological period when primitive turtles may already have adapted to an aquatic life style, i. e. at about 178 Million years ago, or a little later when the crown group of extant turtles have already diversified, i. e. at about 152 Mya. Similarly, because O. hippopotami constitutes the sister group of chelonian parasites, proposing that an African caecilian could be the ancestral host for this polystome species seems at this stage the most likely hypothesis to explain its occurrence within the common hippo. Regardless of the scenario that may be predicted to explain the origin of polystomes within aquatic or semi-aquatic amniotes, their presence and evolution are indicative of early aquatic ecological habits within ancestral lineages...|$|R
40|$|Although {{several aspects}} of the {{digestive}} physiology of the hippopotamidae-non-ruminating foregut fermenters-have been described, ingesta kinetics and passage characteristics of these species are not well understood. The most outstanding feature of the hippo digestive physiology reported so far is the very long mean ingesta retention times (MRTs) measured by Foose [Foose, T., 1982. Trophic strategies of ruminant versus nonruminant ungulates. PhD dissertation, University of Chicago, Chicago. ]. Since those data had been investigated with animals without water access, we intended to measure MRT in hippos which were allowed to enter water pools during the night. MRT parameters as well as dry matter (DM) digestibility were determined in four <b>common</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> amphibius) and four pygmy hippos (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) on two different diets each using cobalt ethylendiamintetraacetate (Co-EDTA) as a fluid, chromium (Cr) -mordanted fibre (< 2 mm) as a particle and acid detergent lignin (ADL) as an internal digestibility marker. Four of the animals additionally received cerium (Ce) -mordanted fibres (2 - 10 mm) as particle markers. Total MRTs for fluids and particles ranged between 20 - 35 and 48 - 106 h in the common and between 13 - 39 and 32 - 107 h in the pygmy hippos. The difference between fluid and particle retention was greater than usually reported in ruminants. Excretion patterns of the markers differed from those usually observed in ruminants but resembled those reported for macropods (kangaroos), indicating a plug-flow reactor-like physiology in the hippo forestomach (FRST). This finding complements other described similarities between the macropod and the hippo forestomach. The measurements of larger particle retention profiles suggest that in the hippo, larger particles might be excreted either faster or {{at the same rate}} as smaller particles, indicating a general difference between ruminants and hippos with respect to differential particle retention. The digestive physiology of hippos is characterised by a generally low food intake, long ingesta retention times and dry matter digestibilities lower than reported in ruminants. Moderate digestibilities in spite of long retention times might be the result of the generally high average ingesta particle size in hippos. The comparatively easy management of pygmy hippos, together with the significant correlations between food intake, MRT and digestibility in the pygmy hippos of this study, recommends this species for further studies on the interplay of these parameters in herbivore digestive physiology...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the abundance, distribution, and population trends of the <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> (Hippopotamus amphibius) in the Gonarezhou National Park (GNP), Zimbabwe, we (i) carried out an aerial survey along sections of major perennial rivers, namely Runde, Save and Mwenezi and other inland water pans, and (ii) analysed the long-term aerial survey data (1965 ‚Äì 2008). For the aerial survey, a Piper PA- 18 Super Cub aircraft was flown once along {{each of the}} three major rivers and associated pans in November 2008. We recorded a total of 187 hippos and 19 groups in the GNP. All sightings were in Runde River, Tambohata Pan and Massasanya Dam (density = 2. 4 hippos/km). We found three trends in hippo populations in the GNP for the period 1965 ‚Äì 2008. First, the period 1965 ‚Äì 1982 was characterized by {{a significant increase in the}} hippo population (simple linear regression: loge[hippo population estimate] = 0. 05 [year] - 89. 01; F 1, 13 = 56. 26, P < 0. 001, R 2 = 0. 81; average annual exponential rate of increase [r] = 0. 05, 95 % confidence interval [CI] for r = 0. 03 ‚Äì 0. 06); second, the period 1983 ‚Äì 1997 was characterized by a significant hippo population decline (simple linear regression: loge[hippo population estimate] = 355. 87 ‚Äì 0. 18 [year]; F 1, 10 = 10. 44, P < 0. 001, R 2 = 0. 51; r = - 0. 18, 95 % CI for r = - 0. 30 to - 0. 05) and thirdly, r between two survey counts in 1997 and 2008 was 0. 06. We attributed the overall decline in hippo abundance, the disappearance of the hippos in the Mwenezi River, and their huge decline in the Save River in the GNP primarily to past droughts, siltation and persecution in adjacent communal areas. We recommend collaborative efforts by the relevant authorities to ensure a continuous flow of water in the Mwenezi River. This will allow for the maintenance of hippo habitats downstream of the Manyuchi Dam, thus creating conducive environment for the re-establishment of the hippos in the Mwenezi River section in GNP. We also recommend that GNP's management should continue to monitor the hippo population and distribution in the park's major rivers and natural pans...|$|R
40|$|With {{a growing}} human {{population}} {{as well as}} a changing lifestyle, the conflict of wildlife and humans is intensifying. In Kenya, Maasais and their livestock have for a long time coexisted with wildlife, but an adjustment to privately own land and cultivation might rapidly change the terms for this coexistence. To understand how the Maasais and their livestock affect the wildlife in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and the surrounding area, this study was undertaken. The purpose of this thesis is to examine how hippos are concerned. The <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> (Hippopotamus amphibius) {{is one of the biggest}} herbivores, and has a very specialized feeding strategy. To avoid the high temperature and solar radiation during daytime, they stay in or close to water; in wetlands, rivers or lakes. When the sun sets and temperature drops they leave the watercourses to graze through the night. The hippo is considered vulnerable, and the IUCN Hippo Specialist Group has found three primary threats to the common hippo; conflict with humans over preferable areas, export of hippo teeth, and poaching. The biggest threat to hippos is believed to be loss of water habitat because of human activity, especially in conjunction with droughts. This thesis also wants to high light how hippos could be affected by humans, not only in water by damming or similar actions but on land while grazing. The study was carried out in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and the adjoining group ranch, Koiyaki GR, in south-western Kenya. The area studied was covered ground rich in grass, both within and outside the park; hence the effect of livestock grazing was evident. The observations were conducted during December 2003 and May-June 2004, because of the great difference in grass quality and grass availability between the seasons. Sadly, the most striking about the hippos is the lack of research, and in this thesis a number of future research areas are pointed out. This is in hope to better understand the grazing habits and life style of this megaherbivore, especially how and where they chose to graze. With this investigated, more secure conclusions can be drawn of how Maasai life affects the hippo population in Maasai Mara. When this is known, predictions can be made for how hippos will be affected of a changing Maasai lifestyle. The results of the study show that hippos do avoid land intensively grazed by livestock, though they are present in the area. Even though seen in the river close to settlements, they were not observed on the nearby transects. This could be interpreted as hippos do not avoid the presence of neither people nor livestock, but they chose to graze at other sites. Evidently, hippos are nocturnal grazers and no hippos were recorded on transects between 06 : 00 and 18 : 00. In both seasons, the majority of animals were observed before midnight, indicating that hippos continue to grass outside of the study area...|$|R
