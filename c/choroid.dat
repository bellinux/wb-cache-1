5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the <b>choroid</b> plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the <b>choroid</b> plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the <b>choroid</b> plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the <b>choroid</b> plexus, the epithelial cells lining the <b>choroid</b> plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
5|$|Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is {{produced}} by the <b>choroid</b> plexus. The <b>choroid</b> plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, and occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly from the tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in <b>choroid</b> plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the <b>choroid</b> plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences <b>choroid</b> plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E

5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. <b>Choroid</b> plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the <b>choroid</b> endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, {{mesoderm}} and endoderm.

5|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day.

5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the <b>choroid</b> plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the <b>choroid</b> plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the effects of a {{continuous}} exposure of 9 months old mice to a 50 Hz magnetic field (MF) with flux densities of 1 mT, 0, 1 mT, or 0 mT (controls) on specific brain cells (epithelial cells of the <b>choroids</b> plexus of the II. and IV. Ventricle, granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and cortical endothelial cells. This was carried out by analysing autoradiographs after injection of ³H-thymidine (TdR) concerning nuclear (n) unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA synthesis in order to obtain information on MF induced nDNA damage and its repair as well as the cell metabolism. 80 male mice (NMRI strain) were randomly divided into four groups, In group I and II, the MF exposure was 1 mT (I) or 0. 1 mT (II). Group III was the control group, i. e. sham-exposed with 0 mT. After the end of the MF-exposure or sham-exposure, the mice were injected with ³H-TdR, either after 5 minutes (Group A), or 24 hours (Group B) or 7 days (Group C). After paraffin embedding 3 µm thick paramedian, sagittal sections were cut, and subsequently autoradiographs prepared (exposure time: 250 d at 4 °C). 100 consecutive cells per cell type and animal were analysed concerning nuclear and cytoplasmic grain numbers as well as the corresponding profile areas. For background correction cells of six mice without MF-exposure and without ³H-TdR injection were examined additionally. The statistical analyses included univariance analyses and subsequent post-hoc t-tests with so-called Bonferroni-corrections. Furthermore, the new data and those of a preceding pilot study (Schmitz et al., 2004) were combined in order to carry out regression analyses. Regarding the effects of the different MF doses on UDS, only the epithelial cells of the <b>choroids</b> plexus (of both ventricles) showed significant results. Surprisingly, UDS was significantly (p< 0. 05) smaller after exposure to 1 mT than 0 mT. This was probably caused by effects unrelated to the MF-exposure. In contrast, the results of linear and quadratic regression analyses led suppose that only MF-exposure with more than 1 mT leads to DNA damage in the epithelial cells of the <b>choroids</b> plexus. However, no harmful effects of MF-exposure could be detected on the hippocampal granule cells. The cytoplasmic labelling of the epithelial cells of the <b>choroids</b> plexus also showed a significant decline between 0 mT and 1 mT MF-exposure. Since the data obtained showed a good correlation with the quadratic regression model, it can be assumed that – as in the case of UDS – MF-exposure with a dose higher than 1 mT leads to an increased cellular metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the pathogenesis of}} transient myopia after blunt eye trauma. Methods: In one patient, the refraction of both eyes (the left eye was injured, but the right eye was not) was measured with an autorefractometer. The cycloplegic refraction was measured at the early stage of trauma and again 3 months after the blunt eye injury. The angle and depth of the anterior chamber, the ciliary body, and the <b>choroids</b> were examined by ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) over 3 months. The depth of the anterior chamber, {{the thickness of the}} lens, and the axial length were measured by A‐scan ultrasonography in both eyes. During the 3 months after the injury, we made comparisons between the menifest and the cycloplegic refractions, the depths of anterior chambers, the thickness of the lenses, the axial lengths, and the UBM-determined appearances of the angles and depths of the anterior chambers, the ciliary bodies, and the <b>choroids</b> in both eyes. Results: We suspect that the depth reduction in the anterior chamber, the increase in anterior to posterior lens diameter, and the edema in the ciliary body are all related to the change in the refractive power following the blunt trauma. Conclusions: Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and ultrasonography of the anterior segment in the eye may be helpful to diagnose and confirm changes in the refractive power that occur after trauma...|$|R
40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is a common}} disease that can result in severe visual impairment. Abnormal regulation of the complement system has been implicated in its pathogenesis, and CFH polymorphisms contribute substantially to risk. How these polymorphisms exert their effects is poorly understood. We performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis on young, aged, and AMD <b>choroids</b> to determine the abundance of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and performed immunofluorescence studies on eyes from 117 donors to evaluate the MAC in aging, early AMD, and advanced AMD. Morphometric studies were performed on eyes with high- or low-risk CFH genotypes. ELISA confirmed that MAC increases significantly with aging and with AMD. MAC was localized to Bruch’s membrane and the choriocapillaris and was detectable at low levels as early as 5 years of age. Hard drusen were labeled with anti-MAC antibody, but large or confluent drusen and basal deposits were generally unlabeled. Labeling of retinal pigment epithelium was observed in some cases of advanced AMD, but not in early disease. Eyes homozygous for the high-risk CFH genotype had thinner <b>choroids</b> than low-risk homozygotes (P <  0. 05). These findings suggest that increased complement activation in AMD and in high-risk genotypes can lead to loss of endothelial cells in early AMD.

Methods: Wistar rats (n= 40) received a footpad injection of 200 μg of Vibrio cholera lipopolysaccharide (LPS), {{and the intensity of}} anterior segment inflammation was evaluated after the LPS injection. Ten rats each were killed 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after injection. Ten normal Wistar rats were killed as controls (0 h). The iris-ciliary body complex and <b>choroids</b> from each eye were removed and subdivided into segments. Immunohistochemical localization of TLR 4 and a resident tissue macrophage marker, cluster of differentiation 163 (CD 163), was performed on whole mount isolated iris-ciliary body complexes and <b>choroids.</b> TLR 4 + and CD 163 + cells in the iris were manually counted, and the cell density (cells/mm 2) was calculated.
