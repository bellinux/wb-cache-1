25|$|A state's {{exclusive}} {{economic zone}} starts at the seaward edge of its territorial sea and extends outward to a distance of 200 nautical miles (370.4km) from the baseline. The {{exclusive economic zone}} stretches much further into sea than the territorial waters, which end at 12 nmi (22km) from the coastal baseline (if following the rules {{set out in the}} UN Convention on the Law of the Sea). Thus, the exclusive economic zones includes the <b>contiguous</b> <b>zone.</b> States also have rights to the seabed of what is called the continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles (648km) from the coastal baseline, beyond the exclusive economic zones, but such areas are not part of their exclusive economic zones. The legal definition of the continental shelf does not directly correspond to the geological meaning of the term, as it also includes the continental rise and slope, and the entire seabed within the exclusive economic zone.|$|E
25|$|A marine {{border dispute}} with Russia in the Barents Sea since 1978 was settled when Stoltenberg and President of Russia Dimitry Medvedev signed an {{agreement}} on 27 April 2010 in Oslo. The agreement is a compromise, which divides a disputed area of around 175,000 km2 (68,000 sq mi) into two approximately equally sized parts. However, the agreement still needs ratification by the State Duma and the Parliament of Norway {{in order to be}} implemented. Whereas Norway had previously insisted on a border in accordance with the equidistance principle, which is recognized in international law, specifically the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea Article 15 and the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the <b>Contiguous</b> <b>Zone</b> Article 6, Russia invoked a Stalin-era decree of the Soviet Union from 1926, which was not recognised by any other country. The new agreement replaced a controversial temporary agreement negotiated by Jens Evensen and Arne Treholt, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy and who aided the Soviet Union in the negotiations. Most of the disputed area was within what would normally be considered Norwegian according to the relevant international treaties.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of site-specific techniques and technologies in precision farming requires subdividing a field into a generally {{small number of}} <b>contiguous</b> homogeneous <b>zones.</b> The proposed algorithm of clustering is based on nonparametric density estimate, where a cluster {{is defined as a}} region surrounding a local maximum of the probability density function. Soil samples were collected in a 2 -ha field of the experimental farm of the Agricultural Research Institute, located in Foggia (Southern Italy) and some of the most production-affecting soil properties were interpolated by using the geostatistical techniques of kriging and cokriging. The {{application of}} the clustering approach to the (co) kriged surface variables produced the subdivision of the field into five distinct classes. The proposed algorithm proves quite promising in identifying spatially <b>contiguous</b> <b>zones,</b> which are more homogeneous in soil properties than the whole-field. Its great advantage consists in giving an additional description of the residual variation within the class and such a piece of information is very useful in precision farming as a basis for the variable-rate application of agronomic inputs...|$|R

The purpose of the process is to heat set the twist deformation so that after cooling and twist removal, the filaments will seek {{to return to their}} set helically crimped paths. This crimping action leads to bulk and/or stretch development such as is encountered in double knit suitings and/or stretch hosiery. During processing, the entire twisted threadline is under constant tension and torque, but is not at constant temperature, since part of it is intentionally heated to effect the setting process. The threadline is thus divided into three <b>contiguous</b> <b>zones,</b> all under the same stress field but each with different mechanical properties. The threadline tension is a result o...|$|R
5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} of displacement chromatography is that non-idealities always {{give rise to}} an overlap zone between each pair of components; this mixed zone must be collected separately for recycle or discard to preserve {{the purity of the}} separated materials. The strategy of adding spacer molecules to form zones between the components (sometimes termed [...] "carrier displacement chromatography") has been investigated and can be useful when suitable, readily removable spacers are found. Another disadvantage is that the raw chromatogram, for instance a plot of absorbance or refractive index vs elution volume, can be difficult to interpret for <b>contiguous</b> <b>zones,</b> especially if the displacement train is not fully developed. Documentation and troubleshooting may require additional chemical analysis to establish the distribution of a given component. Another disadvantage is that the time required for regeneration limits throughput.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the entire}} sample is loaded, the feed is {{switched}} to the displacer, chosen to have higher affinity than any sample component. The displacer forms a sharp-edged zone {{at the head of}} the column, pushing the other components downstream. Each sample component now acts as a displacer for the lower-affinity solutes, and the solutes sort themselves out into a series of contiguous bands (a [...] "displacement train"), all moving downstream at the rate set by the displacer. The size and loading of the column are chosen to let this sorting process reach completion before the components reach the bottom of the column. The solutes appear at the bottom of the column as a series of <b>contiguous</b> <b>zones,</b> each consisting of one purified component, with the concentration within each individual zone effectively uniform.|$|R

40|$|This {{situation}} {{has been identified}} in the literature as the `self potential' problem. In this article, integration over continuous space within the origin-destination zones is applied to not only compute the intrazonal flows more accurately, but also to evaluate the interzonal flows along shortest path routes meeting the interzonal links at efficient intermediate points. In particular, this general approach permits more accurate corrections to the conventional model, allowing, for instance, the usual approximations in determining average trip length to <b>contiguous</b> <b>zones</b> to be overcome. The eventual aim is to develop practical `rules of thumb' for correcting the conventional analysis. This article also examines facility choice via alternative round trip routes, attempting to discern the influence of `intervening opportunities' on the potential for multi-stop trips without having to fully identify the actual trip chain. Such intervening opportunities can only be properly considered along the alternative paths of the actual network.

40|$|This book {{addresses}} the often vexed question of national maritime claims and the delimitation of international maritime boundaries. The number of undelimited international maritime boundaries {{is much larger}} than the number of agreed lines. The two boundaries that define the marine domain of coastal states are examined. First, the baselines along the coast may consist of low-water lines or straight lines or a combination of both. When straight lines are used they define the seaward limit of the state 2 ̆ 7 s internal waters. Second, the outer limits of claims toterritorial seas, <b>contiguous</b> <b>zones</b> and exclusive economic zones are measured from the baselines. All states will have to delimit at least one international boundary with a neighbouring state, whether adjacent or opposite. In confined seas no state can claim the full entitlement and must negotiate international boundaries with all neighbours. Many states bordering oceans can claim the full entitlement seawards, although they will need to delimit national boundaries with adjacent neighbours...|$|R
40|$|A novel flow {{analysis}} system is described which uses twin-plane tomographic data to derive detailed {{pictures of the}} velocity and concentration structure within complex two-phase flows. Initial results have been obtained using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) but other modalities may also be used. By defining a set of <b>contiguous</b> <b>zones</b> over the flow cross-section the full integration of flowrate may be undertaken and a mass flowmeter created for two-phase systems. A number of flows have been analysed, and detailed results from selected tests are presented. The simplest experiments consist of solid particles dropped under gravity through a 50 mm diameter pipe, which approximates the conditions at the exit of an industrial storage hopper. More complex flows were generated in a recirculating flow rig and are typical of conditions in an industrial pneumatic conveying line.
