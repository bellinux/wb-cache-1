40|$|The {{state of}} {{contaminant}} molecules, the deposition rate on key surfaces, {{and the heat}} transfer rate were estimated {{by the use of}} a zeroth-order approximation. Optical surfaces of infrared telescopes cooled to about 20 K should be considered to be covered with at least several deposition layers of condensible molecules without any <b>contamination</b> <b>controls.</b> The effectiveness of the purge gas method of <b>contamination</b> <b>controls</b> was discussed. This method attempts to drive condensible molecules from the telescope tube by impacts with a purge gas in the telescope tube. For this technique to be sufficiently effective, the pressure of the purge gas must be more than 2 x. 000001 torr. The influence caused by interactions of the purged gas with the particulate contaminants was found to slightly increase the resident times of the particulate contaminants within the telescope field of view...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} identify bird species {{is crucial for}} wildlife law enforcement and bird-strike investigations. However, such identifications may be challenging when only partial or damaged feathers are available for analysis. Results By applying vigorous <b>contamination</b> <b>controls</b> and sensitive PCR amplification protocols, we {{found that it was}} feasible to obtain accurate mitochondrial (mt) DNA-based species identification with as few as two feather barbs. This minimally destructive DNA approach was successfully used and tested on a variety of bird species, including North American wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), blue heron (Ardea herodias) and pygmy owl (Glaucidium californicum). The mtDNA was successfully obtained from 'fresh' feathers, historic museum specimens and archaeological samples, demonstrating the sensitivity and versatility of this technique. Conclusions By applying appropriate <b>contamination</b> <b>controls,</b> sufficient quantities of mtDNA can be reliably recovered and analyzed from feather barbs. This previously overlooked substrate provides new opportunities for accurate DNA species identification when minimal feather samples are available for forensic analysis. </p...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} common environments that {{incorporates}} <b>contamination</b> <b>control</b> into its standards protocol is the cleanroom. There are many preventive procedures in place within a cleanroom environment. They include subjecting cleanroom staff to strict clothing regulations, and there is often a gowning room where the staff can change clothes under sterile conditions so as to prevent any particulates from entering from the outside environment. Certain areas in the cleanroom have more stringent measures than others: packaging areas, corridors, gowning rooms and transfer hatches incorporate strict <b>contamination</b> <b>control</b> measures in order to maintain cleanroom standards.|$|E

30|$|NASA’s largest rover to date, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), was {{launched}} in November 2011 to assess the habitability for past life, investigate the surface geology, and characterize the radiation environment of Mars. MSL was assembled to meet stringent microbial cleanliness requirements that involved <b>contamination</b> <b>controls</b> including clean room assembly and microbial reduction (COSPAR 2011; NASA 2011). Since NASA had approved the ATP assay to prescreen spacecraft hardware {{for the presence of}} microorganisms prior to conducting the NSA, the MSL project adopted it for this purpose and used it as a contamination risk reduction tool. MSL was the first NASA mission that utilized the ATP assay to measure hardware cleanliness for mandatory inspection points, while using the NSA for official spore count enumeration.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground The {{reconstruction}} of biological processes and human activities {{during the last}} glacial cycle relies mainly on data from biological remains. Highly abundant tissues, such as wood, are candidates for a genetic analysis of past populations. While well-authenticated DNA has now been recovered from various fossil remains, the final ‘proof' is still missing for wood, despite some promising studies. Scope The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if ancient wood can be analysed routinely in studies of archaeology and palaeogenetics. An experiment was designed which included blind testing, independent replicates, extensive <b>contamination</b> <b>controls</b> and rigorous statistical tests. Ten samples of ancient wood from major European forest tree genera were analysed with plastid DNA markers. Conclusions Authentic DNA was retrieved from wood samples up to 1000 years of age.

In this study, we test the suitability of a high-density oligonucleotide microarray platform for direct, quantitative detection of GMOs found in the Turkish feed market. We tested 1830 different 60 nt probes designed to cover the GM cassettes from 12 different GM cultivars (3 soya, 9 maize), as well as plant species-specific and <b>contamination</b> <b>controls,</b> and developed a data analysis method aiming to provide maximum throughput and sensitivity. The system was able specifically to identify each cultivar, and in 10 / 12 cases was sensitive enough to detect GMO DNA at concentrations of ≤ 1 %. These GMOs could also be quantified using the microarray, as their fluorescence signals increased linearly with GMO concentration...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Contamination</b> <b>control</b> {{products}} {{have been used}} by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the commercial nuclear industry for decades to minimize contamination on radioactive equipment and surfaces and fix contamination in place. “Contamination control products” is a broad term that includes fixatives, strippable coatings, and decontamination gels. A fixative product functions as a permanent coating to stabilize residual loose/transferable radioactive contamination by fixing it in place; this aids in preventing the spread of contamination and reduces the possibility of the contamination becoming airborne, reducing workforce exposure and facilitating future deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) activities. Strippable coating products are loosely adhered paint-like films and are used for their decontamination abilities. They are applied to surfaces with loose/transferable radioactive contamination and then, once dried, are peeled off, which removes the loose/transferable contamination along with the product. The residual radioactive contamination on the surface is significantly reduced once the strippable coating is removed. Modern strippable coatings show high decontamination efficiency and can rival traditional mechanical and chemical decontamination methods. Decontamination gels work {{in much the same way}} as other strippable coatings. The results obtained through the use of <b>contamination</b> <b>control</b> products is variable and depends on the type of substrate, the selected <b>contamination</b> <b>control</b> product, the contaminants, and the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/library/Contamination%20Control%20Fixatives%20List.pdf ...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of microalgae biofuel {{has not been}} realized because of low productivity and high costs associated with the current cultivation systems. In this paper, an attached cultivation method was introduced, in which microalgae cells grew on the surface of vertical artificial supporting material to form algal film. Multiple of the algal films were assembled in an array fashion to dilute solar irradiation to facilitate high photosynthetic efficiency. Results showed that a broad range of microalgae species can grow with this attached method. A biomass productivity of 50 - 80 g m(- 2) d(- 1) was obtained outdoors for Scenedesmus obliquus, corresponding to the photosynthetic efficiency of 5. 2 - 8. 3 % (total solar radiation). This attached method also offers lots of possible advantages over traditional open ponds, such as on water saving, harvesting, <b>contamination</b> <b>controlling</b> and scale-up. The attached cultivation represents a promising technology for economically viable production of microalgae biofuels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. </p...|$|R
