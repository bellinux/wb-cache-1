5|$|Fairly {{common in}} its large range, {{and with its}} {{population}} stable, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a Least <b>Concern</b> <b>on</b> its red list of threatened species.|$|E
5|$|Its large range, {{abundance}} and stable population mean the smooth toadfish {{is classified as}} Least <b>Concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List. Although no decline in numbers has been recorded, the effects of disappearance of its habitat—mangroves and seagrass beds—is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The southeastern U.S. {{subspecies}} (Falco sparverius paulus) {{has declined}} 82% since 1940 {{due to a}} decrease in nest site availability. This decline {{is a result of}} longleaf pines being cleared from agricultural fields. Despite this, the American kestrel is classed as Least <b>Concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Although {{numbers have}} {{declined}} steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least <b>concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List {{because of its}} huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.|$|E
5|$|Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and {{association}} with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, {{as well as}} being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas. The animal's conservation status is listed as least <b>concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|Common and {{widespread}} throughout New Guinea, the hooded pitohui is evaluated {{as a species}} of least <b>concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In one study {{of the effects of}} small subsistence gardens, populations of hooded pitohui were lower in disturbed agricultural habitat in the lowlands, compared to undisturbed forest, but actually increased in disturbed habitat higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Parrotfinches may be preyed upon by {{indigenous}} {{birds of}} prey such as the endemic Fiji goshawk, or by introduced mammals such as the small Asian mongoose, rats, and mice, {{and they may be}} susceptible to disease. The Fiji species, despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group, appears to be stable in numbers. It is therefore classified as Least <b>Concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List, and it is protected under Fijian law.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the alpine}} pika has been rated {{a species of}} least <b>concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it is widespread, with no known {{population}} decline. Despite the lack of data relating to its current population state, it {{is thought to have}} a stable trend, with some isolated populations exhibiting some variation. It has been regionally red-listed in China and Mongolia as a species of least concern, and about 12% of its population in Mongolia is found in protected areas.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least <b>concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range–more than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)–and because its {{population}} is increasing, rather than declining by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not warranted a vulnerable rating. Also, the population size of the mallard is very large.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is an {{abundant}} and familiar bird of human habitations and cultivation {{in most of}} southern Africa. It is not believed to be threatened, and accordingly is listed as a species of least <b>concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN's Red List. It can be an agricultural pest, especially of grain cultivation and vineyards.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is {{evaluated}} as Least <b>Concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. One of its subspecies, Strepera fuliginosa colei of King Island, {{has declined}} {{over much of}} its range on King Island, possibly due to clearing of its forest habitat, and has been listed as Vulnerable. There {{are estimated to be}} around 500 birds. It is unclear whether competition with the more numerous forest raven is impacting on the subspecies there.|$|E

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{has a large}} range, {{estimated at}} 13.2millionkm2 (5.1millionmi2) and a total population estimated at 80–200million individuals, and it is therefore classed as least <b>concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List. There was some northward range expansion in Scotland, Belgium, Norway, and Finland during the 20th century, assisted by the spread of conifer plantations. The population is currently stable, although there may be temporary marked declines in harsh winters.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} is a habitat generalist; it inhabits places with {{adequate}} water and dense vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands and riparian areas. Despite its name, the jungle cat shuns rainforests and woodlands. The jungle cat {{is listed as}} Least <b>Concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List and is mainly threatened by destruction of wetlands, trapping and poisoning. The status of the cat in the wild needs further study, though populations {{are thought to be}} declining.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} {{is listed as}} Least <b>Concern</b> <b>on</b> the IUCN Red List. Major threats to the jungle cat include habitat loss such as the {{destruction}} of wetlands, dam construction, environmental pollution, industrialisation and urbanisation. Illegal hunting is a threat in Turkey and Iran. Its rarity in Southeast Asia is possibly due {{to high levels of}} hunting.|$|E
