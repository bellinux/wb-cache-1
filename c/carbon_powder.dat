5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in <b>carbon</b> <b>powder.</b> Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E

30|$|Commercial <b>carbon</b> black <b>powder</b> (N 115) was {{supplied}} by Qingdao Degussa Company, Qingdao, China. To obtain stable nanofluids, the original <b>carbon</b> black <b>powder</b> was pretreated as follows: 15 g of original <b>carbon</b> black <b>powder</b> and 300 ml 30 % H 2 O 2 were added into a round-bottomed flask and heated to boiling under magnetic stirring. The reaction {{was carried out}} under stirring and boiling for 5 h. Then the mixture was filtrated at room temperature and dried at 100 °C. Pretreated <b>carbon</b> black <b>powder</b> was obtained by repeating the process twice. Then the pretreated <b>carbon</b> black <b>powder</b> was ground and dispersed into distilled water under ultrasonic vibration for 1 h.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{attempted}} phase identification of <b>carbon</b> nanosized <b>powders</b> prepared by pulsed wire discharge (PWD) {{to clarify the}} cooling process of PWD plasma. To prepare the <b>carbon</b> nanosized <b>powders,</b> <b>carbon</b> fibers were discharged in nitrogen gas at 26 – 101 kPa by PWD. Volume fractions of phases in the <b>carbon</b> nanosized <b>powders</b> were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. The volume fraction of amorphous carbon, which must be formed by quenching of carbon plasma, was increased with increasing nitrogen gas pressure. This result suggested that the cooling rate of PWD plasma increased with increasing ambient gas pressure...|$|R
25|$|The most {{effective}} ways of achieving the nanoscale Pt on <b>carbon</b> <b>powder,</b> {{which is currently}} the best option, are through vacuum deposition, sputtering, and electrodeposition. The platinum particles are deposited onto carbon paper that is permeated with PTFE. However, there is an optimal thinness to this catalyst layer, which limits the lower cost limit. Below 4nm, Pt will form islands on the paper, limiting its activity. Above this thickness, the Pt will coat the carbon and be an effective catalyst. To further complicate things, Nafion cannot be infiltrated beyond 10um, so using more Pt than this is an unnecessary expense. Thus the amount {{and shape of the}} catalyst is limited by the constraints of other materials.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the most}} common and {{effective}} catalyst, platinum, is extremely expensive, alternative processing is necessary to maximize surface area and minimize loading. Deposition of nanosized Pt particles onto <b>carbon</b> <b>powder</b> (Pt/C) provides a large Pt surface area while the carbon allows for electrical connection between the catalyst {{and the rest of the}} cell. Platinum is so effective because it has high activity and bonds to the hydrogen just strongly enough to facilitate electron transfer but not inhibit the hydrogen from continuing to move around the cell. However, platinum is less active in the cathode oxygen reduction reaction. This necessitates the use of more platinum, increasing the cell’s expense and thus feasibility. Many potential catalyst choices are ruled out because of the extreme acidity of the cell.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, we {{investigated}} ionic conductivities of the electrolytes and cycle performances of Li/S cells using the electrolyte. (PEO) 10 LiCF 3 SO 3 composite polymer electrolyte(CPE) containing <b>carbon</b> <b>powders</b> and Brij dispersant was prepared by ball milling for 12 hr. The 5 wt % <b>carbon</b> <b>powders</b> having high surface area (~ 80 m 2 /g) was added into the (PEO) 10 LiCF 3 SO 3 electrolyte. To get a well-dispersed structure, Brij dispersant was also added into the (PEO) 10 LiCF 3 SO 3 - 5 wt%Carbon electrolyte. Li/CPEs/ 50 wt%S cells showed initial discharge capacities of between 1, 250 and 1, 413 mAh/g-sulfur with current density of 100 mA/g-sulfur at 80 °C.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mechanical}} grinding on morphology and electrochemical performance of graphite and soft <b>carbon</b> <b>powders</b> {{with respect to}} lithium insertion were studied. The morphology of the milled graphitic powders was found to depend strongly upon {{the nature of the}} interactions (e. g., impact or shear) generated by the two kinds of mixer mills used. For the same milling time, crystallite size was smallest and the density of defects highest for graphitic powders that were ball-milled using impact interactions. The specific surface area of the milled samples does not increase indefinitely with increased milling time, but there is a critical milling time (mc) beyond which the specific surface area goes through a maximum (graphite) or levels off for cokes. By controlling milling conditions, graphite and soft <b>carbon</b> <b>powders</b> with well-defined morphology, d-spacings, surface area, and crystallite size can be made. The reversible (reversible amount of inserted Li) vs. irreversible capacity (irreversible lithium loss between the first discharge and charge) was measured for various C/Li cells using various tailor-made graphite and soft <b>carbon</b> <b>powders.</b> A direct correlation between the irreversible capacity of the milled samples and their specific surface area was observed, consistent with catalytically induced reduction of the electrolyte. For milling times greater than mc, the irreversible capacity remains constant or even decreases while the reversible capacity still increases. With mechanical grinding, both graphite and coke samples having irreversible capacity of 328 mAh/g for a reversible capacity of 708 mAh/g (∼Li 2 C 6) were obtained...|$|R

50|$|Early types, and {{low-cost}} cells, use a separator {{consisting of}} a layer of starch or flour. A layer of starch-coated paper is used in modern cells, which is thinner and allows more manganese dioxide to be used. Originally cells were sealed {{with a layer of}} asphalt to prevent drying out of the electrolyte; more recently a thermoplastic washer sealant is used. The carbon rod is slightly porous, which allows accumulated gas to escape while retaining the aqueous electrolyte. The ratio of manganese dioxide and <b>carbon</b> <b>powder</b> in the cathode paste affects the characteristics of the cell; more <b>carbon</b> <b>powder</b> lowers internal resistance, while more manganese dioxide improves storage capacity.|$|E
