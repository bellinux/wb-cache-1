5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarian-American {{business}} magnate George Soros warns in “Does the Euro have a Future?” {{that there}} is no escape from the “gloomy scenario” of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone’s political cohesion so long as “the authorities persist in their current course.” He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank to step into the breach and indemnify the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury’s solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate “a radical change of heart.” In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes however that a collapse of European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus “the only way” to avert “another Great Depression” is the formation of a European Treasury.|$|E

500|$|Later observations, however, {{have caused}} the {{dopamine}} hypothesis to lose popularity, at least in its simple original form. [...] For one thing, patients with schizophrenia do not typically show measurably increased levels of brain dopamine activity. [...] Also, other dissociative drugs, notably ketamine and phencyclidine that act on glutamate NMDA receptors (and not on dopamine receptors) can produce psychotic symptoms. Perhaps most importantly, those drugs that do reduce dopamine activity are a very imperfect treatment for schizophrenia: [...] they only reduce a subset of symptoms, while producing severe short-term and long-term side effects. [...] Even so, many psychiatrists and neuroscientists <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> schizophrenia involves some sort of dopamine system dysfunction. [...] As the [...] "dopamine hypothesis" [...] has evolved over time, however, the sorts of dysfunctions it postulates have tended to become increasingly subtle and complex.|$|E

However, Marx also said in a television interview that he disliked the women's liberation movement.|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{question}} whether the man killed was actually Nocona. Cynthia stated that he was her personal servant, a Mexican slave named José Nakoni. Quanah Parker refused to correct {{the story of his}} father's death. According to his daughter, Nelda Parker Birdsong, [...] Quana said, [...] "Out of respect to the family of General Ross, do not deny that he killed Peta Nakona.

25|$|Despite the {{impressive}} results, Semmelweis's ideas were not {{accepted by the}} other obstetricians in Budapest. The professor of obstetrics at the University of Pest, Ede Flórián Birly, never adopted Semmelweis's methods.

2500|$|White {{residents}} of Charleston feared {{there could be}} more whites who wanted to help blacks fight against slavery. They were already concerned about the growing abolitionist movement in the North, which spread its message through the mails and via antislavery mariners, both white and black, who came ashore in the city. Judge Bay sentenced the four white men as a warning to any other whites who might think of supporting slave rebels. He also was pushing state lawmakers to strengthen laws against both mariners and free blacks in South Carolina in general, and anyone supporting slave rebellions in particular. Judge Bay thought these four white men were spared from hanging only because of a [...] "statutory oversight." [...] The convictions of these men enabled the white men of the pro-slavery establishment to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> their slaves would not stage rebellions without the manipulation of [...] "alien agitators or local free people of color." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the press}} conference, Murillo Karam showed a video re-enactment {{of how the}} bodies were transported, and several video interrogations of the suspects, and also video of teeth and bones {{recovered}} at the site. He said that the remains were badly burned, making DNA identification difficult. In order to properly identify the remains, the federal government turned to a team of internationally renowned forensic specialists from the University of Innsbruck in Austria for help, though {{he said there was}} no definite timeframe for the results. The families of the students, however, did not accept the statements of the Attorney General and <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> their sons are still alive. They said that they will not accept that their children are dead until it is proven scientifically by independent investigators, since they fear that the government is attempting to close the case in order to counter public outrage. Murillo Karam stated that 74 people had been arrested since the case started and another 10 had arrest warrants. He said that until the situation of the students is confirmed, the case remains open and the government formally considers the students [...] "disappeared." ...|$|E

They attributed her safe return to the discovery of the Jews' plot.|$|R
50|$|As a scientist, Weber did {{not judge}} disenchantment. But he <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{instrumental}} means require authorization by value-rational ends. Even apparently impersonal scientific inquiry, he argued, depends on intrinsic value-rational beliefs {{as much as}} does religion. A recent study argues that his analysis provides legitimate means for restoring value-rational action as a permanent constraint on instrumental action.|$|R

60|$|I {{am aware}} Judge Douglas now {{argues that the}} {{subsequent}} express repeal is no substantial alteration of the bill. This argument seems wonderful to me. It is as if one should argue that white and black are not different. He admits, however, {{that there is a}} literal change in the bill, and that he made the change in deference to other senators who would not support the bill without. This proves that those other senators thought the change a substantial one, and that the Judge thought their opinions worth deferring to. His own opinions, therefore, seem not to rest on a very firm basis, even in his own mind; and I suppose the world believes, and will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>that</b> precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation has arisen.|$|E
60|$|No; my {{difficulty}} is rather in {{accounting for the}} strange coincidence by which the shafts of Apollo split us exclusively along certain lines of class and of economics. I cannot understand why all solicitors did not leave off soliciting, all doctors leave off doctoring, all judges leave off judging, all benevolent bankers leave off lending money at high interest, and all rising politicians leave off having nothing to add to what their right honourable friend told the House about eight years ago. The quaint theoretic plea of the workers, that they were striking because they were ill paid, seems to receive a sort of wild and hazy confirmation from the fact that, throughout the hottest weather, judges and other persons who are particularly well paid showed no disposition to strike. I have to fall back therefore on metaphysical fancies of my own; and I <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the anger of the English poor (to steal a phrase from Sir Thomas Browne) came from something in man that is other than the elements and that owes no homage unto the sun.|$|E
50|$|In the West, it took centuries for the Christian {{belief that}} both {{the body and the}} mind were good to {{dominate}} the Aristotelian belief in the former and the Platonic belief in the latter.
