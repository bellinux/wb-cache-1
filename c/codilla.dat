5000|$|<b>Codilla</b> {{placed the}} result of the {{election}} under protest in the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal. The tribunal ruled on May 25, 2012 that Lucy Torrez-Gomez's substitution of her husband was legal, thereby acknowledging votes for her as valid and not stray. On March 19, 2013, or three months before Torres-Gomez's term was to end, the Supreme Court granted the petition of Silverio Tagolino, who argued that since Gomez was disqualified in the first place, his substitute cannot be allowed to run; the decision, which had 7 justices concurring, 4 dissenting and 4 abstaining, effectively removed Torres-Gomez from her post. Torres-Gomez is appealing the case.|$|E
