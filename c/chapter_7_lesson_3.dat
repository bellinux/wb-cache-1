Chapter 2 provides general background, describing {{the participants in}} the project, the history of the AAMP family of microprocessors, the PVS speci- #cation language, and a brief survey of related work. Chapter 3 discusses the goals and history of the project. Chapter 4 describes the AAMP-FV instruction set #macro# architecture and its speci#cation in PVS. Chapter 5 provides a similar discussion of the AAMP-FV register transfer #micro# architecture.

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{an interdisciplinary}} analysis of new Church of England liturgies (Common Worship) from an ecotheological point of view: {{making use of}} reader response theory, literary analysis, a social scientific survey, liberation theology, environmental and political ethics and liturgical theology. Chapter 1 considers the theological, political and sociological influences on liturgical reform, which include, inculturation, the expression of ethics in the prayer of the Church, liberation theologies, technology, and agrarianism. Chapter 2 considers methods of liturgical change and the scope for making creation visible in liturgy. Chapter 3 finds justification in reader response theory for determining ecotheological priorities for critiquing liturgy. Analysis of Common Worship texts occurs: in Chapter 4, using literary analysis; in Chapter 5 via social scientific survey of clergy using Common Worship; Chapter 6 looks in details at Collects and Post Communions and undertakes an ecotheological rewriting of 9 sample texts. <b>Chapter</b> <b>7</b> identifies <b>lessons</b> for liturgical revision in general and for eco-liturgical reform in particular, paying {{particular attention to the}} dissonant creation theologies unearthed in Common Worship, the necessity for future revisions, and the importance and implication of technological change for liturgical writers and commentators. ...|$|R
40|$|Most major {{organizational}} changes never {{reap the}} benefits the original planners envisioned, they often take longer to implement than expected and in a dynamic environment that can spell disaster for a large enterprise. The Coast Guard {{is in the midst}} of several major organizational changes while planning several more. This thesis will use two powerful analysis tools to make policy recommendations that may lead to greater success in the implementation of change. The two tools are Enterprise Value Stream Mapping Analysis (EVSMA) and System Dynamics (SD). Chapter 1 is a more detailed introduction into the motivation behind this thesis. Chapter 2 will review a brief history of some of the major changes within the Coast Guard. Chapter 3 recapitulates some studies conducted in the business sector, with respect to organizational change. This chapter also explains some basic System Dynamics concepts to better contextualize the business cases mentioned. Chapter 4 describes the Enterprise Value Stream Mapping Analysis of the Coast Guard First District. Chapter 5 develops causal loops that attempt to model the dynamics of change within the Coast Guard. Chapter 6 describes some policy recommendations based on the lean enterprise evaluation and the system dynamics model we developed. <b>Chapter</b> <b>7</b> summarizes some <b>lessons</b> learned and then proposes further studies. by Michael J.
