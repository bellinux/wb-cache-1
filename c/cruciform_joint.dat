40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} scale effect in {{relatively}} thin welded joints subjected to fatigue loading. In scientific literature, the fatigue behaviour of arc welded joints is usually {{divided into two}} groups: thick and thin joints. A cut-off thickness, typically {{in the range of}} 13 mm to 22 mm, is introduced; under such cut-off value the design fatigue strength does not increase by decreasing thickness. Despite this common approach, in the present paper, by means of the implicit gradient method, the concept of cut-off thickness is revised and a single numerical procedure is proposed regardless of the thickness of the joint. In particular, classical non-load carrying and load carrying <b>cruciform</b> <b>joints</b> made of steel are considered in the numerical analysis. On the basis of many experimental comparisons, the implicit gradient approach seems able to capture the fatigue strength of welded joints also when only a few millimeters in thickness. Furthermore, in the case of load carrying <b>cruciform</b> <b>joints,</b> by scaling the weld geometry, it is discussed when the failure initiation site moves from the weld toe to the root and vice versa {{as a function of the}} thickness...|$|R

Specimens welded orthogonally to the rolling direction exhibit shorter fatigue life than specimens welded parallel to the rolling direction. A simple method is then developed for predicting crack growth rate. FEM is used to calculate the stress intensity factors and T stress, which are subsequently used to predict the crack propagation rates and trajectory. Influence of applied stress biaxiality on stress intensity factors, T stress, crack trajectory and growth rates have been analysed. Out-of-plane bending caused by the specimen geometry is also modelled. Predicted and test measured crack growth lives are in reasonably good agreement. Reasons for discrepancy are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Low cycle fatigue cracks {{are mainly}} {{detected}} at discontinuous welded locations with high stresses under repeated cyclic static loads due to cargo loading and unloading. Theoretical and analytical {{methods have been}} used to estimate the local stress and strain, which affect the prediction of fatigue life, but these methods have difficulties considering stress concentration at notched locations and complicated material behavior of welded joints or heat affected zones. Electronic speckle pattern interferometry(ESPI) system is a nondestructive and non-contact measurement system, which can provide relatively accurate full field strain at critical positions such as welded zones and structurally discontinuous locations. In this study, local strain was measured by ESPI system at the welded <b>cruciform</b> <b>joint,</b> and then low cycle fatigue test was performed. Effect of local strain on low cycle fatigue life was examined by using the strain value measured by ESPI.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an experimental-theoretical analysis about the influence of the cooling medium and the geometry of the welding bead profile in fatigue life and the associated parameters with structural integrity of welded joints. A welded joint with cruciform geometry is considered using SMAW (Shielded Metal ArcWelding), plates in structural steel ASTM A 36 HR of 8 mm of thickness, and E 6013 electrode input. A three-dimensional computational model of the <b>cruciform</b> <b>joint</b> was created using the finite element method. For this model, the surface undulation of the cord and differentiation in the mechanical properties of the fusion zone were considered, the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and base material, respectively. In addition, an initial residual stress field, which was established experimentally, was considered. The results were a set of analytical expressions for the weld magnification factor Mk. It was found that values for the latter decrease markedly in function of the intensity of the cooling medium used in the post welding cooling phase, mainly due to the effect of the residual compressive stresses. The obtained models of behavior of the weld magnification factor are compared with the results from other researchers with some small differences, mainly due to the inclusion of the cooling effect of the post weld and the variation of the leg of the weld bead. The obtained analytical equations in the present research for Mk can be used in management models of life and structural integrity for this type of welded joint...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue of welded {{structures}} {{is commonly}} assessed in three ways. These are the nominal stress-, the structural hot spot- and the effective notch stress approach. As {{the applicability of}} the approaches differs, these differences have been discussed. The effective notch stress approach has been validated for a cruciform fillet welded and fully penetration welded joint, according to DNV (2012). The same fillet welded joint was further investigated for varying weld sizes. The results show, that for a weld size half the length of the validation model, fatigue life was estimated to be 140 % longer than that of the nominal approach. Further investigations revealed that there is a nonlinear relation between effective notch stress and weld sizes, while comparison of the notch stress and nominal stress approaches indicate that a linear relation is to be expected. Two explanations have been discussed. Firstly, the size of the notch may be dependent on the weld size, caused by loading mode alternations of the notch. And secondly, the linear relation found may be caused by simplifications made for the nominal stress approach. Equations describing the relation between the two approaches have been proposed. Based on the established methodology for the <b>cruciform</b> <b>joint,</b> a second joint provided by Aker Solutions has been assessed for weld root fatigue. This joint is a knee plate located in a horizontal brace of a drilling vessel. The knee plate was analysed by means of a local finite element model subjected to a variable loading, which was defined from provided stress range exceedances diagrams for one boundary. For simplicity, the opposite boundary of the brace was fixed. All simplifications made, for both model and boundaries, have been discussed and concluded to be acceptable and conservative, based on comparison to weld toe fatigue. Weld root fatigue life was assessed by means of Miner summation, and compared to weld toe fatigue. Based on the proposed equations and the linear relation found between the nominal- and the notch stress S-N curves, a weld size providing a longer fatigue life at the weld root, rather than that at the toe, was proposed. </p...|$|E
