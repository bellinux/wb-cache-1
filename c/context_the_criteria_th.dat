Although current policy initiatives offer guidelines for identifying CLP schools, there is no standard definition or methodology in common usage. The Federal School Improvement Grants (SIG) and Race to the Top (RTT) initiatives, for example, require states to identify the lowest five percent of schools but allow states flexibility to set critical parameters such as the period over which performance should be measured. Similarly, federal policy sets expectations that states will measure school improvement progress against benchmarks but allows states to establish the specific benchmarks (within parameters) and methods of measuring progress. School-based accountability measures, which have dominated the relatively small literature on empirically identifying low-performing and turnaround schools, are problematic on three points...|$|R
