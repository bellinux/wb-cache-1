2500|$|The PEDF {{protein is}} a {{secreted}} protein of roughly 50kDa size and 418 amino acids in length. The N-terminus contains a leader sequence responsible for protein secretion {{out of the}} cell at residues 1-19. A 34-mer fragment of PEDF (residues 24-57) was shown to have antiangiogenic properties, and a 44-mer (residues 58-101) was shown to have neurotrophic properties. [...] A BLAST search reveals a putative receptor binding site exists between residues 75-124. A nuclear localization sequence (NLS) exists about 150 amino acids into the protein. The additional molecular weight {{is partly due to}} a single glycosylation site at residue 285. Near the C-terminus at residues 365-390 lies the reactive <b>center</b> <b>loop</b> (RCL) which is normally involved in serine protease inhibitor activity; however, in PEDF this region does not retain the inhibitory function.|$|E

50|$|Serpins {{generally}} inhibit serine proteases by {{a suicide}} substrate inhibition mechanism, {{in which the}} serpin undergoes a drastic change in structure to form a acyl enzyme intermediate. A reactive <b>center</b> <b>loop</b> of the protease is bound to the central beta loop of the serpin, trapping the protease {{in a state where}} it is no longer able to perform its catalytic functions.

40|$|Most {{bacterial}} pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes {{from either}} Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria have E 1 components with an α 2 homodimeric quaternary structure. In {{a sequel to}} our previous publications, we present the first NMR study on the flexible regions of the E 1 component from Escherichia coli and its biological relevance. We report sequence-specific NMR assignments for 6 residues in the N-terminal 1 – 55 region and for a glycine {{in each of the}} two mobile active <b>center</b> <b>loops</b> of the E 1 component, a 200 -kDa homodimer. This was accomplished by using site-specific substitutions and appropriate labeling patterns along with a peptide with the sequence corresponding to the N-terminal 1 – 35 amino acids of the E 1 component. To study the functions of these mobile regions, we also examined the spectra in the presence of (a) a reaction intermediate analog known to affect the mobility of the active <b>center</b> <b>loops,</b> (b) an E 2 component construct consisting of a lipoyl domain and peripheral subunit binding domain, and (c) a peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the E 2 peripheral subunit binding domain. Deductions from the NMR studies are in excellent agreement with our functional finding, providing a clear indication that the N-terminal region of the E 1 interacts with the E 2 peripheral subunit binding domain and that this interaction precedes reductive acetylation. The results provide the first structural support to the notion that the N-terminal region of the E 1 component of this entire class of bacterial pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes is responsible for binding the E 2 component...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two lines}} of {{evidence}} to indicate that uterine serpins do not function as protease inhibitors. Uterine serpins from the sheep and pig are not inhibitory towards a variety of proteases. In addition, several key amino acids in the hinge region of the reactive <b>center</b> <b>loop</b> which are important for protease inhibitory activity have not been conserved in uterine serpins. Bovine uterine serpin does inhibit pepsin but probably through a mechanism distinct from the prototypical mechanism used by serpins.|$|E
50|$|A {{very simple}} string heddle {{can be made}} with a series of five knots, and five loops. Of these loops, the {{important}} ones are the two on the ends and in the center. The loops on the ends are where the shaft goes through the heddle, and the <b>center</b> <b>loop</b> is the eye. The knots are placed around these key features- the eye is made to be in the center, and the end loops are just big enough for the heddle to slide along the shaft. String heddles can also be crocheted, and come in many different forms.|$|E

40|$|Although {{birds and}} mammals are the only {{vertebrates}} that can produce urine hyperosmotic to their plasma, {{the organization of the}} renal medulla of birds considerably differs from that of mammals. In this study, a three-dimensional model was generated from one cone in the renal medulla of a desert quail (Callipepla gambelii), and the spatial relationships between its limbs of loops of Henle and its collecting ducts were examined. Data on the spatial segregation of the collecting ducts and limbs of loops of Henle were collected. Collecting ducts formed a ring in the <b>center,</b> <b>loops</b> of Henle reaching deep into the medulla clustered within the ring, and loops ending superficially ended outside the ring.
