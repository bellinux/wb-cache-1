Each of the methods was comprised of a single core or portions of a core taken during installation of a neutron access tube. In addition to direct measurement of bulk density, the effect of using "smoothed", "probable " and gamma-probe measured bulk density profiles was evaluated. The use of these three alternative bulk density profiles in the computation of volumetric moisture generally had insignificant effect on the resulting neutron gauge calibration equation. The use of a depth-weighted volumetric moisture profile generally improved calibration statistics, but reduced slopes of neutron calibration equations (% moisture per count ratio). Overall, a total core method which used a tractor-mounted, hydraulically operated coring tool provided the most consistent calibrations with lowest standard errors of estimate, although <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> along {{the perimeter of the}} cored hole increased subsequent neutron count ratios.

During the design stage, Engineers are not fully informed of the effect on adjacent pile due to pile driving and minimum safe distance between two piles for driving. The research is to investigate the effect on adjacent piles due to pile driving and to suggest suitable minimum spacing between piles. Pile driving displaces adjacent piles. It is simulated numerically using Finite Element Analysis software package PLAXIS. This project investigates numerically the influence of spacing on the displacement of afore driven piles due to driving a pile {{in the case of}} driven piles, by using the Finite Element Method. Horizontal displacement caused by the above activities in the pile is used as the prime indicator of disturbance. Pile material and soils are idealized as linearly elastic materials and different soils are represented by varying the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. The pile is assumed as infinitely long walls and the smear zone is modeled around the pile using material of lower stiffness considering the <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> around.

40|$|International audienceSoil air {{permeability}} (k(a)) {{is an important}} factor that controls subsurface gas transport and exchange of gas across the soil-atmosphere interface. It is thus crucial to evaluate the spatial distribution of k(a) for both application and modeling purposes. However, relevant studies are still very limited, partly {{due to the fact that}} the dependence of k(a) on soil moisture levels cannot be directly included in the methods such as geostatistical techniques for analyzing the spatial distribution of k(a). To tackle this problem, the scaling scheme based on the similar media concept, which has been widely used in soil hydrology for characterizing spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties, was employed for scaling k(a) in this study. Four {{air permeability}} models, including Millington and Quirk (1960) -MQ Hunt (2005) -HT, Brooks and Corey (1964) -BC, and Kawamoto et al. (2006) -KA, were selected to test this method using two independent datasets. For the first dataset that included k(a) measured for river sediments, all of the four models were able to delineate the spatial distribution of k(a) with a reference curve of k(a) and a set of scaling factors. Specifically, the MQ model gave the least satisfactory results due to the less flexibility of its form; whereas, there were no significant differences in the performances for the HT, BC, and KA models. For the second dataset that contained k(a) measured for agricultural soils, the overall performance of the four models for scaling k(a) deteriorated, largely due to the alterations in the microscopic structures of soil samples caused by repacking and <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> samples. Nonetheless, as the first attempt, this study shows the viability of using the similar media concept for scaling k(a). The merit of this method resides in the fact that the spatial variations of moisture conditions and soil properties can be simultaneously included for analyzing the spatial distribution of k(a). With a reference curve of k(a) and the distribution of scaling factors, this method would be particularly suitable for modeling subsurface gas transport...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Forest soils {{with low}} bulk densities are often {{considered}} {{less susceptible to}} compaction than soils with higher bulk densities. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if soil strength controlled the <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> with low bulk density. Four soils were selected for this evaluation. Three of these were andic soils with low bulk density and the fourth soil was a more dense, cohesive <b>soil.</b> Undisturbed samples <b>of</b> saturated and partly saturated soil were compressed in a one-dimensional consolidation test apparatus. Measurements with separate samples were at one of 7 normal stresses between 0. 033 and 1. 96 MPa. Shear strength <b>of</b> saturated <b>soil</b> was measured in direct shear tests. Primary consolidation <b>of</b> saturated <b>soil</b> was completed in less than one minute at all normal stresses. Shear stress and bulk density increased continuously during shear strain. The <b>compression</b> index <b>of</b> the cohesive <b>soil</b> was significantly larger (p< 0. 05) than that <b>of</b> the andic <b>soils.</b> The shear strength <b>of</b> andic <b>soils</b> (average cohesion intercept of 0. 016 MPa and friction angle of 33. 3 °) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than the cohesive <b>soil</b> (cohesion intercept <b>of</b> 0. 028 MPa and friction angle of 28. 9 °). When saturated, the cohesive soil was more compressible than the andic <b>soils</b> because <b>of</b> lower <b>soil</b> strength. A nonlinear model <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>compression</b> was developed that accurately predicted the compressed density of saturated and partly saturated soil as a function of normal stress, initial bulk density of undisturbed samples, and degree of saturation. As degree of saturation decreased, the compressibility <b>of</b> the cohesive <b>soil</b> decreased more rapidly than it did for the andic soils. As a result, bulk density <b>of</b> dry cohesive <b>soil</b> increased less than it did for dry andic soils. Differences in the compressibility <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> were attributed to texture and clay mineralogy. The differences in the compressibility <b>of</b> these <b>soils</b> were much smaller than were the differences in bulk density. Decreasing water content affected the compressibility <b>of</b> the cohesive <b>soil</b> more than it affected the andic soils.

For this purpose, one dimensional consolidation {{tests were conducted}} to determine the soil consolidation properties. The test specimens were trimmed from the compaction test specimen. The 1 D consolidation test specimen was subjected to the normal pressures of 2. 5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 kPa in sequence on the test specimen which was saturated with distilled water. At {{the end of the}} loading period of 80 kPa, the vertical load was removed and the specimen was allowed to expand for 24 h for the purpose of evaluating of its swelling behavior. The results showed that void ratio <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> specimens decreased with increasing effective normal pressure. The laboratory investigation clearly demonstrates that, settlement is as the <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> a <b>soil</b> specimen due to vertical loading applied at the top surface of the 1 D consolidation test specimen. It was concluded that, the <b>compression</b> settlement <b>of</b> the stabilized <b>soil</b> with the binder composition of 18 % cement, 2 % peat ash and 5 % silica sand improved by almost 1. 3 -fold. A notable discovery is the suitability <b>of</b> the stabilized <b>soil</b> for road embankment and low lying marginal area for foundation works; also solving the environmental problems in relation to peaty ground. However, sufficient laboratory and field testing are required...|$|R
