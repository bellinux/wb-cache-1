He married Matilda Benson of Sarnia, Ontario in 1875, and resided in Fort Garry with her for the next four years, where he continued to operate his livery business. After growing restless in Winnipeg in 1879, McCauley sold his business and traveled west, this time to Edmonton. McCauley arrived in Edmonton in the fall of 1879 after 21 days of travelling by ox cart. He purchased a farm in Fort Saskatchewan the following spring, and farmed for two years before moving to Edmonton in 1882. In Edmonton, he opened the town's first livery and <b>cartage</b> business, the Edmonton <b>Cartage</b> Company, and a butcher shop in 1883.|$|E

His restless nature and desire for adventure led him to travel west to Manitoba. In Manitoba, he established a livery business, which he ran until he set off for Edmonton in 1879. He farmed for two years in Fort Saskatchewan before finally moving to Edmonton, where he established the settlement's first livery and <b>cartage</b> business.|$|E

In some states it was made illegal to damage the uncut ice belonging to another businessman, but arguments could still become nasty. In the winter of 1900–01, for example, disputes between the Pike and North Lake Company and its rival the Wisconsin Lakes Ice and <b>Cartage</b> Company over the rights to harvest ice resulted in pitched battles between workers and the deployment of a steamship icebreaker to smash competing supplies.|$|E

5000|$|Hungarian {{population}} in the area, who supported the cause of Hungary, in the desire to regain the whole of Transylvania, started, along with the Hungarian Guard, to loot houses of Jews and Romanians. On 9 September 1944, a team of Hungarian gendarmes took up from their homes several Romanians that had important functions {{in the administration of}} the commune. They were taken to an improvised camp in Sărmașu. They were tortured for several days. According to the sentence handed down on 28 June 1946 by People's Tribunal in Cluj, [...] "in the camp was applied an inhumane treatment, consisting of beatings, ill-treatments and executions staged at night. For example, once all Romanians were removed from the camp in the yard, put in the knees («At the church»), and, after this exercise, everyone, regardless of age, were forced to overturn until exhaustion". In the afternoon of 16 September, those 126 Jews in the improvised camp were transported with <b>cartages</b> to a place called Suscut, and in the night of 16/17 September were killed by Hungarian gendarmes and soldiers. The bodies of those killed (31 adult males, 52 adult females and 43 children up to age 15) were exhumed from two mass graves in February 1945. The conclusion reached by the Medico-legal commission who conducted the autopsy of the cadavers was violent death by shooting, and, in the case of several children, violent death by asphyxiation, these ones being buried alive.|$|R

25|$|Prior to 1743 coal {{had been}} mined in Little Govan, close to Glasgow. When that working ceased, {{the price of}} coal in Glasgow rose considerably, {{doubling}} by 1760 (from between 1/1 and 1/3 per cart of 7 cwt), to between 2/1 and 2/6. (1 cwt = 112lb or 51kg). Available coal was mined in Lanarkshire, but, before proper roads were built, the cost of transport by horse and cart was a significant factor. When the Trades House of Glasgow protested, one member cited another cause: that the coal masters had combined to keep prices high; he asserted that the price ought not to exceed 1/6, including 6d for <b>cartage</b> and tolls.|$|E
25|$|The Purple Gang was reputedly {{suspected}} of {{taking part in}} the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. On February 13, 1929, Abe Bernstein had reputedly called Bugs Moran and told him that a hijacked load of booze {{was on its way to}} Chicago. Moran, who was in the middle of a turf war with Capone, had only recently begun to trust Bernstein, who had previously been Capone's chief supplier of Canadian liquor. The next day, instead of delivering a load of liquor, five men dressed as policemen went to S.M.C. <b>Cartage</b> on North Clark Street (Moran's North Side hangout) and opened fire with machine guns, killing seven men in what has become known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.|$|E

Contract rates were lower than the established going rates. Tensions flared. Non contractors refused to cart for the storekeepers and went “on strike” rallying against “non-union” rates. Two hundred and fifty camels at 32 Mile Well were unhobbled and scattered into the scrub. Camel loads were flung to the ground. The dispute was eventually settled after police and officials from both Perth and the local area intervened and facilitated discussions between the opposing parties. Troubles resurfaced periodically - three years later agreement was reached to almost double <b>cartage</b> rates, but it had been a period of financial stress to the cameleers.|$|E
25|$|Price {{continued}} his <b>cartage</b> towards Fort Scott, Kansas. In {{the late afternoon}} of October 25, Price's supply train had difficulty crossing the Marmiton River ford and just as at Mine Creek earlier that afternoon, Price had to make another stand. Brig. Gen. John McNeil, commanding two brigades of Pleasonton's cavalry, engaged troops that Price and his officers had rallied from the earlier battles, including a sizable contingent of unarmed men. Observing the large Confederate force and not knowing that many were unarmed, McNeil refrained from an all-out assault. After about two hours of skirmishing Price recommenced his retreat, while McNeil could not mount an effective pursuit. Price's army was utterly broken by this time; now {{it was simply a}} question of whether he could escape, and how many men he could successfully evacuate to friendly territory.|$|E
25|$|In 1128 Suero twice {{got into}} a dispute with the monastery of Corias over {{a piece of land}} at Peñaullán. He {{appointed}} two of his own knights, Martín Martínez and Pedro Menéndez, to make an enquiry into the dispute and adjudicate it. On 1 February 1129 Suero and his brother Gutierre made exchange of properties. Later that year Suero and fellow Asturian Gonzalo Peláez were sent by the king to Almazán to negotiate with Alfonso the Battler, who still laid claim to the Leonese-Castilian throne. Gonzalo had long been a rival with Suero in western Asturias. In 1131 a monk of Corias was bringing a large load of wheat from León to Laciana through the lands governed by Suero when he was stopped by two of the count's officials and assessed a toll. He refused to pay it and the dispute became violent. Subsequently, Suero was forced by the monks of Corias to make an enquiry, appointing two of his knights, Pedro Garcés and Juan Pérez, with the task. Their finding was that a similar dispute had occurred between Corias and Suero's brother Gutierre during the reign of Alfonso VI, and that the king had ruled the monks owed no portazgo (tolls on <b>cartage)</b> within the tenencia of Laciana. Suero therefore renounced his right to the toll. In 1132 Suero again judged a lawsuits involving Corias.|$|E

Between 1992 and 1997, the city paid Marina <b>Cartage</b> and another Tadin company $49 million for supplying the city with snow removal and other heavy equipment and operators. Tadin earned millions of dollars by buying land cheaply, then leasing or selling it to the city. Marina <b>Cartage</b> used Huels' SDI Security services since 1992. In 1995, with Huels' support, the City Council approved a tax reduction which halved the assessment on a new $4.5 million headquarters and trucking terminal for Marina <b>Cartage</b> at 4450 S. Morgan in Huels' ward, a tax savings of as much as $80,000 per year. In 1996, with Huels' support, the City Council approved a $1.1 million direct grant for the construction of the facility. Weeks later, Tadin created a new company which was used to originate a $1.25 million bailout loan to SDI.

500|$|In late 1871 {{residents}} of Brill petitioned the Duke {{to extend the}} route to Brill and open a passenger service. The Duke agreed; it is likely he had already planned passenger services to Brill, as correspondence from early 1871 mentions passenger facilities at [...] "the Brill terminus".

(Although officially named the [...] "Wotton Tramway", it was {{commonly known as the}} [...] "Brill Tramway" [...] from the time of its conversion to passenger use.) The new terminus of Brill railway station, at the foot of Brill Hill approximately [...] north of the town, opened in March 1872.

500|$|In 1871, the New York Custom House {{collected}} {{more revenue}} from imports {{than any other}} port in the United States. By 1872, two congressional investigations and one by the Treasury Office under Secretary George S. Boutwell looked into allegations of a corruption ring set up at the New York Custom House under two Grant collector appointments, Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy. [...] Both Grinnell and Murphy allowed private merchants to store goods not claimed on the docks in private warehouses for exorbitant fees. [...] Grant's secretaries Horace Porter and Orville E. Babcock and Grant's friend George K. Leet, owner of a private warehouse, allegedly shared in these profits. [...] Secretary Boutwell advocated a reform to keep imports on company dock areas rather than being stored at designated warehouses in New York. [...] Grant's third collector appointment, Chester A. Arthur, implemented Boutwell's reform. [...] On May 25, 1870, Boutwell had implemented reforms that reduced public <b>cartage</b> and government costs, stopped officer gratuities, and decreased port smuggling, but on July 2, 1872, U.S. Senator Carl Schurz insinuated in a speech that no reforms had been undertaken and that the old abuses at the custom house continued. [...] The New York Times claimed that Schurz's speech was [...] "carefully prepared" [...] and [...] "more or less disfigured and discolored by error."

2500|$|In the branch's {{first half}} century, freight was not {{confined}} to coal.

[...] Coal tonnages were declining by this stage: in 1940, the branch was carrying just over half its pre-World War I peak of 800,000 tons. [...] Nonetheless, coal traffic was more than sufficient to keep the branch in service. [...] An early 1967 timetable had one train to Seddonville and the Mokihinui Mine and two to Ngakawau on weekdays, with shuttles from the Conns Creek Branch that diverged at Waimangaroa. Traffic from the Conns Creek Branch was declining and it closed later that year.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Townhead basin served much heavy {{industry}} in that quarter of Glasgow, progressive {{improvements to the}} navigability of the River Clyde meant that 100-tonne (110-short-ton) ships, and by {{the early years of}} the nineteenth century 400-tonne (440-short-ton) ships, could reach the Broomielaw quays from the sea.

2500|$|Although {{considerable}} {{planning and}} expenditure in 1930 {{was going into}} improving the passenger operation, it was hoped to increase revenue from the IR's freight business. Less-than-carload (LCL) overnight deliveries [...] between the various IR-linked towns (and to or from Ohio) was not available from the competing railroads; the latter typically required {{two to three days}} to complete a shipment. An example is delivering machined parts made in Terre Haute overnight to Fort Wayne auto manufacturer Auburn. Prior to 1930, <b>cartage</b> business already existed due to the interurban's ties to local power companies. At night the IR's arch windowed wood bodied box motors would rumble down the quiet brick streets of an Indiana town towing one or two gondolas loaded with coal for the local power plant. In some cases, freight trains operating on city streets became an objection of town councils, particularly if those trains operated during the day. Many merchants, newspapers, and small manufacturing companies used the frequent interurban scheduling provided. Had this freight business increased with an improving economy along with the greater sales generated by a motivated sales force, the IR would have had a promising future. The idea was a good one, but the national economy didn't improve. Instead, it collapsed further. When the Indiana Railroad lost its important freight interchange connection with neighboring interurban Dayton and Western (which connected at Dayton with the busy Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban to the Ohio towns of Toledo, Cincinnati, Springfield, and Columbus) prospects for the line's survival were poor. The C abandoned operations in early 1938 when it lost its interurban connection to Cleveland. The IR continued to barely survive with just Indiana freight business, but its lines were abandoned one by one. Today, one operation on IR track survives as the Southern Indiana Railroad between Speed and Watson Jct handling concrete from Essroc Cement for interchange with the CSX/B at Watson trains using diesel locomotives.|$|E
