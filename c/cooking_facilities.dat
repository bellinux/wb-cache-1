5|$|This victory did not {{delay the}} workhouse's fate; {{the site was}} duly sold to the Catholic Church for £110,000, and {{demolition}} began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate <b>cooking</b> <b>facilities.</b> Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E
5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or <b>cooking</b> <b>facilities,</b> and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The North-West and North-East towers {{behind the}} {{northern}} range are Norman in origin, from the 11th and early 12th century. When first built, {{they were created}} by pushing or folding {{the line of the}} curtain wall outwards to create the desired external shape, and then adding timber floors and a timber wall at the back, rather than being designed as individual buildings. The timber parts of the towers were later replaced in stone, and incorporated into the later range of buildings. The North-East Tower, also known as the Pendover Tower, was originally two-storeys high, with a third floor added on in the 14th century, followed by an extensive remodelling of the inside in the 16th century. It has chamfered angles on the external corners to make it harder to attack the stonework, although this has weakened the structural strength of the tower as a whole. The North-West Tower had similar chamfered corners, but the Closet Tower was built alongside it in the 13th century, altering the external appearance. Two more Norman towers survive in the innermost bailey, the West Tower, also known as the Postern Tower, because it contained a postern gate, and the South-West tower, also called the Oven Tower, on account of its <b>cooking</b> <b>facilities.</b> The Norman towers looked out towards Wales, probably to make a symbolic statement.|$|E

50|$|The cook house: Until {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century it was {{forbidden}} to cook over an open fire on a ship moored in the harbour. The danger of fire on wooden ships was simply too great and the town cook house was built to serve as the harbour <b>cooking</b> <b>facility.</b> The small, whitewashed building is from 1810. The Ærøskøbing Association helped with its restoration in 2001, and now again it serves its original purpose as a place where yachtsmen can prepare food.|$|R

25|$|The Republican exiles were interned {{in fifteen}} improvised camps (mostly barbed-wire {{enclosures}} on the sand, without basic shelter, sanitary or <b>cooking</b> <b>facilities)</b> by the French government {{in places such}} as Argelès, Gurs, Rivesaltes and Vernet. The living conditions in the camps were very harsh. In the first six months, 14,672 refugees died from malnutrition or dysentery. The French government encouraged the refugees to return {{and by the end of}} 1939 between 70,000 and 180,000 refugees returned to Spain, but 300,000 never returned. Many fled to the Soviet Union (between 3,000 and 5,000), USA and Canada (about 1,000), and Great Britain, Belgium and other European countries (between 3,000 and 5,000). Many others managed to reach Latin America (30,000 to Mexico, 10,000 to Argentina, 5,000 to Venezuela, 5,000 to Dominican Republic, 3,500 to Chile, etc.) seeking asylum. Nevertheless, at least 140,000 refugees remained in France and 19,000 in the French colonies of the North Africa. After the fall of France 10,000–15,000 refugees were detained by the Nazis and deported to concentration camps. Another 10,000 joined the French Resistance and more than 2,000 joined the Free French Forces.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Food {{safety is}} one of the most {{important}} concerns for international senior tourists in Thailand when dealing with the cuisine at strange tourist destinations. This paper drew upon data collection from an international senior tourist survey conducted in Bangkok, Thailand during summer of 2014. Summer time in Thailand is a high season for international tourists. It is also a high risk period that a variety food safety issues and incidents have often increased. The survey was structured primarily to obtain international senior tourists’ concerns toward a variety of food safety and risks they encountered during their trip in Thailand. A total of 400 respondents were international senior tourists in Thailand who were elicited as data input for t-test, chi-square test, and ANOVA test. The findings also revealed that the three most important food risks were 1) Unclean physical <b>cooking</b> <b>facility,</b> 2) Toxic chemical handling, and 3) Unclean water...|$|R

40|$|Scheffler reflectors are an {{appropriate}} solar technology {{used to provide}} heat for cooking surfaces and has been adopted in many developing nations. The first Scheffler was built in North America in 2010 by Jason Rapp et al., taking a group of four students approximately 2000 and 3 months. Thus, our task was to minimize {{certain aspects of the}} Scheffler construction process, so that it would be more appropriate for developing countries and industrial applications alike. Additionally, this senior project aims to incorporate the thermal storage unit and tracking system, with the current Scheffler system, to render a workable cooking technology. So far, the frame 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturing time and cost were reduced to a few man-hours and 20 for materials. A manual tracking mechanism to follow the sun throughout the day was developed for under 10, and consists of nylon, a spring, and a metal crank. An automatic tracking mechanism is currently under development. This mechanism uses an Arduino to compare the light levels between two photodiodes. A thermal storage unit, which allows for cooking after the sunset, is in its second prototype, constructed of cement and steel. This cost 30 and less than 2 man-hours to manufacture. It is able to retain temperatures of up to 100 oC for 4 - 5 hours. Construction of the reflective dish is still under development, but we have used many different manufacturing methods to construct a template: sand and fire clay, plaster of paris, and high density foam.
