40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern about the}} {{depletion}} of hydrocarbon resources {{and the risk of}} near-term peaks in production. These concerns hinge upon contested estimates of the recoverable resources of different regions and the associated forecasts of regional production. Beginning with Hubbert, an influential group of analysts have used growth curves both to estimate recoverable resources and to forecast future production. Despite widespread use, these ‘curve-fitting’ techniques remain a focus of misunderstanding and dispute. The aim {{of this paper is to}} classify and explain these techniques and to identify both their relative suitability in different circumstances and the expected level of confidence in their results. The paper develops a mathematical framework that maps <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> onto the available data for conventional oil and highlights the critical importance of the so-called ‘reserve growth’. It then summarizes the historical origins, contemporary application and strengths and weaknesses of each group of <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> and uses illustrative data from a number of oil-producing regions to explore the extent to which these techniques provide consistent estimates of recoverable resources. The paper argues that the applicability of <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> is more limited than adherents claim, the confidence bounds on the results are wider than commonly assumed and the techniques have a tendency to underestimate recoverable resources...|$|R

Chemical covalences on paper surfaces due to a small amount of polymer additives were clarified and determined by an XPS <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>technique.</b> Some of the problems associated with surface analysis of paper by XPS are discussed. The effects of strength additives on the fiber surface or between fibers are illustrated. This technique appears promising as a tool to analyze paper surfaces treated with small amounts of polymer additives.|$|E
40|$|The {{coefficient}} of consolidation (cv) is traditionally evaluated by fitting experimental settlement-time data to the theoretical percentage consolidation-time factor curve of a layer subjected to a uniform initial excess pore water pressure (ui) distribution. Over the years, numerous <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> {{have been developed for}} this experimental-theoretical correlation, the most popular of which are Casagrande's logarithm-of-time method and Taylor's square-root time method. These classical <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> have recently been generalized to account for a variety of different ui distributions. In this paper, basic consolidation principles have been applied in a novel fashion to both standard and tall oedometer tests on two clays to simulate a sinusoidal ui distribution (operating under either singly or doubly drained conditions) within a laboratory setting. The settlement-time data obtained from these tests were analyzed using the modified curve-fitting procedures previously put forward by the authors to determine appropriate values for cv, which were found to closely align with values of cv obtained using the traditional Taylor and Casagrande methods, when the ui distribution is considered uniform. The most valuable feature of these modified <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> was found to be their ability to analyze traditionally obtained settlement-time data to supplement any conventionally obtained cv values. This is useful in terms of validation when settlement-time data do not exhibit the usual trends and traditionally calculated values of cv require further authentication...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{a method}} {{based on a}} {{sensitivity}} analysis and quadratic <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>technique</b> for power loss reduction in a low-voltage distribution area is proposed. Loss sensitivity based method is used to determine some potential DG sites and least-square based <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>technique</b> is used to find out optimum DG capacity. Results obtained from the proposed method is justified using the exhaustive search method which is a computer program that searches for all alternatives by evaluating each individually. For determining the optimum generation capacity of multiple DG units, a new methodology based on an unbalanced multi-phase optimal power flow (UM-OPF) is presented in this thesis. During the formulation of the UM-OPF, an optimisation algorithm is developed in Matlab and the unbalanced multi-phase power flow is solved using the Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI) software OpenDSS. To ensure a global minimum loss profile, a swarm intelligence-based adaptive weight particle swarm optimisation (AW-PSO) algorithm is used which shows better convergence profile compared with basic PSO algorithm. Validation of the proposed methodologies is also conducted using an exhaustive search algorithm. The results obtained from the proposed methods show that significant loss reduction is possible using multiple optimum sized DG units. To determine the optimum DG capacity, with varying generation and load, a cost minimisation planning methodology is also proposed. During the planning process, different DG technologies (such as solar and wind) are considered. The results obtained from this methodology show better loss reduction profile compared to the peak load planning...|$|E

Thus, we seek to maximize the product of the nontoxicity and efficacy dose-response curves. We are interested in sampling rules that perform well along several criteria, including the ethical criterion that, as often as possible, experimental subjects be treated at or close to the maximum in question. Statistically, we wish to identify the optimum dose with high probability {{at the close of the}} experiment.

The first interpolation is made in the grading entropy diagram on the basis of some "optimal" grading curve data. The so-determined preliminary {{transfer function}} is then extended onto the inverse image of the entropy diagram points by a second interpolation or by a <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>technique.</b> In this paper, a double interpolation method to find a transfer function to predict the soil water retention curve for well-graded sands from soil grading data is described.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{attempted}} to investigate both the glycation kinetics and protein secondary conformational changes of human serum albumin (HSA) after the reaction with ribose. The browning and fluorescence determinations as well as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy with a <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>technique</b> were applied. Various concentrations of ribose were incubated over a 12 -week period at 37 ± 0. 5 o C under dark conditions. The results clearly shows that the glycation occurred in HSA-ribose reaction mixtures was markedly increased with the amount of ribose used and incubation time, leading to marked alterations of protein conformation of HSA after FTIR determination. In addition, the browning intensity of reaction solutions were colored from light to deep brown, as determined by optical observation. The increase in fluorescence intensity from HSA–ribose mixtures seemed to occur more quickly than browning, suggesting that the fluorescence products were produced earlier on in the process than compounds causing browning. Moreover, the predominant α-helical composition of HSA decreased with an increase in ribose concentration and incubation time, whereas total β-structure and random coil composition increased, as determined by curve-fitted FTIR microspectroscopy analysis. We also found that the peak intensity ratios at 1044 cm − 1 / 1542 cm − 1 markedly decreased prior to 4 weeks of incubation, then almost plateaued, implying that the consumption of ribose in the glycation reaction might have been accelerated over the first 4 weeks of incubation, and gradually decreased. This study first evidences that two unique IR peaks at 1710 cm − 1 [carbonyl groups of irreversible products produced by the reaction and deposition of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) ] and 1621 cm − 1 (aggregated HSA molecules) were clearly observed from the curve-fitted FTIR spectra of HSA-ribose mixtures over the course of incubation time. This study clearly suggests that FTIR spectroscopic <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>technique</b> may be easily used to allow determining the marked changes in the secondary conformational structure and protein aggregation of HSA during ribosylation as well as the production of AGEs...|$|E

Thus, the need for precise and concise information about packing density becomes a must for an in-depth understanding of yarn structure and hence yarn mechanics. This paper describes a detailed method for determining packing density. We begin by acquiring yarn cross-sectional images to provide input data for calculating yarn cross-sectional packing density.

These forecasts frequently rely on the estimates of the ultimately recoverable resources (URR) of different regions, obtained through the use of curve-fitting to historical trends in discovery or production. Curve-fitting was originally pioneered by M. King Hubbert in the context of an earlier debate about the future of the US oil production. However, despite their widespread use, <b>curve-fitting</b> <b>techniques</b> remain the subject of considerable controversy. This article classifies and explains these techniques and identifies both their relative suitability in different circumstances and the level of confidence that may be placed in their results. This article discusses the interpretation and importance of the URR estimates, indicates the relationship between curve fitting and other methods of estimating the URR and classifies the techniques into three groups. It then investigates each group in turn, indicating their historical origins, contemporary application and major strengths and weaknesses. The article then uses illustrative data from a number of oil-producing regions to assess whether these techniques produce consistent results as well as highlight some of the statistical issues raised and suggesting how they may be addressed.
