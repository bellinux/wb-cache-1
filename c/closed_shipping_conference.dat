40|$|There is a {{substantial}} theoretical literature on the potential effects of loyalty contracts, but a relative paucity of empirical work. This Paper employs the event study methodology to {{examine the effect of}} exclusionary contracts on firm performance in the ocean <b>shipping</b> industry. <b>Shipping</b> <b>conferences</b> - legal cartels exempt from antitrust laws - offered discounts to customers that patronized exclusively cartel member firms. The usage of these contracts was the subject of an extended legal and political struggle. We test for the impact of the most important events in this conflict on the stock returns of firms in the shipping industry. We find that some of these events resulted in significant changes in the firms’ stock returns. Our evidence suggests that exclusive contracts may have contributed to market power in the shipping industry. Event Study; Exclusive Contracts; <b>Shipping</b> <b>Conferences...</b>|$|R

40|$|Liner {{shipping}} is {{the business}} of offering common carrier ocean shipping services in international trade. Since it became an important industry in the 1870 s, it has been characterized by various agreements between firms. Historically, since the formation in 1875 of the Calcutta Conference, the conference system was the primary form of agreement in liner shipping. Variously called liner <b>conferences,</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>conferences,</b> and ocean <b>shipping</b> <b>conferences,</b> they are formal agreements between liner shipping lines on a route, always setting (possibly discriminatory) prices, and sometimes pooling profits or revenues, managing capacity, allocating routes, and offering loyalty discounts. Conferences agreements were quite successful {{and in many cases}} have lasted for years. In the last two decades, conferences have begun to be supplanted by alliances (particularly in the American and European trades, where legislative changes have been unfavourable to them), which are less complete (they do not, for example, set prices) but encompass more broadly defined trade routes...|$|R

40|$|Many {{economists and}} {{antitrust}} experts claim that ocean <b>shipping</b> <b>conferences</b> are essentially legalized cartels. They often advocate eliminating ocean shipping conferences' antitrust immunity. This paper argues that conferences {{also help to}} coordinate their members' joint investments and thereby allow the historically small firms in this industry to exploit vast network economies (akin to those in other transportation industries) that small firms could not capture on their own. The paper proposes reducing rather than eliminating immunity and calls {{for an end to}} many of the regulations currently stifling the industry.

40|$|<b>Shipping</b> <b>conferences</b> {{developed}} {{more than}} a century ago because a means was required to regulate the intense competition in the international shipping industry. This competition, which is natural, was intensified because of technological innovation, high capital investment, and overtonnage. This study is undertaken to show, through a discussion of the development of conferences, tools available for their use, and current political and technological environment in which they operate, that similar conditions still exist, and although the nature of the shipping industry has been experiencing major changes in technology and operations, the conference system still offers a viable forum for negotiating, compromising, and regulating in an important transportation industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to shed light}} on the proposal that firms in concentrated industries may keep excess capacity to forestall entry or expansion by rivals. Excess capacity can deter entry by forming expectations on the part of potential entrants that dominant firms are capable of responding aggressively to threats. But {{in order to make a}} convincing case for excess capacity as a strategic entry deterrent, all potential sources of excess capacity must be considered simultaneously. These may include industry-specific structural factors, such as the divisibility of demand relative to supply, economies of scale or wide swings in demand. Ocean liner shipping exhibits structural factors that have led excess capacity for much of its history. It is a concentrated industry that until the late 1990 s was dominated by price fixing industry groups known as liner <b>shipping</b> <b>conferences.</b> In spite of limited antitrust immunity granted by most governments to liner <b>shipping</b> <b>conferences,</b> excess capacity is and has been a persistent problem that could be a major cause of operational inefficiencies. As such, ocean liner shipping presents an ideal forum in which to distinguish between excess capacity that is an artefact of structural conditions of supply and demand and excess capacity that may be deployed as a strategic defense against opportunistic rivals. The results of a random effects model with instrumental variables show some limited support for the entry deterrence element of excess capacity in liner shipping.

50|$|Vasa {{might not}} have sunk on 10 August 1628, if the ship had been sailed with the gunports <b>closed.</b> <b>Ships</b> with {{multiple}} tiers of gunports normally had to sail with the lowest tier closed, since the pressure of wind in the sails would usually push the hull over until the lower gunport sills were under water. For this reason, the gunport lids are made with a double lip {{which is designed to}} seal well enough to keep out most of the water.
