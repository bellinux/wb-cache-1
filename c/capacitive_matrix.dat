40|$|Blocs {{underlined}} by fractures networks mainly compose hard-rock aquifers. The {{complexity of}} flows through fractures makes inadequate {{the use of}} classical techniques for the interpretation of hydraulic tests. Four different methods, well adapted {{to the complexity of}} groundwater flows in hard-rock aquifers, are presented for pumping wells and/or observation wells interpretations. The Neuman method is suited for unconfined anisotropic aquifers while Gringarten method is developed for the case of a single horizontal fracture. The third method (Warren and Root) takes into consideration the heterogeneity of the medium, allowing the introduction of a double porosity aquifer (transmissive fractures and <b>capacitive</b> <b>matrix).</b> Finally, the fourth method, Barker theory, assesses the flow dimension related to spatial distribution of conductive fractures and their connectivity. All these methods are presented and illustrated on pumping tests carried out in a granite terrain, south of Hyderabad, India...|$|E
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (EM) {{analysis and}} design of a n-element unloaded coupled-microstrip-line TEM resonator are {{presented in this paper}} by using the finite element method (FEM) and method of moments (MoM) in two dimensions. The analysis allows the determination of the primary inductive and <b>capacitive</b> <b>matrices</b> ([L], [C 0]) and simulates the frequency response of S 11 at the RF port of the designed n-element unloaded coupled-microstrip-line TEM resonator. As an application, we present the design results of a MRI probe using a 12 -element unloaded coupled-microstrip-line TEM resonator and operating at 200 MHz (proton imaging at 4. 7 T). The probe has- 118 dB minimum reflection and an unloaded quality factor Qo> 500 at 200 MHz.

40|$|Using {{the finite}} element method (FEM) and method of moments (MoM) in two dimensions, the {{electromagnetic}} (EM) analysis and design of a quasi-TEM slotted tube resonator (STR) are presented. The modeling of this resonator consists in analyzing the even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances (Z 0 e, Z 0 o), effective dielectric constants (εeffe, εeffo), the primary inductive and <b>capacitive</b> <b>matrices</b> ([L], [C]) and simulates the frequency response of S 11 at the RF port of the designed inhomogeneous MRI probe using transmission line method (TLM). As an application, we present the design results of a UHF-MRI probe loaded with a human head model of average relative dielectric constant of 64 and using the optimum configuration of the TEM STR. The probe with high Q operates at 340 MHz (proton imaging at 8 T) and has- 130. 6 dB minimum reflections. The UHF-MRI probe using quasi-TEM STR is easy to construct, inexpensive, and simple to operate. Furthermore, the coil presented here may be constructed to work at different resonances frequencies...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the main drawbacks of coaxial, waveguide, and stripline couplers, the analysis and {{the design of a}} compact coaxial-to-microstrip directional coupler convenient for power and antenna control application, are presented using the method of moments (MoM) in two dimensions. This technique is adapted to study the complex configuration of the line’s system, which does not have a simple analytical solution. The modeling of this structure consists in analyzing the primary inductive and <b>capacitive</b> <b>matrices</b> ([L] and [C]). When these matrices are determined, it is possible to calculate the inductive and capacitive coupling coefficients (kL and kC) and estimate the resulting scattering parameters of the coupler using an adapted numerical model. The coupler can be integrated into a printed circuit board (PCB) and operates over 17 to 35 dB coupling coefficients and is always compensated. The compensation is achieved by the proper displacement of a tuning ground plane with respect {{to the edge of the}} PCB from 0. 1 to 3. 3 mm. As an application, we present the design of a compact coupler with 7. 5 × 4. 8 × 25. 8 mm of size and having approximately 20 dB of coupling coefficient at 2 GHz and a minimum directivity of 23. 3 dB in the frequency range [0. 1 - 4] GHz. In order to check our numerical calculations by the MoM we made simulations in 3 D by using CST MICROWAVE STUDIO software for the same geometrical and physical parameters of our designed coupler. The results obtained by the two numerical models (MoM and CST) show a good agreement of the frequency responses of the coaxial-to-microstrip directional coupler. The studied structure represents a great improvement for high power measurement systems, since it has broad-band, good directivity, and can be easily designed and fabricated...|$|R
40|$|Atmel QTouch Peripheral Touch Controller (PTC) offers {{built-in}} hardware for buttons, sliders, and wheels. PTC supports both mutual {{and self}} capacitance measurement {{without the need}} for any external component. It offers superb sensitivity and noise tolerance, as well as self-calibration and minimizes the sensitivity tuning effort by the user. The PTC is intended for acquiring capacitive touch sensor signals. The external capacitive touch sensor is typically formed on a PCB, and the sensor electrodes are connected to the analog charge integrator of the PTC using the device I/O pins. The PTC supports mutual capacitance sensors organized as <b>capacitive</b> touch <b>matrices</b> in different X-Y configurations, including Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) sensor grids. In mutual capacitance mode, the PTC requires one pin per X line (drive line) and one pin per Y line (sense line). In self capacitance mode, the PTC requires only one pin with a Y-line driver for each self-capacitance sensor. The PTC supports two sets of libraries, the QTouch Library and the QTouch Safety Library. The QTouch Library supports both mutual and self capacitanc...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} body posture and of the foot support on the apparent mass distribution at the feet of standing subjects exposed to whole-body vibration. The apparent mass was measured at the driving point through a <b>capacitive</b> pressure sensor <b>matrix,</b> which allowed to separate the contributions of the different foot regions. The overall value was also determined using a conventional measurement system based on piezoelectric load cells. Ten male subjects performed 15 tests with three kinds of feet supports (flat rigid, anatomic rigid and flat soft) in five different postures. Static components of the pressure measurements were exploited to identify which fraction of the weight is supported by the rearfoot, the midfoot and the forefoot in the various test configurations. Factorial design of experiments on different response variables showed that the apparent mass is affected by the posture but not by the type of feet contact surface; conversely, the presence of insoles varies with the apparent mass distribution on the different feet parts. Practitioner Summary: The response of standing subjects to whole-body vibration has always been considered as a global parameter measured at the driving point, neglecting the local phenomena occurring in different foot parts. We have experimentally identified the apparent mass distribution of subjects in different standing postures and with different foot supports...|$|R
40|$|Abstract As use {{of printed}} {{electronics}} is going towards expansion in near future, researchers are studying methods {{for development of}} printed components, and also procedures for driving them. Few low speed but low cost, and flexible stand alone systems e. g., some sensor systems and displays; have already {{made their way to}} market after competing conventional, high speed, high cost, and rigid silicon electronics. At present, there are different type of printed sensors and display matrices, which have been developed but not being used in stand alone systems. Thus, there was a need for demonstrating ‘developed printed electronic components’ in such a way, that they are integrated with other core electronic circuits like embedded systems, to assure their ability to replace individual conventional component. In the thesis, some experiments were conducted to drive printed electronic components while overlooking their manufacturing details; i. e., the circuit used to drive the printed components was not a part of printed technology (e. g., printed processing, memory units), rather a conventional system (e. g., microcontroller and microprocessor boards available in market) is used. Particularly for this project the printed components are meant to be <b>capacitive</b> sensor <b>matrix,</b> resistive touch screen, organic light emitting diodes (OLED) matrix, electrophoretic display matrix, and electrochromic display matrix. These components were interfaced using embedded system {{in such a way that}} they can be driven meaningfully e. g., resistive touch screen can control display option for OLED matrix. Embedded Linux has significant advantages over previously used OS and non-OS based solutions as it is robust, scalable, and manage resources efficiently. Such a system with backbone of Linux processing was a part of design, which handled a separately designed interface board capable of interfacing 13 capacitive sensor (maximum 8 pF) inputs, a four wire resistive touch screen (with few hundred ohm resistance between terminals), a current driver with 50 mA segment current for 10 x 10 display matrix and voltage range from 0 to 5 V, voltage driver for two led segments capable of dissipate 40 mA at 5 V, finally a voltage driver for separate 10 led segments capable of dissipating 40 mA from 0 to 15 V or a 10 x 10 display matrix with power rating of maximum 16. 9 mA at 0 to 15 V. So, in this way different displays or individual led segments can be interfaced with a system which can download their display configuration from HTTP client based user interface, and upload the capacitive sensor and resistive touch screen readings back to user. The device was capable of changing demonstration parameters e. g., blinking, animation for displays via user interface, and program structure was kept convertible so that minor changes can create completely new demonstration: interfacing different components. Design included a power board capable of providing stable 1 A supply current at 5 V. A Current-Voltage (I-V) characterizing board was part of design which can measure I-V curve of printed solar cells. Printed electronic components were interfaced with embedded systems without much problem, making one comfortable in conclusion that these individual components are ready to replace conventional components in non-standalone systems at-least...|$|R
