5|$|The motif {{has many}} {{historical}} meanings. First, {{as a scientific}} and secular motif, it was only an astrological and zodiacal symbol. Under the Safavid and the first Qajar kings, it became more associated with Shia Islam. During the Safavid era, the lion and sun stood for the two pillars of society, {{the state and the}} Islamic religion. It became a national emblem during the Qajar era. In the 19th century, European visitors at the Qajar court attributed the lion and sun to remote antiquity; since then, it has acquired a nationalistic interpretation. During the reign of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar and his successors, the form of the motif was substantially changed. A crown was also placed {{on the top of the}} symbol to represent the monarchy. Beginning in the reign of Fat′h-Ali, the Islamic aspect of the monarchy was de-emphasized. This shift affected the symbolism of the emblem. The meaning of the symbol changed several times between the Qajar era and the 1979 revolution. The lion <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> a metaphor for the Shia Imam Ali or it could be symbolizing Rostam, the legendary hero of Iranian mythology. The Sun has alternately been interpreted as symbol of motherland or Jamshid, the mythical Shah of Iran.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language {{in the way that}} the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing was not meant to be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same way that the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E

Four people named as masturbators in it (by their first names only) are recognizable Swedish TV celebrities who according to Aftonbladet gave their consent.

The Sphinx is holding a naked young man and gives him probably the kiss of death, because the Riddle of the Sphinx has not been resolved. The humorous relief signifying killing a dragon <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> a matter of prejudice and public opinion. Heine's relief is embraced with a palm and a spruce twig.|$|E
25|$|During the 2004 Presidential campaign, President Chen Shui-bian {{publicly}} campaigned with Lee Teng-hui {{and developed}} a campaign platform, including a call for a new constitution adopted by referendum, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> {{an opportunity to make}} the symbolic changes which Lee supports. There was concern in the United States and in the People's Republic of China that Chen would be supportive of Lee's positions, a belief which was reinforced by Lee's own actions while President and by Lee's public statements that Chen Shui-bian agreed with him.|$|E

25|$|Arthur's Seat plays a {{prominent}} role in Scottish writer James Hogg's 1824 novel The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner. Robert and George Colwan, two feuding brothers, are caught in a fog atop Arthur's Seat and witness what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> a Brocken spectre, a strange phenomenon of the light, which causes George to believe that he is seeing a ghost. In the confusion, Robert nearly kills George, but they both escape {{to the bottom of the}} hill as the fog begins to clear.|$|E
25|$|The deposit as it {{was found}} in KV55 {{presents}} a mixture of chronological and religious anomalies. Objects inscribed with Amenhotep III's nomen and prenomen might be contemporary with that king's reign and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> possessions of Queen Tiye. Other items inscribed with Tiye's name (such as the shrine and furniture elements) also clearly belonged to her. Akhenaten's presence is indicated by items originally inscribed for him (such as the magical bricks) and items that were adapted for his use (such as the coffin and canopic jars).|$|E
25|$|Quarks and gluons (colored) {{manifest}} themselves by fragmenting into more quarks and gluons, {{which in turn}} hadronize into normal (colorless) particles, correlated in jets. As shown in 1978 summer conferences the PLUTO detector at the electron-positron collider DORIS (DESY) produced the first evidence that the hadronic decays of the very narrow resonance Υ(9.46) <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> three-jet event topologies produced by three gluons. Later published analyses by the same experiment confirmed this interpretation and also the spin 1 nature of the gluon (see also the recollection and PLUTO experiments).|$|E
5000|$|The term Zhēngmíng often {{appears in}} English as [...] "The Rectification of Names". This is a misleadingly narrow {{translation}} of the Chinese title. In classical Chinese, the phrase [...] "正名 (zhēngmíng)" [...] <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> either <b>as</b> [...] "rectifying names" [...] or as [...] "correct/right names".|$|R
5000|$|The label's {{name is a}} {{portmanteau}} of the French words [...] "moi-même" [...] (myself) and [...] "moitié" [...] (half), {{although the}} expression [...] "moi-même-moitié" [...] {{does not exist in}} French.

25|$|His {{interest}} in the human form developed at the Academy in Mexico City. His accentuation of the angles of the body, its muscles and joints, can be seen throughout his career in his portrayal of the strong revolutionary body. In addition, many works, especially in the 1930s, prominently feature hands, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> another heroic symbol of proletarian strength through work: his self-portrait in prison (El Coronelazo, 1945, Museum of Modern Art, Mexico City), Our Present Image (1947, Museum of Modern Art, Mexico), New Democracy (1944, Palace of Fine Arts, Mexico City), and even his series on working class women, such as The Sob.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that life initially arose as autocatalytic chemical networks. British ethologist Richard Dawkins wrote about autocatalysis as a potential explanation for {{the origin of life}} in his 2004 book The Ancestor's Tale. In his book, Dawkins cites experiments performed by Julius Rebek, Jr. and his colleagues in which they combined amino adenosine and pentafluorophenyl esters with the autocatalyst amino adenosine triacid ester (AATE). One product was a variant of AATE, which catalyzed the synthesis of themselves. This experiment demonstrated the possibility that autocatalysts could exhibit competition within a population of entities with heredity, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> a rudimentary form of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Laurence Hyde {{had some}} {{learning}} and {{a share of}} his father's literary genius. The main employment of his old age was the preparation for the press of his father's History of the Rebellion, to which he wrote a preface in which he expounded his Tory philosophy. The work was dedicated to his niece Queen Anne: the Queen, whose poor eyesight made reading something of an ordeal, was not especially pleased, particularly since the preface <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> an attack on her own policies. She remarked drily that it was strange {{that a man who}} did not lack sense in other ways should be made ridiculous by his vanity.|$|E
5000|$|Sen. Richard Gordon {{stated that}} [...] "de Castro is highly {{qualified}} for the High Tribunal and that her appointment <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> “reward” for her decision on the Erap plunder case.

50|$|Spontaneous {{symmetry}} breaking {{offered a}} framework to introduce bosons into relativistic quantum field theories. However, according to Goldstone's theorem, these bosons should be massless.
