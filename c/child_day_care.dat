5|$|Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami is a {{separate}} non-profit organization operated by the Archdiocese of Miami. It {{is part of a}} national network of organizations that are operated in each U.S. diocese. This organization claims to be the largest nongovernmental provider of services to the needy in South Florida. It began in 1931 during the Great Depression with four Miami-area pastors and lay members of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. It employs over 600 staff and operates on an annual budget of over $38 million. In 2006, it served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties. Some of these services include transitional housing, homeless shelters, elderly day care, <b>child</b> <b>day</b> <b>care,</b> addiction recovery, HIV/AIDS programs, family and school counseling, meals for the elderly and various immigrant and refugee help programs among others.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of children spend their childhood in <b>children</b> <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers, which represent the child's physical, biological and social environment. The {{purpose of this}} master thesis is to perform integral evaluation of comfort in twenty-five playrooms of eighteen Central-Slovenian <b>children</b> <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers. Integral evaluation of comfort has been performed in four steps, which included measurements of selected parameters of comfort, as well as surveying of the employees. The comprehensive literature review {{was carried out in}} step 1 as we identified the problems and defined criteria for integral evaluation of comfort. In-situ measurements of the selected parameters of thermal and visual comfort, indoor air quality and acoustic comfort were carried out in step 2 (objective evaluation of comfort). In addition, the subjective evaluation of comfort was performed in step 3 on the basis of validated questionnaire. In the context of step 4 – integral evaluation of comfort – we compared the measured and calculated parameters of each comfort type, analyzed the possible relationship between various parameters of comfort in selected playrooms, compared the results of objective and subjective evaluation of comfort and exposed the key conclusions. Based on the implemented steps we formulated integral comfort scale. We suggested possible improvements for achieving comfortable and healthy conditions in <b>children</b> <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers. We have found out that there are no researches, which would include integral evaluation of thermal, visual, acoustic comfort and indoor air quality of <b>children</b> <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers. Consequently, we are the first who used integral evaluation of comfort approach in an educational institution. We have discovered that comfort in {{majority of}} <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers is poor, while subjective evaluations of comfort parameters in playrooms were deviating from the objective ones. On the basis of integral comfort scale only two out of twentyfive playrooms were evaluated as integrally comfortable. Both, for new buildings {{as well as for the}} renovation of educational institutions, we suggest comprehensive measures, based on the presented integral evaluation of comfort...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pyogenes in <b>children</b> attending <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers in North Jordan was studied. Nasal and throat swabs, cultured for Streptococcus pyogenes {{were collected from}} 100 children enrolled in four <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers serving middle to high socioeconomic status portions {{of the population in}} March 1989. The identity of the streptococcal isolates was confirmed by biochemical and serological methods. Throat infection manifestations of the past 3 days, as reported and observed by the care givers, were related to culture results. The study findings showed that the {{prevalence of}} nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pyogenes was high and ranged between 10 to 23. 3 %. It was also noted that the care givers were able to correctly identify children with suspected throat infection, in 11 to 25 % of the children who grew Streptococcus pyogenes on cultures, by mere observation of the symptoms. Due to the high prevalence of nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pyogenes in these settings, measures to control and prevent the spread of Streptococcus pyogenes must be employed.

40|$|Background: <b>Children</b> {{attending}} <b>day</b> <b>care</b> experience substantial gastrointestinal morbidity due to circulating seasonal enteropathogens in the day-care environment. The lack of {{a distinct}} clinical presentation of gastroenteritis (GE) in these children, {{in combination with the}} high diversity of enteropathogenic agents, complicates the assessment of the individual contributions of enteropathogens that may cause GE. We aimed to estimate the proportion of day-care attendees experiencing GE that could be attributed to a range of enteropathogens circulating in <b>day</b> <b>care</b> in the Netherlands in 2010 - 2013. Methods: Using time-series data from a national laboratory-based and syndrome-based surveillance system in Dutch day-care centers and generalized estimating equation analysis, we modelled the variation in prevalence of 16 enteropathogens of bacterial (8), viral (5) and parasitic origin (3) circulating in <b>day</b> <b>care</b> to the variation of GE incidence among <b>children</b> attending <b>day</b> <b>care.</b> Results: Rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, Giardia and Cryptosporidium were significantly associated with GE morbidity among day-care attendees in our time-series analysis. Together, these enteropathogens accounted for 39 % of the GE morbidity: 11 % by rotavirus, 10 % by norovirus, 8 % by Giardia, 7 % by astrovirus and 3 % by Cryptosporidium. Conclusions: We demonstrate that circulating viruses and parasites, rather than bacteria, contribute to seasonal GE experienced by <b>children</b> in <b>day</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given that {{environmental}} factors, {{such as the}} school environment, can influence child development, more attention should {{be paid to the}} development of <b>children</b> attending <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers. OBJECTIVE: Todetermine whether there are differences in the gross motor, fine motor, or cognitive performances of children between 1 and 3 years-old of similar socioeconomic status attending public and private <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers full time. METHOD: Participants were divided into 2 groups, 1 of <b>children</b> attending public <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers (69 <b>children)</b> and another of <b>children</b> attending private <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers (47 <b>children).</b> All children were healthy and regularly attended <b>day</b> <b>care</b> full time for over 4 months. To assess cognitive, gross and fine motor performance, the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III was used. The Mann-Whitney test was used for comparative analyses between groups of children between 13 and 24 months, 25 and 41 months, and 13 and 41 months. RESULTS: <b>Children</b> in public <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers exhibited lower scores on the cognitive development scale beginning at 13 months old. The fine and gross motor performance scores were lower in children over the age of 25 months attending public centers.
