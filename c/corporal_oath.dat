6000|$|... "I dare take my <b>corporal</b> <b>oath</b> of that conclusion," [...] {{said the}} Antiquary. [...] "And {{was it the}} custom, Mr. Dousterswivel, in Westphalia, {{to make use of}} this elegant candelabrum?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have I {{not told}} you already," [...] {{answered}} Sir Mungo, [...] "that the king {{said something to}} that effect--so did the Prince too;--and such being the case, ye may take it on your <b>corporal</b> <b>oath,</b> that every man in the circle who was not silent, sung the same song as they did." ...|$|E
50|$|The Puritan {{probably}} {{dates from}} the year 1606. Some of its incidents are drawn from a contemporary work called The Merry Conceited Jests of George Peele, which attributes to the writer George Peele a number of tricks and jokes {{that can be found}} in previous popular literature. It contains an allusion to an almanac that specifies 15 July as a Tuesday, which was true only of 1606 {{in the first decade of}} the 17th century (although the author may not have intended it to be accurate). And the play's interest in <b>corporal</b> <b>oaths</b> may be related to the demands for oaths of allegiance from Catholics following the Gunpowder Plot.|$|R
6000|$|Here, then, we have twenty-three {{out of our}} thirty-nine fathers [...] "who {{framed the}} Government under which we live," [...] who have, upon their {{official}} responsibility and their <b>corporal</b> <b>oaths,</b> acted upon the very question which the text affirms they [...] "understood just as well, and even better than we do now"; and twenty-one of them--a clear majority of the whole [...] "thirty-nine"--so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury, if, in their understanding, any proper division between local and Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories. Thus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder than words, so actions under such responsibilities speak still louder.|$|R
5000|$|Sir Oliver Muckhill and Sir Andrew Tipstaff visit Lady Plus and Francis. Lady Plus {{is angry}} with the suitors for daring to present {{themselves}} again so soon after she told them to go away, but her attitude toward them seems to have softened now that Pieboard's first two [...] "prophesies" [...] have come true. She orders Francis to kiss Tipstaff and tells Muckhill that she has changed her mind and now intends to marry. Muckhill is overjoyed to hear this news. Tipstaff tempts Francis with promises of the extravagances she can expect to receive if she will become his wife. A servant enters and tells Lady Plus that Sir Godfrey and the [...] "conjurer" [...] will arrive shortly. The suitors exit. Lady Plus moves to an adjoining room. Sir Godfrey enters with Nicholas, Idle, Pieboard and Edmond. Idle says that the room is perfect for a conjuring ceremony. Frightened {{by the prospect of}} encountering a demon, Godfrey, Nicholas and Edmond retire to and adjoining room and plan to observe the ceremony through a keyhole. Idle recites some magical-sounding mumbo-jumbo. A touch of convenient thunder rumbles in the sky. Godfrey is frightened and impressed. Faking the voice of a demon, Pieboard asks the [...] "conjurer" [...] what he wants. When the ceremony is over, Idle calls Godfrey back into the room and tells him that the demon has dropped his chain in the garden. Godfrey, Lady Plus and Nicholas all run to the garden to collect the chain. Edmond enters. Fully convinced that a demon has just visited the house, he imagines that he can smell brimstone and inspects the hangings for signs of fire damage. Idle casts a [...] "spell" [...] to make Edmond invisible. To test his [...] "invisibility", Edmond walks up to Pieboard and tweaks his nose. Pieboard pretends that he cannot see Edmond at all. Sir Godfrey enters. He is extremely happy to have his chain back. Convinced that he is invisible, Edmond strikes Godfrey across the face. Godfrey promises to whip Edmond as punishment for his impudence. Edmond is surprised that his [...] "invisibility" [...] has worn off. Godfrey hugs Idle and thanks him for helping to recover the chain. Lady Plus says that, if she must marry, she will marry Idle, whom she describes as a worth captain and man of wit. (At this point, the action transfers to {{the street in front of}} Lady Plus' house, but there is not a formal scene break). Officers enter carrying <b>Corporal</b> <b>Oath's</b> coffin (he is assumed to be dead as a result of the [...] "wound" [...] Skirmish supposedly gave him in 3.1; in fact, he is merely sleeping deeply under the effect of Pieboard's sleeping potion). Other officers lead Skirmish in handcuffs—he is on his way to be executed as punishment for [...] "murdering" [...] Oath. Pieboard claims that he has the power to raise Oath from the dead. The officers tell him to go ahead and try. Oath wakes up. Everyone is very impressed. The officers agree to set Skirmish free—he is no longer guilty of murder because Oath has come back to life. Godfrey calls for a banquet to celebrate the day's miracles. Francis announces her intention to marry Pieboard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Excellency {{may take}} your <b>corporal</b> <b>oath</b> upon that," [...] said the worthy Major, {{speaking}} {{with his mouth}} full; [...] "for Argyle's bread and water are yet stale and mouldy in my recollection, and though they did their best, yet the viands that the Children of the Mist procured for me, poor helpless creatures as they were, were so unrefreshful to my body, that when enclosed in my armour, whilk I was fain to leave behind me for expedition's sake, I rattled therein like the shrivelled kernel in a nut that hath been kept on to a second Hallowe'en." ...|$|E
60|$|Although {{the giving}} {{information}} concerning the unfair {{manner in which they}} were dismissed from life, is popularly alleged to have been a frequent reason why departed spirits revisit the nether world, it is yet only in a play of the witty comedian, Foote, that the reader will find their appearance become the subject of formal and very ingenious pleadings. In his farce called the Orators, the celebrated Cocklane Ghost is indicted by the name of Fanny the Phantom, for that, contrary to the King's peace, it did annoy, assault, and terrify divers persons residing in Cocklane and elsewhere, in the county of Middlesex. The senior counsel objects to his client pleading to the indictment, unless she is tried by her equals in rank, and therefore he moves the indictment be quashed, unless a jury of ghosts be first had and obtained. To this it is replied, that although Fanny the Phantom had originally a right to a jury of ghosts, yet in taking upon her to knock, to flutter, and to scratch, she did, by condescending to operations proper to humanity, wave her privileges as a ghost, and must consent to be tried in the ordinary manner. It occurs to the Justice who tries the case, that there will be difficulty in impanelling a jury of ghosts, and he doubts how twelve spirits who have no body at all, can be said to take a <b>corporal</b> <b>oath,</b> as required by law, unless, indeed, {{as in the case of}} the Peerage, the prisoner may be tried upon her honour. At length the counsel for the prosecution furnishes the list of ghosts for the selection of the jury, being the most celebrated apparitions of modern times, namely, Sir George Villiers, the evil genius of Brutus, the Ghost of Banquo, and the phantom of Mrs Veal. The counsel for the prosecution objects to a woman, and the court dissolves, under the facetious order, that if the Phantom should plead pregnancy, Mrs Veal will be admitted upon the jury of matrons.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corporal</b> <b>Oath</b> and Skirmish stage a sword {{fight in}} front of Lady Plus' house. Oath pretends {{that he has been}} wounded in the leg. Lady Plus' {{servants}} witness the entire ordeal. A pair of officers arrest Skirmish and carry Oath off to get medical attention.|$|E
5000|$|Pieboard and Skirmish visit Captain Idle in prison. Idle {{tells them}} {{that he has been}} imprisoned for robbery. He fears that he will be hanged. Pieboard {{promises}} to do everything in his power to see that Idle is set free. Nicholas and <b>Corporal</b> <b>Oath</b> enter. Idle—a man who holds Puritans in very low esteem—is not happy to see his kinsman, Nicholas. <b>Corporal</b> <b>Oath</b> insists that Nicholas could prove useful. Pieboard suggests a scheme whereby Nicholas could help to get Idle out of jail. According to Pieboard's plan, Nicholas should steal his master's expensive chain (an ornament worn around the neck) and hide it in the garden. When his master (Sir Godfrey) becomes upset at the loss of the item, Nicholas should tell him that he has an imprisoned kinsman (Idle) who has a supernatural ability to find things. If events transpire according to Pieboard's designs, the master will then spring Idle from prison, Idle will [...] "find" [...] the chain in the garden, and everybody will be happy. Nicholas agrees to follow Pieboard's scheme. He exits. As part of another piece of his scheme, Pieboard instructs Skirmish and the Corporal to fake a fight in front of Lady Plus' home that evening. Pieboard also notes that he has to be careful when walking about in public because he faces the threat of being arrested as a result of unpaid debts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two sets}} of characters, Puritans and scoundrels, begin to make contact in the third scene. <b>Corporal</b> <b>Oath,</b> another cashiered soldier, {{encounters}} three of Lady Plus' servants, Frailty, Simon St. Mary Overies, and Nicholas St. Antlings. Amid some comic back-and-forth about Puritan hypocrisy and the Corporal's bad breath, it is revealed that Nicholas St. Antlings is a kinsman of Captain Idle. At the scene's end, Nicholas and the Corporal also head off to the Marshalsea Prison to learn the Captain Idle's fate. (St. Antlings and St. Mary Overies are two London parishes that were centres of Puritan activity in the early 17th century. The Puritan preacher William Crashaw took offence at the play's satire against Puritans, and preached a sermon on the subject in 1608.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking to herself, Moll {{looks forward}} to marrying her suitor, Sir John Pennydub, {{the son of a}} wealthy farmer. A servant enters and tells Moll that Pennydub has come to visit her. Moll is happy that Pennydub has managed to get into the house without {{alerting}} her mother's attention. Pennydub enters and asks Moll for a kiss. Moll kisses him. Lady Plus enters with Sir Godfrey. Moll and Pennydub exit to avoid being seen together. Sir Godfrey continues to encourage Lady Plus to remarry. Lady Plus will hear none of it. Sir Oliver Muckhill (suitor to Lady Plus), Sir Andrew Tipstaff (suitor to Francis) and Sir John Pennydub (suitor to Moll) enter. Lady Plus scorns them, assures them that she and her daughters will never marry, and tells them to leave. As the gentlemen make their exit, Sir Godfrey whispers that he will do everything in his power to convince Lady Plus to change her mind. Pieboard enters, posing as a fortune-teller. Sir Godfrey exits. Lady Plus' daughters, Francis and Moll, enter. Pieboard tells Lady Plus that her husband's soul is in purgatory (Puritans rejected purgatory as an invention of the Pope, used to increase his power and extort money from believers.) Lady Plus is sceptical of Pieboard's claims. To prove his supernatural abilities, Pieboard makes a series of predictions: 1) Lady Plus' brother-in-law, Sir Gregory, will lose something valuable (remember that Pieboard arranged for Nicholas to steal Gregory's chain in 1.4); 2) There will be some bloodshed resulting in a death in front of Lady Plus' door (remember that Pieboard instructed Skirmish and <b>Corporal</b> <b>Oath</b> to stage a fight in front of Lady Plus' home); 3) Lady Plus and Francis will go mad and run naked in public; and 4) Moll will be struck dumb. The women are horrified by these predictions. Pieboard tells them that, if the first two predictions—the ones he has rigged—come true, there are measures the women can take to avoid going mad or being struck dumb: the two women who have forsworn marriage (Lady Plus and Francis) should get married as soon as possible, and the daughter who is {{in a hurry to get}} married (Moll) should remain single. The women exit, deeply troubled. Pieboard congratulates himself on his wit. He says that, to validate his [...] "prophesy" [...] about a death at Lady Plus' door, he will give <b>Corporal</b> <b>Oath</b> a sleeping potion that will make it seem as though he is dead.|$|E
