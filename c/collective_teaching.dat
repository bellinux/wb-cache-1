This study undertakes a multiple-case study of the transfer of collective knowledge, guided by a set of tentative constructs and propositions derived from organizational learning theory. By focusing on the group-embeddedness dimension of collective knowledge, we direct our attention to the source and recipient communities. We identify two sets of strategic choices concerning the transfer of collective knowledge: collective vs. fragmented teaching, and collective vs. fragmented learning. The empirical context of this study is international R&D capability transfer in the Chinese auto industry.

40|$|In this article, {{dedicated}} to the revolutionary educational work of Peter McLaren, we will deal {{with the question of}} practical teaching methods in higher education {{from the point of view}} of critical pedagogy. We argue that nowadays teaching and learning in educational and social sciences are too often meaningless from the point of view of critical collective learning. Thus the central task in critical pedagogy, and in reform of higher education, is to understand the oppressive aspects of present college life and overall society in order to generate pedagogical, individual and societal transformation while developing pedagogical strategies and study methods that work toward the elimination of various forms of subordination based on class, gender, race and sexual orientation, and strengthen students’ possibilities for genuine collective learning while empowering them to fight against inequalities in the world. Our reflections stem from our academic life and teaching experiences both in Finland and the U. S. We suggest that in order to teach critically, educators need to use more collaborative and <b>collective</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning methods. Thus the idea of collective social expertise becomes a core aim of teaching in the context of critical pedagogy...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} explore {{the use of}} Novakian concept mapping {{as a means of}} visualising and tracing the range of {{emotions}} inherent within any teaching experience. It will focus in particular on its use within higher education, where the presence of emotion has traditionally been disregarded or seemingly suppressed. The example of undergraduate teaching of the law degree will be used as an area where the role of emotion is particularly under-theorised. This paper will assess the effectiveness of concept mapping as a tool to enable academics to explicitly acknowledge, and reflect upon, the existence of emotion, both in terms of their individual teaching experiences, their <b>collective</b> <b>teaching</b> journey through a course or qualification and their students’ learning journey. It will also consider how use of this technique at a collective level could identify areas of pedagogic frailty, which may arise due to the misinterpreting, mishandling or suppression of emotion. The various opportunities and challenges arising from this application of concept mapping techniques will be discussed, drawing on a small, empirical pilot study, and leading to the conclusion that it has a useful and significant role to play within an emerging field of enquiry. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{question}} of a convenient equipoise between the artist and his immediate society has for long dominated the field of sociology of literature. This has become increasingly unavoidable in dictatorial regimes. For leftist writers, the basic essence is to ‘unsettle ’ the already settled and indeed defeatist or fatalistic mindsets of the oppressed class. Consequently, {{the essence of the}} education their literature offers is towards the goal of liberation: indeed, the practice of freedom is central to this theory of action. In this wise, the paper is a study of The Prisoners, a play written by one of Nigeria’s second generation playwrights. The paper observes that our chosen playwright belongs to the Left and he adopts the principle of collective pedagogy, which involves <b>collective</b> <b>teaching</b> and thinking through together among the vectors of revolutionary change. Again, it is observed that the playwright’s personal experience of the Nigerian Civil War (1967 - 1970) coupled with his working experiences and social rapport with the rulers and the ruled in Nigeria or elsewhere may have conditioned his conceptualisation of the play. Thus, the essence of investigating Nwamuo’s The Prisoners is to highlight the implications of collective pedagogy in enhancing social change and development in the society...|$|E
