40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between political risk as an international environmental determinant of capital structure as well as other factors that contribute to capital structure including leverage, foreign exchange risk, agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> and collateral value of assets. We conducted this research on a sample of 200 Singaporean, non-financial, listed domiciled multinational firms over the period of 2005 to 2009. The results suggest that political risk is irrelevant to the multinational capital structure, foreign exchange risk, agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> and (netted) collateral value of assets. We find that the results remain unchanged after controlling for size and industry. The findings produce evidence that foreign exchange risk, as another international factor is also irrelevant to the Singaporean multinational capital structure choice. Additionally, agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and (netted) fixed assets have a negative association with leverage for Singaporean multinational corporations...|$|R

500|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in default rates among junk bond issuing companies. [...] The historical default rate for high yield bonds from 1978 to 1988 was approximately 2.2% of total issuance. [...] In 1989, defaults increased dramatically to 4.3% of the then $190 billion market and an additional 2.6% of issuance defaulted {{in the first half}} of 1990. [...] As a result of the higher perceived risk, the differential in yield of the junk bond market over U.S. treasuries (known as the [...] "spread") had also increased by 700 basis points (7 percentage points). [...] This made the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> in the high yield market significantly more expensive than it had been previously.

2500|$|A {{leveraged}} buyout (LBO) is a financial transaction {{in which a}} company is purchased {{with a combination of}} equity and debt, such that the company's cash flow is the collateral used to secure and repay the borrowed money. The use of debt, which has a lower cost of capital than equity, serves to reduce the overall cost of financing the acquisition. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> is lower because interest payments reduce corporate income tax liability, whereas dividend payments do not. [...] This reduced cost of financing allows greater gains to accrue to the equity, and, as a result, the debt serves as a lever to increase the returns to the equity.|$|E

40|$|Executive {{compensation}} influences managerial risk preferences through executives' portfolio sensitivities {{to changes}} in stock prices (delta) and stock return volatility (vega). Large deltas discourage managerial risk-taking, while large vegas encourage risk-taking. Theory suggests that short-maturity <b>debt</b> mitigates agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> by constraining managerial risk preferences. We posit and find evidence of a negative (positive) relation between CEO portfolio deltas (vegas) and short-maturity debt. We also find that short-maturity debt mitigates the influence of vega- and delta-related incentives on bond yields.

2500|$|Management must {{identify}} the [...] "optimal mix" [...] of financing – the capital structure {{that results in}} maximum firm value, (See Balance sheet, WACC) but must also take other factors into account (see trade-off theory below). Financing a project through debt results in a liability or obligation that must be serviced, thus entailing cash flow implications independent of the project's degree of success. Equity financing is less risky with respect to cash flow commitments, but results in a dilution of share ownership, control and earnings. The cost of equity (see CAPM and APT) is also typically higher than the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> - which is, additionally, a deductible expense – and so equity financing may result in an increased hurdle rate which may offset any reduction in cash flow risk.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the information asymmetry between owner/manager and lenders. More specifically, the research investigates {{the role of}} corporate governance mechanisms in reducing the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> The findings show that lenders perceive higher agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> if the controlling shareholder owns a percentage of capital greater than 66 %. Results also show {{that the presence of}} independent directors elected by minority shareholders on the board mitigates the agency conflicts between borrowers and lenders. In the same way, the audit committee independence reduces the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> Moreover, the study shows that when the audit committee chairman coincides with the board chairman banks perceive more risk and, therefore, a bigger asymmetry. This coincidence increases the concentration of {{power in the hands of}} just one person and this enhances the likelihood of opportunistic actions by the management that could damage lenders. This means that it is costly for companies to concede to just one person too much influence over the board activities, because it reduces the effectiveness of the monitoring role played by independent directors, increasing the information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders...|$|R
5000|$|Within {{the theory}} of {{corporate}} finance, bankruptcy <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> are the increased <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> financing with <b>debt</b> instead <b>of</b> equity that result from a higher probability of bankruptcy. The fact that bankruptcy is generally a costly process in itself and not only a transfer of ownership implies that these costs negatively affect {{the total value of}} the firm. These costs {{can be thought of as}} a financial cost, in the sense that the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> financing increases because the probability of bankruptcy increases. One way to understand this is to realize that when a firm goes bankrupt investors holding its debt are likely to lose part or all of their investment, and therefore investors require a higher rate of return when investing in bonds of a firm that can easily go bankrupt. This implies that an increase in debt which ends up increasing a firm's bankruptcy probability causes an increase in these bankruptcy <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b>|$|R

40|$|Existing {{theories}} {{advocate the}} exclusive use of equity-like instruments in executive compensation. However, recent empirical studies document {{the prevalence of}} debt-like instruments such as pensions. This paper justifies the use <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> as efficient compensation. Inside debt is a superior solution to the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> than the solvency-contingent bonuses and salaries proposed by prior literature, since its payoff depends {{not only on the}} incidence of bankruptcy but also firm value in bankruptcy. Contrary to intuition, granting the manager equal proportions <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and equity is typically inefficient. In most cases, an equity bias is desired to induce effort. However, if effort is productive in increasing liquidation value, or if bankruptcy is likely, a debt bias can improve effort as well as alleviate the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> The model generates a number of empirical predictions consistent with recent evidence.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{determination}} <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> contracting by testing how {{the probability of}} explicit contracting is related to amount to be borrowed and bond feature variables such as maturity, coupon, and bond ratings. Then, we {{examine the relationship between}} agency costs and contracting by comparing between two groups of bond: explicit restriction vs. implicit restriction on the sale of asset and/or sale and leaseback transaction. The probability of explicit restriction in place-is positively related to the amount of capital to be raised in support of the hypothesized relationship: the larger the amount of borrowing, the more likely an explicit restriction is to be included in debt contract. The negative coefficient for bond ratings is statistically significant in strong support of the hypothesized negative relationship between the probability of explicit contracting and bond ratings. The larger the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> (that is, the lower the bond ratings), the more likely explicit restrictions are in place. Agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> (for which bond ratings are used as a proxy) are found to be positively related to the amount of issue and maturity, and negatively related to coupon rate and contracting variable. These positive relationships are interpreted as the size of capital to be raised by bond issue tends to be larger for the borrowing firms with lower agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> debt; and the longer the maturity, the higher the bond ratings, i. e. the lower agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt...</b>|$|R

To mitigate these costs, existing studies find that MNCs typically have lower levels <b>of</b> long-term <b>debt</b> than domestic corporations (DCs).

A reduction in the creditor rights index from its highest value to its lowest value implies a 41 % reduction in the probability of paying a dividend, and a 60 % reduction in dividend payout ratios. These results are robust to numerous control variables, sample variations, model specifications, and alternative hypotheses. We also show that the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> play a more decisive role in determining dividend policies than the previously documented agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> equity.
