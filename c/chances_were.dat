5|$|Returning to QPR at {{the start}} of the new season, <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> limited. The 3–1 victory over Leicester City on New Years Day 2008 was Rehman's 50th game in all {{competitions}} since leaving Fulham in 2006. Rehman finished the 2007–08 season in the starting line for QPR against the Championship's new champions, West Bromwich Albion.|$|E

Soon after New Zealand were at 5/36 after 11 overs, leaving them with 71 runs to score from the last 54 balls, and Australia were in the ascendancy. However, New Zealand's <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> revived by Nicola Browne and Sophie Devine, who put on 41 from as many balls. In the 18th over, Healy caught Browne from Perry's bowling, and Australia went on to win by three runs after New Zealand ended on 6/103.|$|E

Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; it came in a 4–0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. The season ended sourly, however, as Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England's World Cup qualification <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> hit by a run of poor form.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the Humean theory of <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> {{formally}} adequate {{in the sense that}} it satisfies the axioms of finitely additive probability. To this end, firstly, a functionalist account of <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> defended, according to which <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> a functional property and the function relevant to <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> to constrain an agent’s credence in the manner prescribed by David Lewis’s Principal Principle. <b>Chance</b> thus understood <b>is</b> called an expert. Secondly, to specify the functional role of <b>chance,</b> it <b>is</b> claimed that primarily <b>chance</b> should <b>be</b> treated as a cognitive expert, i. e., expert that constrains an agent’s credence because it is predictively accurate. In this light, Humean <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> taken to be a possible physical realization of the cognitive expert. When Humean <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> understood in this way, it can be shown that it occupies the role of the cognitive expert if and only if it is formally adequate. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1848, Kentucky Democrats {{nominated}} Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd {{declined the}} nomination. Powell {{was chosen to}} replace Boyd on the ticket, {{largely due to the}} influence of James Guthrie. The Whig party nominated Senator John J.

Knowing the Democrats' <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell.

5|$|Just {{ahead of}} the opening match of the 2016–17 season, Ranieri cautioned against {{excessive}} hope of City retaining the title arguing that the other clubs now understood Leicester's break tactics. His principle objective, as last season, was to avoid relegation. He also warned against overconfidence against relegation favourites – by implication, their next opponents, newly promoted Hull City. His view on Leicester's <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> shared by Gary Lineker, who said that N'Golo Kanté, who left the club during the summer to join Chelsea, had been Leicester's most important player and essential to Ranieri's system.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{controlled}} the opening passages of the game. Their first goalscoring chance {{came in the}} 11th minute when Alan Kennedy's 30 yard shot was saved by Real goalkeeper Agustín Rodríguez. Further <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> created, but neither Terry McDermott or Dalglish were able to score. Real started to exert more of an influence after this, midfielder Juanito started to cause Liverpool problems with his passing. One pass found José Antonio Camacho who beat Liverpool defender Alan Hansen but put his shot wide of the Liverpool goal. Despite their scoring opportunity, one problem Real had {{was to get the}} best out of their winger Cunningham. Not fully fit, he was tightly marked and made little impact in the match.|$|E

Other notable riders present in the field included 2008 winner Fabian Cancellara, American time trial specialist David Zabriskie, Italian classics rider and former Tirreno–Adriatico podium finisher Alessandro Ballan, former Italian national champion Filippo Pozzato, 2010 Giro d'Italia runner-up David Arroyo, and Australian sprinter Robbie McEwen.|$|E
5|$|The semi-final, against Everton, {{was played}} at Villa Park. Everton were renowned for their {{powerful}} midfield of Ball, Harvey and Kendall, but opted to play more defensively than usual.

Mike Doyle suffered an injury in the first half, and spent 20 minutes off the field. City had the better of the game, but goalscoring <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> missed by Lee and Young. With little time remaining, Young forced a corner. Young took the corner himself, from which teenager Tommy Booth scored the game's only goal.|$|E
5|$|Babangida's {{international}} <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> partly limited due to {{the fact}} that he often found himself behind Finidi George in the pecking order. He played an important role in his team's Olympic triumph in Atlanta in 1996, as Nigeria overcame tough resistance from Brazil and Argentina, packed with the likes of Dida, Roberto Carlos, Bebeto, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Hernan Crespo, Claudio López, Ariel Ortega and Diego Simeone among others. Babangida took part in Nigeria's 1998 World Cup campaign, playing a total of 120 minutes as he started one game and came on as a sub in the other three. He scored his team's only goal in the second-round defeat to Denmark.

5|$|Payne ran {{for reelection}} in 1876 but was {{defeated}} by Republican Amos Townsend. He remained involved in politics, however, and even considered running for the Democratic nomination for President in 1880. Tilden, while not officially a candidate, wielded a heavy influence over the convention. Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer. Tilden did tell some of his close supporters that, {{if he did not}} run, Payne would be his first choice and House Speaker Samuel J. Randall his second. With that, many of the Tilden loyalists pledged their support to Payne, at least until Tilden decided to enter the race. Although Tilden ultimately declined to be nominated, Payne's <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> hindered when Ohio's delegation remained loyal to Senator Allen G. Thurman. Although Payne place third on the convention's first ballot, on the second the delegates stampeded to General Winfield Scott Hancock, who was nominated.|$|E
5|$|Simpson's primary {{objective}} for 1967 was overall {{victory in the}} Tour de France; in preparation, he planned to ride stage races instead of one-day classics. Simpson felt his <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> good because this Tour was contested by national, rather than professional teams. He would lead the British team, which– although one of the weakest– would support him totally, unlike Peugeot. During Simpson's previous three years with Peugeot, he was only guaranteed a place on their Tour team if he signed with them for the following year. Free to join a new team for the 1968 season, he was offered at least ten contracts; Simpson had a verbal agreement with Italian team Salvarani, and would share its leadership with Felice Gimondi. In an interview with Cycling (now Cycling Weekly) journalist, Ken Evans, in April, Simpson revealed his intention to attempt the hour record in the 1967 season. He also said he wanted retire from road racing aged 33, to ride on the track and {{spend more time with}} his family.|$|E

A few minutes later Len Davies headed the ball down to the feet of Ferguson, but the Cardiff player fired the ball wide of the goal despite being {{only a few feet}} away from the goal line. Just before half time, Cardiff won a direct free kick; Fred Keenor hammered the ball into a wall of Corinthian players.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Hurricane Rafael {{is attributed to}} a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on October5. The wave remained disorganized until roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles, at which time a broad {{area of low pressure}} developed and convection began to consolidate around it. As a result, the disturbance was introduced into the National Hurricane Center (NHC)'s 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook with a low chance of tropical development. These <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> subsequently raised as further development occurred, with the system receiving a medium chance of development early on October10, and a high chance of development as it approached the southern Leeward Islands late the following evening. As the wave crossed into the eastern Caribbean Sea and slowed down, the previously broad and open surface low consolidated and became stacked with the mid-level center. The disturbance was already producing tropical storm-force winds, and as a result, skipped tropical depression status to become Tropical Storm Rafael at 1800UTC on October12. At this time, the cyclone was located roughly 200mi (320km) south-southeast of St. Croix.|$|E

The Spanish newspaper El País believed Indurain to be the favorite heading into {{the first day of}} racing. However, the newspaper did state that his <b>chances</b> <b>were</b> lower since his teammate Jean-François Bernard was not participating in the race due to an injury. l'Unità writer Dario Ceccarelli and Avui writer Recuero believed that Chiappucci and Indurain were the favorites to win the overall crown. Spanish newspaper Diari de Girona named Indurain, Chiappucci, Laurent Fignon, and Massimiliano Lelli the main contenders to win the race.|$|E
