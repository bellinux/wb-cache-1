40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} an {{experimental}} method {{to determine the}} electric parameters of a seven-phase low-voltage multiphase drive. The drive is a belt driven starter-alternator for powerful cars with Hybrid Electrical Vehicles (HEV) functions. The resistive and inductive parameters are necessary to obtain the six characteristic time constants of the control modeling. Classical direct measurements lead to imprecise results because of very low values for the windings electric resistance (a few mΩ) and inductance (a few μH). Effects of the imprecision on the measurements are {{all the more important}} that time constants are obtained by a ratio of cyclic inductances by resistance, with cyclic inductances being a linear combination of seven measured inductances. The methodology for <b>identification</b> <b>detailed</b> in this paper is based on a stator current vector control, in a multi-reference frame. This methodology allows us to get directly these time constants. Numerous measurements allow the robustness of the method to be evaluate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper proposes an {{essential}} maintenance strategy for riveted railway bridges {{based on an}} accurate remaining fatigue life estimation technique. The strategy mainly consists of structural appraisal based critical members and connections identification, remaining fatigue lives estimation of critical connections and time dependent member replacement or strengthening scheme. In the stage of critical member <b>identification,</b> <b>detailed</b> structural appraisal has to be conducted giving priority to visual inspection for condition, FE analysis, and material testing, experimental static and dynamic load testing. Accurate fatigue life estimation techniques of both members and connections consist of measured stress histories and recently developed new fatigue models. A verification of the proposed strategy is conducted by comparing the predicted replacement scheme with sequence of experimental failure and fatigue life of selected test specimens. Finally, the proposed strategy was applied to a case study railway bridge to obtain time dependent member replacement scheme and obtained results are compared with previous estimations. Hence, validity and merits of proposed strategy were confirmed...|$|R

40|$|This project aims {{to reduce}} the time {{required}} to attain more detailed scans of small interesting regions present in a quick first-pass sample image. In particular, we concentrate on high fidelity imaging of small sample features via hyperspectral Raman imaging (e. g., small scale compositional variations in bone tissue [4]). The current standard procedure for high quality hyperspectral Raman imaging of small sample features consists of four steps: First-Pass Imaging, <b>Detail</b> <b>Identification,</b> Planning, and finally Detail Imaging. Traditionally, Detail Imaging and Planning have been carried out manually by human personnel—after acquiring some quick lowquality data in First-Pass Imaging, a researcher looks for interesting features (<b>Detail</b> <b>Identification)</b> and decides how to acquire higher-quality data for the interesting features (Planning), which is done in the final Detail Imaging phase. In this paper we will discuss automating the <b>Detail</b> <b>Identification</b> and Planning steps, resulting in a decrease of the procedure’s total integration time. We fix an arbitrary way to automate <b>Detail</b> <b>Identification</b> and compare several different Planning methods. Our primary result is a method guaranteed to return a least cost (e. g., minimum integration time/number of scans) Detail Image under a general cost model. Because of their generality, the methodologies developed here may prove widely useful to basic biomedical scientists as well as to researchers in the pharmaceutical industry...|$|R

40|$|Many {{financial}} organisations (i. e. {{banks and}} insurance companies) have databases on {{individuals and their}} major transactions. These databases have different uses such as obtaining a historical record of an individual. Often the (legal) circumstances mean that a unique identifier for each individual does not exist or cannot be used. Instead personal <b>identification</b> <b>details</b> (names, addresses, dates of birth etc.) must be used to "index" and retrieve records. This is an inexact method and often results in ambiguous situations where multiple records are returned for an enquiry. Disambiguating these situations we term the profile resolution problem. Organisations usually use human experts (review clerks) to resolve ambiguous cases. This is time consuming, expensive and {{does not address the}} cause of the problem. We have shown {{that it is possible to}} automate the decision making expertise of these review clerks with a number of techniques from artificial intelligence and statistics. We illustrate that the profile resolution problem is actually one of three interrelated problems associated with ambiguous cases and discuss how automated techniques can address each...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A taxonomic {{revision}} of the Asian species of Stuckenia, a segregate of Potamogeton, is presented. Six species are recognized and their morphological descriptions, nomenclature and typification of relevant names are given. Distribu-tions of all species are described and lists of representative specimens and distribution maps provided. Lectotypes are designated for 24 names and nomencla-tural types are listed for 22 additional names. The correct name for the species known as Potamogeton recurvatus is Stuckenia pamirica (Baagöe) Z.

40|$|Healthcare {{institutions}} adapt {{cloud based}} archiving of medical images and patient records {{to share them}} efficiently. Controlled access to these records and authentication of images must be enforced to mitigate fraudulent activities and medical errors. This paper presents a zero-watermarking scheme implemented in the composite Contourlet Transform (CT) —Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) domain for unambiguous authentication of medical images. Further, a framework is proposed for accessing patient records based on the watermarking scheme. The patient <b>identification</b> <b>details</b> and a link to patient data encoded into a Quick Response (QR) code serves as the watermark. In the proposed scheme, the medical image is not subjected to degradations due to watermarking. Patient authentication and authorized access to patient data are realized on combining a Secret Share with the Master Share constructed from invariant features of the medical image. The Hu’s invariant image moments are exploited in creating the Master Share.
