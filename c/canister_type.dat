40|$|Performance {{assessment}} for canister cleaning {{system in the}} KE Basin. Information obtained from this assessment {{will be used to}} design any additional equipment used to clean canisters. After thorough review of the design, maintenance history and operational characteristics of the 105 K East (KE) canister cleaning system, Bartlett recommends that the high pressure water jet system (HPWJS) be modified as outlined in section 5. 0, and retained for future use. Further, it is recommended that Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project consider use of a graded approach for canister cleaning, based on individual <b>canister</b> <b>type</b> and characteristics. This approach would allow a simple method to be used on canisters not needing the more rigorous, high-pressure method. Justification is provided in section 5. 0. Although Bartlett has provided some preliminary cost estimates, it is recommended that SNF Project perform a detailed cost-benefit analysis to weigh the alternatives presented...|$|E

50|$|This {{series of}} weapons was {{designed}} to provide a modern alternative to breechloading conversions of the Civil War-era 3-inch Ordnance rifle. It was made of gun steel, stronger than the wrought iron of previous weapons. It fired a 13.5 lb projectile with cast iron, shrapnel, or <b>canister</b> <b>types</b> available. All versions used separately loaded bag charges. The M1885 and M1890 used black powder when first introduced, but the M1897 was redesigned for smokeless powder; the M1890 weapons were then modified for smokeless powder and redesignated M1897s. In the Spanish-American War, difficulties were encountered in ramping up production of smokeless powder, so the M1885 and M1890 weapons were deployed to use the available black powder. There was no recoil mechanism, but the carriage's wheel brakes provided some recoil absorption. The M1890 was a simplification of the M1885, with the barrel made from two forgings instead of eight.|$|R

Additionally, an onboard oxygen generating system {{eliminates the need for}} heavy oxygen <b>canisters.</b> The <b>types</b> of combat missions undertaken by the MiG-29K can be increased by adding optronic/infrared imaging reconnaissance pods.|$|R
40|$|The ''Department of Energy Spent Nuclear Fuel Canister, Transportation, and Monitored Geologic Repository Systems, Structures, and Components Performance Allocation Study'' (CRWMS M&O 2000 b) {{allocated}} {{performance to}} both the canisters received at the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) and the MGR Canister Transfer System (CTS). The purpose of this calculation is to evaluate an assumed range of canister and CTS performance allocation failure probabilities and {{determine the effect of}} these failure probabilities on the frequency of a radionuclide release. Five <b>canister</b> <b>types</b> are addressed in this calculation; high-level radioactive waste (HLW) canisters containing vitrified borosilicate glass, HLW canisters containing immobilized plutonium surrounded by borosilicate glass (Pu/HLW canisters), Department of Energy (DOE) spent nuclear fuel (DSNF) standard canisters (4 sizes), DSNF multi-canister overpacks (MCOs) for N-reactor fuel and other selected DSNF, and naval spent nuclear fuel (SNF) canisters (2 sizes). The quality assurance program applies to this calculation, and the work is performed in accordance with procedure AP- 3. 12 Q, ''Calculations''. The work done for this calculation was evaluated according to AP- 2. 21 Q, ''Quality Determinations and Planning for Scientific, Engineering, and Regulatory Compliance Activities'' that determined this activity to be subject to the requirements of DOE/RW- 0333 P, ''Quality Assurance Requirements and Description'' (DOE 2000 a).

40|$|Borated {{stainless}} steel alloys are candidate neutron absorber materials for criticality control in disposal containers or dry storage <b>canisters.</b> <b>Type</b> 304 borated {{stainless steel}}s {{are similar to}} conventional Type 304 stainless steels except that they contain a boron addition, which imparts a much higher thermal neutron absorption cross section than other austenitic stainless steels. This work investigated the corrosion behavior of borated stainless steel in water and humid air. In this study, Type 304 B 4 and 304 B 5 borated stainless steels {{were exposed to the}} liquid and vapor phases of simulated groundwater at 60, 75, and 90 °C [140, 167, and 194 °F] for about 3 months. The vapor phase was open to air representing the humid air condition. The posttest specimens were analyzed to determine general corrosion rates and occurrence of localized corrosion. It was found that some specimens exposed to humid air at 75 and 90 °C [167 and 194 °F] suffered pitting corrosion, but pitting corrosion was not observed at 60 °C [140 °F] or from the liquid exposure at 75 and 90 °C [167 and 194 °F]. The pits were circular, and the surface near the pitted area was stained. The maximum pit depth was about 70 µm [2. 8 mil]. All the specimens exposed to the liquid phase showed weight gain before acid cleaning of the surface due to scale formation. Most of the specimens exposed to humid air showed weight loss. At all three temperatures, the general corrosion rates of Type 304 B 4 were less than 80 nm/yr [0. 0032 mil/yr] and those of Type 304 B 5 were less than 600 nm/yr [0. 024 mil/yr]. No clear trend was observed regarding the influence of temperature on general corrosion rates of each material. The general corrosion rates of Type 304 B 5 were higher than those of Type 304 B 4...|$|R

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{interesting}} regions of study in our solar system lie inside craters, canyons, and cryovolcanoes, but current state-of-the-art rovers are incapable of accessing and traversing these regions. Axel is a minimalistic rover designed for extreme terrains, and two Axels with a central mother system form a four-wheeled rover to efficiently traverse flat ground. Upon approaching the edge of a crater, Axel detaches from the mother system and travels down the cliff guided by the unwinding tether. However, scientific study of extraplanetary terrains requires instrumentation inside the Axel rover. We aim to develop a simple and reliable sample acquisition and caching system that could retrieve multiple samples from various sites before returning them to the mother system where more sophisticated instruments could perform further analysis. For simplicity and robustness, we propose a pneumatic sampling system which uses compressed air, guided with a nozzle, to blow soil into a sample <b>canister.</b> Numerous <b>types</b> of nozzles were designed, built, and tested. Different designs for nozzle deployment, sample caching, and pressure containment were considered. Finally, a prototype of the entire sampling system was built and evaluated for performance and feasibility...|$|R
50|$|The {{canisters}} could contain food, ammunition, {{weapons or}} other equipment - the Mark 1 canister could carry 12 rifles and 1000 rounds of ammunition. A cylindrical fuel can was also developed {{to fit the}} CLE Canister, with a canister able to accommodate three of the cans. Some loads, such as radios, weren't dropped in CLE Canisters and required special containers to carry and protect them. Prepacked canisters were allocated code numbers according to their load; a unit requiring resupply simply had to communicate the code {{and the number of}} <b>canisters</b> required. The <b>type</b> of load was indicated by the colour of the parachute, although the colours used were periodically changed to confuse the enemy. During Operation Market Garden, for example, the colours used were red for ammunition, green for rations, white for medical supplies, blue for fuel and yellow for communication equipment.|$|R
40|$|A Settlement Agreement {{between the}} Department of Energy and the State of Idaho {{mandates}} that all {{high-level radioactive waste}} now stored at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant be treated {{so that it is}} ready to move out of Idaho for disposal by the target date of 2035. This study investigates the immobilization of all Idaho Chemical Processing Plant calcine, including calcined sodium bearing waste, via the process known as hot isostatic press, which produces compact solid waste forms by means of high temperature and pressure (1, 050 C and 20, 000 psi), as the treatment method for complying with the settlement agreement. The final waste product would be contained in stainless-steel <b>canisters,</b> the same <b>type</b> used at the Savannah River Site for vitrified waste, and stored at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory until a national geological repository becomes available for its disposal. The waste processing period is from 2013 through 2032, and disposal at the High Level Waste repository will probably begin sometime after 2065...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn investigation was conducted {{of the effect}} of canister geometry on the effectiveness of a constant mass of a commercial soda lime, Sodasorb, to absorb carbon dioxide from a mixture of carbon dioxide and air. A comparison of cylindrical canisters with length-to-diameter ratios of 0. 15, 0. 29, 0. 44, 0. 80, 1. 16, and 2. 125 was completed with a constant mass of three pounds of Sodasotb. Annular ring baffles and disk baffles were employed to get a more evenly distributed usage of the Sodasorb with the results compared to the 'straiht' through <b>type</b> <b>canisters</b> for the above L/D ratios. A steady flow rate of approximately 2. 1 SCFM of saturated air with six percent carbon dioxide at one atmosphere and environment temperature of 70 degrees F was used.

40|$|Batteries {{were used}} on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) to provide power to both the active {{experiments}} and the experiment support equipment such as the Experiment Initiative System, Experiment Power and Data System (data acquisition system), and the Environment Exposure Control <b>Canisters.</b> Three different <b>types</b> of batteries were used: lithium sulfur dioxide (LiSO 2), lithium carbon monofluoride (LiCF), and nickel cadmium (NiCd). A total of 92 LiSO 2, 10 LiCF, and 1 NiCd batteries were flown on the LDEF. In addition, approximately 20 LiSO 2 batteries were kept in cold storage at NASA LaRC. The various investigations and post-flight analyses of the flight and control batteries are reviewed. The primary objectives of these studies was to identify degradation modes (if any) of the batteries and to provide information useful to future spacecraft missions. Systems SIG involvement in the post-flight evaluation of LDEF batteries was two-fold: (1) to fund SAFT (original manufacturer of the LiSO 2 batteries) to perform characterization of 13 LiSO 2 batteries (10 flight and 3 control batteries); and (2) to integrate investigator results...|$|R
40|$|A thermal {{analysis}} was performed of a thermal energy storage <b>canister</b> of a <b>type</b> suggested {{for use in a}} solar receiver for an orbiting Brayton cycle power system. Energy storage for the eclipse portion of the cycle is provided by the latent heat of a eutectic mixture of LiF and CaF 2 contained in the canister. The chief motivation for the study is the prediction of vapor void effects on temperature profiles and the identification of possible differences between ground test data and projected behavior in microgravity. The first phase of this study is based on a two-dimensional, cylindrical coordinates model using an interim procedure for describing void behavor in 1 -g and microgravity. The {{thermal analysis}} includes the effects of solidification front behavior, conduction in liquid/solid salt and canister materials, void growth and shrinkage, radiant heat transfer across the void, and convection in the melt due to Marangoni-induced flow and, in 1 -g, flow due to density gradients. A number of significant differences between 1 -g and o-g behavior were found. This resulted from differences in void location relative to the maximum heat flux and a significantly smaller effective conductance in 0 -g due to the absence of gravity-induced convection...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) has {{recently}} {{worked out a}} concept, KBS- 3 V, for disposal of highly radioactive waste {{in the form of}} spent reactor fuel and asked for the Government's approval and licensing. It implies blasting of tunnels at about 400 m depth and boring of large-diameter canister deposition holes extending vertically from the tunnel floor. The rock stresses will be critically high in the construction phase and lead to failure by spalling when the heat pulse from the canisters evolves. The canisters will be surrounded by dense expansive "buffer" clay for minimizing groundwater flow around and along them but the long-term performance of either of them is not adequately proven and the placement impractical and risky. Four major changes of the concept would make it satisfactory. One involves reorientation of the deposition holes from vertical to 45 degrees inclination in two directions for reducing the risk of rock failure. A second is to prepare ready-made stiff units of "supercontainers" with highly compacted blocks of clay tightly surrounding the canisters for simpler and safer installation of clay blocks and canisters. A third is to surround the supercontainers by clay mud that provides the dense buffer with water from start and supports the surrounding rock when the thermal pulse begins to raise the rock stresses. A fourth is to replace the proposed smectite-rich buffer by clay with higher chemical stability and lower but sufficient expandability. A possible fifth change can be to manufacture homogeneous copper <b>canisters</b> of HIPOW <b>type,</b> which would radically reduce the risk of contamination of groundwater by released radionuclides...|$|R
50|$|II./KG 54, I./KG 100, I./KG 54, I. and II./KG 2 joined {{together}} over the Dutch coast at the Funkfeuer at Noordwijk. The force numbered from 90 to 100 bombers. A North Sea landfall culminated near the Essex coast near the Thames Estuary. The crews had no pathfinders to aid them and instead relied on dead reckoning. The crews were briefed {{to fly in}} from the north then bank left and carry out a bomb-run from west to east across the city according to German crews captured on the night. Examination of crashed German aircraft showed that actually, four Knickebein and two Sonne units were available for guidance.I./KG 100 and 54 were {{in the vanguard of}} the assault; KG 2 presumably followed up the attack or to participate in one mass bombing run. KG 100 operated between 10 and 13 He 177s. The bombers were believed to have been carrying four SC1000 Hermanns, but apart from several SC500s loaded on to II./KG 54 Ju 88s the other bombers released AB1000 and or AB500 incendiary-laden <b>canisters</b> included phosphorus <b>types.</b> The attack was carried out between 13,000 and 16,000 ft. The German crews abandoned the target-marking methods of Leuchtpfad and Ablauflinie in favour of a simple pattern laid over the target zone. The colour of the flare denoted the area of the target zone. The abandonment of more precise target-identification suggested a German appreciation of the more practical tactic of area bombing. Another change in procedure was the incorrect positioning of any flare patterns. They were to be ignored and following crews were ordered to drop a greater concentration of flares over correctly aligned areas. With this principle applied in sequence, it was hoped crews would not be distracted by faulty target-marking.|$|R
