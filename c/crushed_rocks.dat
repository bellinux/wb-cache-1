40|$|Abstract. Model {{experiment}} box for <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> {{layer to}} eliminate the differential settlement was designed. Through the model experiment, the effect of eliminating differential settlement was validated and {{the truth of it}} was analyzed. Then the concept and the expressions of the secondary loose coefficient was established. Through measuring the secondary loose coefficient of different rock layers by designed measure box, the relationships of grain diameter of <b>crushed</b> <b>rock,</b> grain figure of gravel and the friction angle with the secondary loose coefficient were analyzed respectively. The research indicated that (1) the design of model experiment box and the experiment was successful; (2) <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> layer which can eliminate the differential settlement mostly depends on its capability of secondary loose; (3) the secondary loose coefficient increases with grain diameter of <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> and the friction angle, and the secondary loose coefficient of <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> is always higher than that of the pebble at the same grain diameter...|$|R

40|$|A {{device was}} {{constructed}} to study dynamic penetration in <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> both in air and a high-vacuum (10 ^(- 5) mm Hg) condition. The apparatus {{is designed to}} drop cylindrical, metal rods, pointed on one end, into cohesion-less <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> material. Dynamic penetration is studied {{as a function of}} several particle sizes and mixtures of these particle sizes. Other factors considered are the density of packing, probe dimensions, vacuum pressure, and vacuum degassing rates. Experimental results show that the density of packing of the <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> particles is the dominant factor affecting the dynan 1 ic penetration. The maximum penetration occurs in air in the <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> with low-density packing. The 1 ninimum penetration occurs in air in densely packed material. Dynamic penetration in vacuum for the low-density and high-density packing lies between the results of penetration in air for the same packing conditions. At vacuum pressures above approximately 0. 1 mm Hg, all penetration values approach the air penetration measurements...|$|R

40|$|Construction and {{demolition}} {{materials such as}} recycled <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> and recycled glass account for a major proportion of the waste materials present in landfills in Australia. Using recycled glass and <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> in road pavement applications would significantly {{reduce the need for}} quarry-based virgin materials. Furthermore, recycled materials could be used in parts of the country where aggregate sources are scarce. This paper discusses the suitability and applicability of recycled glass when used in blends with <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> for road pavement applications. Performance of the blends was measured using an extensive suite of geotechnical engineering laboratory tests including basic classification tests along with modified compaction, California Bearing Ratio and Los Angeles abrasion tests. Repeated load triaxial tests were also conducted on blends. The test results indicated that the recycled glass could be blended with recycled <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> by up to 30 % by mass and provide satisfactory engineering performance {{to be used as a}} pavement subbase material...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{municipal}} solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash in road construction may possess a risk to the environment due to the release of e. g. salt and heavy metals. In this study, two years of leachate data from a test road built of MSWI bottom ash and <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> in northern Sweden were evaluated. It was found that Cu, Cr, Al, Na, and Cl- were leached in higher amounts from the bottom ash, while the release of Zn, Mg, Ba, and Ca was higher from the <b>crushed</b> <b>rock.</b> The difference between ash and <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> leachates decreased over time, mainly due to changes in the ash leachate composition. The road pavement reduced the release rate of most pollutants from the bottom ash compared to the release from the uncovered parts of the road, whereas the release of pollutants from the <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> was less affected by the presence of a pavement.

50|$|A huge {{advantage}} of Otta seal over other seals {{is the ability}} to use almost any type or size of <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> as the aggregate. Depending on where in the world the road is being constructed and therefore what types of rock are available, the strength of an Otta seal can vary greatly. Commonly, the gravel used contains sandstone, basalt, and even coral or volcanic stones. Also, size of the particles varies greatly, with a preferred maximum of 16 mm and 19 mm (0.63 inch and 0.75 inch) for single and double Otta seals, respectively. Typically, the concentration of fine particles of less than 0.075 mm (0.003 inch) should be less than 10%.|$|E

50|$|The Kaiserstuhl {{is today}} largely {{covered by a}} Quaternary loess layer, a loosely {{cemented}} sediment. It is derived from other rocks through erosion and is then transported by the wind. The loess at the Kaiserstuhl - as in all the peripheral areas of the Upper Rhine Valley - was formed during the last Ice Age. Large parts were bare of vegetation and so loess was winnowed out from the Rhine sediments. It was then deposited in the periglacial area (i.e. ice-free, but surrounded by glaciers) at the Kaiserstuhl. The major process active here was frost weathering resulting in <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks.</b> The wind blew strongly, as there was no vegetation that could have moderated it - entraining the lightest material and depositing it at obstacles like the Kaiserstuhl. Deposition took place northeast of the Kaiserstuhl, as the winds blew from the southwest.|$|E
50|$|Sulfur {{concrete}} is {{a composite}} construction material, composed mainly of sulfur and aggregate (generally a coarse aggregate made of gravel or <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> and a fine aggregate such as sand).Cement and water, important compounds in normal concrete, {{are not part of}} sulfur concrete. The concrete is heated above the melting point of sulfur ca. 140 °C. After cooling the concrete reaches a high strength, not needing a prolonged curing like normal concrete. Sulfur concrete is resistant to some compounds like acids which attack normal concrete. Sulfur concrete was developed and promoted as building material to get rid of large amounts of stored sulfur produced by hydrodesulfurization of gas and oil. Sulfur concrete is also a possible building material for a lunar base. As of 2011, sulfur concrete has only been used in small quantities when fast curing or acid resistance is necessary.|$|E
