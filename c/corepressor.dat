40|$|The ETO protein was {{originally}} identified by its fusion to the AML- 1 transcription factor in translocation (8; 21) {{associated with the}} M 2 form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The resulting AML- 1 –ETO fusion is an aberrant transcriptional regulator due {{to the ability of}} ETO, which does not bind DNA itself, to recruit the transcriptional <b>corepressors</b> N-CoR, SMRT, and Sin 3 A and histone deacetylases. The promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional factor fused to retinoic acid receptor α in acute promyelocytic leukemia associated with the (11; 17) (q 23;q 21) translocation. PLZF also mediates transcriptional repression through the actions of <b>corepressors</b> and histone deacetylases. We found that ETO is one of the <b>corepressors</b> recruited by PLZF. The PLZF and ETO proteins associate in vivo and in vitro, and ETO can potentiate transcriptional repression by PLZF. The N-terminal portion of ETO forms complexes with PLZF, while the C-terminal region, which was shown to bind to N-CoR and SMRT, is required for the ability of ETO to augment transcriptional repression by PLZF. The second repression domain (RD 2) of PLZF, not the POZ/BTB domain, is necessary to bind to ETO. Corepression by ETO was completely abrogated by histone deacetylase inhibitors.

2500|$|The Wnt/β-catenin pathway {{starts with}} the binding of Wnt to a {{receptor}} complex encompassing a Fz receptor and LRP co-receptor. [...] After Wnt binds, an intracellular protein named Dishevelled (Dvl) is activated via phosphorylation. β-catenin degradation complexes in the cytoplasm are composed of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Axin. [...] APC promotes the degradation of β-catenin by increasing the affinity of the degradation complex to β-catenin. [...] Axin is a scaffolding protein which holds the degradation complex together. [...] The activated Dvl associates with Axin and prevents GSK3β and casein kinase 1α (CK1α) from phosphorylating critical substrates, such as β-catenin. [...] Phosphorylation of β-catenin marks the protein for ubiquitylation and rapid degradation by proteasomes. [...] Thus, the binding of Wnt to the receptor results in a non-phosphorylated form of β-catenin which localizes to the nucleus and, after displacing the Groucho <b>corepressor</b> protein, forms a complex with Tcf/Lef transcription factors and co-activators (such as CREB binding protein) and induces the expression of downstream target genes.|$|E

The effect of BRG- 1 transfection on ER-mediated transcription was examined. We also determined the effect of estrogen and the pure estrogen antagonist ICI 182, 780 on cell cycle profile and expression of ER.

40|$|Unliganded {{thyroid hormone}} receptors (apoTRs) repress {{transcription}} of hormone-activated genes by recruiting <b>corepressors</b> to the promoters. In contrast, on promoters containing so-called negative thyroid hormone response elements (nTREs), apoTRs activate transcription. A {{number of different}} molecular mechanisms {{have been described as}} to how apoTRs activate transcription varying with the target gene of the study. Here we demonstrate that thyroid hormone regulates the transcription of the Necdin gene, a developmentally regulated candidate gene for the genomic imprinting-associated neurobehavioural disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome. ApoTRs activate Necdin expression through an nTRE in its promoter, downstream of the transcription start site. The nTRE of the Necdin gene resembles the nTREs of the TSHbeta genes of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in the sequence, position in the promoter, and mode of activation. We show that this group of nTRE-driven genes shares the requirements for binding of the retinoic X receptor and nuclear receptor corepressor/silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (NCoR/SMRT) for full ligand-independent activation, whereas {{there is no need for}} association of the p 160 family of coactivators.

Using a novel {{adaptation of the}} yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified several point mutations in NAB <b>corepressors</b> that interfere with their ability to bind to the Egr 1 R 1 domain. Surprisingly, NAB proteins bearing some of these mutations increased Egr 1 activity dramatically. The mechanism underlying the unexpected behavior of these mutants was elucidated by the discovery that NAB conserved domain 1 (NCD 1) not only binds to Egr proteins but also mediates multimerization of NAB molecules. The activating mutants exert a dominant negative effect on NAB repression by multimerizing with native NAB proteins and preventing binding of endogenous NAB proteins with Egr transactivators. To examine NAB repression of a native Egr target gene, we show that NAB 2 represses Egr 2 /Krox 20 -mediated activation of the bFGF/FGF- 2 promoter, and that repression is reversed by coexpression of dominant negative NAB 2.

40|$|Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are {{effective}} therapies for type 2 diabetes, which has reached epidemic proportions in industrialized societies. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), an intensively studied nuclear receptor in diabetes {{for the last}} decade, is the master regulator of adipogenesis {{as well as the}} target of thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs. TZD treatment reduces circulating free fatty acids, which oppose insulin actions in skeletal muscle and other insulin target tissues. Here we report that TZDs dramatically induce adipocyte glycerol kinase (GyK) gene expression. This is surprising, as standard textbooks indicate that adipocytes lack GyK and thereby avoid futile cycles of triglyceride breakdown and re-synthesis from glycerol and free fatty acids. By inducing GyK, TZDs markedly stimulate glycerol incorporation into TG and reduce free fatty acid (FFA) secretion from adipocytes. The futile fuel cycle resulting from expression of GyK in adipocytes is thus a novel mechanism contributing to reduced free fatty acid levels and perhaps insulin sensitization by antidiabetic agents. ^ In adipocytes, many PPARγ target genes such as aP 2 are induced robustly during adipogenesis, others, such as GyK, are expressed at low levels in adipocytes but are dramatically upregulated by TZDs. We have explored the mechanism whereby an exogenous PPARγ ligand is selectively required for adipocyte gene expression. The GyK gene contains a functional PPARγ-response element to which endogenous PPARγ is recruited in adipocytes. However, unlike the classic PPARγ-target gene aP 2, which is constitutively associated with coactivators, the GyK gene is targeted by <b>corepressors</b> in adipocytes. TZDs trigger the dismissal of <b>corepressors</b> and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex and the recruitment of coactivators to the GyK gene. TZDs also induce PPARγ-Coactivator 1 α (PGC- 1 α), whose recruitment to the GyK gene is sufficient to release the <b>corepressors.</b> Thus, selective modulation of adipocyte PPARγ target genes by TZDs involves the dissociation of <b>corepressors</b> by direct and indirect mechanisms. ...|$|R
