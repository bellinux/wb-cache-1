25|$|Because {{variables}} conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements {{cannot be}} reasonably measured numerically, {{sometimes they are}} grouped together as <b>categorical</b> <b>variables,</b> whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables, which can be either discrete or continuous, due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science, in that dichotomous <b>categorical</b> <b>variables</b> may be represented with the Boolean data type, polytomous <b>categorical</b> <b>variables</b> with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type, and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating point computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.|$|E
25|$|Histograms are {{sometimes}} confused with bar charts.

25|$|By equivocating certain columns with {{parameters}} to be estimated, Plackett–Burmans {{can also}} be used to construct mixed categorical and numerical designs, with interactions or high order effects, requiring no more than 4 runs more than the number of model parameters to be estimated. Sort by a-1 columns assigned to categorical variable A and following columns, where A=1+int(a'i /(max(i)+0.00001)), i = row number and a = A's number of values. Next sort on columns assigned to any other <b>categorical</b> <b>variables</b> and following columns, repeating as needed. Such designs, if large, may otherwise be incomputable by standard search techniques like D-optimality. For example, 13 variables averaging 3 values each could have well over a million combinations to search. To estimate the 105 parameters in a quadratic model of 13 variables, one must formally exclude from consideration or compute |X'X| for well over 106C102, i.e. 313C105, or roughly 10484 matrices.|$|E

5000|$|In {{hierarchical}} Bayesian {{models with}} <b>categorical</b> <b>variables,</b> such as latent Dirichlet allocation {{and various other}} models used in natural language processing, it is quite common to collapse out the Dirichlet distributions that are typically used as prior distributions over the <b>categorical</b> <b>variables.</b> The result of this collapsing introduces dependencies among all the <b>categorical</b> <b>variables</b> dependent on a given Dirichlet prior, and the joint distribution of these variables after collapsing is a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. The conditional distribution of a given categorical variable in this distribution, conditioned on the others, assumes an extremely simple form that makes Gibbs sampling even easier than if the collapsing had not been done. The rules are as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} where the group {{membership}} of the nodes dependent on a given Dirichlet prior may change dynamically depending on some other <b>variable</b> (e.g. a <b>categorical</b> <b>variable</b> indexed by another latent <b>categorical</b> <b>variable,</b> as in a topic model), the same expected counts are still computed, but {{need to be done}} carefully so that the correct set of variables is included. See the article on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution for more discussion, including {{in the context of a}} topic model.|$|R
30|$|All these {{previous}} studies presented {{time as a}} <b>categorical</b> <b>variable</b> divided into multiples of 5 or 6  h. However, only a few fractures were treated after 12  h: for instance, just eight (7  %) {{in the study by}} Spencer et al. [9]. In our study, time was also used as a <b>categorical</b> <b>variable.</b> Thus, we used intervals of 12  h, similar to the model adopted by Patzakis and Wilkins [17]. This division was used because only nine fractures (7.3  %) were treated in less than 6  h after the time of exposure; the majority were treated after 12  h. Therefore, we believe that time from injury to admission (or debridement) as a <b>categorical</b> <b>variable</b> is a significant predictor when the delay is more than 12  h, and that may conform with and elucidate some of the previous findings in the orthopedic literature.|$|R

(However, Gibbs sampling would equally be possible if only some or none of the words were observed.

40|$|Main models used in {{logistic}} regression. Regression is {{a commonly}} used technique for decribing {{the relationship between}} a response variable and one or more explanatory variables. When the response <b>variable</b> is a <b>categorical</b> <b>variable,</b> usual regression based on ordinary least squares should be replaced by logistic regression. Binary logistic regression should be used to perform a regression on a dichotomous response. Nominal polytomous logistic regression applies to a <b>categorical</b> response <b>variable</b> that has more than two levels with no natural ordering. And ordinal polytomous logistic regression is used when the response is a <b>categorical</b> <b>variable</b> that has more than two levels with a natural ordering. This note gives an overview of these logistic regression methods and describes three models commonly used when performing ordinal logistic regression. These models are illustrated by an example related to oak decline in the Walloon Region (Belgium) ...|$|R
