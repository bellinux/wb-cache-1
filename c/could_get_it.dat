5|$|The British mission {{consisting}} of Akers and fifteen British experts arrived in December 1943. This {{was a critical}} time. Severe problems had been encountered with the Norris-Adler barrier. Nickel powder and electro-deposited nickel mesh diffusion barriers were pioneered by American chemist Edward Adler and British interior decorator Edward Norris at the SAM Laboratories. A decision {{had to be made}} whether to persevere with it or switch to a powdered nickel barrier based upon British technology that had been developed by Kellex. Up to this point, both were under development. The SAM Laboratory had 700 people working on gaseous diffusion and Kellex had about 900. The British experts conducted a thorough review, and agreed that the Kellex barrier was superior, but felt that it would be unlikely to be ready in time. Kellex's technical director, Percival C. Keith, disagreed, arguing that his company <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> ready and produce it more quickly than the Norris-Adler barrier. Groves listened to the British experts before he formally adopted the Kellex barrier on 5 January 1944.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a problem}} facing the crew in the newsroom, however. There was no {{television}} camera in the studio {{at the time as}} the technical crew was working on it. Eventually the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom. Because of the magnitude of the story and the continuous flow of information coming from various sources, time was of the essence and the camera would take at least twenty minutes to become operational under normal circumstances. The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked on the camera to see if they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> set up quicker.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} secure storage {{stretches}} {{far back in}} time. The earliest known locks {{were made by the}} Egyptians. Ancient Romans used a more sophisticated locking system, called warded locks. Warded locks had special notches and grooves that made picking them more difficult. Lock technology advanced independently in ancient India, Russia, and China, where the combination lock is thought to have originated. In the United States, most banks relied on small iron safes fitted with a key lock up until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century. After the Gold Rush of 1849, unsuccessful prospectors turned to robbing banks. The prospectors would often break into the bank using a pickax and hammer. The safe was usually small enough that the thief <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out a window, and take it to a secluded spot to break it open.|$|E

25|$|This {{building}} was a 1918 motor car garage. At one end it contains restored horse-drawn vehicles. There is {{a reproduction of}} an 1890 garden seat omnibus, with wooden, slatted seats on top, like garden seats. These vehicles have not {{been used in the}} UK since 1931. This reproduction has hydraulic disc brakes for safety. There is a brougham, a 19th-century gentleman's light one-horse carriage. This design {{is said to have been}} named after Lord Chancellor Brougham in the early 19th century. There is also a steamer, or Shand Mason steam fire pump of ca.1880. A team of horses pulled it, and steam powered it, at 250 gallons per minute. Firemen <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> ready in 7 minutes. It was successful enough for the manufacturers to export it worldwide - for example to the Warsaw Fire Guard - but it was expensive in coal and horses, and was superseded by motor pumps in ca.1900.|$|E
500|$|On {{her first}} day on set, Smart was shocked to learn the {{producers}} wanted to cut the scene, a decision she felt was a mistake. She said [...] "They had done this brilliant thing {{and now they were}} going to undo it. They were just being practical. They said, [...] "It would be hours to get you back, your hair, your make-up." [...] Smart spoke to the hair and makeup artists and guaranteed producers they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right in two takes; they did it in one, and the scene stayed in.|$|E
500|$|According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Rodgers, Hammerstein and Fields {{had hoped}} to engage Yul Brynner as director. [...] Brynner, who had gained fame in the team's 1951 hit, The King and I, was an {{accomplished}} director. [...] However, he was busy starring in The Sound and the Fury, and they could not negotiate his release from Twentieth-Century Fox. [...] Instead, they hired actor and dancer Gene Kelly, who had never directed on stage before. [...] Kelly felt that the work would not be one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best, but [...] "as long as I crammed the show brim-full of every joke and gimmick in the book, I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> to work".|$|E

500|$|In 1923, Bagramyan was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Alexandropol Cavalry Regiment, a position he held until 1931. Two years later, Bagramyan graduated from the Leningrad Cavalry School and, in 1934, from the Frunze Military Academy. In his memoirs, Pyotr Grigorenko, a Ukrainian commander who attended Frunze, recalled how Bagramyan was expelled from the academy by his superiors after they had learned {{that he had been}} a secret member of the banned Dashnak Armenian nationalist party for more than a decade. Pending his arrest, Grigorenko described Bagramyan [...] "deeply depressed, saying he only wished they'd arrest him soon so that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> over with." [...] Grigorenko advised that he appeal the arrest warrant which Bagramyan reluctantly did and, with the help of Armenian politburo member Anastas Mikoyan, the arrest warrant was revoked and he accepted to be [...] "rehabilitated." [...] From 1934 to 1936, he served as the {{chief of staff of the}} 5th Cavalry Division, and from 1938, he worked as a senior instructor and lecturer at the Military Academy of the Soviet General Staff. Concurrently, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had purged much of the Soviet officer corps of its veteran commanders. While fellow students from the military academy, Andrei Yeremenko and Georgy Zhukov, had seen their careers rise, Bagramyan's had remained stagnant.|$|E

[...] But Hawke never <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> back because professionalism had evolved as society had changed and {{the likes of}} Sutcliffe and Hammond were establishing a respectability for their job, as noted by Stuart Surridge, that enabled them {{and some of their}} successors to join the establishment.|$|E

[...] He took up arms, therefore, against his native country, and this warranted a charge of treason in 1729. [...] In the siege at Gibraltar in 1727, Wharton sought {{to prove that he}} was not a coward, and so he charged at the head of his men and was wounded in the foot.|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister John Key characterised Dirty Politics as a [...] "cynically timed attack" [...] from [...] "a {{well known}} left wing {{conspiracy}} theorist".

Rather than being timed for maximum political damage, Hager says [...] "it was actually just the practicalities of how fast I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{has used}} Fender Stratocaster guitars almost exclusively. His black 1957/63 (the body {{is from a}} '63; the neck from a '57) Stratocaster, {{previously}} owned by late Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, was used circa 1978–1990. It {{was used as a}} template by Fender to manufacture an Artist Signature model in 2009. The original now resides at his mother's home. [...] "I bought it in 1976," [...] he said. [...] "I saw it advertised in Melody Maker… I got the serial number to check it was [...] guitar. It cost quite a bit of money but I didn't care. I just sold everything I had so I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> and I used it from then on. It just felt like I was holding a piece of magic because he had used this guitar." ...|$|E
2500|$|The shot clock {{received}} near-universal {{praise for}} {{its role in}} improving the style of play in the NBA. Coach and referee Charley Eckman said, [...] "Danny Biasone saved the NBA with the 24-second rule." [...] Boston Celtic all-star Bob Cousy said, [...] "Before the new rule, the last quarter could be deadly. The team in front would hold the ball indefinitely, {{and the only way}} you <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> was by fouling somebody. In the meantime, nobody dared take a shot and the whole game slowed up. With the clock, we have constant action. I think it saved the NBA at that time. It allowed the game to breathe and progress." [...] League president Maurice Podoloff called the adoption of the shot clock [...] "the most important event in the NBA." [...] The league itself states, [...] "Biasone's invention rescue the league." ...|$|E
2500|$|Redford {{supports}} environmentalism, Native American rights, LGBT rights, and the arts. [...] He {{has also}} supported advocacy groups, {{such as the}} Political Action Committee of the Directors Guild of America. Redford has on occasion also supported Republicans, including Brent Cornell Morris in his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination for Utah's 3rd congressional district in 1990. Redford also supported Gary Herbert, another Republican and a friend, in Herbert's successful 2004 campaign to be elected Utah's Lieutenant Governor. Herbert later became Governor of Utah. Redford is an avid environmentalist and is a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He endorsed Democratic President Barack Obama for re-election in 2012. Redford is the first quote on the back cover of Donald Trump's book Crippled America saying of Trump “I'm glad he's in there, being the way he is." [...] But Redford's comment {{was intended to be}} sarcastic, {{as the rest of the}} comment follows, [...] "He's got such a big foot in his mouth I'm not sure you <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{organization}} of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence occurred {{at the same time}} HIV/AIDS began appearing in the Castro District and New York City. Ironically, safe havens during this crisis {{came in the form of}} bars such Maud's and Amelia's, which were shut down. Some theories of why they were shut down included a feeling of separation between male gays bars and lesbian bars, so mostly lesbian bars were being shut down. The AIDS crisis sprouted a clean and sober mentality which drove the number of bars down since people believed that bars were places were everyone had AIDS or <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> very easily. Some of the earliest attempts to bring attention to the new disease were staged by the Sisters, both in and out of costume. In 1982, Sister Florence Nightmare, RN (early AIDS activist and registered nurse Bobbi Campbell) and Sister Roz Erection (Baruch Golden a registered nurse) joined with a team of Sisters and medical professionals to create [...] "Play Fair!", the first safer sex pamphlet to use plain language, practical advice and humor, and considered by one of the founders to be [...] "one of the Order's greatest achievement in community education and support". [...] In 1999, for the Sisters' 20th anniversary the pamphlet was revised. The Sisters worldwide continue to raise awareness of sexual health; many Orders regularly pass out condoms and participate in events to educate people on sexual health issues.|$|E
