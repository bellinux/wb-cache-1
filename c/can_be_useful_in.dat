5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects. Baclofen or tizanidine are sometimes used {{as an alternative to}} benzodiazepines. Tizanidine has been found to have superior tolerability compared to diazepam and baclofen.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and {{the ease with which}} large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E

5|$|The nymphs are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} predators and form an {{important}} part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous stonefly, caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> the biomonitoring of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects.|$|E
5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> {{the diagnosis}} of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed {{at the time of}} ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in {{the diagnosis of}} biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E
5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E
