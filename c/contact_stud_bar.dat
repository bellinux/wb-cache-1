50|$|The first leather bar on Folsom Street was Febe's, on the {{southwest}} corner of 11th and Folsom, which opened July 25, 1966. The <b>Stud</b> <b>bar,</b> which opened in 1966 at 1535 Folsom St., was originally a Hell's Angels hangout; by 1969 it had become a dance bar for hippies on the margins of the leather scene and had a psychedelic black light mural by Chuck Arnett (in 1987, it moved to 399 9th St. at Harrison). In 1967 A Taste of Leather, one of the first in-bar leather stores, was established at Febe's by Nick O'Demus. As of late 2009, A Taste of Leather announced it would be going out of business after 43 years.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{railways}} with third rails, {{or fourth}} rails, in tunnels carry collector shoes projecting laterally (sideways), or vertically, from their bogies. The contact shoe may slide {{on top of}} the third rail (top running), on the bottom (bottom running) or on the side (side running). The side running contact shoe is used against the guide bars on rubber-tired metros. A vertical contact shoe is used on ground-level power supply systems, <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> systems and fourth rail systems. A pair of contact shoes was used on underground current collection systems. The contact shoe on a <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> system is called a ski collector. The ski collector moves vertically to accommodate slight variations in the height of the <b>studs.</b> <b>Contact</b> shoes may also be used on overhead conductor rails, on guide bars or on trolley wires. Most railways use three rails, while the London Underground uses four rails.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> is {{a system}} of {{electrification}} for model railways. It was popular before {{the widespread use of}} plastics since it permits the use of metal sleepers (ties) or track bases, and does not require an insulated section in each wheelset.|$|R
50|$|Wolverhampton District Company {{cars were}} {{modified}} with Lorain <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system equipment and on 15 October 1906 began working between Dudley and Wolverhampton. This was discontinued in 1909 and only restarted in 1921 when the Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways were all converted to overhead power.|$|R
5000|$|A {{modernisation}} scheme followed immediately re-gauging to 3'6" [...] and electrification. The tramway {{was unique}} {{in using the}} Lorain <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system, and because of this, connections to other networks in the area could not be made until 1921, when the council decided to convert to overhead wiring.|$|R
50|$|On 9 November 1905, {{the section}} between Stow Heath Lane and Bilston {{was taken over}} by Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways, and the Deans Road to Willenhall section on 18 April 1906. Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways cars were {{modified}} with overhead equipment to operate through journeys. Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways used the Lorain <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system on the remainder of their routes.|$|R
50|$|The trams ran {{as far as}} Bexhill, {{and were}} worked by {{overhead}} electric wires, except for the stretch along the seafront from Bo-Peep to the Memorial, which was initially worked by the Dolter <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system. The Dolter system was replaced by petrol electric trams in 1914, but overhead electrification was extended to this section in 1921.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> {{system is}} also used on model railway systems (e.g. Märklin) as the center line of studs is less {{obtrusive}} than a single central rail. For outdoor model railway systems {{the use of a}} stud supply system with a skate/ski collector has certain practical advantages. The system is inherently self-cleaning. While the track may not be perfect, with both rails acting as the return part of the system in parallel electrical pick up problems are substantially reduced.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> {{system is}} a once-obsolete {{ground-level}} power supply system for electric trams. Power supply studs were set in the road at intervals and connected to a buried electric cable by switches operated by magnets on the tramcars. Current was collected from the studs by a [...] "skate" [...] or [...] "ski collector" [...] under the tramcar. The system was popular {{for a while in}} the early 1900s but soon fell out of favour because of the unreliability of the magnetic switches.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cities}} where {{overhead}} electric cables were deemed intrusive, underground conduits with electrical conductors were used. Examples of this were New York, Washington DC, Paris, London, Brussels and Budapest. The conduit system of electrical power was very expensive {{to install and}} maintain, although Washington did not close until 1962. Attempts were made with alternative systems not needing overhead wires. There were many systems of “surface” <b>contact,</b> where <b>studs</b> were set in the road surface, and energised by a passing tram, either mechanically or magnetically, to supply power through a skate carried under the tram. Unfortunately these systems all failed due {{to the problem of}} reliability and not always turning off after the tram had passed, resulting in the occasional electrocution of horses and dogs. In the last five years a new system of surface contact has been installed in the Bordeaux tramway by Alstom.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the analysis and}} design of narrow cast in situ joints between precast concrete elements, in which continuity of reinforcement is achieved through overlapping headed bars. Using headed bars minimises the lap length required within the cast in situ joint region. The paper describes a non-linear finite-element model (NLFEM), which was used to simulate a series of tension splice tests {{carried out by the}} authors to simulate the tensile zone of a joint loaded in pure flexure. The tests studied the influences of concrete strength, transverse reinforcement, confining shear <b>studs,</b> headed <b>bar</b> spacing and lap length on joint strength. Results show that the NLFEM captures the behaviour of the joint well. Parametric studies are carried out with the validated numerical model to investigate the effects of variables not considered in the tests, such as shear stud size, cover and out-of-plane offset of the headed bars. The NLFEM provides otherwise unavailable insights into joint behaviour and is considered suitable for the design of standard joint configurations. Additionally, it can assist the development of design-oriented analysis methods...|$|R
25|$|Hastings had {{a network}} of trams from 1905 to 1929. The trams ran as far as Bexhill, and were worked by {{overhead}} electric wires, except for the stretch along the seafront from Bo-Peep to the Memorial, which was initially worked by the Dolter <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> system. The Dolter system was replaced by petrol electric trams in 1914, but overhead electrification was extended to this section in 1921. Trolleybuses rather than trams {{were used in the}} section that included the very narrow High Street, and the entire tram network was replaced by the Hastings trolleybus system in 1928–1929.|$|R
5000|$|Märklin uses a [...] "phantom" [...] third rail, {{where the}} middle rail is {{concealed}} in the track ballast or ties, with only studs protruding, giving {{the advantages of}} three-rail operation without seriously detracting from its realism. This is <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> electrification for model railways and is often used on garden railway systems. Garden railways often have a mixture of electrical and real steam locomotives. while it is possible, insulating model steam locomotives to run on two rail electrification systems is problematic. In practice the stud system outdoors {{has been found to}} be more resistant to continuity problems caused by the outdoor environment.|$|R
50|$|Spinner - Spinners are {{generally}} larger and heavier than saw blades, and spin {{at a lower}} RPM. Rather than cutting through the opponent, spinners use a heavy <b>bar,</b> <b>studded</b> disc, or toothed cylinder (drum/eggbeater) to strike the opponent with the kinetic energy stored in the rotating mass. The mass may spin on either a horizontal or vertical axis, although vertical spinners may have maneuverability problems due to the gyroscopic action of the weapon. The destructive potential of a well-designed spinning weapon requires robust arena containment to prevent shrapnel being thrown into the audience. Three-time BattleBots middleweight champion Hazard was a horizontal bar spinner, while Robot Wars Series 3 runner-up Hypno-Disc was a flywheel spinner.|$|R
2500|$|A {{horse was}} killed after it {{stepped on a}} live stud during {{construction}} of the tramway in Torquay.

There were also frequent problems with trams being stopped when a stud failed to be made live when needed.

5000|$|Märklin three-rail trains use a short spike of DC voltage {{to reverse}} a relay within the {{locomotive}} {{while it is}} stopped. Märklin's track {{does not have an}} actual third rail; instead, a series of short pins provide the current, taken up by a long [...] "shoe" [...] under the engine. This shoe is long enough to always be in contact with several pins. This is known as the <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> system and has certain advantages when used on outdoor model railway systems. The ski collector rubs over the studs and thus inherently self cleans. When both track rails are used for the return in parallel there is much less chance of current interruption due to dirt on the line.|$|R
40|$|Environmental, political, {{and other}} {{considerations}} are {{leading to the}} installation of growing numbers of wind turbines for electricity generation. The present paper concentrates on onshore installations, in which the turbine is placed {{at the end of}} a tower founded on the ground. A serious problem with the foundation or its connection with the tower entails a global failure. A worrying percentage of the towers built before 2010 is ill designed, often with obvious manifestations of the design problem. On the other hand the new designs attempt to optimise material quantities and costs while providing an adequate behaviour under the demands imposed. Principia has gathered considerable experience in both the identification and remediation of the problems experienced by older foundations and the optimisation of new designs. The problem is particularly suitable for numerical simulations with Abaqus and the paper provides the necessary concepts and methodological approach for a reliable and satisfactory solution. More specifically, the concrete geometry is meshed with solid elements. Surface elements including rebar layers are embedded. Other parts of the structure as the steel cylinder, welded <b>studs,</b> anchorage <b>bars,</b> etc. are also included. The concrete behaviour is described with the Abaqus concrete damaged plasticity model. Abaqus/Explicit is used because of the strong non-linearities, mainly caused by concrete cracking and crushing. The methodology allows assessing the suitability of the design for ultimate, serviceability and fatigue limit states...|$|R
50|$|The tramway {{was one of}} {{very few}} in England {{operated}} with a Griffiths-Bedell <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system in the roadway. This initial method of power provision survived until 1919 when this was replaced with overhead wires. The reason for the replacement was that gas leaked from the mains which {{found its way into}} the electric power cable conduit. This appeared in a startling and dangerous manner, as the gas ignitied by the arcing of the magnetic switches, with the result that the cast iron covers for the inspection boxes were blown off, and on more than one occasion, hurled into the air. To minimise the risk of explosion, and electric blower was installed at the Depot, and was started up every morning before the first car left the Depot, and this blew a current of air through the conduit, clearing it of any gas.|$|R
60|$|He gives a vivid {{description}} of the scene that evening. In the centre was a garden raised on arches lit by festoons of lights and connected with the Rows by eight graceful bridges, beneath which hummed the interlacing streams of motor traffic, pulsating as the current alternated {{between east and west}} and north and south. Above rose great frontages of intricate rather than beautiful reinforced porcelain, <b>studded</b> with lights, <b>barred</b> by bold illuminated advertisements, and glowing with reflections. There were the two historical music halls of this place, the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, in which the municipal players revolved perpetually through the cycle of Shakespeare's plays, and four other great houses of refreshment and entertainment whose pinnacles streamed up into the blue obscurity of the night. The south side of the square was in dark contrast to the others; it was still being rebuilt, and a lattice of steel bars surmounted by the frozen gestures of monstrous cranes rose over the excavated sites of vanished Victorian buildings.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> {{system or}} surface contact system was used with some tramway systems. It is used {{especially}} where an overhead {{system would be}} obtrusive. As the studs would be on open roads rather than special track, methods have to be adopted {{to ensure that they}} are only live when under a vehicle. Early systems used mechanical switches. Most use magnetic activation from a magnet on the vehicle, but a few used a purely mechanical system. Systems in use {{in the early part of}} the 20th century included the Lorain, Dolter, and GB surface-contact systems, which were all magnetically operated, and the Robrow surface-contact system, which was mechanical. In practice the technology of the time could be erratic. This meant studs that that did not make contact when activated, and studs that remain live after the vehicle had passed over. Consequently the systems tended to be replaced with either overhead systems, or continuous contact sub surface systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} built by the National Electric Construction Company (NEC), which owned other systems in England, using the Dolter system of <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> power supply (the reason given for this being the unsightliness of {{conventional}} overhead wiring) and public services began on Wednesday 6 February 1907 with a route linking College Square, Rotherham and Parkgate, this being extended to the company’s Dale Road depot in Rawmarsh three days later. The remainder of the line opened on 3 August. In the Dolter system the current was supplied from metal studs placed between the rails that became live and rose from the road to energize the motors of the tram passing over, being then supposed to become dead. This proved unsatisfactory since on occasions the studs remained upright and live so that horses following the tram hauling drays could receive an electric shock. In August 1908, following instructions from the Board of Trade, the company converted their system to overhead pick-up.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the design and}} behaviour of narrow cast in-situ joints between precast concrete elements in which continuity of reinforcement is achieved through overlapping headed bars. The use of headed bars minimises the required reinforcement lap length and hence joint width, thereby, maximising the area of precast concrete units. Confining reinforcement {{in the form of}} transverse bars and vertical shear studs is installed within the joint. Improved understanding of the behaviour of such joints is obtained by means of experimental testing and numerical analysis. In total, 32 tensile specimens and five flexural specimens were tested. The main longitudinal reinforcement in all specimens consisted of 25 mm diameter headed bars with 70 mm square heads. The tests investigated the influence on joint performance of concrete strength, confining shear <b>studs,</b> transverse <b>bar</b> arrangement, headed bar lap length and spacing, and out-of-plane offset of precast planks. For tensile specimens, a lap length of 100 mm with four 16 mm transverse bars and concrete compressive strength of 28 MPa was sufficient for headed bar yield. Ductile flexural failure, with headed bar yield, was achieved with the same lap length, two 20 mm transverse bars and concrete compressive strength of 39 MPa. A nonlinear finite element model (NLFEM) is presented with results showing that it captures the behaviour of the joint well. Additional parametric studies carried out with the validated NLFEM provide otherwise unavailable insights into joint behaviour. In conjunction with an appropriate safety format, the model is considered suitable for the design of standard joint configurations. Analytical models based on the strut-and-tie method and upper bound plasticity are presented. The models were found to give reasonable predictions of joint strength, but are not capable of fully capturing the observed joint behaviour. An improved strut and tie design method is suggested and recommendations are made for optimising joint design. Open Acces...|$|R
50|$|The {{town council}} of Torquay {{did not want}} their seaside resort {{disfigured}} by the poles and overhead wires of a conventional electric tramway and so invited the Dolter Electric Traction Company to construct a tramway using their stud-contact system. A horse was killed after it stepped on a live stud during construction of the Torquay Tramways. Each tram car was then fitted with a bell connected to a special contact arm to warn the driver if a stud remained live after it had passed. The conductor of the tram then had to reset the crank using an insulated mallet. During the Board of Trade inspection of the tramway four such studs were detected during about 8 mi of tests. There were also frequent problems with trams being stopped when a stud failed to be made live when needed. The network covered 6.79 mi and opened in stages during 1907 and 1908. On 27 January 1910 a snow storm stopped all the trams as they couldn't make <b>contact</b> with the <b>studs.</b> It was converted to overhead collection in 1911 shortly before it was extended to Paignton where the town council had refused to allow the Dolter system to be used.|$|R

40|$|Laing O’Rourke (LOR) have {{developed}} and patented a novel form of connection between precast concrete panels utilising lapped headed bars, {{known as the}} “E 6 joint”. Headed reinforcement bars protrude from adjacent faces of precast lightweight concrete panels, such that a reduced lap length {{can be used in}} the cast-in-situ joint region, thereby decreasing the joint width, when compared to straight bar lap splices. Confining reinforcement in the form of vertical shear <b>studs</b> and transverse <b>bars</b> is also installed in the joint. The aim of this research, funded by LOR, is to study the mechanical behaviour of this novel form of connection, at the serviceability and ultimate limit states, by means of numerical analysis, experimental testing and reliability analysis. The experimental results are used to validate a three dimensional non-linear finite element (NLFEA) model of the joint. A strut-and-tie model (STM) developed by LOR and reviewed by Arup, is used to determine the E 6 design joint strength. Analysis shows that the STM gives conservative results compared with numerical and experimental results whilst not fully capturing the observed joint behaviour. More refined alternative design approaches will be considered to overcome these shortcomings. Improved understanding of joint behaviour will enable the joint design to be optimised and facilitate the development of an improved simplified design method. Furthermore, a more widespread use of this system would lead to improvements in buildability, sustainability and health and safety in construction of concrete structures...|$|R
