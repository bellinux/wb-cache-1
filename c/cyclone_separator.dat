50|$|Multiple-cyclone {{separators}} remove more dust than single cyclone separators {{because the}} individual cyclones {{have a greater}} length and smaller diameter. The longer length provides longer residence time while the smaller diameter creates greater centrifugal force. These two factors result in better separation of dust particulates. The pressure drop of multiple-cyclone separators collectors is {{higher than that of}} single-cyclone separators, requiring more energy to clean the same amount of air. A single-chamber <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> of the same volume is more economical, but doesn't remove as much dust.|$|E
50|$|Circulating {{fluidised}} beds (CFB), where gases are at {{a higher}} velocity sufficient to suspend the particle bed, due to a larger kinetic energy of the fluid. As such {{the surface of the}} bed is less smooth and larger particles can be entrained from the bed than for stationary beds. Entrained particles are recirculated via an external loop back into the reactor bed. Depending on the process, the particles may be classified by a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> and separated from or returned to the bed, based upon particle cut size.|$|E

50|$|Systems {{for fine}} removal may only contain a single {{filtration}} system (such as a filter bag or cartridge). However, most units utilize a {{primary and secondary}} separation/filtration system. In many cases the heat or moisture content of dust can negatively affect the filter media of a baghouse or cartridge dust collector. A <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> or dryer may be placed before these units to reduce heat or moisture content before reaching the filters.

50|$|Off-gas is {{the gaseous}} product exiting a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> that is {{connected}} to a fluidized bed. If the gas is clean and contaminate free it can be cooled via a condenser and then filtered to remove fine particles. Once filtered it may be directed back into the system or tapered off.

The off gas produced from the operation may have a considerable amount of such gases and therefore need to be neutralised. Allowing the gases to escape into the environment may cause green house gases and are toxic to local flora and fauna. Cleaning off-gas increases sustainability and negates adverse effects to the environment.|$|E
50|$|Q-11 was {{received}} in 55-gallon drums. The drums were deheaded before processing and were conveyed through a thawing tunnel, which also provided surge capacity of deheaded drums. The drums were lifted {{to the top}} of the building by a skip hoist where they were emptied into a surge hopper that feeds the magnetic separator and jaw crusher. From the jaw crusher, the one-half inch material passes through a rotary drum dryer to a system of conveyors, which conveys the material to a surge hopper that feeds the ring roll mill. The particle size output from the mill was controlled to about 100 mesh by an air classifier mounted directly on the mill. The undersized material was blown to a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> that was mounted directly above the first Gallagher sampler. The three Gallagher samplers in series each took a 10% cut of the stream fed to it, producing a sample approximately 0.1% of the original lot size. The main stream was conveyed to a drumming station where it was packaged in 55-gallon or 30-gallon drums for use in the Refinery. The official weight was taken at this point.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach – A general review of the types of particle cleaning cyclones used in the chemical and process industries was carried out and the principles guiding their operation and performance discussed. Information which could aid the choice of cyclone for new applications is also discussed. Findings – It was concluded that the choice of cyclone for any application is associated with a trade-off between two contrasting performance indicators (collection efficiency and pressure drop). Adequate and accurate data gathering is essential right from the design stage for smooth operation of cyclone.

5000|$|MLIS {{operates}} in cascade setup, like the gaseous diffusion process. Instead of vaporized uranium as in AVLIS the working medium of the MLIS is uranium hexafluoride {{which requires a}} much lower temperature to vaporize. The UF6 gas is mixed with a suitable carrier gas (a noble gas including some hydrogen) which allows the molecules {{to remain in the}} gaseous phase after being cooled by expansion through a supersonic de Laval nozzle. A scavenger gas (e.g. methane) is also included in the mixture to bind with the fluorine atoms after they are dissociated from the UF6 and inhibit their recombination with the enriched UF5 product. In the first stage the expanded and cooled stream of UF6 is irradiated with an infrared laser operating at the wavelength of 16 µm. The mix is then irradiated with another laser, either infrared or ultraviolet, whose photons are selectively absorbed by the excited 235UF6, causing its photolysis to 235UF5 and fluorine. The resultant enriched UF5 forms a solid which is then separated from the gas by filtration or a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator.</b> The precipitated UF5 is relatively enriched with 235UF5 and after conversion back to UF6 it is fed to the next stage of the cascade to be further enriched. The laser for the excitation is usually a carbon dioxide laser with output wavelength shifted from 10.6 µm to 16 µm; the photolysis laser may be a [...] excimer laser operating at 308 nm, however infrared lasers are mostly used in existing implementations.|$|E
50|$|The bottom {{section of}} the riser is narrowed to avoid solids from accumulating in the bottom section. Instead of the riser walls being smooth it is {{generally}} composed of membrane waterwall surfaces, this added feature influences the solid flow patterns in the vicinity, hence influences mixing and gas-solid mixing.The riser exits are divided into two types; “once through exits” which involves the exits being smoothly curve or tapered. This exit allows a large net circulation and is optimal for short uniform residence {{time as well as}} quickly decaying catalysts. The other exit is “internal reflux exits” which is an abrupt exit causing a substantial amount of entrained solids being internally separated from the gas reaching the top of the reactor.The cyclone {{is an integral part of}} an annular fluidized bed, particular sized particles are separated by varying the velocity of feed gas. Consequently, at high velocity gas provides enough kinetic energy to separate particles from the fluidized bed. The feed gas and small particles fly into a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> and there the feed- gas and particles are separated. In turn, particles can be returned or removed to the bed depending on the size of the particle. The entrained solids are captured and sent back to the base of the riser through a vertical standpipe.The large central nozzle is the main component of the Annular Fluidized bed and this differentiate itself from other fluidized beds. The central nozzle is surrounded by a stationary fluidized bed and “due to moderate primary gas fluidisation of the annulus, the solids overflow at the upper edge of the central nozzle” which is then transported and mixed in the mixing chamber by a high upward velocity central secondary gas stream.|$|E
