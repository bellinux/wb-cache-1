Carrageenan treatment promoted infiltration of inflammatory cells and caused swelling in the hind paw. Oral administrations of EER (0. 3 [*]g/kg and 1 [*]g/kg) attenuated acute inflammation similar to the result using dexamethasone (1 [*]mg/kg). Treatment of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) simulated inflammatory condition: LPS significantly increased the productions of NO, PGE 2, and proinflammatory cytokines. EER suppressed activation of macrophages, preventing the induction of iNOS and COX- 2 protein expressions. LPS treatment induced phosphorylation of I-κBα and increased the level of nuclear NF-κB protein, {{both of which were}} suppressed by concomitant treatment of EER.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the leaf epidermis of twelve species in the <b>Compositae</b> (<b>Asteraceae)</b> family was undertaken in order to document characters {{that are important in}} the taxonomy of the family. It was observed that trichomes can be successfully used for the delimitation of genera within the family. Within each species however, there are varied assortment of trichomes with occasional transitions among them. Launaea taraxacifolia was unique in being the only species without any trichome. Stellate trichome type and K-shaped or tetraradiate trichomes were observed in Tridax procumbens only. The genus Vernonia can be delimited from the other genera by the possession of T - shaped trichomes which are absent in the other genera, while amoeboid-shaped trichomes {{can be found in the}} genus Chromolaena only. Within the same genus, the species can also be delimited on the basis of possession of unique trichome types, for example in the genera Vernonia and Emilia. Cuticular striations occur in only two species out of the twelve studied, on the abaxial surface of V. amygdalina and on both surfaces of Bidens pilosa. Four stomatal types were recorded for the family, anomocytic, brachyparacytic, anisocytic and diacytic. Stomatal type was observed to delimit not only at generic level, but also at specific or species level. Ageratum conyzoides and Synedrella nodiflora are the only two species with occasional diacytic stomatal types. Results of the statistical correlation analysis for stomatal size and stomatal index at the 0. 05 and 0. 01 levels revealed high positive correlation for species in the same tribe, as well as for species in different tribes affirming close interrelationship and overlap of the values of stomatal indices and sizes within the family.

Within this family, Artemisia is included in the tribe Anthemideae and comprises over 500 species, which are mainly found in Asia, Europe and North America (Bora and Sharma 2011). Artemisia annua L., commonly known as sweet wormwood or Qinghao, is a large vigorous weedy annual shrub often reaching more than 2  m tall with aromatic leaves (Wright 2002)’ The leaves produce essential oils used in folk and modern medicine, and in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industry (Teixeira da Silva 2004). It has traditionally been used in China for the treatment of fever and chills (Ferreira and Janick 1997). Some Artemisia species including A. annua have been traditionally used in pain, inflammation and febrile conditions (Habib and Waheed 2013; Huang et al. 1993). Though originally growing in Asia and Europe, the plant is cultivated in Africa and used as a tea for the treatment of malaria (Klayman 1993). The aerial parts of A. annua are source of artemisinin that has potent antimalarial activity (Bhakuni et al. 2001). Besides antimalarial activity, A. annua has biological activities such as antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory, cytokinin-like and antitumor effects (Bhakuni et al. 2001; Chougouo-Kengne et al. 2013; Chu et al. 2014; Woerdenbag et al. 1993; Kim et al. 2015). These activities relate to the presence of secondary metabolites such as sesquiterpenoids (Chu et al. 2014), flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic ketones, aromatic acids, phenylpropanoids (Brown 2010), alkaloids and coumarins (Bhakuni et al. 2001).|$|E

However, genetic improvement of guayule has been slowed by its complex mode of reproduction, natural ploidy series, and lack of genetic and genomic resources. The interspecific hybridization of guayule with its closest sister taxon mariola (P. incanum Kunth) offers an opportunity to access novel genetic variation for guayule breeding programs, but mariola accessions available from the U. S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) have never been evaluated for natural variation in ploidy level. In addition, the nuclear genome sizes for guayule and mariola at any ploidy level are unknown. To that end, we examined the ploidy of 10 mariola accessions, which revealed a natural polyploid series ranging from triploid (2 n = 3 x = 54) to pentaploid (2 n = 5 x = 90). In contrast, a ploidy analysis of five guayule accessions uncovered a natural polyploid series that ranged from diploid (2 n = 2 x = 36) to hexaploid (2 n = 6 x = 108). More than one ploidy level among individual plants (mixed ploidy) and instances of aneuploid plants were observed for accessions of both guayule and mariola. The nuclear genome sizes of guayule and mariola were similar at identical ploidy levels, and the genome size of diploid guayule (1624 Mb) was almost twofold smaller than the genomes of sunflower (H. annuus L. 2 n = 2 x = 34) and lettuce (L. sativa L.; 2 n = 2 x = 18), two other <b>Compositae</b> (<b>Asteraceae)</b> species that are being genome-sequenced.

40|$|Of the {{approximately}} 250, 000 species of flowering plants, {{nearly one in}} ten {{are members of the}} <b>Compositae</b> (<b>Asteraceae),</b> a diverse family found in almost every habitat on all continents except Antarctica. With an origin in the mid Eocene, the Compositae is also a relatively young family with remarkable diversifications during the last 40 My. Previous cytologic and systematic investigations suggested that paleopolyploidy may have occurred in at least one Compositae lineage, but a recent analysis of genomic data was equivocal. We tested for evidence of paleopolyploidy in the evolutionary history of the family using recently available expressed sequence tag (EST) data from the Compositae Genome Project. Combined with data available on GenBank, we analyzed nearly 1 million ESTs from 18 species representing seven genera and four tribes. Our analyses revealed at least three ancient whole-genome duplications in the Compositae—a paleopolyploidization shared by all analyzed taxa and placed near the origin of the family just prior to the rapid radiation of its tribes and independent genome duplications near the base of the tribes Mutisieae and Heliantheae. These results are consistent with previous research implicating paleopolyploidy in the evolution and diversification of the Heliantheae. Further, we observed parallel retention of duplicate genes from the basal Compositae genome duplication across all tribes, despite divergence times of 33 – 38 My among these lineages. This pattern of retention was also repeated for the paleologs from the Heliantheae duplication. Intriguingly, the categories of genes retained in duplicate were substantially different from those in Arabidopsis. In particular, we found that genes annotated to structural components or cellular organization Gene Ontology categories were significantly enriched among paleologs, whereas genes associated with transcription and other regulatory functions were significantly underrepresented. Our results suggest that paleopolyploidy can yield strikingly consistent signatures of gene retention in plant genomes despite extensive lineage radiations and recurrent genome duplications but that these patterns vary substantially among higher taxonomic categories...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultivated}} genus Osteospermum {{belongs to}} the plant family <b>Compositae</b> (<b>Asteraceae).</b> Their native habitat is in South African mountains, therefore these plants are also known under the common name 'African Daisy'. Osteospermums are half hardy or hardy perennial ornamental plants. The genus Osteospermum contains about seventy different species, all perennial plants. The perennial cultivated varieties, {{not to be confused}} with the annuals and less valuable cultivated hybrids of Dimorphoteca aurantiaca, are in turn hybrids of O. ecklonis, O. jucundum and other species, and hybrid combinations are often unknown. Also for this hybrid condition they are usually not available from seed, but as vegetatively propagated clones. New varieties are being bred continuously because of the increased economic importance in the production of flowering pot plants and of the increasing demand for accessions with new bright colours and for novel miniature plants. The genus Osteospermum already meets these criteria in its native habitat of South African mountains, and there has been much recent work by botanists and plant breeders to further enhance the natural characteristics of those seventy species of wild plants. Indeed, a characterisation of cultivated Osteospermum germplasm becomes necessary in our country in order to protect the consumers' and breeders' rights, and to help the national breeders in the choice of the parents for a new cross. Moreover, the characterisation by means of molecular markers supplies a way to evaluate biodiversity among commercial varieties and wild relatives. Molecular marker (RAPD) analysis was already demonstrated to be an useful tool to identify Osteospermum varieties and to study their genetic affinities (Faccioli et al., 1999). AFLP analysis has been now carried out on a wide collection of 106 Osteospermum composed by wild species and cultivars belonging to English, Italian and Danish breeding groups. The AFLP protocol has been set up for this ornamental. All the accessions were then tested with four AFLP primers combinations, leading to the undoubtful characterisation of genotypes and to a more accurate understanding of the relationships between the Osteospermum species and cultivars...|$|E
40|$|The {{architecture}} of inflorescence {{refers to the}} spatio-temporal arrangement of flowers on the reproductive branches. Flowering plants have evolved great diversity in such branching systems. Among which, the showy capitulum type inflorescence in the large <b>Compositae</b> (<b>Asteraceae)</b> species {{is regarded as a}} prerequisite factor for their wide spreading around the world. Different from the simple raceme and cyme, capitulum compresses hundreds of individual florets on its receptacle, but overall resembles a single, solitary flower. The ontogeny of capitulum also bears resemblance to a single flower, with regard to the meristem determinacy, floral sequence and histological configurations. Recent molecular studies have revealed that a plant specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY), is required for both the floral initiation and floral patterning, the two essential steps to form an inflorescence. 			 The thesis elaborates Gerbera hybrida as a model to elucidate functions of the LFY ortholog during the development of inflorescence/flower in a capitulum background. In addition to the conserved functions in regulating floral meristem identity and floral patterning, three specified functions were revealed by transgenic Gerbera with down-regulated expression of GhLFY. Firstly, GhLFY is involved in the regulating the floral initiation of marginal ray florets. Down regulation of GhLFY resulted the marginal ray florets revert into a branching patterm that shown on the capitulum of Calyceraceae, the close relatives of Asteraceae. Secondly, the determinacy of IM is disrupted when GhLFY loses its functions, suggesting that GhLFY may function at both the flower and inflorescence interfaces. Thirdly, different flower types show specific responses to GhLFY down-regulation in floral patterning, indicating that there exist a potential genetic gradient among different flower types. At protein level, the LFY functions are specified by formation of versatile protein complexes with its transcriptional co-regulators. In Gerbera, GhLFY proteins tend to form homodimers and they were also capable to interact with a conserved transcriptional co-regulator, the UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) ortholog GhUFO. Taken advantage of the forward Y 2 H library screening, 6 additional proteins were identified to interact with GhLFY, including several novel potential co-regulators of LFY that has not yet been identified in other species. Additionally, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC) was optimized to verify the GhLFY self-interaction in planta...|$|E

Since the related species Anaphalis morrisonicola and Cnicus benedictus were reported for its anti cancer activities, the above mentioned plants were screened for Invitro antioxidant activity. In vitro antioxidant {{studies were carried out}} by DPPH, Nitric oxide and Hydrogen peroxide methods for the aerial part extracts of the plants. Different extracts were obtained from the aerial parts of the whole plant by successive solvent extraction and cold maceration process and subjected for Invitro antioxidant activity studies. Among the extracts tested, the ethyl acetate extract of Anaphalis neelgerriana DC and Cnicus wallchi DC showed significant anti oxidant activity in all the above methods. The potent ethyl acetate extract should be tested for anti oxidant activity in animal models...|$|R
40|$|The family <b>Asteraceae</b> or <b>compositae</b> {{known as}} the ester, daisy or {{sunflower}} family is the largest family of flowering plants. Artemisia is a large diverse genus of plants with between 100 to 150 species belonging to the family <b>asteraceae</b> (<b>compositae).</b> It comprises hardy herbs and shrubs known for their volatile oils. They grow in temperate climate of the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere usually in dry or, semidry habitats. The collected herbs were authenticated, dried and extracted to calculate the percentage of yield. Phytochemical studies of the Hexane and alcoholic extracts showed the presence of various phytoconstituents i. e. carbohydrate, saponins, phytosterol, proteins and amino acid, tannin, phenolic compounds and flavonoids. It was observed that all the extracts show more important chemical constituents for various pharmacological activities. The determination of these characters will aid future investigators in their Pharmacological analysis of this species...|$|R
