We have developed a dynamic in vitro blood-brain barrier model designed to allow for extensive toxicological, pharmacological and physiological testing. Induction of blood-brain barrier properties in a tri-dimensional hollow fiber <b>culturing</b> <b>apparatus</b> was investigated by co-culturing a bovine aortic endothelial cell line (or rat brain endothelial cells) with rat brain astrocytes (or C 6 rat glioma cells) under pulsatile flow conditions to mimic intraluminal blood flow. Cell growth was monitored over time by measuring glucose consumption and lactate production: these experiments confirmed that the hollow fiber cell culturing systems can maintain viable cells in culture for extended (> 1 month) periods of time. Cells were visually inspected after culturing and dissociation from the hollow fiber cartridge and identified as endothelial (by fluorescent Dil-Ac-LDL uptake) or glial (by GFAP immunoreactivity). Blood-brain barrier properties were tested by intraluminal injection of horse-radish peroxidase (HRP, mol. weight 44, 000), glucose (m. w. 180) or potassium. Either procedure demonstrated that aortic cells co-cultured with astrocytes (or C 6 cells) developed a selective barrier with an estimated electrical resistance of 2, 900 omega/cm 2. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of BAEC were also affected by the co-culturing process, suggesting that astrocytes induced CNS properties in these cells.

The quantity of new byssus produced by oysters in the two <b>culture</b> <b>apparatus</b> at the two sites was counted 5, 10, 15 and 20 days after deployment. At the end of the experiment, the thicknesses and tensile strengths of randomly selected byssal threads from ear-hung oysters and oysters held in panel nets were determined. Ten days after deployment, there was no significant difference in the quantity of byssus produced by oysters in the two <b>culture</b> <b>apparatuses</b> at both sites. An average of around two threads per byssus secreting oyster was recorded by the tenth day. However, after 15 and 20 days, ear-hung oysters had produced significantly more byssus (p < 0. 01) than those housed in panel nets at the high current site. On the twentieth day, ear-hung oysters had an average of six byssal threads while those housed in panel nets had an average of around three per oyster at the Raviravi site. In contrast, production of byssus by oysters in the two <b>culture</b> <b>apparatuses</b> did not differ significantly for the same period at the low current site. Furthermore, ear-hung oysters produced significantly thicker byssus than those held in panel nets (p < 0. 01) which had significantly high tensile strengths (p < 0. 01).

40|$|The {{application}} of DNA nanotechnology {{to interface with}} cellular environment provides tremendous opportunities to expand the synthetic biological circuits. The current {{application of}} DNA nanotechnology spans smart therapeutics (Douglas et al, Science 2012), drug delivery (Perrault, Shih, ACS Nano 2014), imaging (Choi et al, ACS Nano 2014), and probes for cell biology (Shaw et al, Nat Methods 2014). The excellent programmability of nucleic-acid-based parts would enlarge the space of complex functionalities realized in synthetic biological circuits. Building on our earlier works on DNA strand displacement circuits to regulate DNA tweezers driven by transcriptional oscillators, we show how discrete-time L 1 adaptive controller {{can be used to}} deliver drugs in situ in response to cellular condition. For this, we replace the model predictive controller used (Menolascina et al, PLOS CB 2014). Our controller automatically regulates the administration of inducer molecules to the cells by comparing the actual protein expression level in the cell population with the desired expression level. We intend to use in the automated platform of (Menolascina et al, PLOS CB 2014) which is based on a microfluidic device, a time-lapse microscopy apparatus, and a set of motorized syringes, all controlled by a computer. They have tested the platform to force yeast cells to express a desired fixed, or time-varying, amount of a reporter protein over thousands of minutes. Here, the computer automatically switched the type of sugar administered to the cells, its concentration and its duration, according to the control algorithm. Our discrete-time L 1 adaptive controller facilitates superior results on controlling expression of any protein, fused to a fluorescent reporter, provided that an external molecule known to (indirectly) affect its promoter activity is available. Conceptually, our controller is also compatible to work with optogenetic systems that allow one to generate desired perturbations in the intracellular concentration of a specific protein in microbial cell culture. As light can be easily added and removed, this enables an easier dynamic control of protein concentration in culture than would be possible with long-lived chemical inducers. Implementation of this closed-loop control scheme is achieved by sampling individual cells from the culture apparatus, imaging and quantifying protein concentration, and adjusting the inducing light appropriately. The <b>culturing</b> <b>apparatus</b> can be operated as a chemostat, allowing one to precisely control microbial growth and providing cell material for downstream assays. Apart from the obvious applications in phenotype regulations, this method of specifically perturbing the concentration of a single protein and measuring the downstream signaling and transcriptional responses will allow experimentalists to make more informative perturbations to better elucidate the kinetics and architecture of biological networks for disease diagnosis and drug delivery. ...|$|E

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that {{vascular}} smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) exhibit varied physiological responses when exposed to altered gravitational conditions. In the present study, we focused on elucidating whether the cell surface glycocalyx could be a potential gravity sensor. For this purpose, a roller <b>culture</b> <b>apparatus</b> was used {{with the intent to}} provide altered gravitational conditions to cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). Heparinase III (Hep. III) was applied to degrade cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) selectively. Sodium chlorate was used to suppress new synthesis of HSPG. Glycocalyx remodeling, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation, and F-actin expression induced by gravity alteration were assessed by flow cytometry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blot. Results indicate that the exposure of cultured RASMCs to altered gravitational conditions led to a reduction in cell surface HSPG content and the activation of NOS. It also down-regulated the expression of glypican- 1, constitutive NOS (NOSI and NOSIII), and F-actin. On the other hand, Hep.

Furthermore, individual enzymatic activity is subject to regulation by metabolic intermediates in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.

We previously developed a flat-plate <b>culture</b> <b>apparatus</b> assembled from materials commonly used for gel electrophoresis, which enables high-density culture of the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. In this study, a stationary dense culture of C. merolae, when re-activated in this <b>culture</b> <b>apparatus,</b> exhibited an accumulation of photosynthetically produced starch. We demonstrated that respiratory activity increased during the culture period, while photosynthetic activity remained constant. Gene expression analysis revealed that the genes involved in cytosolic glycolysis and the citric acid cycle were selectively activated, compared to the genes for the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin–Benson cycle. Measurements of the respiratory rate after addition of various organic substances showed that C. merolae can utilize almost any exogenous organic compound as a respiratory substrate, although the effectiveness of each compound was dependent on the culture time in the flat-plate culture, suggesting that glycolysis was rate-limiting to respiration, and its activity depended on the level of photosynthetic products within the cells. We also demonstrated that organic substances increased the rate of cell growth under dim light and, interestingly, C. merolae could grow heterotrophically in the presence of glycerol. Obligate photoautotrophy should be considered an ecological, rather than physiological, characteristic of C. merolae.|$|R

40|$|Classical {{laboratory}} {{strains of}} Escherichia coli do not spontaneously colonize inert surfaces. However, when maintained in continuous culture for evolution studies or industrial processes, these strains usually generate adherent mutants which form a thick biofilm, visible {{with the naked}} eye, {{on the wall of}} the <b>culture</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Such a mutant was isolated to identify the genes and morphological structures involved in biofilm formation in the very well characterized E. coli K- 12 context. This mutant acquired the ability to colonize hydrophilic (glass) and hydrophobic (polystyrene) surfaces and to form aggregation clumps. A single point mutation, resulting in the replacement of a leucine by an arginine residue at position 43 in the regulatory protein OmpR, was responsible for this phenotype. Observations by electron microscopy revealed the presence at the surfaces of the mutant bacteria of fibrillar structures looking like the particular fimbriae described by the Olsén group and designated curli (A. Olsén, A. Jonsson, and S. Normark, Nature 338 : 652 – 655, 1989).

40|$|Abstract Background To {{maintain}} {{populations of}} microbial cells under controlled conditions {{of growth and}} environment for an indefinite duration {{is a prerequisite for}} experimentally evolving natural isolates of wild-type species or recombinant strains. This goal {{is beyond the scope of}} current continuous <b>culture</b> <b>apparatus</b> because these devices positively select mutants that evade dilution, primarily through attachment to vessel surfaces, resulting in persistent sub-populations of uncontrollable size and growth rate. Results To overcome this drawback, a device with two growth chambers periodically undergoing transient phases of sterilization was designed. The robustness of this device was assessed by propagating an E. coli strain under permanent thymine starvation for over 880 days, i. e. metabolic conditions notoriously known to lead to cell death and clogging of cultivation vessels. Ten thousand generations were required to obtain a descendant lineage that could resist thymine starvation and had recovered wild-type growth rate. Conclusions This approach provides a technological framework for the diversification and improvement of microbial strains by long-term adaptation to inescapable metabolic constraints.

Ephemeral sporangia developed a t low concentrations of these ions, Kf, HC 0,- and C 0, 2 -, and resistant sporangia developed at higher concentrations. (5) The potassium and magnesium content and pH value of the organisms were independent of the pH value and potassium concentration of the medium over the ranges studied, and of the sporangium type produced by the organisms. The continuous <b>culture</b> <b>apparatus</b> used is described and continuous culture theory applicable to experiments in morphogenesis has been developed and tested...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} several years our {{laboratory}} has conducted research towards developing defined competitive exclusion cultures that enhance colonization resistance against salmonellae in baby chicks. Previously in our laboratory it was shown that 10 -day-old broiler and layer chicks that were fed diets containing 5 - 10 % lactose provided either in the feed or in water from day-of-hatch were significantly more resistant to Salmonella typhimurium, and S. enteritidis cecal colonization than control chicks not provided a diet supplemented with lactose. Additionally, resistance against salmonellae cecal colonization was further enhanced in treatment groups provided dietary lactose in combination with an undefined mixture of anaerobic bacteria (i. e. undefined competitive exclusion culture or Nurmi culture) originally obtained from the ceca of adult broiler chickens maintained on a diet containing lactose. In order to make a defined competitive exclusion culture that was efficacious in enhancing colonization resistance against salmonellae, we cultured cecal contents obtained from adult broilers maintained on a unmedicated diet containing 5 % lactose in a continuous-flow (CF) <b>culture</b> <b>apparatus</b> (i. e. chemostat), that was maintained at parameters that would best represent the cecal environment...|$|R
