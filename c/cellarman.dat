25|$|From Eichendorff’s diaries we {{know about}} his love for a girl, Amalie Schaffner, and another love affair in 1807-08 during his student days in Heidelberg with one Käthchen Förster. His deep sorrow about the unrequitted love for the nineteen-year-old {{daughter}} of a <b>cellarman</b> inspired Eichendorff {{to one of his}} most famous poems, Das zerbrochene Ringlein (The Broken Ring).|$|E
60|$|It {{was already}} getting dusk {{when he saw}} two commissaries of the committee, with six armed men, stop before the door and knock. It was opened. Two of the men {{remained}} outside, and the rest entered. He ran to the stores. The head <b>cellarman</b> had gone round the place {{with him and his}} master, and Leigh at once went to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "By St. Paul! I have {{no great}} love for them," [...] quoth Sir Nigel. [...] "I {{am a man}} who am slow to change; and, if you take away from me the faith that I have been taught, it would be long ere I could learn one to set in its place. It is but a chip here and a chip there, yet it may bring the tree down in time. Yet, on the other hand, I cannot but think it shame that a man should turn God's mercy on and off, as a <b>cellarman</b> doth wine with a spigot." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 3 bakers, 1 butcher, 17 shoemakers, 17 tailors, 17 carpenters, 5 cabinetmakers, 6 coopers, 1 bricklayer, 15 blacksmiths, 6 <b>cellarmen,</b> 60 weavers, 42 chandlers, 12 hawkers, 2 inns, 11 taverns, 6 brewer, 2 distilleries, 6 corn dealer, 5 wood dealer… ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{still in}} high school, Caravello began playing {{with a string of}} bands mostly {{performing}} covers of Top 40 songs. As he described it later, [...] "Top-40 in those days was everything - funk, ballads, rock, country, and everything. It was a great time for radio." [...] His first band, The <b>Cellarmen,</b> was formed in 1965 by him and several of his friends. They started playing local clubs in Brooklyn and Queens. Only a handful of recordings were released on the Jody Records label, a small Brooklyn recording studio. Caravello then joined a band called [...] "Things That Go Bump in the Night" [...] and later [...] "Smack", the latter of which consisted mostly of members from The <b>Cellarmen,</b> who disbanded in 1968.|$|R
6000|$|... "As we go downstairs," [...] he went on, [...] "I {{shall make}} some remark about our going {{straight}} on board. That will {{put them on}} the wrong scent, and they will waste a lot of time searching all the craft in the river. I do it principally because I want them to believe that you have been rescued by a party of sailors. You heard me say that, as sailors, they would be accustomed to tie the knots tightly; and of course my uniform will help to lead them astray. The men with me were really some of your <b>cellarmen,</b> under Lefranc." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later the whole back of the atrium was thronged by the motley crowd who ministered to the {{household}} needs of a great Roman nobleman. There was the arcarius, or account keeper, with his stylum behind his ear; the sleek praegustator, who sampled all foods, so as to stand between his master and poison, and beside him his predecessor, now a half-witted idiot through the interception twenty years before of a datura draught from Canidia; the <b>cellarman,</b> summoned from amongst his amphorae; the cook, with his basting-ladle in his hand; the pompous nomenclator, who ushered the guests; the cubicularius, who saw to their accommodation; the silentiarius, who kept order in the house; the structor, who set forth the tables; the carptor, who carved the food; the cinerarius, who lit the fires--these and many more, half-curious, half-terrified, came to the judging of Datus. Behind them a chattering, giggling swarm of Lalages, Marias, Cerusas, and Amaryllides, from the laundries and the spinning-rooms, stood upon their tiptoes and extended their pretty wondering faces over {{the shoulders of the}} men. Through this crowd came two stout varlets leading the culprit between them. He was a small, dark, rough-headed man, with an unkempt beard and wild eyes which shone, brightly with strong inward emotion. His hands were bound behind him, and over his neck was the heavy wooden collar or furca which was placed upon refractory slaves. A smear of blood across his cheek showed that he had not come uninjured from the preceding scuffle.|$|E
60|$|They drank claret, {{decanted}} with zealous {{care and}} {{served by a}} black-aproned <b>cellarman,</b> who waited anxiously by until the Marquis had gravely sipped his first glassful and approved. Their dinner to-day was very much {{what it had been}} a dozen years ago--the French-fed chicken, the artichokes, and strawberries served with liqueurs remained, whatever the season. And their conversations. Marcia leaned back in her chair for a moment, and again the corners of her lips twitched as she remembered. Faithfully, year after year, she could trace those conversations--the courtly, old-fashioned criticism of the events of the week, criticism from the one infallible standard, the standard of the immutable Whiggism upon which the constitution itself rested; conversation with passing references to any new event in art, and, until lately, the stage. To-night Marcia found herself tracing the gradual birth of her stimulating rebellion. She remembered how, years ago, she had sat in that same seat and listened as one might listen to the words of a god. And then came the faint revolt, the development of her intellect, the necessity for giving tongue to those more expansive and more subtle views of life which became her heritage. To do him justice, the Marquis encouraged her. He was as good a judge of wit and spirit as he was of claret. If Marcia had expressed a single sentence awkwardly, if her grammar had ever been at fault, her taste to be questioned, he would have relapsed into the stiffness of his ordinary manner, and she would have felt herself tongue-tied. But, curious though it seemed to her when she looked back, she was forced to realise that it was he who had always encouraged the birth of her new thoughts, her new ideals, her new outlook upon life, her own drastic and sometimes unanswerable criticisms of that state of life in which he lived. She represented modernity, seeking for expression in the culture of the moment. He, remaining of the ancient world, yet found himself rejuvenated, mentally refreshed, week by week, preserved from that condition of obstinate ossification into which he would otherwise have fallen, by this brilliant and unusual companionship. In all the many years of their intimacy he had felt no doubts concerning her. He was possessed of a self-confidence wholly removed from conceit, which had spared for him the knowledge of even a moment's jealousy. In her company he had felt the coming and, as he now realised, the passing of middle age. It was only within these last few hours that certain formless apprehensions had presented themselves to him.|$|E
50|$|After a brief {{stint as}} a <b>cellarman</b> and {{superintendent}} for the Royal Agricultural Society, Shoebridge started his career as an associate to Family Court justice Eric Baker.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911, Horace Shears, <b>cellarman,</b> {{pleaded guilty}} to {{stealing}} five bottles of whisky, two bottles of gin, one bottle of sherry, and some towels and handkerchiefs {{to the value of}} £3 (...) [...] He was sent to prison for 2 months.|$|E

50|$|Finings can be {{introduced}} during {{the production of}} beer in order to induce it to drop bright more readily. For British beers, the most common fining agent is isinglass, and most breweries producing Real Ale introduce isinglass into the shipment cask so that the beer will drop bright readily upon the cask's being breached; this process can take from several hours {{to two or three}} days and may require the addition of supplementary finings by the <b>cellarman.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vernon {{became the}} new potman and <b>cellarman,</b> {{although}} he is shamelessly work-shy and often looks for excuses not to work. He proposed to Liz in 2007, unaware that she was enjoying a fling with brewery delivery man Derek, until Derek confessed all on 15 July. Vernon was prepared to leave Weatherfield, but returned after Liz made a Motown compilation tape which she gave to Lloyd Mullaney to play in his cab {{en route to the}} airport.|$|E
50|$|Annie {{appeared}} to have especially low regard for Fred Gee. When he married Eunice Nuttall in 1981, Annie offered to let them live at the Rovers while they looked for a pub of their own. When they were turned down by the brewery because Eunice {{had been accused of}} stealing, Annie still wanted them out as she had found a new <b>cellarman</b> who was ready to start work. Fred later split from Eunice and Annie let him keep his job.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{kinds of}} spile are available. Initially, [...] "soft" [...] or porous spiles are used, made of open-grained softwood, bamboo, or harder wood with cuts in. These allow the excess gas to escape. Once the <b>cellarman</b> judges this process to be complete, a hard spile is {{inserted}} {{which does not}} allow any more gas out of the cask. These are made of harder wood (usually still technically [...] "softwood", but denser and more solid than soft spiles). Plastic pegs intended for sealing shives are occasionally used as hard spiles.|$|E
50|$|Britton {{was born}} on 7 July 1771 at Kington St. Michael, near Chippenham. His parents were in humble circumstances, and he was left an orphan at an early age. At sixteen he went to London and was apprenticed to a wine merchant. Prevented by ill-health from serving his full term, he found himself adrift in the world, without money or friends. In his fight with poverty he was put to strange shifts, {{becoming}} <b>cellarman</b> at a tavern and clerk to a lawyer, reciting and singing at a small theatre, and compiling a collection of common songs.|$|E
50|$|Steve starts dating StreetCars {{employee}} Ronnie Clayton (Emma Stansfield), a local gangster's estranged wife. Ronnie {{tries to}} frame {{him when she}} accidentally ran down a pensioner in her taxi, but she was eventually caught. Steve's alibi for the crime was that he spent the night with his new business partner Lloyd's girlfriend Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu). This led to the temporary closure of Street Cars when Lloyd refused to work with Steve. Lloyd eventually forgave Steve for his deception and they reopened the business. Later that year, Steve bought The Rovers Return pub from Fred Elliott (John Savident) and installed Liz as landlady and stepfather Vernon Tomlin (Ian Reddington) as <b>cellarman.</b> Steve takes Amy (now played by Amber Chadwick) after Tracy is sentenced to 15 {{years in prison for}} the murder of her boyfriend Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward).|$|E
5000|$|Das zerbrochene Ringlein (The Broken Ring) is {{a poem by}} Joseph von Eichendorff, {{which can}} be found also titled as Lied (lay), first {{published}} 1813 by Justinus Kerner et al. in the almanac «Deutscher Dichterwald» (German Poets’ Forest) under the pseudonym [...] "Florens" [...] and afterwords in his novel Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts.1807/08 Eichendorff pondered in his diaries about the unfulfilled love for Käthchen Förster, daughter of a Heidelberg <b>cellarman,</b> a love affair of the poet during his student days.This fact is reminiscent by a memorial stone at the Philosophenweg (Philosophers' Walk) in Heidelberg, along the Neckar’s shore.In 1814 Eichendorf’s love poem was set to music by Friedrich Glück, and became popular under the title In einem kühlen Grunde, taken from the first verse of the first stanza. The poem can be found interpreted in today's music by Comedian Harmonists, Heino, and Max Raabe.|$|E
50|$|Corlett {{also uses}} {{in his own}} way the shared {{experience}} of an animal's point of view, such as Merlin provides for young Wart, in T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone (1938). In Corlett's hands this becomes archetypal encounters between child and animal: Cinnabar the fox, Sirius the dog, Jasper the Owl, Merula the blackbird, Lutra the otter, Falco the kestrel, Bawson the badger, Corvus the crow, Pica the magpie, Rus the red squirrel, Mustel the weasel and Cervus the deer. In The Bridge in the Clouds Corlett also introduces Rattus Rattus, a noble, brave, swaggering and most appealing rat, a worthy companion to Graham's Ratty, Masefield's Rat the <b>cellarman</b> (in The Midnight Folk), Lewis's Reepicheep, and Hoban's Manny Rat. Indeed, there are hints of Wind in the Willows in the badgers of The Door in the Tree and the rats, weasels, stoats and ferrets in the final conflict of The Bridge in the Clouds.|$|E
50|$|Bill's first wife, Alison, died {{of cancer}} in 1980. However, it is Percy Sugden's (Bill Waddington) niece, Elaine Prior, whom Bill falls for, and in January 1985 they marry and move to Southampton with Bill's daughter, Debbie, where Elaine opens a hair salon. Elaine later gives birth to Bill's second son, Carl. Sometime after this Bill and Elaine move to Germany, where Elaine has an affair, and in July 1995, Bill realises their {{marriage}} is over, and returns to Weatherfield and turns up on Kevin's doorstep. Bill moves in with Kevin while Kevin's wife, Sally (Sally Dynevor), whom he has never met, is away. To welcome his daughter-in-law home, he cooks a meal and burns down their kitchen in the process. Fortunately, he uses his building skills to repair the damage. Bill gets a job as <b>cellarman</b> at The Rovers Return, and later moves in there. In November 1995, Bill loses his job at The Rovers when the Duckworths take over, and to make things worse, receives a tax bill for £1,400. He cannot afford to pay, so Kevin and Sally lend him the money - much to the annoyance of Rita who had given the Webster children £5,000. Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) asks Bill to do some work at the Crimea Street flats and gets one of the flats in return and Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) becomes his business partner. In 1997, Bill has an affair with Maureen and the pair run away together to Germany just ten days after Maureen has married Fred.|$|E
50|$|Cask beer is the {{traditional}} method of service, via a hand pump or by gravity straight from the cask on stillage. Cask conditioned beer is unfiltered, unpasteurized and lacking artificial carbonation (the bubbles are produced by the ongoing fermentation), giving it a limited shelf-life. This dispense method is strongly associated with ale, {{although there is no}} technical barrier to serving lager or stout this way. Most pubs use hand pumps ("beer engines") to draw the beer, whereas stillages are commonly employed at beer festivals. Cask ale and bottle conditioned beer are championed by the Campaign for Real Ale under the name real ale. Prior to stainless steel casks, beer was delivered in large wooden barrels, which were delivered to the cellar via a trap-door on the footpath using two ropes wound about the barrels midriff (a parbuckle) to lower the barrel gently down the cellar's ramp. They then had to stand on their sides for a few days so the sediment would settle {{to the bottom of the}} belly of the barrel, after which they would be 'tapped' by punching the pre-cut centre of the (traditionally cork) bung (at the lower edge of the barrel end) into the barrel by hitting the tapered brass 'tap' with a mallet. One could then attach the pipe connector onto the tap, so that the <b>cellarman</b> could turn the tap on when ready. In a similar manner, one would punch through the centre of a bung on the upper side of the barrel's belly with a hardwood spile (tapered peg). The hardwood spile prevents air access. Once the barrel is in use, the spile is replaced with a 'soft' spile, traditionally made from softwood, but nowadays from bonded-together (woody) fibres. The soft spile prevents a vacuum forming at the upper surface of the beer: it allows sufficient air in for the beer engine to work, but keeps dust, flies and other mischief-makers out.|$|E
