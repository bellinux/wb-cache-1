5|$|The poor {{condition}} of the Betelgeuse for which its operator, Total S.A., was to blame: Immediately before the incident, the vessel's hull and tanks were cracked, <b>corroded,</b> and leaking. The 11-year-old vessel had been worked hard and {{was at the end}} of her service life.|$|E
5|$|These leaks allowed {{water to}} seep through the topping and access the iron {{frame of the}} building. This <b>corroded</b> much of the building's frame during the mall's three decades in operation. The {{corrosion}} was eventually so severe that the weld on a connection failed, resulting in the collapse.|$|E
5|$|Several {{options were}} {{implemented}} {{to increase the}} bridge's lifespan. These included a dehumidification programme that slowed the rate of corrosion in the main cables by keeping air in the voids between the main cables' strands below 40% humidity. Engineering consultants Faber Maunsell began work on the project in 2006, which took {{two and a half}} years to complete at a cost of £7.8million. As part of the works, some of the <b>corroded</b> cable strands were spliced.|$|E

5|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian {{government}} made mandatory {{the use of}} ethanol blends with gasoline, and neat ethanol-powered cars (E100 only) were launched to the market in 1979, after testing with several prototypes developed by four carmakers. Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get <b>corroded</b> by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was found}} {{shattered}} into thousands of pieces and is now heavily <b>corroded,</b> the helmet still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design. It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes. It would {{have been used by}} a Roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle. The identity of the owner is not known but the helmet was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It is possible that the helmet was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the conquest of Britain.|$|E

5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is <b>corroded</b> by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|By early 1997, {{after almost}} two decades of activity, the only repairs {{completed}} were phase one of the air ventilation system to dehumidify the hollow base, the drainage pipes and a new inner roof. Plans now included the erection of a temporary two-story metal building to protect all but the giant Father Time from the harsh winters and to facilitate year-round repair; the reinforcement of <b>corroded</b> steel interior portions; the replacement of inconsistent patches; the substitution of engineered spacing for natural cracks, and finally, hand-brushed concrete recoating. The temporary building was budgeted at $270,000; the city spent a total of $450,000 on repairs approved by the Park District that year.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly <b>corroded.</b> In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E
40|$|Rebar {{corrosion}} is {{the most}} commonly observed deterioration cause in reinforced (RC) bridges, due to the extensive use of salts in de-icing operations during winter. Corrosion {{is known to have}} adverse effects on the mechanical properties of the affected rebars (i. e. impaired strength and ductility). A significant loss in the mechanical properties of <b>corroding</b> rebars of structural elements, such as under-reinforced beams is likely to affect their ductility. However, the observed scatter in the available experimental data of <b>corroding</b> under-reinforced beams do not allow for consistent conclusions to be made. In this paper, the ductility of <b>corroding</b> under-reinforced beams - in flexure - is examined using non-linear finite element analysis (NLFEA). Numerical models of <b>corroding</b> RC beams are developed and validated, using empirical models from the literature, to consider the effect of corrosion on the residual properties of the <b>corroding</b> rebars and their bond with concrete. The results are discussed in relation to key experimental and numerical studies. Thereafter, a detailed parametric study is presented, which quantifies the evolution of ductility in the <b>corroding</b> beams and assist in explaining the scatter found in the experimental data. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R

500|$|Zinc is more {{reactive}} than iron or {{steel and}} thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely <b>corrodes</b> away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( [...] forms as the zinc <b>corrodes.</b> This protection lasts {{even after the}} zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc <b>corrodes</b> away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying.

5|$|Plutonium milling {{operations}} produced {{large quantities}} of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium. Thousands of 55-gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen area called the 903 pad storage area, where they <b>corroded</b> and leaked radionuclides over years into the soil and water. An estimated 5,000 gallons of plutonium-contaminated oil leached into the soil between 1964 and 1967. Portions of this waste, mixed with dust that composed Pad 903, became airborne in the heavy winds of the Front Range and contaminated offsite areas {{to the south and}} east.|$|E
5|$|The {{controllers}} {{were designed}} to be tough enough to survive the forces of launch, and proved to be extremely resilient to damage. During {{the investigation of the}} Challenger accident the two MECs (from engines 2020 and 2021), recovered from the seafloor, were delivered to Honeywell Aerospace for examination and analysis. One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely <b>corroded</b> and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
5|$|The fossils {{from near}} Santa Fé {{included}} the horse tooth which had puzzled Darwin {{as it had}} been previously thought that horses had only come to the Americas in the 16th century, close to a Toxodon tooth and a tooth of Mastodon andium (now Cuvieronius hyodon). Owen confirmed that the horse tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named Equus curvidens, and its age was confirmed by a <b>corroded</b> horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils. This discovery was later explained as part of the evolution of the horse.|$|E
40|$|The N Reactor fuel is <b>corroding</b> {{at sites}} where the Zircaloy {{cladding}} was damaged when the fuel was {{discharged from the}} reactor. <b>Corroding</b> areas are clearly visible on the fuel stored in open cans in the K East Basin. There {{is a need to}} estimate the area of the <b>corroding</b> uranium to analyze aspects of fuel behavior as it is transitioned. from current wet storage to dry storage. In this report, the factors that contribute to {open_quotes}true{close_quotes} surface area are analyzed in terms of what is currently known about the N Reactor fuel. Using observations from a visual examinations of the fuel in the K East wet storage facility, a value for the <b>corroding</b> geometric area is estimated. Based on observations of <b>corroding</b> uranium and surface roughness values for other metals, a surface roughness factor is also estimated and applied to the <b>corroding</b> K East fuel to provide an estimated {open_quotes}true{close_quotes} surface area. While the estimated area may be modified as additional data become available from fuel characterization studies, the estimate provides a basis to assess effects of exposed uranium metal surfaces on fuel behavior in operations involved in transitioning from wet to dry storage, during shipment and staging, conditioning, and dry interim storage...|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not be identified as {{the upper part of the}} coin was partially <b>corroded.</b> A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a striking resemblance to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Hansa served {{abroad for}} the first nine years of her career in the German navy. In 1884, it was found that her iron hull was badly <b>corroded,</b> which {{rendered}} the ship unfit for further active service. She was therefore removed from active duty and used for a variety of secondary roles. From 1884 to 1888, she served as a guard ship in Kiel, where she also trained engine and boiler room personnel. In 1888, she was stricken from the naval register and used as a barracks ship in Kiel. She was moved to Mönkeberg in 1905, where she continued to train boiler room personnel, until 1906 when she was sold to ship-breakers and dismantled for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations of {{the figures}} varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are {{arranged}} in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, {{with the exception of}} Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31–35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly <b>corroded,</b> the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads, while a third, perhaps a boy, assisting an adult who may be the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena’s peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.|$|E

50|$|Pure gold {{will usually}} survives {{underwater}} {{for a long}} period of time without <b>corroding.</b> With silver objects, it will <b>corrode</b> quite easily, become very fragile, and form layers of concretion. Copper, brass and bronze can develop a shiny pitted surface and can become covered with a layer of concretion as well as green or black corrosion. Ferrous metals such as cast and wrought iron and steel usually <b>corrode</b> to form thick concretions that can entirely cover the metal object. Marine organisms such as limpets and molluscs can grasp on the metal surfaces and cause fouling corrosion—corrosion.|$|R
5|$|Many of the textures were {{accumulated}} {{during a}} three-day trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The artists took hundreds of photos of wood, adobe, sand, stucco and other materials, which were treated in Photoshop before being mapped onto the 3D geometry. Whereas many computer-generated environments {{of the time}} ended up looking smooth, like plastic, the Millers and Vander Wende developed a more gritty and weathered design, with <b>corroded</b> and aged elements, to imply reality. The artists considered how objects would look and function if they were real, where and how they would be worn, and created corresponding details. While bump maps were occasionally used to simulate geometry, even small details such as screws were often individually modeled.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 2010, a {{ceremony}} was held aboard Belfast {{to mark the}} 65th anniversary of end of the Second World War in Europe. Veterans of the Arctic convoys were in attendance to receive medals from the Russian Ambassador Yuri Fedotov. During the ceremony it was announced that, {{as part of the}} restoration of the ship, two new masts had been manufactured at the Severnaya Verf shipyard near Saint Petersburg. The production of the masts, to replace <b>corroded</b> originals, had been supported by a number of Russian businesses at a reported cost of £500,000. The restoration of the masts involved removing the fittings from both masts, allowing them to be individually restored. The old masts were then cut down in sections, the new masts erected, and the original fittings replaced. On 19 October 2010, the new masts were dedicated at {{a ceremony}} attended by HMS Belfast veterans, by Prince Philip and officials from the Russian embassy and government.|$|E
