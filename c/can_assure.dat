25|$|The natives, whose {{presence}} causes so much disgust to you, often {{take pride in}} {{the fact that they are}} Italian subjects. In Libya, Somalia and in the recent war against their homeland, in foreign struggles, they have shielded you with their bodies, and sometimes paid with their lives. I <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you that it is no exaggeration to say that the natives provided you the means with which you could overcome. The misinterpretation of so many merits and acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an essentially alien and imperial government.|$|E

25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> {{you that you are}} not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E
25|$|Two rival teenage gangs, the Jets (White) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican immigrants), {{struggle}} {{for control of}} the neighborhood somewhere in the Upper West Side of New York City amidst the police (Prologue). They are warned by Lt. Schrank and Officer Krupke to stop fighting on their beat. The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> their continued dominance of the street. The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance. Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them ("Jet Song"). Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come. Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over. Tony is convinced that something important is round the corner ("Something's Coming").|$|E

[...] Days before the season opener, Lloyd Carr compared the daunting schedule to an expedition to Mount Everest. Carr noted, [...] "It's a little akin to climbing Mount Everest.

[...] During the story arc involving her girlfriend Rae Thomas, Simone was noted for her naivety when approaching relationships and sex.

500|$|Senior {{officers}} from the investigation asked for assistance from the National Policing Improvement Agency, which provides expertise for difficult cases. On 4 January 2011, a clinical forensic psychologist, who had previously been involved as a criminal profiler in other high-profile murder cases, joined the investigation to help narrow down the number of potential suspects. Jones stated that his officers had established over 1,000 lines of inquiry. Jones said, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you, {{we are determined to}} solve this crime and bring Jo's killers to justice."

American physicist Philip Anderson, also a future Nobel Prize laureate, {{spent a year in}} Cambridge in 1961–1962, and recalled that having Josephson in a class was [...] "a disconcerting experience for a lecturer, I <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you, because everything had to be right or he would come up and explain it to me after class." [...] It was during this period, as a PhD student in 1962, that he carried out the research that led to his discovery of the Josephson effect; Cambridge unveiled a plaque on the Mond Building dedicated to the discovery in November 2012. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1962, and obtained his PhD in 1964 for a thesis entitled Non-linear conduction in superconductors.|$|E

If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs". [...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you I would cut out the piece".

500|$|Until he read Warner's Cricket Between Two Wars {{during the}} Second World War, Fingleton was unaware that Warner {{assumed he was}} {{responsible}} for the leak. When he found out, Fingleton wrote to Warner, who replied that although he believed Fingleton to be the source, he would publish a correction if presented with evidence to the contrary. Fingleton did not pursue the case. Australian cricketer Bill O'Reilly wrote that during the 1948 tour of England, he and Fingleton confronted Warner, who apologised as he no longer believed Fingleton to be the culprit. Fingleton thought the belief he was responsible cost him a place on the 1934 tour to England, although there were other possible factors in his exclusion. According to Fingleton, Woodfull later told him that the controversy had led to his missing selection. A letter which Woodfull wrote to Fingleton in 1943 stated [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you that I did not connect your name with the passing on of that conversation." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show, Simone was played by three actresses: Lena Cardwell (July 5, 1999 to April 16, 2001), Chrystee Pharris (April 17, 2001 to April 2004), and Cathy Jenéen Doe (July 23, 2004 to September 4, 2007). The program made history as the first daytime serial to show two women having sex in bed. She is also the first African-American lesbian {{character}} to appear in a daytime serial. When discussing the decision to portray Simone as a lesbian, Kalouria emphasized [...] "sexual identity isn't a passing fancy" [...] and [...] "this is where [...] is [...] I <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you we're not going to make light of this particular topic." [...] The storyline about Simone's lesbianism, and the representation of her sexuality, received mixed feedback from critics and media outlets, as did Cathy Jenéen Doe's performance. Passions won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality, and her relationship with Rae. Despite the award, Sarah Warn, former editor of entertainment website AfterEllen.com, criticized the lesbian reveal as having [...] "reduced Simone to a one-dimensional character who happened to sleep with a girl." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{later became}} the center of disapproval from viewers, who felt Declan was moving on too fast after Bridget's death when he developed feelings for Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). Sorensen then backed the storyline, wanting his character to move on stating: [...] "It's a difficult situation. Declan was truly in love with Bridget. He was {{one of the lucky ones}} to have found his soul mate early in life, but at the same time, he has to move on and live his life." [...] further adding: [...] "A lot of people do think it's too soon for another relationship. But I <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you that it's done very tastefully." [...] He then added an explanation to how Declan feels, adding: [...] "He feels as though he's cheated on Bridget and that he hasn't mourned for long enough to be able to move on without showing proper respect to the love of his life. He's left confused and upset." [...] As scenes from the storyline began to air Brewer made comment on the storyline reassuring viewers adding: [...] "I think they'll be okay with it... I think they'll be accepting. It's done very tastefully and very slowly. The two characters don't rush anything." ...|$|E
