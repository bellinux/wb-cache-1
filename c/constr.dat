2500|$|Byrd sued Dean Witter {{in federal}} court, alleging {{violations}} {{of both the}} Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and applicable California law. During the pendency of the action, Justice William Brennan had suggested in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury <b>Constr.</b> Corp., where the petitioner sought to prevent the respondent it had already sued in state court from compelling arbitration through a federal action, that the FAA applied to proceedings in state courts as well, and that its enactment amounted to [...] "a national policy favoring arbitration."

2500|$|The {{applicability}} of the Wilko doctrine to 1934 Act claims, the judge wrote, [...] "merits some discussion". Allegaert v. Perot had set precedent within the Second Circuit eight years earlier by making explicit what had long been taken as settled law in all federal courts. He further distinguished Allegaert from the instant case by noting that Allegaert had involved industrywide allegations of massive fraud, and thus there was a public policy reason to prefer litigation, whereas McMahon was between one brokerage firm and one client. Combined with the Court's declaration two years earlier in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury <b>Constr.</b> Corp. that the FAA enacted [...] "a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary," [...] MacMahon followed the lead of district courts in other circuits and ordered the parties to arbitrate per their contract. He further held that the RICO claims were non-arbitrable, but stayed them pending the outcome of arbitration. Following Byrd, he also required arbitration of the McMahons' claims under state law.|$|E

5000|$|The {{general rule}} is that [...] "abstention from the {{exercise}} of federal jurisdiction is the exception, not the rule." [...] Cone Mem. Hosp. v.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{a dispute over}} {{payments}} {{after the completion of}} a new wing eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. By a 6-3 margin, the justices required the hospital to arbitrate with its contractor. The case, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury <b>Constr.</b> Corp., set some precedents in civil procedure, clarifying the circumstances under which a federal court can decline jurisdiction when there is a similar case in state court and when a stay may be appealed as a final judgement.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, due {{to growing}} court dockets, courts {{enforced}} arbitration agreements more often. In the 1983 case Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury <b>Constr.</b> Co., the Supreme Court stated that by enacting §2 of the FAA, Congress made a [...] "declaration {{of a liberal}} federal policy favoring arbitration agreements". Later decisions by the Supreme Court in the 1990s established that the FAA preempts state laws regulating arbitration agreements and that statutory claims may be arbitrated pursuant to an arbitration agreement.|$|E

50|$|Financing public {{projects}} {{through public}} authorities is also attractive because their independent corporate structure theoretically {{makes them more}} flexible and efficient than state agencies. Many restrictions placed on state agencies {{do not apply to}} public authorities, including, for example, general public bidding requirements (some public bidding requirements do apply under the Public Authorities Law). See Plumbing, Heating, Piping & Air Conditioning Contr. Ass'n v. N.Y.S. Thruway Auth., 5 N.Y.2d 420 (1959). Most public authorities may also make contracts, and because of public authorities' corporate status, there is generally, no remedy against the state for the breach of such contracts. John Grace & Co. v. State University <b>Constr.</b> Fund, 44 N.Y.2d 84 (1978). Many public authorities, such as Industrial Development Agencies and the Empire State Development Corporation, can also condemn property.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} case is White v. Massachusetts Council of <b>Constr.</b> Employers, Inc., {{in which}} the Supreme Court held that the City of Boston could require its building contractors to hire at least fifty percent of their workforce from among Boston residents. 460 U.S. at 214 - 15. Because all of the employees covered by that mandate were [...] "in a substantial if informal sense, 'working for the city,' [...] " [...] Boston {{was considered to be}} simply favoring its own residents through the expenditures of municipal funds. The Supreme Court stated, [...] "when a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause." [...] Id. at 208. Nothing in the Constitution precludes a local government from hiring a local company precisely because it is local.|$|E

50|$|According to U.S. v. Utah <b>Constr.</b> & Mining Co., {{pursuant}} to a delegation by the President under Public Law 85—804, government departments and agencies exercising functions {{in connection with}} the national defense may, upon a finding that such action would 'facilitate the national defense,' enter into amendments and modifications of contracts without regard to other provisions of law respecting such amendments and modifications. As implemented by the Atomic Energy Commission's procurement regulations, the authority conferred encompasses amendments without consideration, correction of mutual mistakes, and formalization of informal commitments. This authority, which in many respects is analogous to power to settle claims, is delegated to Contract Adjustment Boards established within the departments and agencies concerned separate from the Boards of Contract Appeals. Because the regulations preclude resort to the powers conferred by Public Law 85—804 '(u)nless other legal authority in the Department concerned is deemed to be lacking or inadequate,', the Army Contract Adjustment Board has generally required contractors to exhaust remedies before the ASBCA under the disputes clause. Thus it is quite evident from the administration of Public Law 85—804 and its predecessors that the limitations on the jurisdiction of the Boards of Contract Appeals are well understood by the military procurement departments and Congress.|$|E

40|$|The {{fact that}} finite direct sums {{of two or}} more {{mutually}} different spaces from the family {ℓ_p : 1 < p<∞}∪ c_ 0 fail to have greedy bases is stated in [Dilworth et al., Greedy bases for Besov spaces, <b>Constr.</b> Approx. 34 (2011), no. 2, 281 - 296]. However, the concise proof that the authors give of this fundamental result in greedy approximation relies on a fallacious argument, namely the alleged uniqueness of unconditional basis up to permutation of the spaces involved. The main goal of this note is to settle the problem by providing a correct proof. For that we first show that all greedy bases in an ℓ_p space have fundamental functions of the same order. As a by-product of our work we obtain that every almost greedy basis of a Banach space with unconditional basis and nontrivial type contains a greedy subbasis.
