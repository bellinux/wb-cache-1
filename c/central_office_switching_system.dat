50|$|The Hardware Information Navigational Tool, or HINT, is an {{information}} web service {{developed by the}} former AG Communications Systems (now Alcatel-Lucent) which displays hardware and software characteristics of a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system.</b> It displays the hardware equipment as it is positioned in the central office and shows how this equipment is being used. The program displays an interactive map, allowing the user to select the applicable states/provinces or country, then select the switching system, and then finally the module, circuit pack, and circuit. The statistical reports allow customers to maintain a watch on their resources. It is also useful for engineering and {{the daunting task of}} assigning all of the various telephony services.|$|E
50|$|The first {{telephones}} {{were directly}} connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location. Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards. This gave rise to landline telephone service in which each telephone is connected {{by a pair of}} dedicated wires to a local <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system,</b> which developed into fully automated systems starting in the early 1900s. For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the middle 20th century. Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973. By the late 1970s several mobile telephone networks operated around the world. In 1983, the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) was launched, offering a standardized technology providing portability for users far beyond the personal residence or office. These analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with better security, greater capacity, better regional coverage, and lower cost. The public switched telephone network, with its hierarchical system of many switching centers, interconnects telephones around the world for communication with each other. With the standardized international numbering system, E.164, each telephone line has an identifying telephone number, that may be called from any authorized telephone on the network.|$|E
5000|$|Inose {{was well}} known, internationally, for his {{invention}} of the TSI system {{while he was at}} AT&T Bell Laboratories. The idea of the TSI was to implement time switches into digital <b>switching</b> <b>systems.</b> The system collects data and stores them in a time slot and allows the time slot to be interchanged with another. It contains one physical input and one physical output. [...] "He built a prototype digital time-division multiplexing (TDM) electronic <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> called CAMPUS, which is based on the TSI principle..." [...] Although this invention was crucial, it did not receive much recognition due to costly memory devices. Later in the 1970s when semiconductor technologies began advancing, TSI received more recognition. Since its first commercial deployment in 1976, it has been popular and utilized amongst the digital <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> and digital private branch exchanges.|$|R
50|$|The GTD-5 EAX (General Telephone Digital Number 5 Electronic Automatic Exchange) is the Class 5 {{telephone}} switch {{developed by}} GTE Automatic Electric Laboratories.

50|$|Beginning in 1986, GTE {{spun off}} several {{operations}} to form joint ventures. That same year, GTE Sprint and United Telecommunication's long-distance subsidiary, US Telecom, agreed to merge and form US Sprint Communications Company, with each parent retaining a 50 percent {{interest in the}} new firm. That same year, GTE transferred its international transmission, overseas <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switching,</b> and business <b>systems</b> operations to {{a joint venture with}} Siemens AG of Germany, which took 80 percent ownership of the new firm. The following year, GTE transferred its business systems operations in the United States to a new joint venture, Fujitsu GTE Business Systems, Inc., formed with Fujitsu Limited, which retained 80 percent ownership.|$|R
5000|$|DCO (Digital <b>Central</b> <b>Office),</b> a {{time-division}} <b>switch</b> {{similar to}} DMS-10. The Stromberg-Carlson DCO {{was the first}} Class-5 digital local <b>office</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> installed in the U.S. Stromberg-Carlson put their switch (lab-prototype)into service in July 1977 in Richmond Hill, Georgia. This switch was SC's [...] "REA FIELD TRIAL" [...] office, but was never accepted by the telephone company (Coastal Utilities Inc) and was replaced with a Northern Telecom DMS-10 in the early 80's.|$|R
50|$|A marker {{is a type}} {{of special}} purpose control system that was used in {{electromechanical}} telephone <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches.</b> <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> are the large devices that telephone companies use to make the connections that support telephone calls. The switch makes voice connections between users, and to control equipment such as that used to detect dialed numbers.|$|R

5000|$|SPC was {{introduced}} in electronic <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> in the 1960s. The 101ESS PBX was a transitional <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> in the Bell System to provide expanded services to business customers that were otherwise still served by an electromechanical <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch.</b> Examples of SPC based 3rd generation <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> include: Western Electric 1ESS switch, British GPO TXE (various manufacturers), Metaconta 11 (ITT Europe) and the AKE, ARE and pre-digital (1970s) versions of the AXE telephone exchange by Ericsson and Philips PRX were large-scale systems in the public switched telephone network. SPC enabled sophisticated calling features. As SPC exchanges evolved, reliability and versatility increased.|$|R
50|$|The SP-1 {{design was}} {{superseded}} by the DMS-100 <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> {{and other members}} of the DMS family of products (DMS: digital multiplex switch). DMS extended the technology by fully integrating switching and transmission. This was a major advance that changed the way systems were built.|$|R
50|$|The 1AESS <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> {{incorporated}} higher processing capacities {{based on}} the 1A Processor in 1976.

50|$|Whitehorse {{converted}} from partial dial to full dial service on October 31, 1960. After this date, local communities' ring-down phones were replaced with local exchange service, using surplus <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> {{that could be}} acquired at a relatively low cost. The wire line facilities along the highway was changed from ring-down services to multi-party lines off dial exchanges as the communities along the line received <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches,</b> {{most of which were}} Ericsson Rurax switches that during the late 1970s were modified to enable direct dialing of long distance calls, though without automatic number identification. The more remote multi-party lines were switched from wire to Exicom radios, while the Ruraxes were mostly replaced in the mid-1980s with modern solid-state digital switches, though the last Rurax remained in service in Swift River until 1987.|$|R

50|$|In {{telephone}} switches, time-slot interchange switches usually {{form the}} outer {{layer of the}} switching fabric at a <b>central</b> <b>office's</b> <b>switch.</b> They take data from time-multiplexed T-1 or E-1 lines that serve neighborhoods. The T-1 or E-1 lines serve the subscriber line interface cards (SLICs) in local neighborhoods. The SLICs serve as the outer space-division switches of a modern wired telephone system.|$|R
50|$|The pair {{of wires}} from the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> to a {{subscriber}}'s home {{is called a}} subscriber loop. It carries a direct current (DC) voltage at a nominal voltage of 48V when the receiver is on-hook, supplied by a power conversion system in the <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> This power conversion system is backed up with a bank of batteries, resulting in continuation of service during interruption of power to the customer supplied by their electrical utility.|$|R
