50|$|SBB Cargo works {{together}} with the international climate protection organisation Myclimate to offer its customers a completely climate-neutral transport service. The inevitable CO2 emissions of a shipment by train are neutralised by climate protection measures elsewhere. Unlike other similar schemes, the SBB Cargo concept takes all environmentally harmful emissions and the entire life cycle of the <b>consignment</b> into <b>account</b> when calculating the environmental impact. Since the beginning of 2009 the Swiss railfreight operator has also been providing its customers with individual emission reports. The emissions comparison for all consignments forwarded by SBB Cargo can easily be integrated into operational environmental management systems and presented in environmental audits.|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyses}} ?wholesale? and ?retail? categories, {{providing a}} modern {{understanding of the}} size of <b>consignment,</b> taking into <b>account</b> trends in economic relations. Analysis of existing definitions of ?wholesale? was carried out. A comparison of the main characteristics of ?wholesale? and ?retail? categories revealed their key differences: the size of the lot and the purpose of purchase. Such differences are cancelled out by the current trends of socio-economic processes: mass customization, postponed production, collaborative consumption, domination of retail, and the gradual ousting of the wholesale intermediary from the supply chain. Development of the information market calls for the introduction of new indicators measuring its volume, due to the differences in the processes of production, distribution and consumption of material goods. ? ?????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ????? ? ?????????, ??? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ????????? ??????? ?????? ?????? ? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ?????????. ??????????? ?????? ???????????? ??????????? ????????? ?????. ????????? ????????? ????????? ????? ? ????????? ?? ?? ???????? ???????????????. ?????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ???????: ?????? ?????? ? ???? ???????. ????? ???????? ???????????? ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????-????????????? ?????????: ???????? ???????????? ?? ?????, ?????????? ????????????, ?????????? ???????????, ????????????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ???? ????????. ? ????????? ????? ?????????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ????? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ???????????, ??? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????, ????????????? ? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????...|$|R
