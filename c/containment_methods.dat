40|$|Transgene {{spreading}} is a {{major concern}} in cultivating genetically modified (GM) corn. Cross-pollination may cause the spread of transgenes from GM cornfields to conventional fields. Occasionally, seed lot contamination, volunteers, mixing during sowing, harvest, and trade can also lead to transgene escape. Obviously, new biological confinement technologies are highly desired to mitigate transgene spreading in addition to physical separation and isolation methods. In this study, we report the development of a built-in <b>containment</b> <b>method</b> to mitigate transgene spreading in corn. In this method, an RNAi cassette for suppressing the expression of the nicosulfuron detoxifying enzyme CYP 81 A 9 and an expression cassette for the glyphosate tolerant 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene G 10 were constructed and transformed into corn via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The GM corn plants that were generated were found to be sensitive to nicosulfuron but resistant to glyphosate, which is exactly the opposite of conventional corn. Field tests demonstrated that GM corn plants with silenced CYP 81 A 9 could be killed by applying nicosulfuron at 40 g/ha, which is the recommended dose for weed control in cornfields. This study suggests that this built-in <b>containment</b> <b>method</b> for controlling the spread of corn transgenes is effective and easy to implement...|$|R

40|$|Background: Legg-Calve´-Perthes disease (LCPD) is an {{idiopathic}} avascular necrosis of the femoral head. There {{are multiple}} {{approaches to the}} treatment of LCPD ranging from conservative management {{to a wide variety of}} surgical methods. Conservative management necessitates extreme degrees of abduction in an orthosis for a longer period of time which further jeopardize capital femoral head vascularity. Surgical <b>containment</b> <b>methods</b> are used in cases where it is desirable. Initial surgical <b>containment</b> <b>methods</b> are varus or varus-derotational osteotomy of the proximal femur or an innominate osteotomy as described by Salter and other pelvic osteotomies. The purpose of this study was to describe the early results of <b>containment</b> <b>methods</b> by one-stage combined osteotomy (femoral varus osteotomy and Salter innominate osteotomy) in patients with severe LCPD. Materials and Methods: 23 children were operated in the age group of 4 – 9 years for LCPD by one-stage combined osteotomy procedure between January 2005 and June 2012. There were 19 boys and 4 girls, left hip involved in 10 cases and right in 13 cases. Preoperatively, they were classified according to Catterall, Joseph's stage and lateral pillar (LP) classification. Postoperatively, clinical results were evaluated in accordance with Ratliff classification and radiological assessment was made by Mose's index, modified Stulberg classification and Epiphyseal extrusion index. Results: Seventeen hips were Catterall group III, 6 in group IV and all had two or more “head-at-risk” signs. There were 2 patients with stage IIA, 15 were in stage IIB and 6 were in stage IIIA as classified by Joseph's stage of disease. According to LP classification, 11 patients were group B, 3 were group B/C and 9 were in group C. At an average followup of 5. 4 years (range 2 – 9. 5 years), the clinical results were good in 12, fair in 9 and poor in 2. According to Mose scale, 8 patients had good results, 13 fair results and 2 had poor results. Based on modified Stulberg classification, there were 10 patients in group A, 11 in group B and 2 in group C. The average preoperative extrusion index was 23. 6 % which improved postoperatively to 9. 5 % at latest followup. Conclusions: The surgical treatment of LCPD with the best expected outcome is still a challenge. Advanced <b>containment</b> <b>methods</b> by one-stage combined osteotomy can be considered as an alternative treatment where femoral head subluxation or deformity which makes containment difficult or impossible by more conventional methods...|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, we described a proposed model explaining differences in rates of conflict (aggression, absconding, self-harm, etc.) and containment (seclusion, special observation, manual restraint, etc.). The Safewards Model identified six originating domains {{as sources of}} conflict and containment: the patient community, patient characteristics, the regulatory framework, the staff team, the physical environment, and outside hospital.

Little is known about why these differences exist, or about how staff choose between the different methods available to them. Aims: To compare psychiatric professionals attitudes to containment measures between countries with different practices, and to discover what factors have {{the greatest impact on}} preparedness to use a <b>containment</b> <b>method.</b> Method: Surveys of psychiatric professionals in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland, and Australia, using the Attitude to Containment Measures Questionnaire. Results: Relative approval of different containment measures broadly matched what we know about different practices, with some notable differences. Staff in Finland expressed the highest level of approval of containment, staff in the UK the least, with those in the Netherlands in between. Individuals’ preferences for different containment measures were largely determined by whether they considered it (i) safe for the patients undergoing it, (ii) prevented them from injuring others, and (iii) quickly calmed them. Conclusion: Future evaluation research on containment measures should use time taken to calm the patient, injury to patients and others, as primary outcomes. National clinical audit and injury reporting systems would also enable the identification of methods that are truly physically injurious to patients, aiding in the rational selection of appropriate containment measures...|$|R
40|$|This project compares three GIS {{techniques}} that estimate populations who are potentially affected by environmental contamination in Portland, Oregon. All three GIS techniques utilize polygon containment to estimate populations potentially exposed to pollutants based on block level census data. In this study, multiple buffer distances at half-mile increments were used across all three techniques. Circular Euclidean distance buffers surrounding a known contaminated property, such as documented brownfields, approximate the contamination zone. Accurate estimates for populations exposed to harmful environmental conditions {{could provide a}} better understanding of environmental justice issues. The specific research questions were: 1) Are the population estimates sensitive to the GIS techniques used? 2) Are higher proportions of minority populations closer to brownfields than the general population? The three population estimation techniques are: the centroid <b>containment</b> <b>method,</b> areal apportionment method, and vector-based dasymetric mapping. Centroid <b>containment</b> <b>method</b> assigns the population of a census enumeration unit to its centroid. If the centroid falls within the contamination zone, then the total population of the census unit is counted as being exposed to the pollutant. Areal apportionment method estimates exposed populations by calculating the population based on its proportional size for the area of the census enumeration unit that falls within the contamination zone. Vector-based dasymetric mapping redistributes the population into areas that correspond more directly to resident populations within a census enumeration unit. Building volumes are used to dis-aggregate the census enumeration blocks into smaller spatial units that account for three-dimensional space and more realistically resemble the populations who may reside in the exposure zones. Using the population estimates derived from these methods, I examined if minority populations were disproportionately distributed near brownfields. For question 1, I compared the population estimates from the three methods at various buffer distances to ascertain the reliability of each of their calculations. After the sensitivity analysis was performed, I used a half-mile radius around brownfields as the potential risk area and compared the percentage of minorities in the risk area to the percentage of the total population in the risk area {{for each of the three}} GIS techniques. The results indicate all three techniques produced comparable population estimates across the various distance intervals. Consequently, this allowed for a fair comparison across all three GIS methods. In terms of environmental justice the results reported all three estimation techniques to have similar results. As the techniques got more advance, the results showed less inequality for minorities; however, the margin for this difference was only one to two sites depending on which methods are being compared. Also, the vector-based dasymetric method presented a lower percentage of minorities in the risk area when compared to the other two methods, because dasymetric mapping is designed to estimate were people are more likely concentrated. The research from this project presented how GIS could be used to investigate environmental justice, and how different spatial analysis methods could result in uncertainty with population distribution...|$|R

The biocontrol potential of South African isolates of Heterorhabditis zealandica, Steinernema citrae, S. khoisanae, S. yirgalemense, and Steinernema sp., was evaluated against codling moth, Cydia pomonella. Codling moth was susceptible to all six nematode isolates at a concentration of 50 infective juveniles/insect (78 - 100 % mortality). Low temperatures (10 h at 17 ºC; 14 h at 12 ºC) negatively affected larvicidal activity (≤ 3 %) for all isolates. All tested isolates were most effective at higher levels of water activity (aw= 1). The average aw 50 -values for all isolates tested was 0. 94 (0. 93 - 0. 95), except S. khoisanae 0. 97 (0. 97 - 0. 98). Regarding host-seeking ability, no positive attraction to host cues could be detected amongst isolates, except for H. zealandica. Three of the isolates, H. zealandica, S. khoisanae, and the undescribed Steinernema sp., were selected for field-testing and proven to be effective (mortality > 50 %). Insect <b>containment</b> <b>methods</b> used during field experimentation was shown to influence larvacidal activity, as different levels of mortality were obtained using various <b>containment</b> <b>methods</b> (wooden planks vs. pear tree logs vs. mesh cages).

When the cascades with different opinions reaching the same user, the cascade arriving first {{is the most likely}} to be taken by the user. Therefore, once misinformation or rumor is detected, a natural <b>containment</b> <b>method</b> is to introduce a positive cascade competing against the rumor. Given a budget k, the rumor blocking problem asks for k seed users to trigger the spread of the positive cascade such that the number of the users who are not influenced by rumor can be maximized. The prior works have shown that the rumor blocking problem can be approximated within a factor of (1 - 1 /e-δ) by a classic greedy algorithm combined with Monte Carlo simulation with the running time of O(k^ 3 mn n/δ^ 2), where n and m are the number of users and edges, respectively. Unfortunately, the Monte-Carlo-simulation-based methods are extremely time consuming and the existing algorithms either trade performance guarantees for practical efficiency or vice versa. In this paper, we present a randomized algorithm which runs in O(km n/δ^ 2) expected time and provides a (1 - 1 /e-δ) -approximation with a high probability.

Along with RNAi transgenes, the gene Heat Shock Promoter:FLOWERING LOCUS T (HSP:FT) is inserted into poplar trees to promote early flowering, allowing one to expedite the study of the effects of RNAi.
