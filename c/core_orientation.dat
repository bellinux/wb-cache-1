Honeycomb sandwich panels were constructed using Hexcel 6367 A 250 - 5 H carbon fiber face sheets and Hexcel Nomex HRH- 10 - 1 / 8 - 5 honeycomb cores. The mechanical properties of the constituent materials were discovered experimentally using ASTM standards and theoretical models using honeycomb mechanics and classical beam and plate theory are described. A failure mode map for loading under three point bending is developed from previous works by Triantafillou and Gibson 26, showing the dependence of failure mode on face sheet to core thickness and honeycomb <b>core</b> ribbon <b>orientation.</b> Beam specimens are tested {{with the effects of}} Honeycomb <b>core</b> ribbon <b>orientation</b> and unequal face sheet thickness’s examined.

Yet current research neglects different distributor characteristics, such as risk preferences and long- or short-term orientations. In China, an emerging market with continuously evolving legal institutions, distributors' <b>core</b> business <b>orientations</b> (risk preference and long-term orientation) may affect their channel relationship with suppliers (distributor trust and channel conflict).

The buckling stress of single- and double-layer corrugated sandwich structures increased when the strain rate increased. The increased buckling stresses were ascribed to the micro inertial effects. The initial buckling stress at quasi-static and high strain rate was numerically shown to be imperfection sensitive. Increasing the number of core layers decreased the buckling stress and increased the densification strain.
