50|$|The <b>crowding-out</b> {{hypothesis}} {{is the assumption}} that when a government experiences a deficit, the choice to borrow to offset that deficit draws on the pool of resources available for investment and private investment gets crowded out. This <b>crowding-out</b> effect is induced by changes in the interest rate. When the government wishes to borrow, their demand for credit increases and the interest rate, or price of credit, increases. This increase in the interest rate makes private investment more expensive as well and less of it is used.|$|E

50|$|Frey, Osterloh {{and others}} find in several econometric studies that {{crowding}} theory is particularly relevant for work motivation: For example motivational <b>crowding-out</b> {{is more likely}} when principal and agent (employer and employee) have a personal relationship.

Using household survey data from Vietnam, I find the evidence supporting this hypothesis.

Using a panel of 145 countries from 1960 to 2007, the results suggest that government spending produces important <b>crowding-out</b> effects, by negatively affecting both private consumption and investment.

40|$|We {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} that involuntary transfers {{for the provision of}} a public good will completely crowd out voluntary transfers against the warm-glow hypothesis that <b>crowding-out</b> will be incomplete because individuals care about giving. Our design differs from the related design used by Andreoni in considering two levels of the involuntary transfer and a wider range of contribution possibilities, and in mixing groups every period instead of every four periods. We analyse the data with careful attention to boundary effects. We retain {{the null hypothesis}} of complete <b>crowding-out</b> in two of three pairwise comparisions, but reject it in favour of incomplete <b>crowding-out</b> in the comparison most closely akin to Andreoni’s design. Thus we confirm the existence of incomplete <b>crowding-out</b> in some environments, but suggest that the warm-glow hypothesis is inadequate in explaining it. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} full {{equilibrium}} characterization of warm-glow giving à la Andreoni (1989, 1990) by extending the Andreoni-McGuire (1993) algorithm. We then generalize and offer an intuitive {{meaning to the}} large-economy <b>crowding-out</b> results by Ribar and Wilhelm (2002). The algorithm indexes individuals according to their free-riding levels of the public good. This level is finite for an individual whose donation is always dictated by some altruism or concern for charity. We show that if all individuals have finite free-riding levels, then the <b>crowding-out</b> is complete in a large economy. If, on the other hand, a non-negligible fraction of the population never free rides, then the <b>crowding-out</b> is zero in a large economy. We discuss implications of these extreme <b>crowding-out</b> predictions for charitable behavior and fund-raising strategies. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} defence {{expenditure}} {{on the economy}} has been widely studied through different types of models. However, the results from these studies have not reached definitive conclusions, and have left a gap in the analysis of the impact of defence R&D expenditure at the economy level. Defence R&D has specific characteristics, which lead to market failures: public good, high risk and uncertainty, national security. Also, defence R&D creates two types of externalities: negative (<b>crowding-out),</b> and positive (spin-off). <b>Crowding-out</b> is the major economic debate about defence R&D. This paper analyses the <b>crowding-out</b> hypothesis by applying three types of models for the UK case: supply, demand, and demand-supply models. From these three models the most reliable is chosen and applied to the individual cases of France, Germany, Japan and USA. The paper also reports the results for the pooled data of these five countries, and for four error component models.

Therefore, a differentiated approach to rise retirement age, allowing high-skilled manpower to retire later than low-skilled manpower, can cause much softer <b>crowding-out</b> effect than a cookie-cutter approach to delay retirement.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} the {{strategic}} interaction between the labor supply decision of the elderly and private transfers from their children lowers the opportunity cost of leisure of the elderly. This in turn magnifies the <b>crowding-out</b> effect of public pensions on the labor supply of the elderly. We show that this mechanism has implications for evaluating the <b>crowding-out</b> effect of public pensions in developing countries. That is, a misspecified econometric model that does not control for the endogeneity of private transfers leads to a biased estimate of the <b>crowding-out</b> effect of public pensions.

40|$|The {{major problem}} studied {{in this paper}} is the <b>crowding-out</b> effect. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to {{determine}} whether the <b>crowding-out</b> effect is occurring in the U. S., or around the world, because of U. S. government budget deficits. If it is, the way fiscal policy is handled in this country will probably need changing. To study the problem, interest rates within and outside the U. S. are examined to see if U. S. budget deficits affect them. The paper also looks at both sides of the issue to get a better understanding of what is happening. Research studied includes both popular press items and journals. This allows conclusions to be more complete for they are based on both public opinion and mathematical models. There is one factor that limits this paper, it is the time period during which the <b>crowding-out</b> effect has been studied. The <b>crowding-out</b> effect has been hypothesized for many years, but the likelihood of its occurrence was not very high until the last decade. Therefore, the amount of research done on the <b>crowding-out</b> effect has been somewhat limited. Unfortunately, there are no clear-cut answers about the <b>crowding-out</b> effect. After researching the issue, the <b>crowding-out</b> effect remains as elusive as ever. The effect needs to be studied further until more definitive answers can be found. In the second part of the paper, other possible effects of deficits are studied. These effects highlight the importance of U. S. deficits as they pertain to both the U. S. and the entire world. Only time and more studies will tell if U. S. government budget deficits are helping or hurting the U. S. and the world in the long-run. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E

40|$|The {{withdrawal}} of discretionary fiscal stimulus and a renewed emphasis on institutional and 'self-imposed' budgetary constraints are {{evidence that the}} imperative of fiscal sustainability and sound accounting fundamentals continue to drive fiscal policymaking within many advanced economies.

30|$|This paper {{examines}} the relationships between {{natural resource}} dependence, public education investment, and human capital accumulation. It addresses why the “blessing” of abundant natural resources often {{turns into a}} “curse” in many countries and regions, focusing on the <b>crowding-out</b> effect of natural resources on human capital. According to our empirical analysis of provincial panel data from China, natural resource dependence is significantly and negatively correlated with human capital accumulation. The <b>crowding-out</b> effect of natural resources on human capital exists only in the central and western regions of China. Our introduction of an interaction term for natural resource dependence and public education investment underscores the possibility of investing in public education to reduce the <b>crowding-out</b> effect of natural resource dependence on human capital. The government should utilize the income of the natural resource sector to increase investment in education to enhance local human capital.|$|E
