The complex, which originally cost $60 million to build and housed 4,500 workers in over a million square feet (100,000 m2) of office space, was sold in 1994, for $525,000. The renovated complex, which {{is now known as}} <b>Cross</b> <b>Point,</b> was subsequently sold in 1998, to a joint venture of Yale Properties and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors for a price reported to be over $100 million.|$|E

The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The bridge is usually positioned by the <b>cross</b> <b>point</b> of the [...] "f-hole" [...] (i.e., where the horizontal line occurs in the [...] "f"). The f-holes, named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process. The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small length of rubber hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier. This keeps the wood components of the cello from drying out.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} the <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> (Tropp) of experimental and clinical hypoproteinaemias, and obtained the following results : 1) Hypoproteinaemia induced by plasmapheresis. Shifts of the protein fractions {{were accompanied by}} appearances of the <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> of globulin-type. An apparent decrease of albumin, with an increase of globulin, was also demonstrable by an electrophoretical study carried out simultaneously. 2) Anaemia induced by repeated venepunctures. Though indicated also to be of globulin-type, the <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> type was rather closer to albumin-type than those observec by plasmapheresis.

40|$|Parallel {{programming}} is elusive. The relative performance of different parallel implementations varies with machine architecture, system and problem size. How to compare different implementations {{over a wide}} range of machine architectures and problem sizes has never been well addressed due to its difficulty. Scalability has been proposed in recent years to reveal scaling properties of parallel algorithms and machines. In this paper, based on scalability analysis, the concepts of <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> analysis and range comparison are introduced. <b>Crossing</b> <b>point</b> analysis finds slow/fast performance <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> of parallel algorithms and machines. Range comparison compares performance {{over a wide range}} of ensemble and problem size via scalability and <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> analysis.

Some unusual transport behaviors are revealed. We show that the electrical conductivity takes a Drude form when the Fermi energy $E_{F}$ is above the band <b>crossing</b> <b>point,</b> but a non-Drude form which is a quadratic function of $E_{F}$ when $E_{F}$ lies below the band <b>crossing</b> <b>point.</b> The Mott relation breaks down when $E_{F}$ lies {{in the vicinity of}} the band <b>crossing</b> <b>point.</b> It is shown that the thermopower and thermoelectric figure of merit are strongly enhanced when $E_{F}$ downs below the band <b>crossing</b> <b>point.</b> This enhancement is attributed to not only the one-dimensional-like density of state but also the unconventional intraband elastic scattering below the band <b>crossing</b> <b>point.</b> The differences between these results and those obtained by the relaxation time approximation are discussed in detail.
