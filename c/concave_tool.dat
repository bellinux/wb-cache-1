In order {{to study the}} effect of tool geometry on the joint strength of spot friction welds, a <b>concave</b> <b>tool</b> and a flat tool were used. In {{order to understand the}} effect of tool penetration depth on the joint strength, spot friction welds were prepared with two different penetration depths for each tool. The results indicated that the <b>concave</b> <b>tool</b> produced slightly higher joint strength than the flat tool. The joint strength did not change for the two depths for the flat tool whereas the joint strength slightly increases as the penetration depth increases for the <b>concave</b> <b>tool.</b> The experimental results show that the failure mechanism is necking and shearing for the spot friction welds made by both tools.

40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of rough machining operations can produce significant productivity improvement in mould and die making {{because most of the}} metal is removed in the roughing stage. In this paper, a high-efficiency 2. 5 -dimensional rough milling strategy for mould core machining is presented. The strategy consists of three different tool paths. The first tool path is generated {{on the basis of the}} convex hull boundary of a machining region. Owing to the absence of <b>concave</b> <b>tool</b> path segments, the convex hull based tool path can eliminate the chip load fluctuation problem encountered in corner cutting. The second tool path is an enhanced unidirectional straight-line tool path, which has the virtue of maintaining a steady cutting resistance throughout. The large staircases left behind by these two tool paths are refined by using the third tool path which is a contour-parallel tool path that cuts the mould core layer by layer in an upward manner. After applying these three tool paths, the stock material left on the mould core surface can be post-processed by the subsequent finish milling operation. A case study is illustrated to demonstrate the practicality of the presented rough milling strategy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|This thesis report investigates how the {{parameters}} of friction stir welding tools {{affect the quality of}} welds. Specifically, the joining of 5 mm 6061 -T 6 aluminium alloy with four different tools was carried out and a relationship between tool parameters and weld quality was then determined. The four types of tools include; a flat shoulder with cylindrical threaded pin, flat shoulder with triangular pin, spiral shoulder with threaded triflute pin and concave shoulder with threaded pin. The design of the friction stir welding tools are based on literature reviewed. To analyse the quality of the welds microstructure, bend and hardness tests were conducted. The experimental setup consists of a milling machine with an adjustable spindle speed and transverse feed rate which was used to undertake friction stir welding. The welding parameters of spindle speed and transverse feed rate were kept constant throughout testing which allows only the tool geometry to affect the outcome of the welds. Welds made with the triflute, cylindrical and <b>concave</b> <b>tools</b> were of a satisfactory condition whereas the triangular tool failed. Results from post weld analysis indicate that the triflute and <b>concave</b> <b>tools</b> have a coarse grain microstructure which leads to a lower hardness and a more ductile failure during the bend test. The cylindrical tool resulted in a fine grained microstructure and thus has a higher hardness and brittle failure. The triangular tool failed to produce a satisfactory weld due to failure in the pin which sheared off. Micro crack defects were found in all weld samples as well as a wormhole in welds made using the cylindrical tool and lack of root penetration with the triflute tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{sticking}} {{of a model}} ibuprofen-lactose formulation {{with respect}} to compaction force, punch tip geometry and punch tip embossment was assessed. Compaction was performed at 10, 25 or 40 kN using an instrumented single-punch tablet press. Three sets of 'normal' concave punches were {{used to evaluate the}} influence of punch curvature and diameter. The punches were 10, 11 and 12 mm in diameter, respectively. The 10 -mm punch was embossed with a letter 'A' logo to assess the influence of an embossment on sticking. Flat-faced punches (12. 5 mm) were used for comparison with the <b>concave</b> <b>tooling.</b> Surface profiles (Taylor Hobson Talysurf 120) of the upper punch faces were obtained to evaluate the surface quality of the tooling used. Following compaction, ibuprofen attached to the upper punch face was quantified by spectroscopy. Increasing punch curvature from flat-faced punches to concave decreased sticking. Altering punch diameter of the concave punches had no effect on sticking when expressed as mug mm(- 2). The embossed letter 'A' logo increased sticking considerably owing to the probable concentration of shear stresses at the lateral faces of the embossed logo...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{accurate}} 3 D {{finite element}} simulation of the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process requires a proper knowledge of both material and interface behaviors, but friction, the key phenomenon of this process, is quite difficult to model and identify. According {{to the extreme}} encountered conditions and the highly coupled nature of the material flow, simple tribological tests are not representative enough, so the welding process itself has been utilized in most analyses of the literature, although its complexity has led to use simplified numerical models and approaches. The recent development of more accurate 3 D simulation software, which allows modeling the entire complexity of the FSW process, {{makes it possible to}} follow a much more rigorous inverse analysis (or calibration) approach. FSW trials are conducted on an Al 6061 aluminum plate with an unthreaded <b>concave</b> <b>tool.</b> Forces and tool temperatures are accurately recorded at steady welding state, for different welding speeds. The numerical simulations are based on an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation that has been implemented in the Forge 3 ® F. E. software. The main feature of the numerical approach is to accurately compute the contact and frictional surface between the plate and the tool. A first study using Norton's friction model show the great sensitivity of welding forces and tool temperatures to friction coefficients, the need {{to take into account the}} changes brought to the contact surface by slight friction variations (thanks to the ALE formulation), the possibility to get very accurate calibrations on forces, and the impossibility to properly render the tool temperature profile. On the other hand, the use of Coulomb's friction model allows obtaining realistic temperature profiles and so calibrating a friction coefficient that offers an excellent agreement with experiments, on forces as much as on tool temperatures, for various welding speeds...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIn this work, {{the effect}} of {{different}} parameters, including stacking sequence, part thickness, and tooling material, on distortion of flat panels was investigated. A Romer arm equipped with a laser scanner was used to obtain {{the maximum amount of}} distortion as well as the 3 D pattern of distortion for each panel. Among the different stacking sequences, the maximum distortion was observed in the asymmetric and balanced panel, while the least distortion belonged to the symmetric and unbalanced one. Furthermore, thinner panels were more distorted than thicker panels with the same planar size and stacking sequences. This study showed that distortion of the flat panels caused by asymmetry in the stacking sequence was an order of magnitude greater than distortion of the panels due to imbalance in the stacking sequence. L-shaped and U-shaped panels were also fabricated to investigate {{the effect of}} stacking sequence on spring-in angle and warpage of the panels. Among all the stacking sequences, the panel with an asymmetric and unbalanced stacking sequence showed the least spring-in angle, while the largest angle was observed in the symmetric and balanced panel. Although asymmetry in the stacking sequences reduced the spring-in angle, significantly more warpage was observed in the panels with asymmetric stacking sequences, as compared to the symmetric ones. MSC Marc was used to predict the distortion of the panels, and the simulation results were compared with the experimental results for several stacking sequences of the flat and the L-shaped panels. An L-shaped panel with the stacking sequence of [0 / 45 / 90 /- 45] 4 was simulated to investigate the effect of curve radius and tool geometry on the spring-in angle. The FEA results showed that curing the L-shaped panel on a <b>concave</b> <b>tool</b> led to less spring-in angle, as compared to the panel confined to a convex tool...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{complexity}} of the compaction process specially with using high-speed tablet presses necessitates the use of robust monitoring tools during the process. The use of an instrumented compaction simulator in the early stage of development has a significant benefit for product development and scaling-up. Up to now, in tableting research rare {{attention has been paid}} to the measurement of die-wall pressure. Die-wall instrumentation would be essential to understand the deformation of particles under axial pressure during the compaction cycle. It would be also of great help to investigate particle–die-wall shear stresses or friction, which is the cause of many tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking. Purpose: To investigate the effect of compaction process variables ((pre) compression pressure, speed, ejection angle, tooling shape), formulation variables (filler, lubricant, binder, drug loading), powder physico-chemical properties (particle size and shape, water activity) on the compaction process through radial die-wall monitoring. Common tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking were also investigated. Materials and Methods: Using a fully instrumented compaction simulator, the Presster™ guided by mathematical modeling and experimental design. Materials with different compaction behaviors: viscoelastic, plastic, brittle, plastic/brittle. Results and Discussion: Regarding tablet press parameters, by increasing compaction pressure radial die-wall pressure was increased for all materials (RDP and MDP), while with increasing pre-compaction residual die-wall pressure (RDP) was decreased for plastic materials, whereas by increasing speed maximum die-wall pressure (MDP) was decreased for all materials. Plastic and brittle materials showed increased tendencies for friction because of high radial relaxation. An increasing RDP value during compaction would indicate higher tendency for friction, whereas a high constant value of MDP would provide an evidence for plastic behavior. High compaction force combined with high speed should be avoided to prevent capping. Increasing ejection angle increased friction tendencies and ejection force for powders. Effective Fall Time (EFT) derived from decompression time was a reliable tool for sticking prediction. Moreover, radial die-wall monitoring was a more sensitive tool to detect sticking in comparison to take-off force. Flat shape tooling increased radial die-wall pressure while it was reduced by <b>concave</b> <b>tooling</b> due to more homogeneity in density distribution as well as greater area of contact. However, <b>concave</b> <b>tooling</b> showed higher friction and capping in comparison to flat tooling due to more radial movement for the powder, which resulted in higher densification at the edges in comparison to flat tooling. Concerning formulation variables, additives enhancing the elasticity or weakening the bonds such as lubricants or increasing drug loading promoted the occurrence of capping, while additives improving the mechanical strength such as binders reduced capping. The RDP/MDP ratio was not suitable as a sensitive parameter for the evaluation of lubricants, since it was only changed for plastic and/or brittle materials. Also, MDP was a good predictor for axial pressure transmission to the die-wall. External lubrication reduced the die-wall-compact friction without affecting the deformation behavior of the formulation. High RDP values were not always responsible for capping, because MCC exhibited low RDP values and still showed capping, therefore, other parameters such ER 0 and tensile strength should also be considered. Regarding physico-chemical properties of powders, small / irregular particles acted more plastically at high compression, showed better axial pressure transmission, more porous and stronger compacts, and had higher tendency for friction and sticking than bigger particles. On the other hand, high water activity resulted in a low RDP and friction for all materials, and a high MDP for plastic materials. This was due to the lubricating and plasticizing effects of water, respectively. Conclusion: Radial die-wall pressure monitoring is recommended as a valuable tool to assess the deformation behavior of materials and detect friction and adhesion at early stages of development and during production as well, which would be of great help to predict common scaling-up tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking...|$|R

40|$|Mt. Etna is {{permanently}} active {{requiring a}} continuous data acquisition a multidisciplinary monitoring system where huge data masses accumulate and pose severe difficulties of interpretation. Therefore the INGV staff {{has developed a}} number of software tools for data mining, aiming at identifying structures in the data which {{can be related to}} the volcanic activity and furnish criteria for the definition of alert systems. We tackle the problem by applying methods of clustering and classification. We identify data groups by defining a measure of similarity or distance. Data groups may assume various shapes, once forming convex clouds once complex <b>concave</b> bodies. The <b>tool</b> “KKAanalysis” is a basket of clustering methods and forms the backbone of the tremor-based automatic alarm system of INGV-OE. It exploits both SOM and Fuzzy Clustering. Besides seismic data the concept has been applied to petrochemic data as well as in a combined analysis of gas-emission data and seismic data. The software “DBSCAN” focuses on density-based clustering that allows discovering clusters with arbitrary shape. Here, clusters are defined as dense regions of objects in the data space separated by regions of low density. In DBSCAN a cluster grows guaranteeing that the density within a group of objects exceeds some threshold. In the context of volcano monitoring the method is particularly promising in the recognition of ash particles as they have a rather irregular shape. The “MOTIF” software allows identifying typical wave forms in time series. It overcomes shortages of methods like cross- correlation, which entail a high computational effort. MOTIF on the other hand can recognize non-similarity of two patterns on a small number of data points without going through the whole length of the data vectors. The development includes modules for feature extraction and post-processing verifying the validity of the results obtained by the classifiers...|$|R
