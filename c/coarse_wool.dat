The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's {{fell to her}} feet, and a child's to its knees. The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from <b>coarse</b> <b>wool</b> in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E

60|$|Three {{parts in}} four of the {{inhabitants}} of that district of the town where I dwell were English manufacturers, whom either misfortunes in trade, little petty debts, contracted through idleness, or the pressures of a numerous family, had driven into our cheap country: These were employed in working up our <b>coarse</b> <b>wool,</b> while the finest was sent into England. Several of these had taken the children of the native Irish apprentices to them, who being humbled by the forfeiture of upward of three millions by the Revolution, were obliged to stoop to a mechanic industry. Upon the passing of this bill, we were obliged to dismiss thousands of these people from our service. Those who had settled their affairs returned home, and overstocked England with workmen; those whose debts were unsatisfied went to France, Spain, and the Netherlands, where they met with good encouragement, whereby the natives, having got a firm footing in the trade, being acute fellows, soon became as good workmen as any we have, and supply the foreign manufactories with a constant recruit of artisans; our island lying much more under pasture than any in Europe. The foreigners (notwithstanding all the restrictions the English Parliament has bound us up with) are furnished with the greatest quantity of our choicest wool. I need not tell you, sir, that a custom-house oath is held as little sacred here as in England, or that it is common for masters of vessels to swear themselves bound for one of the English wool ports, and unload in France or Spain. By this means the trade in those parts is, in a great measure, destroyed, and we were obliged to try our hands at finer works, having only our home consumption to depend upon; and, I can assure you, we have, in several kinds of narrow goods, even exceeded the English, and I believe we shall, in a few years more, be able to equal them in broad cloths; but this you may depend upon, that scarce the tenth part of English goods are now imported, {{of what used to be}} before the famous act.|$|E

40|$|Argentina {{is one of}} {{the five}} major wool {{producing}} and exporting countries in the world. Because of the traditionally large proportion of <b>coarser</b> <b>wools</b> in the Argentinian wool clip, wool exports from Argentina have historically been considered a major competitor with New Zealand exports.

50|$|The {{amount of}} crimp {{corresponds}} to the fineness of the wool fibers. A fine wool like Merino may have up to 100 crimps per inch, while <b>coarser</b> <b>wool</b> like karakul may have as few as one or two. In contrast, hair has little if any scale and no crimp, and little ability to bind into yarn. On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp. The relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to breed and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning, felting, or carding into batts for quilts or other insulating products, including the famous tweed cloth of Scotland.|$|R

40|$|Based on cointegration {{analysis}} and monthly data from 1976. 8 to 1999. 10, a long-run equilibrium relationship {{was found to}} exist between prices for wools of 19 to 23 microns, despite the wool Reserve Price Scheme operated until February 1991. Furthermore, the prices for 19, 20 and 21 micron wools {{were found to be}} weakly exogenous. The latter result suggested that, although co-integrated, prices for finer wools tended to be less volatile than <b>coarser</b> <b>wools.</b> The implications are that wool producers would enjoy more stable prices by producing finer wools and that cross-hedging is possible given co-movements of prices. cointegration, error correction model, reserve price scheme, wool marketing., Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R

Merino wools are normally measured on Laserscan instruments in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, although OFDA instruments may also be used in some cases (the results from {{these two types of}} instrument are quite similar). The “coefficient of variation of fibre diameter” (CVD) {{is a measure of the}} variation in fibre fineness within the sample fleece, relative to the average fibre diameter.

Serows have shorter and <b>coarser</b> <b>wool</b> than gorals. The mainland serow is spread across southern China.

5000|$|The Southdowns {{had long}} dark brown or black legs, matured early, {{produced}} {{the best of}} mutton and a fine quality of medium wool. The original Hampshire was larger, coarser, but hardier, slower to mature, with inferior flesh, and a longer but <b>coarser</b> <b>wool.</b> The Southdown had always been remarkable for its power of transmitting its special characteristics to its progeny by other kinds of sheep, and hence it soon impressed its own characteristics on its progeny by the Hampshire. The horns of the original breed have disappeared; the face and legs have become dark, the frame has become more compact, the bones smaller, the back broader and straighter, the legs shorter, and the flesh and wool of better quality, while the superior hardiness and greater size, {{as well as the}} large head and Roman nose of the old breed, still remain. Hampshires of the 1890s matured early and fattened readily. They clipped from 6 to 7 pounds of wool, suitable for combing, which was longer than Southdown wool, but less fine.|$|R
