5|$|In an {{alternate}} story line, Nemo admits to Anna he cannot swim; the two spend time together {{and fall in}} love. Anna {{turns out to be}} Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to New York with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a pool cleaner, hoping to run into Anna by <b>chance.</b> <b>They</b> finally see one another at the train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks him to call her in two days and meet at the lighthouse. However, he loses her number when a sudden downpour makes her note illegible. Nemo waits at the lighthouse every day, but Anna does not come.|$|E
25|$|Reweighted range voting (RRV) is a multi-winner {{voting system}} similar to STV in that voters can express support for {{multiple}} candidates, but different in that candidates are graded instead of ranked.

25|$|Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2009) {{find that}} expert chess players play {{differently}} from college students. With a rising Elo, {{the probability of}} continuing the game declines; all Grandmasters in the experiment stopped at their first <b>chance.</b> <b>They</b> conclude that chess players are familiar with using backward induction reasoning and hence need less learning to reach the equilibrium. However, {{in an attempt to}} replicate these findings, Levitt, List, and Sadoff (2010) find strongly contradictory results, with zero of sixteen Grandmasters stopping the game at the first node.|$|E

40|$|In the Health and Retirement Survey {{respondents}} were asked about the <b>chances</b> <b>they</b> would live to 75 or to 85, and the <b>chances</b> <b>they</b> would work after age 62 or 65. We analyze the responses {{to determine if they}} behave like probabilities, if their averages are close to average probabilities in the population, and if they have correlations with other variables that are similar to correlations with actual outcomes. We find that generally they do behave like probabilities and they do aggregate. Most remarkable, however, is that they covary with other variables in the same way actual outcomes vary with the variables. For example, smokers give lower probabilities of living to 75 than nonsmokers. We conclude that these measures of subjective probabilities have great potential use in models of intertemporal decision making under uncertainty. ...|$|R
25|$|The film {{is notable}} for its avant-garde style, shot on stark high-contrast {{black-and-white}} film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema. The striking black-and-white photography of the film's cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s. When {{the film was}} in its pre-production phase, Coppola asked Burum how he wanted to film it and they agreed {{that it might be}} the only <b>chance</b> <b>they</b> were ever {{going to have to make}} a black-and-white film.|$|E

25|$|Sweating {{dissipated}} heat through evaporation. Early humans, like chimpanzees now, had few sweat glands, {{and most of}} them were located in the palms of the hand and the soles of feet. At times, individuals with more sweat glands were born. These humans could search for food and hunt for longer periods before being forced back to the shades. The more they could forage, more and healthier offspring they could produce, and higher the <b>chance</b> <b>they</b> had to pass on their genes for abundant sweat glands. With less hair, sweat could evaporate more easily and cool the body of humans faster. A few million years of evolution later, early humans had sparse body hair and more than 2 million sweat glands in their body.|$|E

25|$|The more {{moderate}} {{members of the}} Volunteers' Provisional Committee {{did not like the}} idea, nor the way it was presented, but they were largely prepared {{to go along with it}} to prevent Redmond from forming a rival organisation, which would draw away most of their support. The IRB was completely opposed to Redmond's demands, as this would end any <b>chance</b> <b>they</b> had of controlling the Volunteers. Hobson, who simultaneously served in leadership roles in both the IRB and the Volunteers, was one of a few IRB members to reluctantly submit to Redmond's demands, leading to a falling out with the IRB leaders, notably Tom Clarke. In the end the Committee accepted Redmond's demands, by a vote of 18 to 9, most of the votes of dissent coming from members of the IRB.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years before}} their ascent, Grove had {{stood in the}} Hotel Royal in Chamouni (Chamonix), trying to persuade two young ladies and their father, who were using a {{telescope}} to view the peaks around Mont Blanc, that a black dot on the summit snowfield was not a person, but a distant rock some hundreds of feet in height. By <b>chance</b> <b>they</b> espied a real group of climbers, appearing as extremely small dots making {{their way across the}} DÃ´me du GoÃ»ter. Attempting to devise for them some imaginary route by which they might have reached that point, Grove showed them the fine snow crest descending in a gentle curve from the sharp and still unclimbed summit of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. The thought then struck him that an expedition to the summit, with an exit down the eastern ridge towards the easy DÃ´me du GoÃ»ter might actually make a fine undertaking.|$|E
25|$|Wolpoff {{writes that}} Cochran and Harpending {{continue}} to refute conventional wisdom in their {{discussion of the}} Neanderthals. For natural selection to have a <b>chance,</b> <b>they</b> argue, there need to be favourable mutations, or favourable combinations of existing alleles such as genes for blue eyes or pale skin. Cochran and Harpending concentrate on the Neolithic farming revolution {{as the beginning of}} major population expansions that provided enough mutations to accelerate genetic change. Infectious diseases were another consequence of the early urban populations and soon became a new source of selection pressures. The origins of many recently adapted genes have now been traced to this period, creating effects such as regional differences in skin colour and skeletal gracility. Adaptations may have sacrificed muscle strength for higher intelligence and less aggressive human behaviours. By 5000 years ago, the authors estimate that adaptive alleles were coming into existence at a rate about 100 times faster than during the Pleistocene. This is the â€˜â€˜explosionâ€™â€™ of the bookâ€™s title.|$|E

25|$|Although many {{companies}} offer courses in stock picking, and numerous experts report success through technical analysis and fundamental analysis, many economists and academics state {{that because of}} the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) it is unlikely that any amount of analysis can help an investor make any gains above the stock market itself. In the distribution of investors, many academics believe that the richest are simply outliers in such a distribution (i.e. in a game of <b>chance,</b> <b>they</b> have flipped heads twenty times in a row). When money is put into the stock market, it is done with the aim of generating a return on the capital invested. Many investors try not only to make a profitable return, but also to outperform, or beat, the market. However, market efficiency - championed in the EMH formulated by Eugene Fama in 1970, suggests that at any given time, prices fully reflect all available information on a particular stock and/or market.|$|E

On the issue of Patrick Vieira's anticipated move to Real Madrid, Wenger told reporters the player would remain at Arsenal. Wenger acknowledged his team were short on experience {{as a result of}} selling players and missing Vieira, Sol Campbell and Thierry Henry, who all were injured. He considered this to be a disadvantage, but argued [...] "...the younger ones have to be given a <b>chance.</b> <b>They</b> all have to take some responsibility." ...|$|E

However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the [...] "Doughnut Dunkers" [...] and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, [...] "Careful what you drink, Mr. President.

[...] His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.|$|E
