Accomplishments during this project included synthesis and testing of new derivatized sol-gel coatings for surface acoustic wave sensors (SAWs). Surfactant modified and fluoroalcohol derivatized sol-gel oxides were coated onto SAW devices and tested with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Theses modified sol-gel coatings improved SAW sensitivity to DMMP by over three orders of magnitude when compared to standard polymeric oatings such as polyisobutylene and by over two orders of magnitude compared with polymers tailor made for enhanced sensitivity to phosphonates. SAW sensors coated with these materials exhibit highly sensitive reversible behavior at elevated temperatures (> 90 degree C), possibly leading to low detection levels for semivolatile analytes while remaining insensitive to volatile organic interferants. Additionally, we have investigated the use of reactive polymers for detection of volatile and reactive CW agent precursors (Chemical Weapons Convention Schedule 3 Agents) such as phosphouous oxychloride (POCl(3)).

40|$|Participation in {{military}} operations {{is accompanied by}} health hazards resulting from exposure to chemical substances from natural and anthropogenic sources. Historically, focus on toxicological risks {{has been on the}} health effects of exposure to <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>CW</b> A). In recent years the awareness of the importance of health hazards resulting from exposure to other chemicals encountered during military operations has grown steadily. The new era brings new types of operations, mostly outof-area, and new 'threats' including releases of toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) and materials (TIMs) as well as health effects of many chemicals of different nature in the operational environment, including the releases of chemicals with a specific military nature e. g. ammunitions, explosives, pyrotechnics, (jet) fuels, combustion products and pesticides. Although potential health risks from (urban) operations and some of the chemicals contributing to urban pollution are being investigated to some extent, several crucial questions are not yet addressed. Armed forces {{need to be able to}} perform a military-relevant and dedicated risk assessment of toxic materials (other than CWA) under operational conditions during missions and exercises. An improved level of safety and health care for military personnel under operational conditions will enhance combat readiness and effectiveness, and increase the probability of successful mission completion. An additional, non-operational benefit is that the risk of post-deployment illness and disability, resulting from exposures during deployment, will be reduced. The new Technical Group (TG) 262 under the NATO/HFM panel will address the issue of health hazards resulting from exposure to chemicals in order to enable risk management. Special attention will be paid to operational risk assessment and short and long term health effects. The main topics of the TG's activity to be covered in relation to adverse health effects of deployed personnel are: • Urban and industrial pollutants in areas to which military personnel are deployed, such as (contaminated) particulate matter, fuels and combustion by-products from traffic, industrial and residential activities, agriculture-related chemicals and materials, and industrial by- products and waste; • Pollutants originating from military activities, such as bum pits, pesticides and fuels or combustion products thereof. TG- 262 kicked-off in February 2016, will be active until October 2018 and is open to NATO and PfP nations as well as Global Partners of NATO.

The beneficial application of enzyme stabilization in nanostructured materials for use in nerve agent detoxification and pre-treatment is reviewed and discussed in this article. Organophosphorus hydrolyzing enzymes (e. g. OPAA, OPH, Paraoxonase) are capable of detoxifying neurotoxic <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare</b> (<b>CW)</b> <b>agents,</b> i. e. G-type, V-type, and related organophosphorus (OP) -based indus-trial materials.

Novel enzyme-complexed nano-delivery systems, particularly polymeric nanocapsules and sterically stabilized lipo-somes, can be used to carry these metabolizing enzymes to the circulation. Thus, it is possible to avoid the physiological disposition and potential immu-nological reactions of respective enzymes.

Controlled physical damage (removal of the upper 100 ??m skin layer) resulted in significant enhancement of the dermal absorption of all three CW agents. Of the haemostatic products assessed, WoundStat??? was consistently the most effective, being equivalent in performance to a standard military decontaminant (fuller???s earth).

Its use resulted in large nUmbers of casualties requiring prolonged and intensive medical care. Despite Geneva Protocol of 1925, which categorically OOnned the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons in wars, SM has been used in several wars, including the 1 ran- 1 rnq war during the 1980 s, which renewed interest in it. Though, the chemical we'dpons convention was signed by more than 160 counbies in 1993 and was subsequently ratified by several counbies, the threat from this agent persists due to its clandestine usage during war and also by teITOrist groups. There is no effective and specific antido ~ for local and systemic toxicity of SM despite scientific research for more than 75 years.

40|$|Degree Project Thesis, Programme in Medicine. TITLE: Hospital {{preparedness}} {{for chemical}} threats - A pilot study among emergency medicine staff in Gothenburg, Sweden. Abstract 	 Introduction: An impendent exposure to hazardous materials {{has become a}} reality worldwide. Increasing numbers of transportations with loaded chemical agents, the increasing risk of contamination due to an accident {{and the use of}} chemicals in conflicts or terror events, may all result in a disastrous outcome. These events should be managed medically. Hospital preparedness is an important component of a successful management of such events. Aim: To identify hospital staff´s preparedness for chemical threats in Gothenburg, Sweden and to investigate how training affects the knowledge and the willingness to report to work during a chemical event. We also aim to compare the willingness of the Swedish healthcare staff to report to work, to that of the Israeli staff. Method: A validated questionnaire for assessing knowledge and readiness to report to work in a chemical major incident, already used in Israel, was used to study the level of knowledge and readiness among Swedish emergency staff in Gothenburg. Results: The overall level of knowledge was low. There was a positive statistically significant correlation between higher knowledge and participation in any <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare</b> (<b>CW)</b> training program (P= 0. 000). Participation in any CW training program also showed positive and statically significant correlation to a higher willingness to report to work during a CW (P= 0. 036). Discussion: There is a need for improved knowledge concerning chemical threats and its management among the healthcare staff in Gothenburg. Such improvement may be obtained by initiation of training programs. Additional knowledge may also improve staff´s self-confidence to manage a CW event and report to work during such potential occurence. Conclusions: The emergency staff members should be offered regular educational opportunities, targeted to improve their knowledge and willingness to report to work during chemical events. Key words: hospital preparedness, chemical events, report to work, knowledge...|$|R

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is presented}} {{of the major}} methods that are presently available for biomonitoring of exposure to <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare</b> agents, i. e., nerve agents and sulfur mustard. These methods can be applied {{for a variety of}} purposes such as diagnosis and dosimetry of exposure of casualties, verification of nonadherence to the Chemical Weapon Convention, health surveillance, assessment of low level exposures (Gulf War Syndrome) and last but not least for forensic purposes in case of terrorist attacks with these agents. This paper will focus on methods that are based on the analysis of long-lived protein adducts of <b>CW</b> <b>agents</b> which are detectable weeks or even months after exposure. Examples of real exposure incidents will be described. © 2006 Springer...|$|R
