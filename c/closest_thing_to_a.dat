Alex {{introduces}} her mother to Dr. Linus because he's been hurt after being battered by Desmond. Danielle and Alex bring him home for dinner. While Alex is doing her homework, Danielle and Dr. Linus talk about her. She tells him that {{since the death of}} her father when she was two, he's the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> father figure that she has. Dr. Linus is visibly touched.|$|E
25|$|Slate acts as Bete Noire's Chief Examiner, and is {{considered}} the city's best detective. Slate is also the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> police officer in the city. Before coming to Bete Noire, Slate was an officer in a northwestern African city called Maristan, which he says was even more corrupt than Bete Noire, until it was destroyed by a demon and vanished from human memory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} of the mythic past after the creation, Ra dwells on earth as king of the gods and of humans. This period is the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> golden age in Egyptian tradition, {{the period of}} {{stability}} that the Egyptians constantly sought to evoke and imitate. Yet the stories about Ra's reign focus on conflicts between him and forces that disrupt his rule, reflecting the king's role in Egyptian ideology as enforcer of maat.|$|E

25|$|During these investigations, {{numerous}} witnesses {{came forward}} with damning testimony, almost all of which was corroborated by other witnesses. One witness, Captain Silas Soule, who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons, was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony. However, despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars' recommendation, no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre. Chivington was {{beyond the reach of}} army justice because he'd already resigned his commission. The <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> punishment he suffered was the effective end of his political aspirations.|$|E
25|$|The Israelite {{system of}} {{measuring}} area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown {{with a certain}} volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 seahs of barley. The <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> formal area unit was the yoke (Hebrew semed) (sometimes translated as acre), which referred {{to the amount of}} land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.|$|E
25|$|The son of Constantine was T'oros I, {{who succeeded}} him in around 1100. During his rule, he faced both Byzantines and Seljuks, and {{expanded}} the Rubenid domain. He transferred the Cilician capital from Tarsus to Sis after having eliminated the small Byzantine garrison stationed there. In 1112, {{he took the}} castle of Cyzistra in order to avenge {{the death of the}} last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. The assassins of the latter, three Byzantine brothers who governed the castle, were thus brutally killed. Eventually, there emerged a type of centralized government in the area with the rise of the Rubenid princes. During the twelfth century, they were the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ruling dynasty, and wrestled with the Byzantines for power over the region.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{conservative}} Saudi {{women do}} not support loosening traditional gender roles and restrictions, {{on the grounds that}} Saudi Arabia is the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> [...] "ideal and pure Islamic nation," [...] and under threat from [...] "imported Western values".|$|R

25|$|He {{had gained}} near-total control of RKO {{by the end}} of 1954 at a cost of nearly $24million, {{becoming}} the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sole owner of a Hollywood studio seen in three decades. Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions {{thanks in part to the}} limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5million in personal profit.|$|E
25|$|Luis Hernando de Larramendi gained no {{dedicated}} scholarly work; the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> monograph are chapters {{dedicated to}} his father by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, Así se hizo MAPFRE (2000). Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they {{paint a picture of}} a Catholic taking communion almost every day, a profoundly idealist person, extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence. Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect, though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} days, Nakamoto is {{estimated}} to have mined 1 million bitcoins. Before disappearing from any involvement in bitcoin, Nakamoto in a sense handed over the reins to developer Gavin Andresen, who then became the bitcoin lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation, the 'anarchic' bitcoin community's <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> official public face.|$|R
5000|$|In the Ottoman Empire, and as such, the Hakham Bashi was the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> overall Exilarchal {{authority}} among Jewry {{everywhere in}} the Middle East in early modern times.

500|$|Commenting on the platform, Alan Dershowitz wrote, [...] "It {{is a real}} {{tragedy that}} Black Lives Matter — which has done so much good in raising {{awareness}} of police abuses — has now moved away from its central mission and has declared war against the nation state of the Jewish people." [...] He noted that Black Lives Matter is not monolithic and [...] "is a movement comprising numerous groups. ... But the platform is the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> formal declaration of principles by Black Lives Matter." [...] Dershowitz called on [...] "all decent supporters of Black Lives Matter" [...] to demand removal of the paragraph accusing Israel of genocide.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{commercial}} {{impact of the}} album, Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watson wrote, [...] "For a pop star who was once dismissed as being incapable of yielding more than one hit song per album, Rihanna's newfound staying power {{is nothing short of}} remarkable–and proof that there's room for more than one diva in this game." [...] Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic concluded that it was Good Girl Gone Bad that made Rihanna a [...] "full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts". Nick Levine of Digital Spy described the album, as the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Thriller that 2007/08 is likely to produce.|$|E
500|$|Early in the show, {{the actress}} based her {{understanding}} of Eve on the character's relationships with Grace and Ivy Winthrop. Ross described Eve's love for Grace as [...] "my rock in the sea" [...] when Eve took extreme, illegal measures to hide her past. Kim Johnston Ulrich, who portrayed Ivy, felt that her character viewed Eve as her only friend. Ross added that Eve respected Ivy's [...] "ability to take charge" [...] instead of [...] "always tiptoeing around and walking on eggshells". She understood Ivy's schemes to blackmail Eve as an attempt at a deeper connection; as [...] "the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend that Ivy had", Eve interpreted their relationship as a desire for friendship.|$|E

50|$|In Eastern Catholic (non-Latin) churches, {{the office}} of apostolic visitor can be {{indefinite}} and the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ordinary for communities in regions which have not (yet) been organized into any ordinary jurisdiction.

500|$|Simkins {{noted that}} Tillman [...] "rose above the {{handicap}} of his radical views, his obstreperousness, and the insularity of his issues {{to become a}} considerable force in national politics". Historian I. M. Newby deemed Tillmanism the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mass movement {{in the history of}} white South Carolinians, and one that dominated the state for a generation. [...] "To students of black history and racial equality its most striking features are {{the extent to which it}} expressed the desire of white Carolinians to dominate blacks and the fact that much of its unity and force derived from its antiblack racial policies." [...] Tillman's movement took power from the Bourbon Democrats in South Carolina, but a greater price was paid, electorally and in lives, by African Americans.|$|E
500|$|Outside {{mainland}} China, {{a network}} of volunteer [...] "contact persons," [...] regional Falun Dafa Associations and university clubs exists in approximately 70 countries. In most mid- to large-sized cities, Falun Gong practitioners organize regular group meditation or study sessions in which they practice Falun Gong exercises and read (or re-read) Li Hongzhi's writings. The exercise and meditation sessions are described as informal groups of practitioners who gather in public parks—usually in the morning—for one to two hours. Group study sessions typically {{take place in the}} evenings in private residences or university or high school classrooms, and are described by David Ownby as [...] "the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regular 'congregational experience'" [...] that Falun Gong offers. Individuals who are too busy, isolated, or who simply prefer solitude may elect to practice privately.|$|E
500|$|... "She" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slow jam on Goblin, where [...] "Tyler genuinely wrestles with lust." [...] The song features Tyler, the Creator pining [...] "for a gorgeous girl" [...] while [...] "crooner Frank Ocean chimes in with a vocal hook". The track is [...] "delivered with sweetly juvenile expressions of desire, except that Tyler peppers the track with a single-word epithet that would earn him a kick in the groin from any self-respecting woman." [...] HipHopDX's Sean Ryon mused that [...] "even the more subdued songs like [...] "She" [...] with Frank Ocean" [...] embody [...] "Tyler’s middle-fingers-up attitude, as he twists perverted tales of stalking girls and “stabbing Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus” into anathematic odes to unbridled individualism." ...|$|E
25|$|Since Simpson's 1945 classification, the paleontological {{record has}} been recalibrated, and the {{intervening}} years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself, partly through the new concept of cladistics. Though field work gradually made Simpson's classification outdated, it remained the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> official classification of mammals. See list of placental mammals and list of monotremes and marsupials for more detailed information on mammal genera and species.|$|R
5000|$|... "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot", {{also known}} as [...] "I, D'oh-Bot", is the ninth episode of The Simpsons fifteenth season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 11, 2004. This episode represents a milestone {{in the history of}} the series as Snowball II is killed off, which, excluding the death of Homer's mother in season 19's [...] "Mona Leaves-a", is <b>to</b> date the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> actual Simpson family member actually being killed off.|$|R

500|$|Calling the {{character}} the [...] "black sheep" [...] of the Lannister family, TV Guide wrote {{as the show}} premiered in 2011 that [...] "Tyrion sees through all the chicanery and decides the best option is to drink and bed {{his way through the}} Seven Kingdoms." [...] The Boston Globe added that he is [...] "a hedonistic intellectual who can talk his way out of anything." [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "brilliant but low-living" [...] Tyrion is [...] "so well acquainted with the workings of the world he can hardly bear it, the Imp is ... debauched, perhaps, but a truth-teller nonetheless, fighting for his own survival with as much mercy as he can spare." [...] The New York Times went as far as to name Tyrion [...] "the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hero" [...] in the HBO series.|$|E
500|$|Connor {{undergoes}} {{dramatic changes}} in season five. Very much an opposite to his earlier persona, the only features common with his previous self are his protectiveness of loved ones, attraction to older women, and later his fighting prowess. Otherwise he's a prosperous, sweet young man, due to his fake memories of a happy childhood. Jeffrey Bell wanted to highlight Connor's [...] "well-adjusted" [...] mentality for this season. Vincent calls him a [...] "happy" [...] person and liked playing this version more {{because he has been}} playing the [...] "brooding" [...] version {{for a year and a}} half year. The comic book Connor develops in the same direction as he starts emerging a hero still keeping his pleasant personality. Joss Whedon characterizes the comic book Connor as [...] "the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> superhero hell has' because he has powers without any of the weaknesses of the vampire, and is well adjusted. Brain considers him [...] "one of the coolest characters in any series or comics".|$|E
500|$|The song's musical {{structure}} {{is characterized by}} intervals in which the music builds to a potential break, but softly decrescendos instead. As each verse concludes, the song's snapping, electronic rhythm track gradually softens and rippling synth chords repeat throughout the song. Marc Hogan of Spin writes that Diplo [...] "teases us {{with the sort of}} wubba-wubba subwoofer noises that have become inescapable in {{the past year or so}} of pop radio. But he never actually gives in with the full dubstep drop ... the song keeps swelling to one big wave after another, without ever really reaching a single, song-stopping crescendo." [...] Hogan cites the bridge at around the three-minute mark as [...] "the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> climax" [...] on the song, [...] "when the track gets as quiet as it ever has before becoming as lush as it ever gets." [...] Pitchfork Media's Carrie Battan calls the song [...] "an exercise in the power of restraint", commenting that [...] "Diplo shows uncharacteristic subtlety behind Usher's sentiment, with a beat that seems to hang suspended in midair." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the party's independent, [...] "national communist" [...] course, the {{absolute}} control that Ceaușescu {{had over the}} party and the country led to some non-Romanian observers describing the PCR as one of the <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> old-style Stalinist party.
