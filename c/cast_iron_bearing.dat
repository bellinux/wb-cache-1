5000|$|John Danner (March 10, 1823 - April 12, 1918) invented and {{patented}} (May 16, 1876) [...] {{the pivot}} and post revolving bookcase. His bookcase hangs suspended {{from a simple}} <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> which sits {{on top of an}} inner column or post. The revolving mechanism consists of two nesting cast iron cones that provide a precise pivot point supporting the entire weight of the bookcase. The top support suspension design addressed the binding and racking problems of previous bottom bearing Lazy Susan type bookcases. [...] "These cases, with their immense load, revolve with a slight touch of the hand; are noiseless in operation, and will last a lifetime." [...] Originally designed to hold 32 volumes of the Encyclopedia, it is a compact, rotating bookcase.

5000|$|In condemning Bouch's Southesk viaduct for {{defective}} foundations after rigorous testing, Colonel Yolland (the {{head of the}} Railway Inspectorate) {{had also}} stated his opinion that [...] "piers constructed of cast-iron columns of the dimensions used in this viaduct should not in future be sanctioned by the Board of Trade.". Marindin's report noted that [...] " [...] This disaster furnishes a very convincing proof of the unreliability of small cast-iron columns when used for the piers of viaducts in positions where {{they are likely to}} be exposed to any blow or sudden shock [...] " [...] but drew a slightly different conclusion: that [...] "it would be far better in future to avoid any such mode of construction.". Consequently, Marindin stopped well short of requiring any reconstruction of the viaduct to use only wrought-iron columns: [...] "I do not, however, consider that the reconstruction of this viaduct need be objected to provided due care is taken, either by the erection of timber ice fenders or by the substitution of wrought iron rakers of sufficient strength to withstand the blows of the floating ice, to guard the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> columns from any such danger…. And it is worthy of consideration whether it would not be better to increase the width of the spans at the centre of the channel, so as to permit the ice to pass more freely than it does at present." ...|$|E

5000|$|Most machine slides {{for many}} decades, and many even today, were simple-but-accurate <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> linear <b>bearing</b> surfaces, {{such as a}} {{dovetail}} slide or box slide, with an Acme leadscrew drive. With just a simple nut, some backlash is inevitable. On manual (non-CNC) machine tools, the way that machinists compensate for the effect of backlash is to approach all precise positions using the same direction of travel. This means that {{if they have been}} dialing left, and now they want to move to a rightward point, they move rightward all the way past it and then dial leftward back to it. The setups, tool approaches, and toolpaths are designed around this constraint.|$|R

There were at least three designs of bogie carriage in use at this time, namely the original 'knifeboard' open pattern, a closed 1st/2nd class composite with diagonal body planking and a 'curly roofed' suprintendent saloon. There were also a number of Bagnall and Fowler bogie wagons {{left over from the}} abortive Suakin-Berber campaign. By World War One, the closed seven plank bogie wagon using the type (2) chassis above was the most ubiquitous item of rolling stock and a small number of these even remained on site after the closure of the railway system.
