5|$|The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} {{insufficient}} evidence to justify leaving agriculture {{out of the}} NZ ETS until 2015. A submission from the Institute of Policy Studies (New Zealand) and The New Zealand Climate Change Research Institute <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> the delayed entry of agriculture into the NZ ETS would reduce long term competitiveness of the New Zealand economy by supporting industry that can not compete in an emissions constrained world.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> some of the {{illustrations}} are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states {{that many of the}} taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} it was <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> the two former Line E {{stations}} and tunnels {{should be used}} for Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
5|$|By June 1942, Royal Navy commanders <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> {{camouflage}} {{was largely}} unnecessary, {{given that the}} enemy would be using RDF and submarine hydrophones.

5|$|During World War II, {{scientists}} from the United Kingdom, United States and Japan (Unit 731 of the imperial Japanese army) were involved in research into producing a biological weapon from smallpox. Plans of large scale production were never carried through as they <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> the weapon would not be very effective due to the wide-scale availability of a vaccine.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 Derek Briggs and Whittington {{published}} {{a description of}} Anomalocaris, also from the Burgess Shale. Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström suggested that the two animals were related, as they shared lateral flaps with gills, stalked eyes and other features; and he classified them as primitive arthropods, although he <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> arthropods are not a single phylum.|$|E
5|$|In a {{revision}} of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed {{the definition of the}} clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of Triceratops and birds. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and Eoraptor. Padian and May <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> since both Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that they could not be considered inside Dinosauria.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show a lower level of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E
5|$|Koch himself {{believes}} that a considerable part of the poem can be dated to the 6th century.

They <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> they had simply shifted its religious basis as Constantine had done before, and they continued to refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants (Orthodox Christians) as Rûm. Meanwhile, the Danubian Principalities (whose rulers also considered themselves the heirs of the Eastern Roman Emperors) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.|$|E

5|$|President of the RSK Milan Babić {{refused to}} endorse the plan; Milošević summoned him to Belgrade where he, Serb members of the federal presidency, JNA commanders and Bosnian Serb leaders tried to persuade Babić {{to change his mind}} in a 70-hour-long meeting. Despite failing to persuade Babić, Milošević {{arranged}} to have the RSK parliament approve the plan instead. Babić's and Milošević's supporters organized two separate, concurrent sessions of the RSK parliamenteach group proclaiming victory. On 27 February, Babić was removed as RSK president following an intervention by Milošević; he was replaced with Goran Hadžić. Babić opposed the Vance plan because he <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> acceptance of it, and the replacement of the JNA by UNPROFOR, would represent a de facto acceptance of Croatian sovereignty over the territory held by the RSK because the Vance plan treated RSK territory as part of Croatia. Croatia considered the UNPAs part of Croatia and objected to any official recognition of RSK officials within them. It feared the RSK would use the UN mission to consolidate itself within the UNPAs. The Croatian authorities <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> the only parties to the Vance Plan were the authorities in Belgrade, the UN and Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{thought that}} the victory {{at the battle of}} Suipacha {{strengthened}} his perspective, as the Junta would have defeated its enemies. He <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> Moreno's animosity was rooted in the aforementioned mutiny of Álzaga, as Moreno took part in it. The victory was celebrated at the barracks of the Patricians, where the officer Anastasio Duarte, who was drunk, made a toast to Saavedra, as if he was the king of the Americas. Moreno drafted the Honours Suppression decree when he knew about it, which suppressed the ceremonies and privileges {{of the president of the}} Junta inherited from the former office of viceroy. However, Saavedra signed it without complaint. The Regiment of Patricians resented Moreno because of this, but Saavedra <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> it was a disproportionated response to a trivial issue.|$|E
