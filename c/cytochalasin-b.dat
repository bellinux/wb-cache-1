Both polarized light and electron microscopic examination show that <b>cytochalasin-B</b> disrupts existing myofibrils and inhibits the formation of new ones. Discrete Z-bands are not present in treated heart cells and thick, presumably myosin, filaments are found in disarray. These effects are reversible; after <b>cytochalasin-B</b> is removed from the medium, heartbeat recovers and myofibrils with discrete Z-bands reappear.

40|$|Stimulation of the hypogastric {{nerve to}} the guinea pig vas deferens in the {{presence}} of phenoxybenzamine produced an enhanced release of both dopamine-β-hydroxylase (EC 1. 14. 2. 1) and norepinephrine. Addition of colchicine, vinblastine, or <b>cytochalasin-B</b> to the incubation medium caused an almost complete inhibition of release of both the amine and the enzyme. Colchicine and <b>cytochalasin-B</b> produced a blocking effect but did not, however, modify the ratio of dopamine-β-hydroxylase to norepinephrine recovered in the bath fluid.

40|$|Transfer of the melanocyte-specific and lysosome-related organelle, the melanosome, from melanocytes to keratinocytes {{is crucial}} for the {{protection}} of the skin against harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR) [...] our main physiological cutaneous stressor. However, this commonplace event remains a most enigmatic process despite several early hypotheses. Recently, we and others have proposed a role for filopodia in melanin transfer, although conclusive experimental proof remained elusive. Using known filopodial markers (MyoX/Cdc 42) and the filopodial disrupter, low-dose <b>cytochalasin-B,</b> we demonstrate here a requirement for filopodia in melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes and also, unexpectedly, between keratinocytes. Melanin distribution throughout the skin represents the key phenotypic event in skin pigmentation. Melanocyte filopodia were also necessary for UVR-stimulated melanosome transfer, as this was also inhibited by MyoX knockdown and low-dose <b>cytochalasin-B.</b> Knockdown of keratinocyte MyoX protein, in its capacity as a phagocytosis effector, resulted in the inhibition of melanin uptake by keratinocytes. This indicates a central role for phagocytosis by keratinocytes of melanocyte filopodia. In summary, we propose a new model for the regulation of pigmentation in human skin cells under both constitutive and facultative (post-UVR) conditions, which we call the "filopodial-phagocytosis model. " This model also provides a unique and highly accessible way to study lysosome-related organelle movement between mammalian cells...|$|E

Human keratinocytes (HaCaTs) attached to and formed localized deformation {{on the surface}} of highly flexible cholesteryl ester liquid crystals. Cells have shown affinity to the lyotropic phase of the cholesteric liquid crystals which was immersed in culture media. In studying the nature of the attachment, 30 Î¼M <b>cytochalasin-B</b> and 0. 25 Trypsin-EDTA were applied in independent experiments to qualitatively evaluate the force transmitted from the cytoskeletons and adhesion proteins to the liquid crystals substrate. 2 formaldehyde was used to fix the cells and to interrogate the mechanical creep effects in the liquid crystals. <b>Cytochalasin-B</b> reduced the forces exerted by the cells on the liquid crystals indicating that the liquid crystal surface could be used to sense forces generated internally by actin filaments. This study was supported by an additional experiment in which cells attachment was inhibited by the trypsin indicating the forces induced on the liquid crystals by the actin filaments were transmitted to the surface via protein couplings, i. e., focal contacts. Cells morphologies were also distinctly different in both treatments. The study on the creep effects at micro scale showed that a constant stress on the material imposed a regular strain on the material. Liquid crystals has shown stability in response to a constant and long term stress over a period of three days.

40|$|In this study, {{the nature}} of cell {{attachment}} and contraction {{on the surface of}} a shear sensitive cholesteryl ester liquid crystal (LC) was examined. This interaction {{has the potential to be}} utilized as a novel cell force transducing assay. Preliminary studies indicated that cells cultured on the LC induce deformations in the underlying LC layer. This study aimed at determining if those deformations resulted from the weight of the cell or from forces generated within the cell being transmitted to the LC surface by focal adhesions (FA). In order to study this cell-surface relationship, the forces generated within the cell by the actin cytoskeleton were inhibited by treatment with 30 Î¼M <b>cytochalasin-B</b> and cell surface attachment via integrins was broken by treatment of cells with, 0. 25 Trypsin-EDTA. In the study of the morphology changes of cells and their interfacial interactions within the LC were investigated using fluorescence staining of the actin cytoskeleton and Widefield Surface Plasmon Resonance (WSPR) microscopy. Both <b>cytochalasin-B</b> and trypsin treatments caused deformations in the shear sensitive LC surface to decrease and disappear. This indicates that the deformations in the LC were induced by forces generated in the actin cytoskeleton being transmitted to the LC surface via FA. Fluorescent staining of the actin cytoskeleton and immunofluorescent vinculin staining indicated that cells cultured on the soft LC substrate developed a diffuse actin cytoskeleton and vinculin staining revealed FA around the periphery of the cells. These finding were confirmed by WSPR microscopy which indicated that cell surface attachments formed around the periphery of cells grown on the liquid crystals.

Herein, we examined the effects of an insulin-sensitizing drug, troglitazone (TGZ), on glucose uptake and the translocation of GLUT 4 in L 6 myotubes. The prolonged exposure (24 h) of L 6 myotubes to TGZ (1025 mol/l) caused a substantial increase in the 2 -deoxy-[3 H]D-glucose (2 -DG) uptake without changing the total amount of the glucose transporters GLUT 4, GLUT 1, and GLUT 3.

Cellular uptake of silica was monitored by ICP-MS. At non-cytotoxic doses the smallest particles showed a slightly higher fold induction of micronuclei (MNBN). When considering the three SNPs together, particle number and total surface area appeared to account for MNBN induction as they both correlated significantly with the amplitude of the effect. Using nominal or cellular dose did not show statistically significant differences. Likewise, alkaline comet assay and FISH-centromeric probing of MNBN indicated a weak and not statistically significant induction of oxidative DNA damage, chromosome breakage and chromosome loss.

The {{study was designed}} to evaluate the interaction of programmed death- 1 (PD- 1) receptors on CD 4 T cells and programmed death ligand- 1 (PD-L 1) on tubular cells (HK 2 and HRPTEC, primary tubular cells). Co-cultivation of HIV- 1 infected lymphocytes (HIV-LY) with HK 2 s/HRPTECs resulted in T cell apoptosis, uptake of the apoptosed HIV-LY by HK 2 s/HRPTECs, tubular cell activation and HIV expression. <b>Cytochalasin-B</b> inhibited tubular cell HIV-LY uptake and anti-PD-L 1 antibody inhibited HIV-LY apoptosis and tubular cell HIV-LY uptake, activation and HIV expression.

40|$|The GLUT 9 gene encodes a cDNA which {{exhibits}} significant sequence similarity {{with members}} of the glucose transporter (GLUT) family. The gene is located on chromosome 9 q 34 and consists of 10 exons separated by short introns. The amino acid sequence deduced from its cDNA predicts 12 putative membrane-spanning helices and all the motifs (sugar-transporter signatures) that have previously been shown to be essential for transport activity. A striking characteristic of GLUT 9 is the presence of two arginines in the putative helices 7 and 8 at positions where the organic anion transporters harbour basic residues.

40|$|The {{micronucleus}} (MN) test is {{a standard}} procedure in screening for potential genotoxic compounds in vitro and in vivo. Micronuclei originate from chromosomal fragments or whole chromosomes that fail to engage with the mitotic spin-dle and therefore lag behind when the cell divides (Ying and Hickson 2011). The current MN test methodology {{is based on the}} cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assay in which the once-divided cells are recognized by their binucle-ate appearance after cytokinesis block with <b>cytochalasin-B</b> (Fenech 2000). By the MN test combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the genetic contents of the MN can be characterized. The application of FISH probes allows one to distinguish MN originating either from chromosome loss or breakage and to determine the involvement of specific chromosomes and chromosome fragments in MN formation. Using multicolor FISH, the relative contribution of all chro-mosomes in MN formation can be studied, but such studies are scarce (Leach and Jackson-Cook 2001; Norppa and Falck 2003; Hovhannisyan et al. 2008).

A dose-dependent increase of MN frequency was observed by tirapazamine treatment and the hypoxic toxicity ratio was about 130 for SCCVII and 37 for G- 361. The radiation dose-response curves of MN frequency suggested that the interaction of tirapazamine with irradiation appeared to be essentially additive in both cell lines. In contrast, the dose-response curve became steeper by KU- 2285 treatment.

The {{aim of this study}} was to locate the defect in the insulin secretion pathway induced by a LP diet during gestation. The effects of various secretagogues acting at different levels of the insulin secretion cascade were investigated in vitro in fetal islets from dams fed either a normal or a LP diet during pregnancy. Insulin content, insulin secretion and the cAMP content were then measured. Although insulin content of LP islets did not differ from that of control islets, insulin secretion from LP fetal islets was reduced when challenged by amino acids or cAMP enhancers. This reduction did not appear to be related solely to an altered islet cAMP content. An impairment of insulin secretion remained after stimulation of fetal LP islets with either metabolic or nonmetabolic secretagogues. The insulin secretion by LP islets was restored to normal, however, with barium or <b>cytochalasin-B.</b> These findings demonstrate that an in utero isocaloric LP diet impairs insulin secretion of the fetus.

Research has focused on high lipid content of pig embryos {{and its role in}} hypothermic sensitivity, while little re-search has been conducted on structural damage. Documenting cytoskeletal disruption provides information on embryonic sen-sitivity and cellular response to cryopreservation. The objectives of this study were to document microfilament (MF) alterations during swine embryo vitrification, to utilize an MF inhibitor dur-ing cryopreservation to stabilize MF, and to determine the de-velopmental competence of cytoskeletal-stabilized and vitrified pig embryos. Vitrified morulae/early blastocysts displayed MF disruptions and lacked developmental competence after cryo-preservation; hatched blastocysts displayed variable MF disrup-tion and developmental competence. <b>Cytochalasin-b</b> did not im-prove morula/early blastocyst viability after vitrification; how-ever, it significantly (P, 0. 05) improved survival and develop-ment of expanded and hatched blastocysts.

40|$|Human genetic {{integrity}} is compromised by the intense industrial activity, which {{emphasizes the importance}} to determine an "acceptable" genetic damage level and to carry out routine genotoxicity assays in the populations at risk. Micronuclei are cytoplasmatic bodies of nuclear origin which correspond to genetic material that is not correctly incorporated in the daughter cells in the cellular division; they reflect the existence of chromosomal aberrations and are originated by chromosomal breaks, replication errors followed by cellular division of the DNA and/or exposure to genotoxic agents. There are several factors able to modify the number of micronuclei present in a given cell, among them are age, gender, vitamins, medical treatments, daily exposure to genotoxic agents, etc. The cytogenetic assay {{for the detection of}} micronuclei (CBMN: cytokinesis-block micronucleus) is based on the use of a chemical agent, <b>cytochalasin-B,</b> which is able to block cytocinesis but allowing the nuclear division, therefore yielding binucleated and monodivided cells. The micronuclei scoring is performed on 1000 binucleated cells and the starting sample may vary, although most studies are performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes.

40|$|At the Washington “ 2 nd International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing” (25 – 26 March 1999) current methodologies {{and data}} for the in vitro {{micronucleus}} test were reviewed. As a result, guidelines {{for the conduct of}} specific aspects of the protocol were developed. Agreement was achieved on the following topics: choice of cells, slide preparation, analysis of micronuclei, toxicity, use of <b>cytochalasin-B,</b> number of doses, and treatment/harvest times [Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 35 (2000) 167]. Because {{there were a number of}} important in vitro micronucleus validation studies in progress, it was not possible to design a definitive, internationally harmonized protocol at that time. These studies have now been completed and the data were reviewed at the Plymouth “ 3 rd International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing” (28 – 29 June 2002). Data from studies coordinated by the French Society of Genetic Toxicology, Japanese collaborative studies, European pharmaceutical industry validation studies, along with data from Lilly Research Laboratories were used to prepare conclusions on the main aspects of the in vitro micronucleus protocol. In this paper, the consensus agreements on the protocol for performing the in vitro micronucleus assay are presented. The major recommendations concern: 1. Demonstration of cell proliferation: both cell lines and lymphocytes can be used, but demonstration of cell proliferation in both control and treated cells is compulsory for the acceptance of the test. 2. Assessment of toxicity and dose range finding: assessment of toxicity should be performed by determining cell proliferation, e. g. increased cell counts (CC) or population doubling (PD) without <b>cytochalasin-B,</b> or e. g. cytokinesis-block proliferation index with cytochalasin-B; and by determining other markers for cytotoxicity (confluency, apoptosis, necrosis) which can provide valuable additional information. 3. Treatment schedules for cell lines and lymphocytes. 4. Choice of positive controls: without S 9 -mix both a clastogen (e. g. mitomycin C or bleomycin) and an aneugen (e. g. colchicine) should be included as positive controls and a clastogen that requires S 9 for activity when S 9 -mix is used (e. g. dimethylnitrosamine, or cyclophosphamide in those cell types that cannot activate this agent directly). 5. Duplicate cultures and number of cells to be scored. 6. Repeat experiments: in lymphocytes, for each experiment blood from 2 different healthy young and non-smoking donors should be compared. In cell lines, the experiments need only to be repeated if the first one is negative. 7. Statistics: statistical significance should not be the sole factor for determining positive results. Biological meaning should serve as a guideline. Examples of statistical analyses are given.

Tumor cell suspensions thus obtained were incubated for 72 h in tissue culture dishes containing complete medium and 1.0 μg·ml− 1 of <b>cytochalasin-B</b> to inhibit cytokinesis while allowing nuclear division, and the cultures were then trypsinized and cell suspensions were fixed.

40|$|Although {{ionising}} radiation mainly induces DNA strand breaks leading to chromosomal aberrations, {{there are indications}} that it also might induce numerical chromosome aberrations (aneuploidy). The existing data, however, do not provide evidence for a mechanism. To assess the relative sensitivity of the G 1 vs. G 2 cellular targets, whole blood cultures of lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with different doses of X-rays (0. 5, 1 and 2 Gy). The lymphocytes were harvested after <b>cytochalasin-B</b> blockade to allow the selective study of binucleated cells, having undergone only one division in culture. Harvesting was performed at different sampling times (70, 74, and 78 hours). To evaluate the micronuclei, regarding whole chromosomes or acentric fragments, an oligonucleotide probe that recognises the centromeric region of all human chromosomes was used. The relative percentage of centromere- positive micronuclei ranged from 5 up to 18 % depending on the cell cycle stage and on the received dose. Cells exposed during the G 1 phase exhibited a slightly higher frequency of centromere-positive micronuclei than cells that were in G 2 at the time of exposure.

40|$|AbstractStudies of glucose {{transporter}} activity and anti-{{glucose transporter}} (GLUT 1) immunoblots {{were performed on}} different endothelial cell primary cultures (brain capillary, adrenal capillary and aortic) to determine their response to glucose deprivation. Cell cultures were exposed to glucose deprivation (0. 5 mM) for 48 h periods and refed (11. 0 mM) for 36 additional hours. Control cultures were kept in 11. 0 mM glucose {{for the duration of}} these studies. Measurements of 2 -[3 H]deoxy-d-glucose uptake and membrane fraction purification were performed every 12 h during these timecourses. Baseline <b>cytochalasin-B</b> sensitive uptake of 2 -deoxy-d-glucose was near three times larger in brain capillary endothelial cells than in adrenal or aortic endothelial cultures. In all three endothelial cell cultures, 2 -deoxy-d-glucose uptake increased during glucose deprivation, and returned to control values upon refeeding. Aortic and adrenal cortical endothelia expressed the starvation induced increases 12 h sooner than brain capillary endothelia. Return to control values was also 12 h faster in these cultured endothelia. Immunoblot studies showed that in all three endothelial cell cultures the increases in transporter activity during glucose starvation correlate with increased membrane expression of GLUT 1. Quantitative analysis of the anti-GLUT 1 immunoblots indicated that induction of GLUT 1 following glucose starvation was slower in brain capillary endothelia than in aortic or adrenal endothelia. The slower response by brain capillary endothelial cells {{may be related to the}} higher transport rate of glucose in these cells...|$|E
40|$|Catecholamines inhibit {{adenylate cyclase}} in {{pancreatic}} B-cells, but {{the importance of}} the resulting fall in cAMP concentration for the decrease in insulin release remains controversial. Adrenaline caused a dose-dependent inhibition (EC 50 = 5. 7 nM) of insulin release by mouse islets incubated in a medium containing 15 mM glucose. Supplementation of the medium with 500 microM dibutyryl-cAMP or 1 microM forskolin potentiated the effect of glucose on release and attenuated the inhibition by 1 and 10 nM adrenaline; the EC 50 value was increased 2 -fold. The inhibitory action of 100 nM or 1 microM adrenaline was, however, not affected. This apparent change in adrenaline potency was not simply due to the larger rate of release since it was not observed when the effect of glucose was potentiated by <b>cytochalasin-B.</b> However, when the same rate of insulin release as that produced by 15 mM glucose alone was achieved by combining 10 mM glucose and 250 microM dibutyryl-cAMP, the inhibitory potency of adrenaline was unaffected. Intracellular microelectrodes were used to determine whether the changes in B-cell membrane potential brought about by adrenaline are mediated by a fall in cAMP levels. Addition of dibutyryl-cAMP or forskolin to a medium containing 10 or 15 mM glucose increased the Ca(2 +) -dependent electrical activity triggered by the sugar. However, this did not prevent adrenaline from hyperpolarizing the membrane transiently and causing a steady-state decrease in the intensity of the electrical activity.

40|$|Embryo {{survival}} rates obtained after transfer of in vitro produced porcine blastocysts are very poor. This is probably related to poor {{quality of the}} embryos. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine markers for good quality blastocysts. Therefore, we tried to link blastocyst morphology to several morphological and cell biological properties, and evaluated the survival of in vitro produced, morphologically classified, blastocysts following non-surgical transfer. In vitro and in vivo produced blastocysts were allocated to two groups (classes A and B) on the basis of morphological characteristics. The quality of their actin cytoskeleton, their total cell number, their ability to re-expand after <b>cytochalasin-B</b> treatment and the occurrence of numerical chromosome aberrations were studied and compared. In vivo produced blastocysts were used as a control. Our results indicate that the ability of blastocysts to re-expand after cytochalasin-B-induced actin depolymerization was positively correlated with the morphology of the blastocyst, and associated with the quality of the actin cytoskeleton. Chromosome analysis revealed that mosaicism is inherent to the in vitro production of porcine embryos, but also that in vivo produced blastocysts contained some non-diploid cells. In non-surgical embryo transfer experiments more recipients receiving class A blastocysts were pregnant on Day 20 than those receiving class B blastocysts. One recipient gave birth to six piglets from class A in vitro produced blastocysts, providing a verification of the enhanced viability of blastocysts that were scored as `good¿ on the basis of their morphology...|$|E
40|$|The actin {{cytoskeleton}} (microfilaments, MFs) {{accompanies the}} tubulin cytoskeleton (microtubules) during the meiotic {{division of the}} cell, but knowledge about the scope of their physiological competence and cooperation is insufficient. To cast more light on this issue, we analysed the F-actin distribution during the meiotic division of the Psilotum nudum sporocytes. Unfixed sporangia of P. nudum were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and 4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole dihydrochloride, and we monitored {{the changes in the}} actin cytoskeleton and nuclear chromatin throughout sporogenesis. We observed that the actin cytoskeleton in meiotically dividing cells is not only part of the kariokinetic spindle and phragmoplast but it also forms a well-developed network in the cytoplasm present in all phases of meiosis. Moreover, in telophase I F-actin filaments formed short-lived phragmoplast, which was adjacent to the plasma membrane, exactly at the site of future cell wall formation. Additionally, the meiocytes were pre-treated with <b>cytochalasin-B</b> at a concentration that causes damage to the MFs. This facilitated observation of the effect of selective MFs damage on the course of meiosis and sporogenesis of P. nudum. Changes were observed that occurred in the cytochalasin-treated cells: the daughter nuclei were located abnormally close to each other, there was no formation of the equatorial plate of organelles and, consequently, meiosis did not occur normally. It seems possible that, if the actin cytoskeleton only is damaged, regular cytokinesis will not occur and, hence, no viable spores will be produced...|$|E
40|$|We have {{validated}} {{the analysis}} of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and nuclear buds as biomarkers of genomic instability within the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in long-term lymphocyte cultures. Lymphocytes from 20 subjects were cultured in medium containing 12 - 120 nM folic acid for 9 days. Binucleate cells were scored for micronuclei (MN), NPBs and nuclear budding on day nine after 24 h incubation {{in the presence of}} the cytokinesis inhibitor <b>cytochalasin-B.</b> Folic acid concentration was correlated significantly (P< 0. 0001) and negatively (r=- 0. 63 to - 0. 74) with all these markers of chromosome damage. Chromosome damage was minimised at 60 - 120 nM folic acid, which is greater than the concentration of folate normally observed in plasma (< 30 nM). Current evidence suggests that (a) NPBs originate from dicentric chromosomes in which the centromeres have been pulled to the opposite poles of the cell at anaphase and are therefore, indicative of chromosome rearrangement and (b) that the nuclear budding process is the mechanism by which cells remove amplified DNA and is therefore a marker of gene amplification. The strong correlation between micronucleus formation, nuclear budding and NPBs (r= 0. 75 - 0. 77, P< 0. 001) is supportive of the hypothesis that folic acid deficiency causes genomic instability and gene amplification by the initiation of breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles. These results also suggest that the CBMN assay may be a useful model for the study of the BFB cycle which may be one of the key mechanisms for the hypermutability phenotype required for the rapid evolution of cancer cells.

40|$|Keratinocyte {{traction}} forces play {{a crucial}} role in wound healing. The aim of this study was to develop a novel cell traction force (CTF) transducer system based on cholesteryl ester liquid crystals (LC). Keratinocytes cultured on LC induced linear and isolated deformation lines in the LC surface. As suggested by the fluorescence staining, the deformation lines appeared to correlate with the forces generated by the contraction of circumferential actin filaments which were transmitted to the LC surface via the focal adhesions. Due to the linear viscoelastic behavior of the LC, Hooke's equation was used to quantify the CTFs by associating Young's modulus of LC to the cell induced stresses and biaxial strain in forming the LC deformation. Young's modulus of the LC was profiled by using spherical indentation and determined at approximately 87. 1 +/- 17. 2 kPa. A new technique involving <b>cytochalasin-B</b> treatment was used to disrupt the intracellular force generating actin fibers, and consequently the biaxial strain in the LC induced by the cells was determined. Due to the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution (approximately 1 mum) of the LC based CTF transducer, a wide range of CTFs was determined (10 - 120 nN). These were found to be linearly proportional to the length of the deformations. The linear relationship of CTF-deformations was then applied in a bespoke CTF mapping software to estimate CTFs and to map CTF fields. The generated CTF map highlighted distinct distributions and different magnitude of CTFs were revealed for polarized and non-polarized keratinocytes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the genotoxic effects of flunixin meglumine on mice peripheral lymphocytes by in vitro and in vivo/in vitro cytokinesis block micronucleus tests (CBMN). Flunixin meglumine was used at concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL for the in vitro assay and 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg for the in vivo/in vitro assay. Mice were treated intraperitonally twice with a 24 h interval and sacrificed 6 h after the last dose. Cardiac blood was taken and added to the cultures for the in vivo/in vitro test. 21 h after the addition of the test compound for the in vitro test, and after the initiation of incubation for in vivo/in vitro test cytokinesis was blocked with the addition of <b>cytochalasin-B</b> and 20 h later the cultures were harvested. In both test systems, a negative and a positive control mitomycin C (MMC) were also included. The micronucleated binuclear cell (MNBN) frequencies increased after both treatments, however, the differences between the treated cells and the control groups were found to be statistically significant only for the in vitro treatment. The increase was in a dosedependent manner, significant elevations of MNBN cell (p< 0. 05 and p< 0. 001) were observed at concentrations 50 and 100 μg/mL respectively. In addition reduction in cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) was observed in both treatments, indicating cytotoxicity of flunixin meglumine. According to these results, flunixin meglumine is genotoxic in mice lymphocytes treated in vitro, but has not mutagenic activity in vivo under micronucleus (MN) test conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{combined}} radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy in {{the severity of}} cytogenetic alterations expressed as micronucleus (MN) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients treated for esophageal cancer was evaluated. To do this, blood was obtained from 23 and 15 esophageal cancer patients scheduled for chemo-radiotherapy and RT alone, respectively, before, during, and after treatment. Blood samples were cultured in RPMI- 1640 complete medium containing 1 % phytohemagglutinin and incubated in a CO 2 incubator. <b>Cytochalasin-B</b> {{was added to the}} cultures at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Finally, harvesting, slide making, and analysis were performed according to standard procedures. Results indicate that {{there was no significant difference}} between the frequencies of MN in lymphocytes of individuals before being treated with RT alone or chemo-radiotherapy. In the middle of treatment, (after 12 fractions of RT) the frequency of MN increased significantly compared with their concurrent pre-treatment samples in both groups (four-fold). However, the frequency of MN observed for RT patients was not significantly different with those received chemo- and radiotherapy. At the end of treatment, (after 24 fractions of radiotherapy) an increase in the MN frequency was observed for chemo-radiation group significantly higher than RT group (P = 0. 022). Mild increase in MN frequency in lymphocytes of patients receiving chemoradiation only after the completion of treatment course might be indicative of resistance induced by chemotherapeutics to the clastogenic effects of radiation. Therefore, using these agents repeatedly for cancer treatment in combination with radiation might not cause severe adverse biological effects in normal tissues. </div...|$|E
