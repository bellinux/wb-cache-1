5000|$|Eventually, Powderly Creek {{passes through}} the Bushwick <b>silt</b> <b>basin.</b> This <b>silt</b> <b>basin</b> is {{the remains of the}} {{impoundment}} for a washery pool. It is the largest <b>silt</b> <b>basin</b> discovered by the Lackawanna River Corridor Association in their stream walks. The <b>silt</b> <b>basin</b> has an area of 30 acre and is 15 ft deep. The estimated volume of silts and fines is 1.7 million cubic yards. Powderly Creek forms a [...] "macabre" [...] channel through the basin.|$|R
50|$|Downstream of the Bushwick <b>silt</b> <b>basin,</b> Powderly Creek {{passes over}} some {{sandstone}} ledges. At {{a distance of}} 1 mi upstream of its mouth, it enters a trapezoidal riprap channel {{for the remainder of}} its length. Culm and cinder piles form many of the uplands in the lower reaches of the creek's watershed.|$|R
50|$|Powderly Creek (also {{known as}} Powderly Brook) is a {{tributary}} of the Lackawanna River in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately 2.3 mi long and flows through Carbondale Township and Mayfield. The watershed of the creek has an area of 1.77 sq mi. The creek is an impaired stream. It is impacted by flow loss and is also affected by acid mine drainage. Its waters tend to be acidic. The watershed of the creek is in the Appalachian Mountain Section of the Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The main rock formations in the watershed include interbedded sedimentary rock and sandstone. Culm and silt are deposited in the creek's vicinity and it flows through a large <b>silt</b> <b>basin</b> known as the Bushwick <b>silt</b> <b>basin.</b> A major underground coal fire is burning on a hill near the creek.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 1890s, {{shipments}} from Bullo Pill declined, {{and the last}} cargo of stone left the dock in 1926. The lock gates collapsed and the <b>basin</b> <b>silted</b> up. The coal-loading chute was eventually scrapped.|$|R
50|$|In 2015 East Cheshire Sub Aqua Club {{installed}} a 2-metre x 3 metre scuba diving training platform in St Peter's basin further extending {{the use of}} the Salford Quays for watersports, allowing scuba divers to safely conduct training, away from the <b>silt</b> in the <b>basin.</b>|$|R
50|$|Large {{parts of}} the Lackawanna River watershedincluding its upper reaches, the Moosic Mountains, West Mountain, and the North Pocono Plateauare largely forested. However, large areas of urban and {{suburban}} development occur in the river's valley from Pittston to Carbondale, with some urban sprawl reaching as far as halfway from the river to the ridge tops. Abandoned mining land lies between many of the developed areas {{in this part of}} the watershed. Such land contains at least 25000 to 30000 acre of culm banks, overburden piles, <b>silt</b> <b>basins,</b> non-vegetated soil, and degraded waterways. One of the main owners of forested land in the watershed is the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry, which owns the Lackawanna State Forest that straddles the border between the Lackawanna River and Lehigh River watersheds. The Pennsylvania Game Commission also owns more than several thousand acres of Pennsylvania State Game Lands in the watershed. Additionally, there are more than 20000 acre of wetlands in the watershed and another 10000 to 15000 acre historically existed. All of the minor tributaries of the river begin in wetlands in the West Mountains or the Moosic Mountains. Riparian wetlands occur along the lower reaches of the river and a feature known as the Duryea Swamp is located in former mining pits at the river's mouth.|$|R
50|$|Cluny Harbour is {{probably}} still the true heart of Buckie and {{this project was}} built by the Cluny family in 1877 to replace the town's first stone harbour in Nether Buckie which was constructed in 1857 1 mi or so to the west but {{had a tendency to}} silt up and become unusable. The Laird of Letterfourie had contributed £5,000 of the construction costs at Nether Buckie but the main investor with the balance of £10,000 was the Board of Fisheries. The engineers were D.&T. Stevenson of Edinburgh, the family firm of the author Robert Louis Stevenson. It was and remains a very sturdily built edifice with the main walls of considerable thickness being built of quartzite, quarried locally at Strathlene, capped with a very hard type of sandstone which was also used to form the walls at the entrance and of the harbour proper. As regards stability the harbour has remained a monument to engineering science with very little maintenance ever being necessary. It had a design fault, however, in that the entrance opened to the north east and was subject to infill with shingle, moving westwards by longshore drift. Later known as Buckpool Harbour this earlier port became something of an eyesore and eventually the <b>silted</b> <b>basin</b> became overgrown and dangerously swampy. The decision was taken to fill in the basin and this work was undertaken in the 1970s. The resulting park includes a pebble beach and the original quartzite harbour walls remain completely intact.|$|R
5000|$|These two dams {{serve as}} a means to control {{flooding}} of the river as it heads into Tabasco state, but when reservoirs are dangerously full, it becomes necessary to release large quantities of water. This most often occurs in late summer and fall, when rains are heaviest. This water heads to the flat slow draining floodplains of Tabasco, including its capital of Villahermosa and has cause serious flooding problems. [...] In 1970, the <b>silting</b> <b>basin</b> was severely damaged during a flood 20% less than the design capacity. Pressure fluctuations caused the stone slabs to detach from their anchor. The last major floodings related to the Malpaso dam occurred in 2007 and 2008. Unusually heavy rain not only filled the dam to over capacity, flooding about 400 towns around the area in 2007. In 2008, Twenty two communities in the dam area were flooded and when the water finally flowed freely again, major flooding occurred in Tabasco, especially in Nacajuca [...] [...] In 2008, Comisión Federal de Electricidad, the dam's owner, shut down operations at the dam to complete the second stage on a canal project designed to alleviate storage in the dam's reservoir. The canal's construction occurred in three stages and it was dug through a mud slide in between the dam and the Peñitas Dam downstream. At {{the end of the third}} stage, the canal will be able to pass [...]|$|R
40|$|Silt {{deposited}} in the lake ranges in size. Little is {{deposited in}} the east <b>basin.</b> <b>Silt</b> finally gravitates to the deeper parts of the former Molonglo channel, deepest behind the Scrivener Dam. 82 to 96 percent of river borne sediment is {{deposited in the}} dam. Over the next hald century no serious reduction in dam depth should aoccur, requiring restorative action. Only normal routine maintenance will be necessary along the foreshores...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{restoration}} of Blennerville Windmill in the early 1990s it was envisaged that the canal could be restored as a tourist attraction. In 1999 the Office of Public Works (OPW) started a restoration project of the canal {{at a cost of}} IR£650,000. It involved the excavation of the basin, a new swing bridge constructed at Blennerville, the lock gates being restored and the canal being dredged of <b>silt.</b> The <b>basin</b> area of the canal was subsequently redeveloped with apartments blocks built as part of a proposed marina while the towpath along the canal was upgraded and is now used by people as an enjoyable amenity as part of the Dingle Way. Tralee Rowing Club use the canal and have a boathouse at the basin.|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent its}} <b>silting,</b> the {{upstream}} <b>basin</b> {{is equipped with}} more than 200 km² benches, lakes and dams (38 lakes and five earth dams) for an average volume of one million cubic meters. Three decades later, they {{have given way to}} integrated planning. For if it reduces the silting of the dam of El Haouareb, it causes the same time reducing water intake downstream, threatening the exploitation of groundwater in the plain of Kairouan is dependent on the charging of the dam.|$|R
40|$|Lake Macbride is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} top four lakes for fishing in the state of Iowa. It is widely used by the public and contributes significant economic benefits to the county. Lake Macbride is situated in the North Corridor which is one of the fastest growing areas in the state. The lake has a surface area of 940 acres and drains 16, 205 acres. Lake Macbride is on the Iowa 303 (d) list for excessive sediments and nutrients. In 2001, Lake Macbride State Park received over 2. 5 million dollars from the Marine Fuel Tax and Fish and Wildlife Trust to install 2 <b>silt</b> <b>basins</b> and stabilize over 12 miles of shoreline in the lake. Also in 2001, the Johnson County SWCD received a WSPF allocation from DSC to address agriculture and urban runoff issues in the watershed. Section 319 funding was received in 2002 to continue watershed efforts to the present. A watershed assessment was completed in 2003 to guide watershed activities. In 2005, a TMDL was completed for the lake. Since 2001, over 645, 000 dollars has been spent by landowners and funding partners to install conservation practices in the watershed. Watershed efforts have resulted in the reduction of over 4200 tons of soils from being delivered into Lake Macbride. Nutrient reductions have also occurred from the development of nutrient management plans on 2000 acres. The District is in the process of wrapping up watershed efforts on private land. A series of 13 structures is planned to be installed in the State Park over the next several years. One of the last remaining items that still needs addressed is 1, 400 feet of eroding shoreline adjacent to Lake Macbride along Cottage Reserve Road. The road is under the jurisdiction of the Johnson County Board of Supervisors. Both the Board of Supervisors and the IDNR are willing to contribute substantial dollars to address the 250 tons of soil that are being directly delivered to Lake Macbride each year...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the River Bartala to study the principal hydrodynamic factors causing the deposition of suspended particles in brackishwater fish farms during exchange of tidal water. Relationship between (i) marginal velocity and tidal height, (ii) width of deposition and tidal height, (iii) width of deposition and tidal time have been established. With {{the help of the}} above equations and the non-linear statistical <b>curve</b> between <b>silt</b> ingress and tidal time fitted earlier by the authors, the relationship between silt deposition in the feeder canal and tidal time has been established. That the equation, the first of its kind, is very useful in estimating the ratio of silt deposition in pond and canal of the brackish-water farm has been demonstrated. The methodology developed will be immensely helpful in estimating the life of a brackishwater fish farm, the knowledge of which is vitally essential for its scientific designing...|$|R

The paper describes a mechanism of carrying out these sediments into natural water basins (rivers and lakes) while the water being pumped by pumping stations. Measures for increasing strength of canal slopes performing under a changeable level regime are proposed in the paper. The paper contains methodology for determination of allowable rates of lowering a water level in the river-bed during pumping process. In order to prevent <b>basin</b> <b>silting</b> it is suggested toform settling ponds at polder systems. The methods for determination of ponds’ parameters are presented in the paper.  </p...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} mass balance of {{phosphorus}} in the forline water reservoir Švihov in Želivka river. Retention dams Němčice, Trnávka and Sedlice were built {{to protect the}} main water reservoir Švihov. Samples for determination of total phosphorus were within the water management monitoring collected and subsequently processed by laboratory staff of Prague state enterprice Vltava River. Monthly flows on inputs and outputs for each tank were obtained from limnigrafice stations. From those dates, which were provided by the state enterprise Vltava River, they were calculated by mass balance of phosphorus in individual tanks. In term of retention of efficacy of those nutrients ballasts tank is in the range 23 - 48 % of the deposited phosphorous. Retention dams favorably influence the quality of surface water, and that transform the incoming nutrients and trap <b>silt</b> from the <b>basin,</b> which are thus not deposited in the water reservoir itself...|$|R
40|$|Lake Sfanta Ana {{is one of}} {{the most}} emblematic {{lacustrine}} complexes of our country. In this context, its monitoring is not only necessary but also compulsory. The study of its evolution and the forecasts are done easier because we have had hydrotopometric highs for about 100 years, even if the frequency of evaluations has not been periodical. The morphometric elements have had a normal evolution, of continuous diminution, specific to lacustrine complexes. The modification rates of the morphometric parameters are different, but they all highlight the necessity of taking urgent measures of protection, in order to slow down the filling speed of the lake <b>basin.</b> <b>Silting</b> is fast due to anthropic influences. The tourism activity produces, direct and indirectly, alluviums that reach inside the lake, due to the processes occurred on the slopes of the crater. We must find a modus vivendi, which is possible in theory, so that tourism and environment protection may “live together ” in harmony...|$|R
50|$|The primaeval Danube first <b>silted</b> up the <b>basin</b> of the Pannonian Sea {{which now}} forms the Eastern Slovak Lowland {{on the left}} {{bank of the river}} and the Little Hungarian Plain on the right bank. It flowed towards the south into Transdanubia and then {{followed}} the present-day course of the Drava into an interior lake system in the south of the present Great Plain. Later the Danube was diverted to the east by tectonic uplift, finding an outlet through the Visegrád gap. During the Quaternary the Great Plain continued to sink, meanwhile the Börzsöny and the Visegrád mountains were rising. The result was the gorge, or a 200 to 300 m deep terraced valley cut through the mountains by the Danube at what is now the Danube Bend at Visegrád, between Esztergom and Vác. Once through the gorge, the Danube fanned out into the Great Hungarian Plain, depositing alluvial cones. The present north-south course was formed by the river in the late Pleistocene.|$|R
5000|$|Sedimentation {{began in}} the Caradoc (upper Ordovician, [...] ). During the Llandovery, the Stockdale Supergroup {{is marked by a}} number of oxic-anoxic transitions, with black shales {{corresponding}} to transgressions - these may have helped to mitigate a runaway greenhouse effect.The rate of sediment accumulation accelerated with time; it held fairly steady at a low ~50 metres per million years (m/Ma) until the Wenlock (mid Silurian, [...] ), when it increased greatly, eventually reaching over 1000 m/Ma when the record is terminated by erosion in the Pridoli (terminal Silurian, [...] ). This sudden upturn in deposition rate {{is a result of the}} increasing proximity of the Avalon mountain belt, which started to depress the plate from the Ordovician, but was not close enough to increase the sedimentary input until the Silurian. The latest phase of sedimentation reflected a change in the basin's state. Instead of being underfilled, and trapping all sediment that flowed into it, it became overfilled. This was reflected by a shallowing of water depth, as the <b>basin</b> <b>silted</b> up. This culminated with a transition to terrestrial conditions in the Přídolí.|$|R
40|$|The {{researches}} on {{the mechanical}} characteristic and constitutive models of frozen soil have important meanings in structural design of deep frozen soil wall. In the present study, the triaxial compression and creep tests {{have been carried}} out, and the mechanical characteristic of frozen silt is obtained. The experiment {{results show that the}} deformation characteristic of frozen silt is related to confining pressure under conventional triaxial compression condition. The frozen silt presents strain softening in shear process; with increase of confining pressure, the strain softening characteristic gradually decreases. The creep <b>curves</b> of frozen <b>silt</b> present the decaying and the stable creep stages under low stress level; however, under high stress level, once the strain increases to a critical value, the creep strain velocity gradually increases and the specimen quickly happens to destroy. To reproduce the deformation behavior, the disturbed state elastoplastic and new creep constitutive models of frozen silt are developed. The comparisons between experimental results and calculated results from constitutive models show that the proposed constitutive models could describe the conventional triaxial compression and creep deformation behaviors of frozen silt...|$|R
40|$|The global {{character}} of the time interval known as the Little Ice Age (LIA) is at present relatively well established. However, the forcing mechanisms behind this cooling interval are still elusive. Investigations in annually laminated sediments have shown that varved sediments {{are among the best}} climate archives to tackle these questions. Proglacial Lago Frías in northern Patagonia is fed by the Tronador ice cap (3554 m). Previous investigations have shown that this glacier has reacted sensitively to climate change during the LIA, with well-identified major glacial advances between AD 1800 – 1850. Results of a multiproxy study of Lago Frías sediments reflect variations in the transport of glacially derived clay and <b>silt</b> to the <b>basin</b> that can be directly linked to changes in climate. Sedimentological evidence combined with a chronological model indicate variations in varve thicknesses showing two frequencies centered at 16. 4 and 10. 5 years that have been previously attributed to the solar cycles and the Tropical Atlantic Sea Surface Dipole (TAD), respectively. The main frequency is, however, located between 2. 5 and 3. 0 years pointing towards a dominant El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal. Thus, the Lago Frías record provides new insights about the complexity of the various forcing mechanisms behind the cooling during the LIA in an area with a paucity of high-resolution climate records...|$|R
50|$|With the {{formation}} of the Falkland Plateau and Cape Fold Mountain ranges, rivers from the south began to dominate the sedimentation in the Karoo Sea, which began to silt up. (The highlands {{to the north of the}} Karoo Sea had, by this time, been leveled by erosion and begun to be buried under newer sediments.) Several Mississippi-like rivers flowed over the <b>silted</b> up Karoo <b>Basin</b> from the south, creating rich new habitats for a variety of flora and fauna. The terrestrial (as opposed to lacunar or marine) deposits created by these rivers gave rise to the Beaufort Group. It is composed of a monotonous sequence of shales and mudstones, with some interbedded lenticular sandstones. The Beaufort Group is rich in reptilian, and to a lesser extent, amphibian remains. There is a plethora of both herbivorous and carnivorous reptile fossils. The Beaufort rocks are internationally famous for its rich record of therapsid synapsids (mammal-like reptiles), which mark an intermediary stage in the evolution of the mammals from reptiles. The most abundant herbivores were the anomodonts, whose most primitive forms are also known from the Beaufort rocks. The dinocephalians (terrible head) are so named because of their extraordinary thick boned skulls, which were probably used for head butting during territorial fights. With their 3-meter body length, they were the first large animals to live on land.|$|R
40|$|The {{consolidation}} {{settlement of}} a structure {{founded on a}} normally consolidated soil can be calculated from {{the knowledge of the}} compression index C-c. The value of C-c is usually obtained from the laboratory oedometer test {{on the assumption that the}} void ratio (e) -logarithm of pressure (log sigma'(nu)) plot is linear. While the literature reveals that in the case of highly plastic clays the plots are concave upwards with their C-c (computed between successive load increments) decreasing with an increase in sigma'(nu), little is known regarding soils that are less plastic, in particular, silty soils. This paper reports the e-log sigma'(nu) plots of clays and silts. It was found that the e-log sigma'(nu) <b>curves</b> of the <b>silts</b> are not linear but are convex upwards. This results in an increase in C-c with an increase in sigma'(nu). Convex curves are to be regarded as a normal feature in such soils and can be explained from consideration of the mechanical and physicochemical factors that govern the compressibility of clays. These factors establish that C-c increases with sigma'(nu) for those soils whose compressibility behavior is governed by mechanical factors, in contrast to soils like very plastic clays whose compressibility behavior is governed by physicochemical factors. In the latter, C-c decreases with an increase in the consolidation pressure...|$|R
40|$|The Site is {{a former}} dry {{cleaning}} operation where a release of perchloroethylene (PCE) to soil and groundwater had occurred. Hydrogen Release Compound® (HRC) is being used for source control to mitigate vapor intrusion to the existing building. The Site {{is located in the}} Connecticut River basin with PCE up to 250 mg/L in perched groundwater above a silt-layer aquitard. Site risk is driven by the soil vapor intrusion pathway into the commercial building. Soil vapor extraction was implemented to mitigate vapor intrusion, with no appreciable change in the perched groundwater conditions and rapid rebound of PCE in soil gas to pre-treatment levels in four months. Our evaluation of soil data following multiple HRC applications over an 8 -year period into the perched groundwater on top of a Connecticut River <b>basin</b> <b>silt</b> deposit finds that treatment in the sandy unit above the aquitard achieved significant reduction of PCE in the silt layer below. This discovery changed the project Conceptual Site Model and led to further evaluation of the source of PCE feeding into soil gas. With decreased groundwater concentrations of PCE but persistent soil gas concentrations, Membrane Interface Probe (MIP) work was done to further assess the extent of additional area within the perched groundwater that required treatment. The results indicated that the extent of significant concentrations of PCE was in a peripheral area around the initial treatment zones. Following the MIP results, additional in-situ HRC treatment in the perched aquifer over a broader area than previous injections was implemented with the intent of removing a significant mass of PCE. As we expected, there was a PCE source in the silt layer below the treatment area. Subsequent data show further decreases in PCE concentrations measured in perched groundwater and soil gas...|$|R
