5000|$|The {{enduring}} {{popularity of}} the silent medium in Japanese cinema owed in great part to {{the tradition of the}} benshi, a live narrator who performed as accompaniment to a film screening. As director Akira Kurosawa later described, the benshi [...] "not only recounted the plot of the films, they enhanced the emotional content by performing the voices and sound effects and providing evocative descriptions of events and images on the screen.... The most popular narrators were stars in their own right, solely responsible for the patronage of a particular theatre." [...] Film historian Mariann Lewinsky argues,The end of silent film in the West and in Japan was imposed by the industry and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution.... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn't lack anything, least in Japan, where there was always the human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not better, just more economical. As a cinema owner you didn't have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.By the same token, the viability of the benshi system facilitated a gradual transition to sound—allowing the studios to spread out the capital <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> and their directors and technical crews time to become familiar with the new technology.The Mandarin-language Gēnǚ hóng mǔdān ( [...] , Singsong Girl Red Peony), starring Butterfly Wu, premiered as China's first feature talkie in 1930. By February of that year, production was apparently completed on a sound version of The Devil's Playground, arguably qualifying it as the first Australian talking motion picture; however, the May press screening of Commonwealth Film Contest prizewinner Fellers is the first verifiable public exhibition of an Australian talkie. In September 1930, a song performed by Indian star Sulochana, excerpted from the silent feature Madhuri (1928), was released as a synchronized-sound short, the country's first. The following year, Ardeshir Irani directed the first Indian talking feature, the Hindi-Urdu Alam Ara, and produced Kalidas, primarily in Tamil with some Telugu. Nineteen-thirty-one also saw the first Bengali-language film, Jamai Sasthi, and the first movie fully spoken in Telugu, Bhakta Prahlada. In 1932, Ayodhyecha Raja became the first movie in which Marathi was spoken to be released (though Sant Tukaram was the first to go through the official censorship process); the first Gujarati-language film, Narsimha Mehta, and all-Tamil talkie, Kalava, debuted as well. The next year, Ardeshir Irani produced the first Persian-language talkie, Dukhtar-e-loor. Also in 1933, the first Cantonese-language films were produced in Hong Kong—Sha zai dongfang (The Idiot's Wedding Night) and Liang xing (Conscience); within two years, the local film industry had fully converted to sound.

The answer depends on the balance between <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> to other uses and the net benefits produced in economic growth, poverty alleviation, and protection of the environment. The first section on Imperata economics sets up the analytical framework {{to address this question}} and draws on the wider development economics literature to consider whether growth and poverty alleviation are conflicting or complementary objectives.

The second section on Imperata policy reviews whether policy distortions and market failures provide a sufficient rationale for direct policy intervention to promote tree planting on Imperata grasslands.

40|$|Lack of {{data and}} {{knowledge}} of the transition to and the economics of organic vegetable production is often cited as a major reason why farmers have been reluctant to convert to organic systems with vegetables. This paper outlines the initial results of a DEFRA funded project investigating the economic implications of conversion to organic vegetable production. Whole farm financial data has been collected and analysed for a group of 5 farms from 1996 - 2001. The findings show that net farm income declined by an average of 66 % during conversion, although it recovered to within 36 % of pre-conversion levels once organic vegetable production began. This was a result of falls in output and smaller overall reductions in costs. In contrast costs of casual labour rose sharply following conversion. The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion,</b> for this group of farms, is estimated at a total of £ 556 /ha in comparison with organic aid payments available at £ 450 /ha over 5 yrs.

40|$|The {{vegetable}} market {{is one of}} the largest sectors within the UK organic food market. This market grew by 30 % per annum in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s, although it is now slowing down to a rate of 10 - 15 % per annum. This growth has been caused by a greater consumer awareness of food safety, health and environmental issues and has been further stimulated by the increased presence of the multiple retailers in the market. In contrast, the production of UK organic vegetables has been slower and constrained due to the time it takes growers to convert land to organic production, by lack of knowledge of organic systems and higher <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> faced by many vegetable growers. However, by the year 2000, growers had responded to improved economic and policy incentives, and now the UK is 58 % self sufficient in organic vegetables.

40|$|In 2012, the European Commission (EC) {{launched}} the Bioeconomy Strategy and Action Plan {{with the objective}} of establishing a resource efficient and competitive society that reconciles food security with the sustainable use of renewable resources. This report contributes to the plan by evaluating the macroeconomic impacts of bio-based applications in the EU. Such effects can only be evaluated with a computable general equilibrium model such as MAGNET. Four bio-based applications are considered, namely biofuel (second generation), biochemicals, bioelectricity, and biogas (synthetic natural gas). This is done assuming that 1 EJ lignocellulose biomass is converted into fuel, chemicals, electricity and gas and that the final product replaces an equal amount of conventional (e. g. fossil energy) product (on energy basis). The results show that given the assumed efficiency of conversion technology, <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion,</b> biomass price and oil price, the production of second generation biofuel and biochemicals are the only competitive sectors compare to their conventional counterparts in the year 2030 for the EU.

A substantial part of this impact {{can be explained by the}} increase in wages, since the production of biomass is relatively labour intensive.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Relational databases have proved inadequate for supporting new classes of applications, and as a consequence, {{a number of new}} approaches have been taken (Blaha 1998), (Harrington 2000). The most salient alternatives are denormalisation and conversion to an object-oriented database (Douglas 1997). Denormalisation can provide better performance but has deficiencies with respect to data modelling. Object-oriented databases can provide increased performance efficiency but without the deficiencies in data modelling (Blaha 2000). Although there have been various benchmark tests reported, none of these tests have compared normalised, object oriented and de-normalised databases. This research shows that a non-normalised database for data containing type code complexity would be normalised in the process of conversion to an objectoriented database. This helps to correct badly organised data and so gives the performance benefits of de-normalisation while improving data modelling. The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> from relational databases to object oriented databases were also examined. Costs were based on published benchmark tests, a benchmark carried out during this study and case studies. The benchmark tests were based on an engineering database benchmark. Engineering problems such as computer-aided design and manufacturing have much to gain from conversion to object-oriented databases. Costs were calculated for coding and development, and also for operation. It was found that conversion to an object-oriented database was not usually cost effective as many of the performance benefits could be achieved by the far cheaper process of de-normalisation, or by using the performance improving facilities provided by many relational database systems such as indexing or partitioning or by simply upgrading the system hardware. It is concluded therefore that while object oriented databases are a better alternative for databases built from scratch, the conversion of a legacy relational database to an object oriented database is not necessarily cost effective...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{reduction}} of environmental contaminants {{that contribute to}} smog and soot is a worldwide goal that has seen an increased focus in recent years. In the United States, for example, {{it is estimated that}} by 2014 new rules will lead to a 71 % {{reduction of}} sulfur dioxide emissions and 52 % of nitrogen oxide emissions as compared to 2005 level. Thus, medium-sized plants (100 - 500 MW) that currently do not have flue gas desulfurization (FGD) units or selective catalytic reduction systems (SCRs) will be required to adapt. Similar emission reduction efforts are expected to be adopted globally, albeit at different levels. Wet-scrubber FGD is characterized {{as one of the most}} effective SO 2 removal techniques with low operating costs. However capital cost for implementation is considered high. Hence an effective optimization procedure is required to reduce these capital <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion.</b> Power plants commonly use a lime slurry spray reaction to reduce SO 2 emissions. Control of the droplets throughout the tower geometry is essential to ensuring maximum reduction while minimizing scale. The liquid slurry is known to have density, surface tension and viscosity values that deviate from standard water spray characteristics, which complicates process optimization. In order to improve the scrubber, nozzle characteristics and placement must be optimized to reduce the cost of the system implementation and mitigate risks of inadequate pollution reduction. A series of large flow rate, hydraulic, hollow cone sprays were investigated for this study. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to examine potential scrubber designs for optimization of the system. Nozzle parameters were modeled to allow particle tracking through the system. An ANSYS Fluent Lagrangian particle tracking method was used with heat and mass transfer. The alkaline sorbent material and SO 2 reaction is modeled to determine uniformity and efficacy of the system. Volumetric chemistry mechanisms were used to simulate the reaction. These results demonstrate the expected liquid-gas interaction relative to the system efficiency. Drop size, liquid rheology, and spray array layout were examined to achieve SO 2 removal above 90 %. Wall impingement and flow pattern results were evaluated due to their impact in minimizing equipment plugging and corrosion required as for long-term scrubber utilization...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{combustion}} {{has increasingly}} {{been used in}} pulverised fuel coal fired power stations {{as a way of}} addressing a wide range of emissions reduction targets. The reuse of existing equipment such as coal mills is essential to minimise the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion.</b> However the fundamental fracture mechanics involved in biomass comminution are completely different to coal. Thus a thorough knowledge of the comminution properties of all biomass types in coal and biomass mills is necessary in order to minimise operational issues and to optimise milling and combustion. This thesis provides extensive novel characterisation on densified biomass before and after milling. The study analysed 9 densified biomasses, 2 non-densified biomasses, and a sample coal in five different mills; planetary ball mill, Hardgrove Grindability Index testing mill, Bond Work Index ball mill, cutting mill, and a ring-roller mill. Milling was found to have little impact on particle shape, even when an order of magnitude change in particle size was observed. Particle shape is inherent to the particles which comprise a pellet, and is determined by the pre-densified comminution processes. Milling had little impact on compositional particles of herbaceous or wood pellets. Olive cake had the most spherical of all the materials. Thermal pre-treatments of woody biomass not only saw a significant improvement in grindability in all mills, but also enhanced shape factors. The Hardgrove Grindability Index is a poor indicator of the grindability of biomass. The Bond Work Index can be used to analyse the choking potential of biomass pellets prior to full scale mill trials. To optimise milling in coal mills, biomass pellets should be composed of particles close to the required size so that only the pellet comminution stage occurs. The milling behaviour of densified biomass in a laboratory scale ring-roller mill with dynamic classification was investigated for the first time. The milling studies showed that knowledge of a materials critical particle size for comminution through compression is essential to understand its milling behaviour in different mills. The results presented in this thesis not only provide new insight and addresses significant gaps in knowledge, they also provide useful and practical guidance for addressing operational issues such as mill choking, as well as ways to optimise biomass comminution in laboratory and full scale mills, such as mill classifier optimisation based on real particle characteristics...|$|E
