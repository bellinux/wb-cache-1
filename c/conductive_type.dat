40|$|OBJECTIVES: Mutations in EYA 4 {{can cause}} nonsyndromic {{autosomal}} dominant sensorineural hearing impairment (DFNA 10) or a syndromic variant with hearing impairment and dilated cardiomyopathy. A mutation in EYA 4 {{was found in}} a Dutch family, causing DFNA 10. This study is focused on characterizing the hearing impairment in this family. DESIGN: Whole exome sequencing was performed in the proband. In addition, peripheral blood samples were collected from 23 family members, and segregation analyses were performed. All participants underwent otorhinolaryngological examinations and pure-tone audiometry, and 12 participants underwent speech audiometry. In addition, an extended set of audiometric measurements was performed in five family members to evaluate the functional status of the cochlea. Vestibular testing was performed in three family members. Two individuals underwent echocardiography to evaluate the nonsyndromic phenotype. RESULTS: The authors present a Dutch family with a truncating mutation in EYA 4 causing a mid-frequency hearing impairment. This mutation (c. 464 del) leads to a frameshift and a premature stop codon (p. Pro 155 fsX). This mutation is the most N-terminal mutation in EYA 4 found to date. In addition, a missense mutation, predicted to be deleterious, was found in EYA 4 in two family members. Echocardiography in two family members revealed no signs of dilated cardiomyopathy. Results of caloric and velocity step tests in three family members showed no abnormalities. Hearing impairment was found to be symmetric and progressive, beginning as a mid-frequency hearing impairment in childhood and developing into a high-frequency, moderate hearing impairment later in life. Furthermore, an extended set of audiometric measurements was performed in five family members. The results were comparable to those obtained in patients with other sensory types of hearing impairments, such as patients with Usher syndrome type IIA and presbyacusis, and not to those obtained in patients with (cochlear) <b>conductive</b> <b>types</b> of hearing impairment, such as DFNA 8 / 12 and DFNA 13. CONCLUSIONS: The mid-frequency hearing impairment in the present family was found to be symmetric and progressive, with a predominantly childhood onset. The results of psychophysical measurements revealed similarities to other conditions involving a sensory type of hearing impairment, such as Usher syndrome type IIA and presbyacusis. The study results suggest that EYA 4 is expressed in the sensory cells of the cochlea. This phenotypic description will facilitate counseling for hearing impairment in DFNA 10 patients...|$|R

Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis and particle size determination reveal the formation of micron-sized particles, probably by the agglomeration of nanoparticles of LaNiO 3.

LaNiO 3 does not show much activity for methanol oxidation. However, a synergistic effect is observed when LaNiO 3 is mixed with small amounts of Pt/C. The increased oxidation current due to the addition of LaNiO 3 to small amounts of Pt/C in the three mixtures containing LaNiO 3 is attributed to either the additional catalyst site of the perovskite in addition to the Pt site, or the removal of CO poisoning on the Pt surface by the surface oxygen of the adjacent perovskite...|$|R

In simulations of ELMs in the convective ELM regime, in the ITER Q = 10 scenario, the ELM footprint broadening is due to filaments being expelled from the plasma.

40|$|The {{strength}} of the spin-orbit interaction relevant to transport in a low dimensional structure depends critically on the relative geometrical arrangement of current carrying orbitals.

30|$|In {{generating}} {{and testing}} models, {{an important consideration}} is how the anisotropy {{is applied to the}} background 1 D isotropic profile. There are three ways to impose anisotropy (Fig.  1). The first maintains the background model as the most conductive direction and forms a more resistive model (by a factor of α) for the orthogonal direction (type 1). The second approach is to split the anisotropy in half between the two axis directions by subtracting resistivity from one direction and adding to the other such that the total conductivity split is a factor of α, centered on the background profile (type 2). The third possibility is the opposite of type 1, where the background model follows the most resistive direction and the imposed anisotropy results in a layer that is more <b>conductive</b> (<b>type</b> 3). Because MT is less sensitive to resistive layers, changes to the model to make it more conductive have a more significant and pronounced effect on the response.

40|$|Designers that adopt {{composite}} {{materials for the}} skin of aerospace structures must verify that their systems guarantee an equivalent level of protection against lightning strikes {{with respect to the}} ones that adopt traditional metallic skins. In particular, the design must ensure that lightning strikes do not cause critical damages to structures, systems, and payload. This section introduces the references for requirements and specifications of lightning protection issues involving aerospace systems. Moreover, the physics of the lightning is documented, that is, the way a strike can be generated. Also the analytical models of the lightning are reported considering all the significant terms involved. The effect of lightning strikes on the aerospace structures is discussed. They can be divided into two main categories, such as direct effects, that is, the ones that produce a direct physical damage on a vehicle, and indirect effects, that is, the ones produced by the currents induced by the magnetic fields of the strike that are determined in proximity of the skin of an aerospace platform. Finally, the methods adopted for protection of aerospace systems having skins made of {{composite materials}} against the effects of lightning strikes are presented, considering both <b>conductive</b> and nonconductive <b>types</b> of composite...|$|R
