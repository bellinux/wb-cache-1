5|$|Block 2: {{infantry}} {{block with}} one retractable mixed-arms turret, one AM <b>cloche,</b> one GFM-B <b>cloche</b> and one GFM-B observation <b>cloche.</b> Block 2 {{was the principal}} focus of the German assault.|$|E
5|$|Letters {{claiming}} that she bore Charles a son named James de la <b>Cloche</b> in 1646 are dismissed by historians as forgeries.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{initially}} became {{established in}} Lower Silesia, Greater Poland, central Poland, and western Masovia and Lesser Poland, gradually replacing, moving eastbound, the Pomeranian {{culture and the}} <b>Cloche</b> Grave culture, coexisting with the older cultures for a while (in some cases well into the younger pre-Roman period, 200 to 0 BC) and assimilating in process some of their characteristics, for example the <b>Cloche</b> Grave funerary practice and ceramics. The Przeworsk people must have originated from the above two local cultures, {{because of the lack}} of any other archeologically viable possibility, but in respect to their predecessors they represent a striking cultural discontinuity (different cremation rite and pottery).|$|E
5|$|As {{the factory}} bell rings, the {{cigarette}} girls emerge and exchange banter with {{young men in}} the crowd ("La <b>cloche</b> a sonné"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love ("L'amour est un oiseau rebelle"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don José, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.|$|E
5|$|Disregarding the dates, most historians agree {{upon the}} same {{sequence}} of events for {{this part of the}} Sacred War. The principal question is therefore when that sequence started. Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and <b>Cloche)</b> dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355–354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC. Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others give these dates as occurring one year later, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.|$|E
5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and <b>cloche</b> hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
