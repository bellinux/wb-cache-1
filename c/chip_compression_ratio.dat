The {{results show that the}} <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> has a large influence on the engine performance, combustion, and emissions. The penetration distance of the natural-gas jet is decreased and relatively strong mixture stratification is formed as the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> is increased, giving a fast burning rate and a high thermal efficiency, especially at low and medium engine loads. However, the brake thermal efficiency is increased with a <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> up to a limit of 12 at high engine loads. The maximum cylinder gas pressure is increased with increase in the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio.</b> The flame development duration is decreased with increase in the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> and this behaviour becomes more obvious with increase in the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> at low loads or for lean mixture combustion. This indicates that the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> has a significant influence on the combustion duration at lean combustion.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of the cutting process, on a macro and micro scale, in the deep hole drilling with BTA system. An experimental procedure is developed to highlight the impact of cutting speed and feed rate on the cutting process when machining the 18 MND 5 steel. Parameters based on dimensional characteristics of chips are introduced to quantify the morphology of chips generated by central, intermediate and external inserts of the complex BTA drilling tool. From observation of the chips morphology (flat, curved and spiral) and the measurement of the chips width, the provenance of each chip with respect to cutting inserts is identified. Then, the <b>Chip</b> <b>Compression</b> <b>Ratio</b> is evaluated for each cutting condition, indicating the amount of plastic strain in chips. Thanks {{to the introduction of}} a new parameter, denoted as Chip Fragmentation Ratio, it is found that the cutting speed has a little influence, compared to the feed rate, on the chips size. Based on this quantitative anal" # "ysis, the optimal range of cutting conditions for the BTA deep hole drilling is discussed. It is mentioned that although increasing the feed rate promotes the chips fragmentation and increases the material removal rate (increasing productivity), an upper limit is to determine to prevent excessive flank wear.

It is shown that SPD parameters such as deformation strain, macro-texture and strain rate can be controlled by varying the tool rake angle and chip compression (thickness) ratio, while imposing large strains in the chip in a single step of deformation. This level of parameter control is not achievable in any of the conventional SPD processes. By controlling the geometry of the chip (extrudate) a priori using a constraining tool, production of bulk material in foil, sheet and bar forms, and with nanostructured and ultrafine grained (UFG) microstructures, is demonstrated using commercially pure copper and aluminum 6061 -T 6 as model systems. The effects of secondary deformation arising from friction at the tool-chip contact and of the incipient (transient) stage of chip formation on the foil/sheet microstructure are characterized. ^ A characterization of the deformation field is carried out using the method of slip line fields (SLFs). Unlike upper-bound models, it is possible to estimate strain profiles, hydrostatic pressure and modes of deformation using an SLF model.
