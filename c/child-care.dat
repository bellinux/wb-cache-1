5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly also meant that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and a national network of <b>child-care</b> centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E

5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange <b>child-care</b> should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
5|$|Women in the Middle Ages were officially {{required}} to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often allowed much {{control over their own}} lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, <b>child-care,</b> as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were unable to become priests.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how child-rearing behaviors are culturally constructed by focusingon Chinese and Korean foreign student families whose children are attending Japanese day-care centers. Data {{were obtained from}} interviews with nine Chinese foreign student families and twelve Korean foreign student families in the Japanese language; the interviews were conducted from September, 1994 to July, 1996. The data analysis has uncovered shifts in {{the relation between the}} two subordinate systems of child-rearing behaviors: 1) child-rearing act system, and 2) child-rearing belief system. Usually the two systems are closely related, and the acts correspond with underlying beliefs in one's own cultural environment. However, one-third of the participant mothers were found to have experienced a gap between the Japanese child-rearing act system and their original cultural belief system. An example is dressing. In Japan, children wear just a few layers in winter, whereas Chinese and Korean children are covered with thick clothes. The mothers follow the instructions of Japanese day-care centers in the area of <b>child-caring</b> such as clothing and toilet training, though psychological mismatch remains, especially in clothing. Another important finding is an altered view and/or lifestyle of the Korean mothers living in Japan, which has not observed among the Chinese counterpart. The Chinese mothers share the cultural ideal-image of a mother as one person and already know how to share the <b>child-caring</b> tasks with day-care centers. In contrast, the Korean mothers, who hold individually different ideal-images of a mother, have to individually learn one's position in relation to the day-care centers. Thus, child-rearing practices do not only involve culturally constructed <b>child-caring</b> R strategies but also embrace cultural views of mother's own life...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is “The Development and Use of Standards for Licensing of Private <b>Child-caring</b> and Child-placing Agencies in Nebraska. ”The scope of the project is limited to a study of the history, procedure, and methods of licensing, and the {{development}} of standards and their use in Nebraska. The main emphasis of the study will be {{on the development of the}} Nebraska program during the last ten years. The following sources and materials were used in making the study: General overall reading about licensing, the need for it, and its beginning as well as methods and procedures. A study of the several acts of the legislature. The study of confidential records and file material on licensing and standards available within the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare. This includes material from reports on each particular agency. Interviews with the chief of the Division of Child Welfare, as well as an interview with a member of the Children’s Code Commission as of 1920. Use of annual and biennial reports from various departments. Use of material from the Children’s Bureau and the Child Welfare League of America on licensing and standards.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to clarify the effect of gender role orientation, sports participation and the barriers to a married woman’s sports activity. The participants for analysis numbered 210. Gender role orientation is measured using Ito’s (1978) MHF Scale. The individual’s classification on the MHF Scale was provided“masculinity (M scale) ”, “femininity (F scale) ”, and“androgyny (H scale) ”. With this research, it was classified into the high frequency participation group, the low frequency participation group, and the nonparticipation group according to the frequency of sports. As a result, the difference was not shown at the women’s age, occupation and child’s age in sports participation. Moreover, especially as for the distinction, gender role orientation was not seen with sports participation, either, but a gender role orientation was a sense of values equal, regardless of sports participation or non-sports participation. Regarding the time factor, there was a difference with work-time, housekeeping, and <b>child-caring</b> which is significant between the high frequency participation group, the low frequency participation group and the non-participation group. That is, it turns out that it has not been a problem at all in the high frequency participation group regarding time constraints. Regarding the prevention factor, {{it turns out that the}} women of the non-participation group resultingly give priority to family over oneself because of working, housekeeping, and <b>child-caring.</b> The women of the non-participation group have at least separated the gender role orientation and participation. As a result, although gender role does not influence consciousness, it has influenced participation. However, it is difficult to apply such a tendency to all women, because of the difference of women’s positions and their varying perspectives on sports...|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the Trustees of Porter-Leath Home {{recognized}} the declining need {{of services for}} orphans. Institutional care for orphans became rare {{largely due to the}} availability of Social Security benefits and Public Assistance Programs. Also, the numbers of true orphans diminished significantly as medical advances were made. Consequently, the Trustees sought to expand the Home’s <b>child-caring</b> services to meet the ever-increasing demands for more specialized institutional programs. As a result, by 1961 children under care at Porter-Leath came from the Courts, the Children’s Bureau and the Department of Public Welfare. For the most part, these children were dependent and neglected and from broken homes. The “cottage-type” or small-group system instituted by the Home in the 1950s was well suited to provide individual care and attention to children in such distress.|$|R

25|$|The state's more {{tolerant}} attitude toward Islam encouraged {{the proliferation of}} private religious activities, including {{the construction of new}} mosques and Qur'an schools in the cities, the establishment of Islamic centers for research on and conferences about Islam and its role in Turkey, and the establishment of religiously oriented professional and women's journals. The printing of newspapers, the publication of religious books, and the growth of innumerable religious projects ranging from health centers, <b>child-care</b> facilities, and youth hostels to financial institutions and consumer cooperatives flourished. When the government legalized private broadcasting after 1990, several Islamic radio stations were organized.

40|$|A {{relatively}} {{high level of}} part-time employment exists in Australia, with part-time workers having little incentive to move into full-time work {{due to a lack}} of work and family provisions in industrial agreements. This engenders the need to understand how the demographic structure of employment is shaped by such policy. This study seeks to investigate the breadwinner and childcare roles within Australia's employment structure by analysing employment status and relevant demographic variables using data from the 'Australia at Work' survey. We found that among households with dependent children, men dominated breadwinner roles, possibly to coutervail the partial employment of their female partners who were found to trade-off employment for <b>child-caring</b> roles within the household. This study shows how industrial agreements have influenced work and family roles in the employment structure, and serves as a basis for measuring the impact of recent policy reforms such as more flexible working arrangements for parents...|$|R
40|$|In many {{countries}} {{economic and social}} concerns associated with ageing populations have focused attention onto flexible forms of working as key to encouraging people to work longer and delay retirement. This article argues {{that there has been}} a remarkable lack of attention paid to the role of gender in extending working lives and contends that this gap has arisen because of two, inter-related, oversights: little consideration of relationships between gender and flexible working beyond the <b>child-caring</b> phase of life; and the prevailing tendency to think of end of working life and retirement as gender-neutral or following a typical male trajectory. The findings of a qualitative study of people aged 50 + in the UK challenge some of the key assumptions underpinning the utility of flexible work in extending working lives, and provide insight into the ways in which working in later life is constructed and enacted differently for men and women...|$|R
50|$|Single {{mothers are}} one of the poorest populations, many of them {{vulnerable}} to homelessness. In the United States, nearly half (45%) of single mothers and their children live below the poverty line, also referred to as the poverty threshold. They lack the financial resources to support their children when the birth father is unresponsive. Many seek assistance through living with another adult, perhaps a relative, fictive kin, or significant other, and divorced mothers who remarry have fewer financial struggles than unmarried single mothers, who cannot work {{for longer periods of time}} without shirking their <b>child-caring</b> responsibilities. Unmarried mothers are thus more likely to cohabit with another adult. Many of the jobs available to women are not sufficient and do not bring in enough income for the mother and her children; this is common in the United States and other countries all over the world.|$|R
