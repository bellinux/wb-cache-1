50|$|For a given {{capacitor}} charging current, the amplitude of the output waveform will decrease linearly with frequency. In musical terms, {{this means a}} waveform an octave higher in pitch is of half the amplitude. In order to produce a constant amplitude over {{the full range of}} the oscillator, some compensation scheme must be employed. This is often done by controlling the charging current from the same microprocessor that controls the <b>counter</b> <b>reset</b> value.|$|E
5000|$|Oversampling {{can be done}} blind using {{multiple}} phases of a free-running clock to create multiple samples of the input and then selecting the best sample. Or, a counter can be used that is driven by a sampling clock running at some multiple of the data stream frequency, with the <b>counter</b> <b>reset</b> on every transition of the data stream and the data stream sampled at some predetermined count. These two types of oversampling are sometimes called spatial and time respectively.The best bit error ratio (BER) is obtained when the samples are taken {{as far away as}} possible from any data stream transitions. [...] While most oversampling designs using a counter employ a sampling clock frequency that is an even multiple of the data stream, an odd multiple is better able to create a sampling point further from any data stream transitions and can do so at nearly half the frequency of a design using an even multiple. In oversampling type CDRs, the signal used to sample the data can be used as the recovered clock.|$|E

40|$|ATLAS-SCT has {{developed}} a new ATLAS trigger card, 'Digital Atlas Vme Electronics' ("DAVE"). The unit {{is designed to provide}} a versatile array of interface and logic resources, including a large FPGA. It interfaces to both VME bus and USB hosts.

DAVE provides additional hardware and a large amount of free firmware resource to allow users to add or change functionality. The combination of the large number of individually programmable inputs and outputs in various formats, with very large external RAM and other components all connected to the FPGA, also makes DAVE a powerful and versatile FPGA utility car...|$|E
30|$|To {{address the}} {{shortcomings}} of WRR described above, we propose an algorithm that changes the static weight of each class into a dynamic weight. These are computed dynamically according to the traffic characteristics of the queue and the static weight of each class {{at the beginning of}} every <b>counter</b> <b>reset.</b> These keep track of the traffic variations of each queue to reduce the delay and packet loss, as well as to improve the throughput in an IEEE 802.16 network under input burst traffic.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} this {{expression}} that very large values of wi,k will extend the <b>counter</b> <b>reset</b> time. To avoid this, wi,k needs to be made a small integer by dividing by a constant common to all the queues and rounding off the result to an integer value. This will yield an appropriate weight for each queue. For example, assume that there are three queues in the first round and that their weights w 1, 1, w 1, 2, and w 1, 3 are computed as 201, 203, and 243, respectively. After dividing these values by 40, we obtain 5, 6, and 7 as more appropriate values of w 1, 1, w 1, 2, and w 1, 3, respectively. We adopted the idea of using an appropriate constant value in[25]. The author used it in order to avoid a large quantization error from large divisor.|$|E

5000|$|During {{production}} at Canley, the seat trim was again revised, with a plaid cloth in navy blue or tan, with matching coloured leather effect edging, and matching door cards. A further trim change during {{production at}} Solihull saw {{the use of}} a ruched velour in blue or tan on the seats, with matching inserts on the doors. Also, the internal door lock buttons were changed from the earlier standard BL round ones, to rectangular buttons held on with small grub screws. There was also a change to the trip mile <b>counter's</b> <b>reset</b> button, which became a push type operated through the instrument [...] "glass", rather than a turn type under the dash.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} compute the pulse frequency, an {{accurate}} 1 -second time base must be provided as the master clock or heartbeat. The one pulse per second (1 PPS) signal from a GPS board is easy to obtain, as most OEM GPS boards provide this signal, which is accurate to ± 1 μS, making it an ideal time base for measuring {{the frequency of the}} magnetic sensor output signal. The master clock is implemented through an interrupt, with <b>counter</b> <b>reset</b> and transmission of frequency data as part of the interrupt service routine executed by the CPU (and thus not affecting the ability of the timing registers to count). Time and date information aligned to {{the leading edge of the}} 1 PPS signal is fed to the controlling microcontroller (MCU) module over a TTL serial link, and is encoded in industry-standard NMEA 0183 format (National Marine Electronics Association, 2002). We selected the Garmin GPS 18 LVC GPS engine (Garmin International Inc., 2005) for its compactness and simplicity. It is a 61 mm diameter by 19 mm thick disk containing an integrated receiver and antenna attached toa 5 m power/communication cable. The unit was configured to emit a 1 PPS pulse and the NMEA GPRMC sentence, thus providing the 1 Hz timing pulse and time stamps. Configuration settings are stored in the GPS unit’s non-volatile memory.|$|E
40|$|In Experiment 1, 10 pigeons {{were exposed}} to a {{successive}} symbolic matching-to-sample procedure in which the sample was generated by the pigeons' own behavior. Each trial began with both response keys illuminated white, one being the “correct” key and the other the “incorrect” key. The pigeons {{had no way of}} discriminating which key was correct and which incorrect, since these roles were assigned on a random basis with the same probability of 0. 5 for each key. A fixed ratio of five responses was required on the correct key. However, each time the pigeon pecked the incorrect key, the correct key response <b>counter</b> <b>reset.</b> Five consecutive pecks on the correct key {{was the only way to}} end this component, and switch off both key lights. Two seconds later, these same keys were illuminated again, one green and the other red (comparison stimuli). Now, if the correct white key had been on the left, a peck at one color produced food, and if the correct white key had been on the right, a peck at the other color produced food. When the pigeons had learned this discrimination, they {{were exposed to}} several symmetry tests (simultaneous presentations of both keys illuminated the same color—i. e., both red or both green), in order to interchange the sample with the comparison stimuli. In Experiment 2, the importance of requiring discrimination between the samples and between the comparisons was analyzed. In Experiment 3, we compared the results of Experiment 1 with a slightly different experiment, which resulted in discrimination of key position, an exteroceptive stimulus. The results showed that symmetry emerged only when different responses were used as samples...|$|E

40|$|The {{proportional}} Service {{model is}} receiving {{a lot of}} attention as an attractive model for providing differentiated services on the Internet. In particular, this model is controllable, able to provide the "tuning knobs" for network operators to quantitatively differentiate the quality-of-service (QoS) of different classes, and lends itself naturally to simple pricing schemes. In this paper, we focus on the issue of how to practically implement such a QoS differentiation scheme at high-speed routers using efficient buffer management and packet scheduling mechanisms. We first propose a uniform scheduler. Unlike previously proposed schedulers which can be used only for a single QoS metric, our scheduler is suitable for various QoS metrics. We then introduce a new packet dropping mechanism with an active <b>counter</b> <b>resetting</b> scheme that compare favorably with previous schemes. Finally, we develop an original and simple approach for the integration of absolute QoS constraints with the proportional differentiation paradigm...|$|R

The objective is {{to bring peace to}} his magical land by controlling the famous fast food clown. Most of Ronald's companions have been kidnapped, and the animals have turned feral. His brainwashed companions will occasionally attack. Ronald can defend himself using apple bombs, thrown in a carefully calculated parabola. Being hit by an enemy causes damage, which decreases Ronald's [...] "Life" [...] meter. During various parts of a stage, players have the opportunity to collect up to 100 hamburger icons throughout the game.

50|$|The arcade game Vs. Ice Climber has a {{few more}} {{gameplay}} differences. The player must pick from an initial set of 24 mountains to conquer. After eight are cleared, a Super Bonus stage occurs in which the player must reach a high platform. Afterwards, the player must choose from {{the second set of}} 24 mountains, in which the Condor is replaced by a giant butterfly. After the next eight stages are cleared and the Super Bonus is over, the player resumes the cycle from the original mountain set. The game keeps track of whether the mountain was claimed by an Ice Climber or if it remains Topi territory—once all the stages are completed, the <b>counter</b> <b>resets.</b> Approximately 30 of the 48 level designs are borrowed from the NES game. Stage setups are generally trickier in Vs. Ice Climber, with some new mechanics such as cloud platforms that move diagonal or strong gusts of wind. In addition, a purple bee with a spear flying in a horizontal pattern is included as a somewhat rare fourth enemy.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{computational}} complexity of reachability, coverability and inclusion for extensions of context-free commutative grammars with integer <b>counters</b> and <b>reset</b> operations on them. Those grammars can alternatively {{be viewed as}} an extension of communication-free Petri nets. Our main results are that reachability and coverability are inter-reducible and both NP-complete. In particular, this class of commutative grammars enjoys semi-linear reachability sets. We also show that the inclusion problem is, in general, coNEXP-complete and already Π_ 2 ^P-complete for grammars with only one non-terminal symbol. Showing the lower bound for the latter result requires us to develop a novel Π_ 2 ^P-complete variant of the classic subset sum problem. Comment: 33 page...|$|R
50|$|This game's {{score and}} hyper {{mechanics}} are highly {{similar to those}} of DaiOuJou. The biggest basic difference in scoring is that the chain hit <b>counter</b> will not <b>reset</b> immediately when the chain meter empties; the counter will instead drop by 25% and decrease very quickly until the chain continues. The chain meter is also more easily kept above zero by using the laser.|$|R
50|$|The {{incremented}} and periodically <b>reset</b> <b>counter</b> is the discrete {{version of}} the intersecting method's sawtooth.

50|$|In {{case it is}} {{necessary}} to recite {{a very large number of}} mantras, Tibetan Buddhist malas have bell and dorje counters (a short string of ten beads, usually silver, with a bell or dorje at the bottom). The dorje counter is used to count each round around the mala, and the bell counter to count each time the dorje counter runs out of beads. After that, the dorje <b>counter</b> is <b>reset.</b> These <b>counters</b> are placed at different points on the mala depending on tradition, sometimes at the 10th, 21st or 25th bead from the Guru bead.

These numbers are sometimes in real time format (hours:minutes:seconds), but are often only an ambiguous 4 digit sequential counter. These numbers advance up or down based on the machine counting a tape's control track pulses. This type of display is useful only as a simple and temporary reference, as it is very inaccurate, and the <b>counter</b> is <b>reset</b> to zero when a tape is inserted.

5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} chain counter, {{consisting}} of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain <b>counter</b> <b>resets.</b> The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a warrior-type role; Ravager, a black mage-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.|$|R

The EWO receiver has a unique time counter (named ‘S-WPIA counter’). The S-WPIA <b>counter</b> is <b>reset</b> when the EWO receiver receives new TI from the satellite bus-system. The LSB of the S-WPIA counter corresponds to 1 / 524, 288  s.

50|$|Most {{frequency}} counters work {{by using}} a counter which accumulates the number of events occurring within a specific period of time. After a preset period known as the gate time (1 second, for example), the value in the counter is transferred to a display and the <b>counter</b> is <b>reset</b> to zero. If the event being measured repeats itself with sufficient stability and the frequency is considerably {{lower than that of}} the clock oscillator being used, the resolution of the measurement can be greatly improved by measuring the time required for an entire number of cycles, rather than counting the number of entire cycles observed for a pre-set duration (often referred to as the reciprocal technique). The internal oscillator which provides the time signals is called the timebase, and must be calibrated very accurately.|$|R
