40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{analyzing}} <b>compliment</b> and <b>compliment</b> response in Instagram. This study aims to (1) describe {{the categories of}} <b>compliment</b> in Instagram, (2) clarify the types of <b>compliment</b> response in Instagram, and (3) describe the intentions of <b>compliment</b> in Instagram. This research applies descriptive qualitative method. The data analyzed are comments containing <b>compliment</b> and <b>compliment</b> response in Instagram. Based on the analysis the writer found that; (1) The <b>compliment</b> in this research is divided into two; linguistic and non-linguistic strategies. The linguistic strategy is aparted into two caategories; possession <b>compliment</b> and performance <b>compliment.</b> There are two <b>compliment</b> categories of <b>compliment</b> strategies which are found in Instagram: possession <b>compliment</b> and performance <b>compliment.</b> The <b>compliment</b> givers in Instagram mostly use possession <b>compliment,</b> particularly, adjective possession <b>compliment.</b> The performance <b>compliment</b> category is rarely to use in Instagram. The <b>compliment</b> givers in Instagram also use non-linguistic <b>compliment</b> which is formed in emoticons. Smiley and love emoticons are the most emoticons emerge in this research. Some <b>compliment</b> givers use one emoticons and some other use more than one; (2) The intentions of <b>compliment</b> are to praise and to ask <b>compliment</b> back. (3) The <b>compliment</b> response which mostly use in Instagram is appreciation token strategy; thank you and thanks. Another <b>compliment</b> receivers in Instagram use non-lingustic <b>compliment</b> response as well. It is formed in emoticons. The most emoticons emerge in this research for responding <b>compliment</b> are thumbs, love and smiley emoticons. Some <b>compliment</b> receivers use one emoticon, and some other use more than one.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine <b>compliment</b> responses among Jordanian university students. It aims to explore the use of <b>compliment</b> responses among Jordanian, and investigate if there are any differences with regard to gender. The corpus consists of 611 <b>compliment</b> responses collected from 36 participants through an ethnographic (note-taking) method during the second semester of 2013 / 2014 academic session. This research adopted Herbert’s (1990) taxonomy of <b>compliment</b> response strategies to analyze the <b>compliment</b> responses. Results show that recipients used the agreement strategies more frequently than the other strategies. The findings also show although both males and females favored to use agreement strategies more than non agreement and other interpretation strategies, female students used agreement strategies more frequently than the male students. This may support the claim that males tend to interpret <b>compliment</b> as FTA. Females also preferred to use agreement strategies to respond to <b>compliment</b> offered by female than <b>compliment</b> offered by male. <b>Compliment</b> responses strategies are discussed in terms of gender. It can be concluded that the linguistic manipulations of <b>compliment</b> responses shown in this study indicate that no one strategy of <b>compliment</b> responses would work because different genders have different sets of strategies, thereby preventing any valid generalization. The current study offered important differences in using <b>compliment</b> responses between genders...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a sociolinguistic study about <b>compliment</b> {{responses}} strategies {{used by the}} female basketball players in my club in Surabaya. The <b>compliment</b> responses I discussed are in daily conversation of Bahasa Indonesia. To find the strategies of my respondents using those ways, and to find the influence of culture and custom in using the <b>compliment</b> responses, I take three respondents in my research. My respondents are my friends in the basketball team; they are Marry, Ann, and Katty, who have different characteristics. I use a qualitative research to do my study, in order to observe the topic deeply, not just observing the surface data. Although my observation is in Bahasa Indonesia, I use Herbert?s theory as the main theory on the types of <b>compliment</b> responses strategies. In the findings, I can show that my respondents, who are female, tend to use `no acknowledgement? strategies {{in responding to the}} <b>compliment</b> on ability, and they have their own reason to do that. While in responding to the <b>compliment</b> on appearance, they tend to use `praise upgrade? strategies, as their special characteristics of the basketball players who live in a `mess?. Culture, society, and mood may have influenced people in using the types of <b>compliment</b> responses. Besides, there are social factors (external factors) and conditions such as relationship, status, and even internal factors such as mood, age, which influence them in responding to the <b>compliment.</b> It depends on the purpose and the intention of the speaker in using the <b>compliment</b> responses strategies...|$|R

No significant association was observed between temperature values and erythrocyte displays on the forehead and cheek.
