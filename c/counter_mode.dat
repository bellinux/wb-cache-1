40|$|Flameless {{combustion}} is of a {{great interest}} since it simultaneously provides higher thermal efficiency together with controlling the pollutant emission such as NOX. This technology has been used to provide large energy savings in power system and industrial heating applications. In this technology, the preheat temperature of the combustion air must be higher than the auto-ignition temperature of the reactant mixture. In this review, papers concern the effect of firing mode to reduce pollutant emissions such as NOX emission and combustion efficiency for flameless combustion were reviewed. Summaries on the influences of the firing mode in the flameless combustion were presented, discussed and analyzed.

40|$|Abstract—Cryptographic {{primitives}} such as secure hash functions (e. g., SHA 1, SHA 2, and SHA 3) and {{symmetric key}} block ciphers (e. g., AES and TDES) have been {{commonly used to}} design pseudorandom generators with <b>counter</b> <b>modes</b> (e. g., in Java Crypto Library and in NIST SP 800 - 90 A standards). It is assumed that if these primitives are secure then the pseudorandom generators based on these primitives are also secure.

Based on complexity theoretic results for pseudorandom sequences, this paper analyzes stochastic properties of long sequences produced by hash function based pseudorandom generators DRBG from NIST SP 800 - 90 A and SHA 1 PRNG from Java Crypto Library. Our results show {{that none of these}} sequences satisfy the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) which holds for polynomial time pseudorandom sequences. Our results also show that if the seeds and counters for pseudorandom generators are not appropriately chosen, then the generated sequences have strongly biased values for LIL-tests and could be distinguished from uniformly chosen sequences with a high probability. Based on these results, appropriate seeding and counter methods are proposed for pseudorandom generator designs. The results in this paper reveal some “non-random” behavior of SHA 1, SHA 2, and of the recently announced SHA 3. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Cryptographic {{primitives}} such as secure hash functions (e. g., SHA 1, SHA 2, and SHA 3) and {{symmetric key}} block ciphers (e. g., AES and TDES) have been {{commonly used to}} design pseudorandom generators with <b>counter</b> <b>modes</b> (e. g., in NIST SP 800 - 90 A standards). It is assumed that if these primitives are secure then the sequences generated by pseudorandom generators based on these primitives are indistinguishable from sequences from true random sources. How-ever, no systematic research and analysis have been done to support this assump-tion. Based on complexity theoretic results for pseudorandom sequences, this pa-per analyzes stochastic properties of long sequences produced by pseudorandom generators DRBG-SHA from NIST SP 800 - 90 A. A collection of 6 TB random se-quences are generated and {{it is observed that}} the statistical distance between the collection of generated sequences and uniform distribution is around 0. 07 (with 0 for statistically indistinguishable and 1 for completely distinguishable). We then try to see whether other seeding approaches to pseudorandom generators could be used to reduce the statistical distance. For example, we carried out experiment with dynamic seeding approach. The experimental results show that the collec-tion of sequences generated by the revised seeding approach is also at least 0. 07 statistically away from the collection of uniform chosen sequences. Though the statistical distance 0. 07 is acceptable in practice for most applications, the pre-ferred distance of a cryptographic “random oracle ” from a true random source should be smaller than 0. 03 with the sample size of 1000 sequences (2 TB bits). ...|$|R
