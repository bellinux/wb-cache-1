40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [90]- 93) Global competitiveness {{is forcing}} manufacturing companies {{to make a}} critical review of every aspect of their businesses. In most machine shops, the profit margin is typically quite low. Optimized processing is required to ensure a profit. Simulation of metal-cutting processes provides substantial opportunities for enhancing throughput, decreasing costs and improving product quality. The use of computer simulations to avoid unstable cutting processes is one area where significant gains can be realized. Time domain simulation models were developed for both plunge feed turning and slender endmilling. Simulations were conducted using C++ computer programs. Chatter (i. e., excessive tool vibration) is shown to exist beyond a stability limit of <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> for both cases. Sinusoidal varying tool displacements are demonstrated to contribute to regenerative surface waviness (i. e., causing varying chip thickness) for all <b>chip</b> <b>widths.</b> A nominal tool displacement that is proportional to <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> arises due to the tool compliance and force exerted on the tool. When <b>chip</b> <b>widths</b> are below a limiting size for stability, displacement amplitudes decay towards the nominal tool displacement value. For <b>chip</b> <b>widths</b> at the stability limit, a constant amplitude of the tool displacement around the nominal value occurs. A constant growth of the displacement amplitude occurs for <b>chip</b> <b>widths</b> above the stability limit. Generally, the growth rate in the amplitude is fester for larger amounts of excessive <b>chip</b> <b>widths.</b> However, the amplitude growth is limited when the tool momentarily and repeatedly leaves the cut corresponding to chatter. Experimental verification was performed utilizing a Kistler force dynamometer, a Tektronix data acquisition system, a Renault lathe and a Mori-Seiki machining center. Good correlation was achieved between experiments and simulations. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

When the deformation degree is larger than 15 %, there are little changes of the effective strain along the deformed block centerline.

Eyes with an optic cup area of <  0. 2  mm 2 were excluded.  RESULTS—In the normal subjects, inferior to temporal rim <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> (1. 67  (SD 0. 53)) was significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher than superior to temporal rim <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> (1. 56  (0. 49)). Both ratios were significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher the more vertically the optic disc was configured. In the normal eyes, both ratios were statistically independent of disc size, rim area, refractive error, age, and sex. With the differences being more marked for the inferior to temporal ratio than for the superior to temporal <b>ratio,</b> both rim <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> were significantly (p< 0. 005) lower in the ocular hypertensive group than in the normal group. Despite the high significance of the differences, diagnostic power of the inferior ratio and the superior ratio was 59 % and 58 %, respectively, indicating a marked overlap between the groups.  CONCLUSIONS—Abnormally low inferior to temporal and superior to temporal rim <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> can indicate glaucomatous optic nerve damage in some ocular hypertensive eyes. Being independent of optic disc size and ocular magnification, the rim <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> may be taken as one among other variables for the ophthalmoscopic optic disc evaluation, taking into account, however, a pronounced overlap between normal eyes and ocular hypertensive eyes.    Keywords: neuroretinal rim width ratios; glaucoma; ocular hypertensio...|$|R

METHODS: Pretreatment and posttreatment panoramic radiographs of 120 orthodontically treated cases were taken. The lower third molars' angulation and space/crown <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> were examined {{and the relative}} factors on changes were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) The changes of the lower third molars' angulation and space/crown <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> after orthodontic treatment were quite different among the cases. (2) The factors which influenced these changes mainly included extraction, mandibular plane angle, angulation and space/crown <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> of lower third molar before orthodontic treatment.

The Golden proportion (62 %) and the recurring esthetic dental proportion (RED) are two theories in this field that have been suggested to create harmony among anterior teeth. These have rarely been studied among the Iranian population. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the Golden proportion and RED proportion in students, staff, and patients of Shahed dental school. Patients and Methods: This study was conducted with 116 subjects in Shahed dental school photographs of the subject’s anterior teeth were taken from the frontal view. The perceived <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> of canine to lateral incisor and lateral incisor to central incisor were calculated. In this study, the Golden proportion was evaluated within the range of 0. 55 – 0. 64. To evaluate the existence of the RED proportion in each subject, the <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> of canine to lateral incisor was compared with the <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> of lateral incisor to central incisor. Results: The Golden proportion existed in 25 % of the perceived <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> of lateral incisor to central incisor, and 2. 1 % of the <b>width</b> <b>ratios</b> of canine to lateral incisor in natural dentition. The RED proportion existed in 18. 5 % of subjects, and the most recurring proportion was 0. 73 in these subjects.

40|$|Borehole logs often show {{considerable}} variation over small lengths, {{consistent with}} fine layering of the formation. Elastic upscaling allows layering on a fine length scale {{to be replaced}} by thicker, homogeneous equivalent transversely isotropic layers, thus creating a model with far fewer layers. In this paper, the eVect of inclusions of finite lateral extent on elastic upscaling is examined. For inclusions with a small thickness to <b>width</b> <b>ratio,</b> Backus averaging gives a good approximation to the long-wavelength elastic properties of the medium. However, for larger thickness to <b>width</b> <b>ratios,</b> the anisotropy of the medium can be significantly reduced. For inclusions that are long in comparison to their width, azimuthal anisotropy may result if the inclusions show a preferential orientation. This could result from the presence of flow during deposition. The azimuthal anisotropy increases with increasing thickness to <b>width</b> <b>ratio</b> of the inclusions, and vanishes when this ratio is zero. For larger thickness to <b>width</b> <b>ratios,</b> the magnitude of the azimuthal anisotropy may be of similar magnitude to that commonly seen in sedimentary basins.

40|$|American Society of Mechanical EngineersThe {{measurement}} of cutting force systems {{is one of}} the most frequently used techniques for the monitoring of machining processes. Its wide spread application ranges from tool condition identification, feedback control, cutting system design, to process optimization. To gain fundamental understanding of the force system in machining, this paper presents the work of establishing a closed form expression for the cutting force in end milling as an explicit function of cutting parameters and tool/workpiece geometry. Based on the theoretical local cutting force model, the generation of total cutting forces is formulated as the angular convolution of three uncorrelated cutting process component functions, namely the elemental cutting force function, the <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> density function, and the tooth sequence function. The elemental cutting force function is related to the chip formation process in an elemental cutting area and it is characterized by the chip thickness variation, specific cutting pressure constants, and entry/exit angles. The <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> density function defines the <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> per unit cutter rotation along a cutter flute within the range of axial depth of cut as the function of the angular position of each cutting point. The tooth sequence function represents the spacing between flutes as well as their cutting sequence as the cutter rotates. The analysis of cutting forces is extended into the Fourier domain by taking the frequency multiplication of the transforms of the three component functions. Fourier series coefficients of the cutting forces are shown to be algebraic functions of various tool parameters and cutting conditions. Simulation results are presented in the frequency domain to illustrate the effects of process parameters.
