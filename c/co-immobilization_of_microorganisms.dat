40|$|A {{combination}} of the freshwater microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris or C. sorokiniana) and a microalgae growth-promoting bacterium (MGPB, Azospirillum brasilense strain Cd), co-immobilized in small alginate beads, was developed to remove P and N from wastewater. This paper describes {{the usefulness of the}} approach in removing P and N from synthetic and domestic wastewater of the city of La Paz, Mexico. A. brasilense Cd significantly enhanced the growth of both Chlorella species when the co-immobilized microorganisms were grown in synthetic and domestic wastewater. While A. brasilense is incapable of significant removal of N and P from the wastewater, both microalgae can. Co-immobilization of the bacterium and the microalgae was superior to removal by the microalgae alone, removing up to 100 % ammonium, and 92 % phosphorus within six days (varied with the source of the wastewater), compared to 75 % ammonium and 89 % phosphorus by the microalgae alone. Removal of ammonium from the wastewater was better with the co-immobilized microorganisms when the level of ammonium in the wastewater was increased from 3 to 7 mg/L.

40|$|Current {{cellulosic}} biomass hydrolysis {{is based on}} the one-time use of cellulases. Cellulases immobilized on magnetic nanocarriers offer the advantages of magnetic separation and repeated use for continuous hydrolysis. Most immobilization methods focus on only one type of cellulase. Here, we report <b>co-immobilization</b> <b>of</b> two types of cellulases, β-glucosidase A (BglA) and cellobiohydrolase D (CelD), on sub- 20 nm superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles demonstrated 100 % immobilization efficiency for both BglA and CelD. The total enzyme activities of immobilized BglA and CelD were up to 67. 1 % and 41. 5 % of that of the free cellulases, respectively. The immobilized BglA and CelD each retained about 85 % and 43 % of the initial immobilized enzyme activities after being recycled 3 and 10 times, respectively.

40|$|In bio-redox cascade {{reactions}} that are immobilized on porous supports, mass-transfer limitations may impede the effective {{concentration of the}} cofactor around the corresponding dehydrogenases. This main drawback has been addressed by the <b>co-immobilization</b> <b>of</b> both the main and recycling dehydrogenases. Herein, we report tailor-made co-immobilization procedures to assemble three different bio-redox orthogonal cascades invitro (two selective reductions and one selective oxidation) with insitu cofactor-regeneration. However, the co-immobilization itself does not guarantee {{the success of the}} biotransformation because the same co-immobilization chemistry may not be suitable for the two enzymes that are involved in the bio-redox cascade. Therefore, our co-immobilization system was optimized for each bi-enzymatic cascade. In all cases, the optimized co-immobilization procedure was more efficient in the biocatalytic cascade than if the two dehydrogenases were immobilized on two different carriers. In one specific case (one thermophilic cascade), the <b>co-immobilization</b> <b>of</b> an optimal ratio of main/recycling dehydrogenases (1 : 5) on the same carrier resulted in a biocatalyst that was able to recycle NADH up to 9000 times per equivalent of substrate in 1 hour at 55 °C. Moreover, uniform distributions of both dehydrogenases across the porous surface also enhanced the recycling efficiency of the cofactor 1. 5 -fold versus cascades in which the enzymes were not uniformly distributed across the same porous surface, presumably because of vicinal cooperation effects. Hence, this system for the <b>co-immobilization</b> <b>of</b> bi-enzymatic systems may be extended to other biocatalytic cascades, thereby opening a window for the optimization of other multi-enzyme biotransformations in which cofactor-recycling is necessary. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Type I {{pullulanase}} from Anoxybacillus sp. SK 3 - 4 (PulASK) is {{an unusual}} debranching enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes starch α- 1, 6 linkages at long branches producing oligosaccharides (≥G 8), but is nonreactive against short branches; thus, incapable of producing reducing sugars (G 1 –G 7). We report {{on the effects of}} both single and <b>co-immobilization</b> <b>of</b> PulASK on product specificity. PulASK was purified and immobilized through covalent attachment to three epoxides (ReliZyme EP 403 /M, Immobead IB- 150 P, and Immobead IB- 150 A) and an amino-epoxide (ReliZyme HFA 403 /M) activated supports. Following immobilization, all PulASK derivatives were active on both short and long branches in starch producing reducing sugars (predominantly maltotriose) and oligosaccharides (≥G 8), respectively, a feature that is absent in the free enzyme. This study also demonstrated that <b>co-immobilization</b> <b>of</b> PulASK and α-amylase from Anoxybacillus sp.

A coating with dextran aldehyde MW 6000 Da, partially oxidized, covalently attached the enzymes to the support. Optimum activity was verified in the pH range 2 - 4, and at 50, 65 and 80 °C for the xylanase, α-l-arabinofuranosidase and β-xylosidase, respectively. The xylanase was highly thermostable retaining more than 70 % of activity even after 24 h incubation at 60 and 70 °C; and at 80 °C its half-life was 1. 7 h.

The first design, the internally immobilized sensor, consists of a reactor chamber, micro-lenses and self-alignment structures for fiber optics positioning. This sensor design allows optical detection of glucose concentrations under continuous glucose flow conditions of 33 µL/h based on internal <b>co-immobilization</b> <b>of</b> glucose oxidase (GOX) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) on the internal PDMS surface of the reactor chamber. For this design, two co-immobilization methods, the simple adsorption and the covalent binding (PEG) methods were tested. Experiments showed successful results when using the covalent binding (PEG) method, where glucose concentrations up to 5 mM with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 99 and a limit of detection of 0. 26 mM are detectable. The second design is a modified version of the internally immobilized sensor, where a microbead chamber and a beads filling channel are integrated into the sensor.

While high catalytic activity, selectivity and mild reaction conditions are attractive advantages of the biocatalysts, particularly costs arising from required cofactors pose a sever limitation.
