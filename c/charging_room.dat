25|$|Initially, H Battery was {{accommodated}} {{in tents}} near a small freshwater stream emptying into Sunny Bay, about 500 yards {{south of the}} gun emplacements, while camp buildings were erected there by the local Civil Construction Corps. Constructed mostly of timber from Johnson's sawmill at Stratford, {{on the outskirts of}} Cairns, these buildings were of a standard rectangular design measuring 60 feet by 20 feet. They included: 7 barrack rooms, officers' quarters, sergeants' quarters (each of these having separate ablution blocks and latrines), battery office, quarter master's store, officers' mess and kitchen, gunners' mess and kitchen, canteen and recreation room, and a small battery <b>charging</b> <b>room</b> to supply the camp with electricity. About 150 yards north of the camp a workshop was erected, and north of this, about half-way between the camp and the defence installations, a hospital and RAP shelter were built. There was no road from Cairns to the camp, which had to be supplied via boat (the unit had its own two-masted vessel, the Eulalie). A timber jetty was constructed at Sunny Bay near the camp site, and closer to the Cape a stone and concrete ramp for a landing barge.|$|E
50|$|Southern Stove Works, Manchester is a {{historic}} factory complex located in Richmond, Virginia that replaced the company's original factory. The complex includes two contributing prefabricated steel frame buildings built in 1920. The west building contains the original two-story office building that has been connected by one-story infill to the long one-story warehouse building that contained the pressing and mounting departments and a three-part warehouse. The office is a five-by-three-bay, two-story, building measuring 40 by 80 feet and brick curtain walls. The east building today consists of the foundry with attached original washrooms and office, <b>charging</b> <b>room,</b> and an expanded mill room.|$|E
5000|$|During 2012, Energy Products {{developed}} and has patents pending {{for a more}} efficient means to change and charge forklift batteries while providing a just-in-time delivery of charged forklift batteries. [...] In January 2013, Energy Products began providing Charged Battery Delivery service to the Chrysler Windsor Assembly Plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. This set-up freed space in the factory by eliminating the battery room needed to charge and maintain the forklift batteries, provides a safer way to handle forklift batteries, eliminates the environmental issues with charging batteries in the factory, reduced {{the time required to}} change batteries and significantly reduces the capital costs associated with operating a battery <b>charging</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

5000|$|To {{the east}} of the Court House is the a single storey brick residence. The {{original}} plan form of this building is an [...] "L" [...] with an attached square room at the rear that was originally the <b>Charge</b> <b>Room.</b> The building has hipped roofs which have wide eaves with exposed timber frame soffits and are clad in corrugated galvanised iron. It has a timber front verandah which has been enclosed. The verandah roof is contiguous with the main roof. The west side displays three double hung windows that have prominent hoods which have diagonal timber sides and corrugated iron roofs. A flat roofed brick addition has been made to the east verandah. Internally the building retains its original configuration with a main living room off the front verandah and three rooms down the western side with the <b>Charge</b> <b>Room</b> off the east verandah. The laundry addition is accessed down stairs off the east verandah.|$|R

5000|$|When Homer first meets Mindy, {{he imagines}} her as Venus in Sandro Botticelli's {{painting}} The Birth of Venus. To deal with Homer and Mindy <b>charging</b> <b>room</b> {{service to the}} company, Mr. Burns unleashes flying monkeys {{in the manner of}} the Wicked Witch of the West, as seen in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. However, the attempt fails as the monkeys all fall to their deaths. The scene where Homer meets his guardian angel in the guise of Isaac Newton (who changes into Colonel Klink from Hogan's Heroes because Homer has no idea who Newton is), wondering what his life would have been like if he married Mindy and not Marge, draws from the films It's A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol. When Homer meets Mindy in the elevator, he thinks [...] "unsexy thoughts" [...] to avoid being seduced by her. He imagines Barney in a bikini and humming the theme tune to the American sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. Homer attempts to read the notes for Mindy that he wrote on his hand, but they have smeared out because of sweat. In his attempt, Homer unknowingly babbles the Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, a Buddhist chant in Nichiren Buddhism and SGI. This is a reference to an Akbar and Jeff cartoon, written by Matt Groening, in which the same mantra is used. When Homer notices the sweat, he says he is [...] "sweating like critic Roger Ebert". In the bathroom, Homer sings a rough version of the song [...] "Mandy" [...] by Barry Manilow, replacing [...] "Mandy" [...] with [...] "Mindy". Homer refers to comic strip Ziggy when he wonders if Mindy agrees the title character has become [...] "too preachy". Barry White's song [...] "Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe" [...] is played in the episode's final scene where Homer and Marge make out at the hotel room.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 1900 brick {{cell block}} consisted of six cells, with one padded cell and one larger communal cell. A concrete verandah with timber trim and balustrade ran {{the length of}} the building. A chain link stockade fence separated this area {{from the rest of the}} reserve and allowed for prisoners' exercise yard. In 1940, toilet and shower facilities were added at the eastern end of the building. A <b>charge</b> <b>room</b> was added to the building in 1952 and chain link wire was used to enclose the verandah portion of the cell block.|$|R

50|$|The lock up keepers {{residence}} {{was built}} {{as part of}} the original 1900 Police Station, maintaining the congruity of form and design in the combination of timber, iron and brick materials. The design was typical of turn of the century government accommodation incorporating two bedrooms, living room, kitchen, bathroom and front and rear verandas. In 1940 a <b>charge</b> <b>room</b> was added to the building and in 1962, a laundry and internal toilet were attached. As onsite residencies became redundant, the building was used for office space to complement the main Police Station housed in the former Court House.|$|R
5000|$|To {{the south}} and the rear of the {{residence}} and to the east of the former Court House is a single storey brick cell block. This building has a narrow [...] "L" [...] shaped plan form with a gabled corrugated clad roof and small high level barred windows on the north and east sides. A low pitched verandah with security screening is on the north side. The building was originally documented to have three four cells but appears to have been constructed with five. A <b>charge</b> <b>room</b> was added to the north west corner in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|A {{cell block}} {{consisting}} of four cells, each 12 ft by 8 ft facing a verandah, was constructed {{at the same}} time as the 1919 police station. This building was used for remand of prisoners before trial or awaiting transfer to larger correctional facilities. In 1962, two new cells were added to the building, providing an extra female cell and a female toilet. In the western section of the building, two cells were converted to a <b>charge</b> <b>room</b> and records room; and a male toilet. In 1998 this building was repositioned on the police reserve to accommodate the construction of a new watch house.|$|R
50|$|In December 2001, Energy Products set up {{operations}} in Flint, MI to provide just-in-time delivery of fully charged forklift batteries to supply all the DC power {{necessary to support}} all the electric forklifts operating at General Motors Truck & Bus plant in Flint, MI and General Motors Powertrain in Bay City, MI. This operation allowed the GM plants to eliminate their battery <b>charging</b> <b>rooms</b> {{as well as the}} ownership of forklift batteries, chargers and related equipment and the associated maintenance. During the term of the agreement, Energy Products delivered over 550,000 lbs. of charged batteries every day and returned the discharged batteries to an off-site facility for recharging and maintenance.|$|R

50|$|The {{single-storeyed}} watch {{house and}} watch house keeper's residence were constructed as separate buildings of coherent design {{to the main}} police station. The watch house consisted of cells, <b>charge</b> <b>rooms,</b> laundry, toilet and shower and had an internal exercise yard, creating a compact and spatially introspective building precluding the need for fencing. The watch house keeper's residence was a single-storeyed brick and tile building with a verandah. In 1988 the two buildings were joined and the watch house extended to accommodate more cell space. These alterations allowed the residence {{to be used as}} office space and the capacity of the watch house to be increased. A brick fence with barbed wire top was added for further security at this time.|$|R

40|$|A review. In {{the future}} the demand of {{sustainable}} and low toxic surfactants and solvents will constantly increase. In this article, we review some {{new approaches to}} meet these requirements. Whereas ionic liqs. are often based on imidazolium ions, we will show that there are also much less toxic ones, esp. with choline as cation. Choline salts, even if solid at room temp., can advantageously be mixed with other sustainable solids to form deep eutectic solvents, i. e., "green" liqs. at room temp. Further, choline {{can be used to}} dissolve long-chain carboxylates in water thus maybe permitting new applications of soaps. Alternatively, choline and other natural cations can be part of promising low toxic cationic surfactants. By combining them with ethoxylated carboxylates, interesting <b>charged</b> <b>room</b> temp. liq. surfactant combinations can be obtained. Finally, we shortly discuss the potential benefits of ionic liqs. in microemulsions...|$|R
