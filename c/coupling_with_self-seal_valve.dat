40|$|The {{reported}} {{incidence of}} balanced chromosomal translocations in <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> multiple spontaneous abortions (SABs) ranges from 0 % of 31 %. Because our experience {{has suggested that}} SABs are useful for ascertaining balanced translocations, we report the results of chromosome analyses performed on blood specimens from 440 individuals including 200 couples who were ascertained {{on the basis of}} two or more SABs. Balanced translocations were found in 3. 6 % of these 200 couples. For 122 of these couples, more detailed reproductive histories were available. For 48 <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> two SABs, four (8. 4 %) had balanced translocations; for 37 <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> three SABs, one (2. 7 %) had a balanced translocation; for 20 <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> four SABs, two (10 %) had balanced translocations; and for 17 <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> five or more SABs, one (5. 9 %) had a balanced translocation.

40|$|Objective: Relationship {{education}} (RE) {{usually is}} {{conceived of as}} relationship enhancement for currently satisfied <b>couples,</b> <b>with</b> a goal of helping couples sustain satisfaction. However, RE also might be useful as a brief, indicated intervention for <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> low satisfaction. The current study evaluated the effect of RE on <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> low and high relationship satisfaction. Method: The study was a randomized controlled trial in which 182 couples were randomly assigned to: a book reading control condition (control); RELATE online assessment with feedback and relationship goal setting (RELATE); or RELATE with CoupleCARE (RCC), a flexible delivery skill-based education program. Couples were assessed on relationship satisfaction and individual mental health before and after RE, and through to 4 -year follow-up. Results: <b>Couples</b> <b>with</b> high initial satisfaction showed no effects of RE on satisfaction. RCC but not RELATE increased satisfaction in <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> low initial satisfaction, but effects dissipated between 6 and 12 months after RE. There were no effects of RE on mental health. Conclusion: Flexible delivery RE produces immediate effects as an indicated early intervention for <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> low relationship satisfaction, but the effects attenuate.
