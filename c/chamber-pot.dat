5000|$|For {{visitors}} to the city without their own manservants caddies could be hired to guide them safely by torchlight through the warren of closes in the Old Town at night. Captain Edmund Burt, an English soldier visiting Edinburgh in the 1750s, relates how he was assisted to his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, just as {{the beat of the}} city drum signalled the time for residents to empty their <b>chamber-pots</b> from their windows with the cry of [...] "Gardyloo!" [...] (said to derive from the French gardez de l'eau!).|$|R
5000|$|As {{with all}} English churches, St. Nicholas Cole Abbey became Protestant during the Reformation. Upon the {{accession}} of Queen Mary I, {{it was the}} first church to celebrate Mass (on 23 August 1553). The incumbent rector, Thomas Sowdley, had obtained a licence to marry during the reign of Edward VI and was deprived of his living as a result. In the same month as the coronation of Mary I, John Strype recorded “Another priest called sir Tho. Snowdel, Sowdleywhom they nicknamed [...] "Parson Chicken", was carted through Cheapside, for assoiling an old acquaintance of his in a ditch in Finsbury field; and was at that riding saluted with <b>chamber-pots</b> and rotten eggs”. Sowdley regained his living on the accession of Elizabeth I.|$|R

Why, 'tis a kind of little ease[B], to cramp thy rebellious prentices in; I have seen an usurer's iron chest would hold two on't: A penny looking-glass cannot stand upright in the window, that and the brush tills it: the hat-case must be {{disposed}} under the bed, and the comb-case will hang down, from the ceiling to the floor. If I chance to dine in my chamber, I must stay till I am empty before I can get out: and if I chance to spill the <b>chamber-pot,</b> it will overflow it from top to bottom.|$|E
6000|$|But {{we have a}} more {{particular}} {{account of}} these lodgings in Green Arbor Court from the Rev. Thomas Percy, afterward Bishop of Dromore, and celebrated for his relics of ancient poetry, his beautiful ballads, and other works. During an occasional visit to London, he was introduced to Goldsmith by Grainger, and ever after continued {{one of his most}} steadfast and valued friends. The following is his description of the poet's squalid apartment: [...] "I called on Goldsmith at his lodgings in March, 1759, and found him writing his 'Inquiry' in a miserable, dirty-looking room, in which there was but one chair; and when, from civility, he resigned it to me, he himself was obliged to sit in the window. While we were conversing together some one tapped gently at the door, and, being desired to come in, a poor, ragged little girl, of a very becoming demeanor, entered the room, and, dropping a courtesy, said, 'My mamma sends her compliments and begs the favor of you to lend her a <b>chamber-pot</b> full of coals.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{recurring}} features of John's homilies is {{his emphasis on}} care for the needy. Echoing themes found in the Gospel of Matthew, he calls upon the rich to lay aside materialism in favor of helping the poor, often employing all of his rhetorical skills to shame wealthy people to abandon conspicuous consumption: [...] "Do you pay such honor to your excrements as to receive them into a silver <b>chamber-pot</b> when another man {{made in the image}} of God is perishing in the cold?" ...|$|E
50|$|Bloodworth {{appears to}} have been made a {{scapegoat}} for the failure to arrest the Fire, for until he had the King’s authority he could not pull down houses without being made personally responsible for the cost of rebuilding them, and he was also faced with stiff resistance from the aldermen. When Parliament met he was named to the committees on the bill ‘for providing utensils for the speedy quenching of fire’, no doubt ribald references to the lord mayor’s <b>chamber-pot,</b> and to recommend tax abatements for the stricken metropolis. He asked Joseph Williamson to vindicate his handling of the emergency in the Gazette, and {{to make it clear that}} he was not ‘out of favour’.|$|E
50|$|In 1077, Robert instigated {{his first}} insurrection against {{his father as}} the result of a prank played by his younger {{brothers}} William Rufus and Henry, who had dumped a full <b>chamber-pot</b> over his head. Robert was enraged and, urged on by his companions, started a brawl with his brothers that was only interrupted by the intercession of their father. Feeling that his dignity was wounded, Robert was further angered when King William failed to punish his brothers. The next day Robert and his followers attempted to seize the castle of Rouen. The siege failed, but, when King William ordered their arrest, Robert and his companions took refuge with Hugh of Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais. They were forced to flee again when King William attacked their base at Rémalard.|$|E
5000|$|Observations {{that eating}} {{asparagus}} {{results in a}} detectable change in the odour of urine have been recorded over time. In 1702, Louis Lémery noted [...] "a powerful and disagreeable smell in the urine", whilst John Arbuthnot noted that [...] "asparagus ... affects the urine with a [...] smell." [...] Benjamin Franklin described the odour as [...] "disagreable" [...] in Fart Proudly, his essay on flatulence whilst Marcel Proust claimed that asparagus [...] "transforms my <b>chamber-pot</b> into a flask of perfume." [...] As early as 1891, Marceli Nencki had attributed the smell to methanethiol {{which is also a}} component of flatus and bad breath. [...] More recent research has attributed the odour to a mixture of sulfur-containing metabolites of asparagusic acid which have been detected in urine; these include methanethiol and span at least seven distinct functional groups, as shown in the table below. Most of the metabolites are volatile organic compounds with a high vapour pressure, meaning that they readily enter the gaseous state and spread through the air at room temperature and hence are available for detection by the olfactory system.|$|E

40|$|My {{starting}} point for this paper is a Victorian jug, bowl and <b>chamber-pot</b> set, that I encountered displayed in the toilet of a small Yorkshire Museum. The story of this set is the framework for an exploration of literature on how we invest personal, domestic possessions with meaning. Before starting its life in the museum, the jug, bowl and chamber pot set belonged {{to the secretary of}} the museum board. It was gifted to her by a friend 4 or 5 years ago, and she kept it in her bathroom, filled with potpourri, dried flowers and soaps. When she had her bathroom replaced, there was no longer enough surface space for displaying the set. She moved it into storage in the shed, where she still kept it on view to remind her that it needed a new home. Then she thought of putting it on display in the new museum toilet, on an old wooden cabinet she had in her conservatory. Her decision to move it out of her home and into the museum toilet was a creative and caring one, which triggered the washstand’s transformation from a personal possession, into a public historical artifact. The Victorian washstand set has an interesting -and in many ways ordinary- ‘life’ story, punctuated by transitions in meaning, value and purpose. By writing this paper I will ‘visit’ the most significant transitions, and use my visits as the basis for considering literature that discusses peoples’ relationships to their domestic possessions, and practices of keeping them that influence transitions in meaning. In particular, I am seeking instances where the physical and material properties of an object are discussed in relation to meaning-making. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{personal}} histories of home possessions, and explores the decisions we make to keep and care for them. Through my research I collect first-hand stories of peoples’ possessions. These ‘alternative’ histories of things are idiosyncratic, but are nevertheless valid. The paper will reflect {{on some of these}} stories, and the diverse emotional and practical considerations that inform decisions about the fate of personal possessions. This will be considered alongside literature from design history and anthropology on domestic practices of curating (the selection and display of objects as an ongoing process of individual meaning creation), and caring practices of divesting of unwanted things (e. g. Miller 2008, Whincup 2004, Crewe et al 2005) For the purposes of this paper, I plan to interview one of a team of volunteers who run a small public museum in the UK, which houses an eclectic range of historical artefacts. In the corner of the museum toilet there is a Victorian washstand, displayed with a bowl and jug on the top, and <b>chamber-pot</b> underneath. The washstand set used to belong to the museum secretary, and was kept in her home until she redecorated and it no longer seemed to fit. When the museum acquired funding to build the toilet, she saw an opportunity to rehome the washstand. Her decision to move it out of her home and into the museum was a creative and caring one which transformed the washstand from a personal possession, into a public historical artefact.
