The battle continued from about 7:30 a.m. until 1:30 pm. The defenders had plenty of ammunition, and were well-defended from arrows behind the thick sides of the wagon boxes.|$|E

La Milagrosa was battered by the currents and waves of the tsunami for four days while moving south. Outside Corral the crew rescued six nearly unconscious and dehydrated children on board two boats. The boats found were used to navigate in Valdivia River and Corral Bay but had drifted into the high sea.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlement}} of Corral grew {{out from the}} headquarters of the forts of Corral Bay that were built in 1645 to protect the city of Valdivia. By that time Spanish ships sailed through Valdivia River all the way to Valdivia but Corral soon took over the role of receiving major ships. With the Spanish king's Decree of Free Trade of 1778 cities in Spanish America were allowed to have direct commerce with Spain, which greatly stimulated commerce in Corral that benefited from trade routes across Cape Horn. During the Chilean Independence War Corral and Valdivia functioned together with Chiloé as a prominent royalist strongholds. In 1820 Thomas Cochrane, commanding the newly created Chilean Navy, took Corral and Valdivia by an amphibious attack. From the times of Chile's independence until the early 20th century Corral gained prominence as an important port for traffic between the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean, as Chilean port were declared open to ships sailing under any state flag. After being incorporated into Chile the forts in Corral fell gradually into disuse. Since late colonial <b>times</b> <b>Corral</b> became not only the main port of entrance to the interior of Valdivia but also of Osorno that was founded in 1796.|$|R

Defesa: Curitiba, 10 / 05 / 2016 Inclui referências : f. 48 - 59; 76 - 80 Área de concentração : Nutrição e produção animalResumo: A pecuária de corte é uma atividade representativa no Brasil e contribui expressivamente para a economia. No entanto, os índices de produtividade estão abaixo do desejado e do potencial do país, de modo que a baixa eficiência reprodutiva do rebanho tem colaborado para isto. A dificuldade de se obter um bezerro/vaca/ano, atrelada à alta incidência de anestro pós-parto atua fortemente nesta eficiência reprodutiva insatisfatória. Assim, protocolos que buscam sincronizar o estro dos animais e aumentar a taxa de serviço, os chamados protocolos de Inseminação Artificial em Tempo Fixo (IATF), vêm sendo empregados, oferecendo inúmeras vantagens. Paralelo ao uso dos protocolos de sincronização, que buscam melhorar a eficiência reprodutiva, um fator que comprovadamente diminui a fertilidade e acontece rotineiramente na pecuária é o estresse. Os fatores liberados nesse mecanismo agem diretamente sobre o eixo hipotálamo-hipófise-gonadal, inibindo a reprodução. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram verificar se os agentes estressores que ocorrem no manejo da IATF (Inseminação Artificial em Tempo Fixo) e os níveis séricos de {{cortisol}} têm efeito sobre as taxas de prenhez em fêmeas Bos indicus. Foram utilizadas 261 vacas Bos indicus, multíparas, saudáveis, lactantes paridas (30 a 45 dias pós-parto), com idade média de 6, 6 (± 1, 45) anos e escore de condição corporal (ECC) entre 2, 5 e 3 (na escala de 1 a 5, em que 1 = muito magra e 5 = muito gorda). O mesmo protocolo de IATF foi aplicado a todos os animais. Foram utilizados três inseminadores e sêmen de um único touro. O diagnóstico de gestação foi realizado de 28 a 32 dias após a inseminação, com uso de ultrassom transretal. Foram considerados agentes estressores: Tempo no Brete, Tempo no Tronco, Tempo Total, Distância Invernada Curral, Distância Curral Invernada, Distância Total Percorrida, Tempo sem Bezerro e Tempo no Curral. Para verificar se houve correlação entre o horário de coleta e os níveis de cortisol foi realizada a correlação de Spearman. O efeito dos agentes estressores sobre a probabilidade de gestação foi aferido por meio da análise de regressão logística, enquanto que o efeito dos níveis de cortisol sobre a gestação foi determinado pelo teste Mann- Whitney. Houve efeito do meio (inseminador, fazenda e mês) e do Tempo no Tronco sobre as chances de prenhez (p 0, 05). Palavras-chave: eficiência reprodutiva; estresse; IATF; manejo no curral; reprodução; tempo no tronco. Abstract: The {{beef cattle}} livestock is a representative activity in Brazil and contributes {{significantly to the}} economy. However, productivity rates are below desired and below {{the potential of the}} country, so that the herd's low reproductive efficiency has contributed to this. The difficulty of obtaining a calf / cow / year, linked to the high incidence of postpartum anestrus acts strongly on this poor reproductive efficiency. Therefore, the protocols that seek synchronize the animals estrus and increase the service charge, the so called protocols of Fixed-Time Artificial Insemination (FTAI), have been employed, offering numerous advantages. Parallel to the use of synchronization protocols which seek the improvement of the reproductive efficiency, a proven factor that decreases the fertility and happens routinely in livestock is stress. The factors released in this mechanism act directly on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by inhibiting the reproduction. The objectives of this work were to verify if the stressing agents occurring during the handling of the Fixed-Time Artificial Insemination (FTAI) and the serum cortisol levels {{have an effect on the}} pregnancy rate of female Bos indicus. There were used 261 suckling cows Bos indicus (30 to 45 days postpartum), multiparous, healthy, with ages averaging 6. 6 (± 1. 45) years and with body condition score between 2. 5 and 3 (in the scale of 1 to 5, in which 1 =very thin and 5 =very fat). The same FTAI protocol was applied to all animals. Three inseminators and the semen of one only bull were used. The pregnancy diagnosis was made by transrectal ultrasonography 28 to 32 days after the insemination. The following stressing agents were considered: time in the pen, time in the chute, total time, distance between pasture and corral, distance between <b>corral</b> and pasture, <b>time</b> without calf, <b>time</b> in the <b>corral.</b> The Spearman correlation was used to verify if there was a relation between the collection time and the cortisol levels. The effect of the stressing agents on the pregnancy probability was measured by logistic regression analysis, while the effect of the cortisol levels on pregnancy was determined by the Mann-Whitney test. There was an effect of the means (inseminator, farm and month) and the time in the chute on the pregnancy rates (p 0. 05).
