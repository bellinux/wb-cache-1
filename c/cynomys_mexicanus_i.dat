50|$|The Mexican {{prairie dog}} (<b>Cynomys</b> <b>mexicanus)</b> is a diurnal {{burrowing}} rodent native to Mexico. Treatment as an agricultural pest {{has led to}} its status as an endangered species. They {{are closely related to}} squirrels, chipmunks, and marmots.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a special}} case of {{allopatric}} speciation, peripatric speciation is often invoked for instances of isolation in refugia (caused by glaciation) as small populations become isolated due to habitat fragmentation such as with North American red (Picea rubens) and black (Picea mariana) spruce [...] or the prairie dogs <b>Cynomys</b> <b>mexicanus</b> and <b>Cynomys</b> ludovicianus.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{present in}} this {{ecoregion}} include the Mexican prairie dog (<b>Cynomys</b> <b>mexicanus),</b> Saussure's shrew (Sorex saussurei), yellow-faced pocket gopher (Pappogeomys castanops), Allen's squirrel (Sciurus alleni), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) and coyote (Canis latrans). Birds {{such as the}} burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), hooded oriole (Icterus cucullates), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), long-billed thrasher (Toxostoma longirostre), hooded yellowthroat (Geothlypis nelsoni), blue bunting (Cyanocompsa parellina) and olive sparrow (Arremonops rufivirgatus) are resident.|$|R

Mexican black bears (Ursus americanus eremicus) and cougars inhabit the Sierra de Picachos. The {{southern part of}} the ecoregion is an Endemic Bird Area and is home to the red-crowned amazon (Amazona viridigenalis), crimson-collared grosbeak (Rhodothraupis celaeno), Altamira yellowthroat (Geothlypis flavovelata), and Tamaulipas crow (Corvus imparatus).|$|R
50|$|Using a phylogeographic {{approach}} {{paired with}} ecological niche models (i.e. prediction and identification of expansion and contraction species ranges into suitable habitats {{based on current}} ecological niches, correlated with fossil and molecular data), researchers found that the prairie dog species <b>Cynomys</b> <b>mexicanus</b> speciated peripatrically from Cynomys ludovicianus approximately 230,000 years ago. North American glacial cycles promoted range expansion and contraction of the prairie dogs, leading to the isolation of a relic population in a refugium located in the present day Coahuila, Mexico. This distribution and paleobiogeographic pattern correlates with other species expressing similar biographic range patterns such as with the Sorex cinereus complex.|$|R
50|$|Codex Vindobonensis <b>Mexicanus</b> <b>I,</b> {{also known}} as Codex Vindobonensis C, or Codex <b>Mexicanus</b> <b>I</b> is an accordion-folded pre-Columbian piece of Mixtec writing. It is a ritual-calendrical and genealogical {{document}} dated to the 14th century.|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequences of}} the cytochrome b gene {{and of the}} control region are described for <b>Cynomys</b> <b>mexicanus</b> and Spermophilus spilosoma. The cytochrome b gene was characterized {{by the presence of}} eight non-synonymous substitutions at the inter-generic level, presented mainly in the transmembrane zone (87 %). The control region was characterized by the presence of the conserved blocks, ETAS 1 and CSB 1; by the absence of repetitive sequences and by the conserved blocks, ETAS 2, CSB 2 and CSB 3. Most of the inter-generic variation (47. 9 %) was observed in the ETAS domain. The structure of the control region was similar to that of phylogenetic related specie...|$|R

50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{changed its}} owners and places {{in which it}} was housed. As a result, its name was often changed (18 times). It was known as Codex Constantinopolitanus, Codex Byzantinus, and Codex <b>Mexicanus</b> <b>I.</b> The last name is more often used in the present day.|$|R
50|$|Cipactli (Cipactli) 'Crocodile' or 'Caiman', was {{the first}} day of the Aztec divinatory count of 13 X 20 days (the tonalpohualli), and Cipactonal 'Sign of Cipactli' was {{considered}} to have been the first diviner. In Aztec cosmology, the crocodile symbolized the earth floating in the primeval waters. According to one Aztec tradition, Teocipactli 'Divine Crocodile' was the name of a survivor of the flood who rescued himself in a canoe and again peopled the earth. In the Mixtec Vienna Codex (Codex Vindobonensis <b>Mexicanus</b> <b>I),</b> Crocodile is a day associated with dynastic beginnings.|$|R
40|$|Pre-colonial Mixtec codices vividly and colourfully {{tell about}} the history and {{religion}} of Mixtec polities and have, {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century, attracted the interest of many scholars. Indeed, these historical narratives provide a unique window into ancient Mesoamerican concepts of time, history, drama, worldview and memory. Incorporated in these codices are numerous auditive scenes: events in the story line in which musical behaviour plays an important role. The present thesis examines these scenes, aiming to get a more comprehensive and arguably more full-fledged understanding of musical behaviour in pre-colonial Mixtec society. Since musical behaviour plays an important role in the formation of personal as well as social identities, research into musical behaviour of past cultures can contribute significantly to the knowledge about the worldviews of these cultures. Mixtec codices provide excellent means for this, since the stories in these manuscripts not only tell about individual actions and events in a certain time period, but also include important information about how these events related to a wider, socio-cultural context. By means of a novel, comprehensive approach, consisting of an adapted variant of the Critical Discourse Analysis methodology, this thesis analyses auditive scenes from five Mixtec codices: the Codex Bodley, Codex Colombino-Becker I, Codex Selden, Codex Vindobonensis <b>Mexicanus</b> <b>I</b> & Codex Zouche-Nuttall. As such, this thesis examines the role of musical behaviour contained in auditive scenes of pre-colonial Mixtec codices on the levels of the text, their conveyance and their socio-cultural context. The results of these analyses show that musical behaviour played an important role in codices at a variety of levels. Indeed, this thesis shows that, on the basis of a bi-directional relationship, textual analyses of auditive scenes in Mixtec codices can provide important tools for understanding the role musical behaviour played vis-à-vis socio-cultural and ideological dynamics. The oral performance (discursive practice) through which the codices’ stories were reproduced, distributed and consumed was the binding element between the codices’ text and the socio-cultural context. On the basis of these findings, recommendations for further research are provided...|$|R
40|$|Two {{new species}} of the doryctine genus Iare, <b>I.</b> <b>mexicanus</b> sp. nov. and I. cheguevarai sp. nov., are genetically and morphologically {{described}} from a tropical dry forest in Jalisco, Mexico. Iare belokobylskiji Marsh is also reported for the latter region. These species represent the northernmost distribution records for the genus. A simultaneous Bayesian analysis with COI and 28 S DNA sequence data recovered the three examined species of Iare within a single clade, though with low support. This genus appears nested within a large doryctine Neotropical clade as sister group of a cluster containing species of Callihormius Ashmead, Leluthia Cameron, Histeromeroides Marsh and Panama Marsh...|$|R
40|$|Six {{species of}} Paragonimus are {{presently}} known in Latin America. They {{include the following}} : P. mexicanus, P. peruvianus, P. amazonicus, P. inca, P. ecuadoriensis, and P. caliensis. Among them, P. peruvianus has been recognized as a synonym of P. mexicanus by Miyazaki himself, the discoverer of P. peruvianus. Furthermore, P. ecuadoriensis is suggestive of a synonym of P. <b>mexicanus</b> by Miyazaki. <b>I</b> also regard P. amazonicus, P. inca and P. caliensis as dependent species. I entertain a strong suspicion that these are synonymous with P. mexicanus. Therefore, P. mexicanus is the only species that distinctly inhabits Latin America. In the classification, in particular Paragonimus, {{we have to recognize}} the variations in the same species. 現在までにラテンアメリカの肺吸虫はP. mexicanus, P. peruvianus, P. amazonicus, P. inca, P. ecuadoriensis, P. caliensisの 6 種が報告されてきたが,そのうちP. peruvianusは命名者である宮崎自身によってP. mexicanusのシノニムと訂正された｡さらにP. ecuadoriensisもP. mexicanusのシノニムであると示唆されている｡P. amazonicus, P. inca, P. caliensisもその分類には些細を形態上の違いを取り上げており,著者はP. mexicanusのシノニムの可能性が強いと考えている｡したがって､現在のラテンアメリカに明確に分布している肺吸虫種はP. mexicanus 1 種のみである｡肺吸虫の分類においては特に種内の変異を認めるべきである...|$|R
