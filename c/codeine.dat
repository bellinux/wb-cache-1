5|$|Barely Real is the 1992 {{extended}} play (EP) by the American indie {{rock band}} <b>Codeine.</b> After releasing their previous album Frigid Stars LP in 1990, the group accepted {{an invitation from}} the quartet Bastro to tour in Europe in 1991. Following the tour the group was invited to record a single for Sub Pop Singles Club and attempted to record their follow-up album The White Birch in 1992. The recording sessions proved to be disastrous for the group since it found themselves often with unusable tracks over several different studios. As <b>Codeine</b> could not record enough material for a full-length album, they decided to release what tracks they had as an EP.|$|E
5|$|Once there, Innes becomes acquainted over {{drinks with}} a former boxer named Nelson Byrne. The job, {{originally}} intended to be looking after Wooley, becomes a sinister operation as Innes learns there may be impropriety related to the fight. Innes deals with his dependence on <b>codeine</b> and alcohol along with Wooley's anger management problems. Innes finds himself in a difficult situation in an unfamiliar city, suffers a gunshot wound and his charge Wooley is involuntarily subdued with medication and kidnapped. Innes becomes the suspect in a murder investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department, finds and rescues Wooley and learns that his supposed friend Byrne was the culprit. After being exonerated by the police, Innes escorts Wooley back to England.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as <b>codeine,</b> as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as <b>codeine,</b> dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> {{preparations}} {{require a}} prescription in India. A preparation of paracetamol and <b>codeine</b> {{is available in}} India. <b>Codeine</b> is also present in various cough syrups as <b>codeine</b> phosphate including chlorpheniramine maleate. Pure <b>codeine</b> is also available as <b>codeine</b> sulphate tablets. <b>Codeine</b> containing cough medicine has been banned in India with effect from 14 March 2016. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has found no proof of its efficacy against cough control.|$|E
25|$|In the Alkaloid Extraction Unit only base {{morphine}} is produced. In {{the adjacent}} Derivatives Unit {{half of the}} morphine extracted is converted to morphine hydrochloride, <b>codeine,</b> <b>codeine</b> phosphate, <b>codeine</b> sulphate, <b>codeine</b> hydrochloride, morphine sulphate, ethylmorphine hydrochloride.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> and/or {{its major}} {{metabolites}} may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor therapy, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning or assist in a medico-legal death investigation. Drug abuse screening programs generally test urine, hair, sweat or saliva. Many commercial opiate screening tests directed at morphine cross-react appreciably with <b>codeine</b> and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish <b>codeine</b> from other opiates and opioids. It {{is important to note}} that <b>codeine</b> usage results in significant amounts of morphine as an excretion product. Furthermore, heroin contains <b>codeine</b> (or acetyl <b>codeine)</b> as an impurity and its use will result in excretion of small amounts of <b>codeine.</b> Poppy seed foods represent yet another source of low levels of <b>codeine</b> in one's biofluids. Blood or plasma <b>codeine</b> concentrations are typically in the 50–300µg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 700–7000µg/L in chronic users and 1000–10,000µg/L in cases of acute fatal over dosage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> is also {{commonly}} marketed {{in products}} containing <b>codeine</b> with other pain killers or muscle relaxers, {{as well as}} <b>codeine</b> mixed with phenacetin (Emprazil with <b>codeine</b> No. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, and others, {{as well as more}} complex mixtures, including such mixtures as aspirin + paracetamol + <b>codeine</b> ± caffeine ± antihistamines and other agents, such as those mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|Preparations of <b>codeine</b> in Iran {{normally}} {{comes with}} paracetamol or guaifenesin, {{and can be}} purchased over-the-counter. Pure <b>codeine</b> is also available as <b>codeine</b> phosphate 30mg tablets and special permit required to purchasing. Iran's deputy health minister reported that <b>codeine</b> combinations is Iran's best selling OTC medication.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> {{preparations}} {{are available}} as {{over the counter}} pharmacy medicines in Sri Lanka. The most common preparation is Panadeine, which contains 500mg of Paracetamol and 8mg of <b>Codeine.</b> But cough syrup containing <b>Codeine</b> is banned, even with a prescription.|$|E
25|$|The methyl {{group that}} makes {{morphine}} into <b>codeine</b> {{can be removed}} or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make <b>codeine</b> analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. <b>Codeine</b> analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in <b>codeine</b> and morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone, nicocodeine and nicomorphine, dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine, etc.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>codeine</b> is {{regulated}} by the Controlled Substances Act. Federal law dictates that <b>codeine</b> be a Schedule II controlled substance when used in products for pain-relief that contain <b>codeine</b> alone or more than 90mg per dosage unit. Tablets of <b>codeine</b> in combination with aspirin or paracetamol (paracetamol/Tylenol) made for pain relief are listed as Schedule III (allowing for electronic fills and refills without a physical paper-copy of the physician ordered prescription); and cough syrups are Schedule III or V, depending on formula. The paracetamol/codeine pain-relief elixir (trade name Tylenol Elixir with <b>Codeine)</b> is a Schedule IV controlled substance.|$|E
25|$|As an analgesic, <b>codeine</b> compares weakly {{to other}} opiates. Related to <b>codeine</b> {{in other ways}} are codoxime, thebacon, codeine-N-oxide (genocodeine), related to the {{nitrogen}} morphine derivatives as is <b>codeine</b> methobromide, and heterocodeine, which is a drug six times stronger than morphine and 72 times stronger than <b>codeine</b> due to a small re-arrangement of the molecule, viz. moving the methyl group from the 3 to the 6 position on the morphine carbon skeleton.|$|E
25|$|Some {{states have}} chosen to {{classify}} Schedule V <b>codeine</b> preparations into a more restrictive schedule in order to cut down the abuse of prescription <b>codeine</b> preparations. Minnesota, for instance, has chosen to reclassify Schedule V <b>codeine</b> preparations (such as Cheratussin) as a Schedule II controlled substance.|$|E
25|$|Neat <b>codeine</b> and higher-strength <b>codeine</b> {{formulations}} {{are generally}} prescription-only medicines (POM) {{meaning that the}} sale of such products is restricted under the Medicines Act 1968. Lower-strength products containing combinations of up to 12.8mg of <b>codeine</b> per dosage unit, combined with paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin are available over the counter at pharmacies. <b>Codeine</b> linctus of 15mg per 5ml is also available at some pharmacies, although a purchaser would have to request it specifically from the pharmacist.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> tablets or {{preparations}} {{require a}} prescription in Italy. Preparations of paracetamol and <b>codeine</b> {{are available in}} Italy as Co-Efferalgan and Tachidol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> tablets or {{preparations}} {{require a}} prescription in Spain, {{although this is}} often not enforced and many pharmacies will sell <b>codeine</b> products without the requirement of a prescription.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> is metabolised by O- and N-demethylation in {{the liver}} to {{morphine}} and norcodeine. <b>Codeine</b> and its metabolites are excreted almost entirely by the kidney, mainly as conjugates with glucuronic acid.|$|E
25|$|For example, we {{have two}} {{patients}} who are taking <b>codeine</b> for pain relief. <b>Codeine</b> is a prodrug, so it requires conversion from its inactive form to its active form. The active form of <b>codeine</b> is morphine, which provides the therapeutic effect of pain relief. If person A receives one *1 allele each from mother and father to code for the CYP2D6 gene, then that person is considered to have an extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotype, as allele *1 is considered to have a normal-function (this would be represented as CYP2D6 *1/*1). If person B {{on the other hand}} had received one *1 allele from the mother and a *4 allele from the father, that individual would be an Intermediate Metabolizer (IM) (the genotype would be CYP2D6 *1/*4). Although both individuals are taking the same dose of <b>codeine,</b> person B could potentially lack the therapeutic benefits of <b>codeine</b> due to the decreased conversion rate of <b>codeine</b> to its active counterpart morphine.|$|E
25|$|Injectable <b>codeine</b> is {{available}} for subcutaneous or intramuscular injection only; intravenous injection is contraindicated as this can result in non-immune mast-cell degranulation and resulting anaphylactoid reaction. <b>Codeine</b> suppositories are also marketed in some countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> is {{produced}} {{in the human body}} along the same biosynthetic pathway as morphine. Urinary concentrations of endogenous <b>codeine</b> and morphine have been found to significantly increase in individuals taking L-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Another {{means of}} using or misusing {{morphine}} {{is to use}} chemical reactions {{to turn it into}} heroin or another stronger opioid. Morphine can, using a technique reported in New Zealand (where the initial precursor is <b>codeine)</b> and elsewhere known as home-bake, be turned into what is usually a mixture of morphine, heroin, 3-monoacetylmorphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, and <b>codeine</b> derivatives like acetylcodeine if the process is using morphine made from demethylating <b>codeine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, <b>codeine</b> {{has been}} found as an {{endogenous}} compound, along with morphine, in the brains of non human primates with depolarized neurons, indicating that <b>codeine</b> may function as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 <b>codeine</b> is a Class B {{controlled}} substance or a Class A drug when prepared for injection. The possession of {{controlled substance}}s {{without a prescription}} is a criminal offence. However, certain preparations of <b>codeine</b> are exempt from this restriction under Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. It is thus legal to possess <b>codeine</b> without a prescription, provided that it is compounded {{with at least one}} other active or inactive ingredient and that the dosage of each tablet, capsule, etc. does not exceed 100mg or 2.5% concentration in the case of liquid preparations. The exemptions do not to apply to any preparation of <b>codeine</b> designed for injection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> is {{not allowed}} without a medical prescription. <b>Codeine</b> is sold under the name Farmacod and its {{concentration}} does not exceed 15mg. There is a known combination of acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol and <b>codeine</b> phosphate hemihydrate named Aspaco that is allowed without a medical prescription but its case is signed with an exclamation red symbol which means that driving won't be allowed during treatment. There are no sanctions whether the drug is given without a prescription.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{increased}} metabolism of <b>codeine</b> to morphine, ultrarapid metabolizers (those possessing more than 2 functional {{copies of the}} CYP2D6 allele) {{are at increased risk}} of adverse drug effects related to morphine toxicity. Guidelines released by the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) advise against administering <b>codeine</b> to ultrarapid metabolizers, where this genetic information is available. The CPIC also suggests that <b>codeine</b> use be avoided in poor metabolizers, due to its lack of efficacy in this group.|$|E
25|$|Patient B is a {{woman who}} gave birth by {{caesarian}} section. Her physician prescribed <b>codeine</b> for post-caesarian pain. She took the standard prescribed dose, however experienced nausea and dizziness while she was taking <b>codeine.</b> She also noticed that her breastfed infant was lethargic and feeding poorly. When the patient mentioned these symptoms to her physician, they recommended that she discontinue <b>codeine</b> use. Within a few days, both the patient and her infant’s symptoms were no longer present. It is assumed that if the patient underwent a pharmacogenomic test, it would have revealed she may have had a duplication of the gene CYP2D6 placing her in the Ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) category, explaining her ADRs to <b>codeine</b> use.|$|E
25|$|While <b>codeine</b> can be {{directly}} extracted from opium, its original source, most <b>codeine</b> is synthesized from the much more abundant morphine {{through the process of}} O-methylation, through a process first completed in the late 20th century by Robert C. Corcoran and Junning Ma.|$|E
25|$|CYP2D6 {{converts}} <b>codeine</b> into morphine, {{which then}} undergoes glucuronidation. Life-threatening intoxication, including respiratory depression requiring intubation, can develop over {{a matter of}} days in patients who have multiple functional alleles of CYP2D6, resulting in ultra-rapid metabolism of opioids such as <b>codeine</b> into morphine.|$|E
25|$|Codeine-only {{products}} {{can be obtained}} with a prescription as a time release tablet. <b>Codeine</b> is also marketed in cough syrups with zero to a half-dozen other active ingredients, and a linctus (e.g., Paveral) {{for all of the}} uses for which <b>codeine</b> is indicated.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark <b>codeine</b> is {{sold over}} the counter with max 9.6mg in mixture. The item is given {{over the counter}}, no prescriptions. The strongest {{available}} over the counter preparation containing <b>codeine</b> has 9.6mg (with aspirin, brand name Kodimagnyl); anything stronger requires a prescription.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> {{can be used}} as a {{recreational}} drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> is used {{to treat}} mild to {{moderate}} pain and to relieve cough. <b>Codeine</b> {{is also used to}} treat diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, although loperamide (which is available without a prescription for milder diarrhea), diphenoxylate, paregoric or even laudanum are more frequently used to treat severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1832 by Pierre Jean Robiquet. In 2013 about 361,000 kilograms of <b>codeine</b> were produced while 249,000 kilograms were used. This makes it the most commonly taken opiate. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.04 and 0.29 USD per dose as of 2014. In the United States it costs about one dollar a dose. <b>Codeine</b> occurs naturally and makes up about 2% of opium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> is used {{in illegal}} drug {{laboratories}} to make morphine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Codeine</b> was {{isolated}} in 1832 by Pierre Jean Robiquet.|$|E
