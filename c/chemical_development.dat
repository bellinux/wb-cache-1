25|$|Meanwhile, a British inventor, William Fox Talbot, {{had succeeded}} in making crude but {{reasonably}} light-fast silver images on paper as early as 1834 but had kept his work secret. After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the calotype process, which used the <b>chemical</b> <b>development</b> of a latent image to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent negative {{which could be used}} to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as Daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera. Talbot's famous tiny paper negative of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey, {{one of a number of}} camera photographs he made in the summer of 1835, may be the oldest camera negative in existence.|$|E

[...] He returned to Berlin and joined the AEG board in 1899, becoming a leading industrialist in the late German Empire and early Weimar Republic periods. [...] In 1903 his younger and much more entrepreneurial brother Erich Rathenau died. [...] Broken-hearted his father had to be content with Walther's help instead. Walther Rathenau was a highly successful industrialist: in a decade he set up power stations in Manchester (England), Buenos Aires (Argentina), and Baku (northern Persia, later run by the Soviet Union). [...] AEG acquired ownership of a streetcar company in Madrid; and in East Africa he purchased an English firm. [...] In total he was involved with 84 companies worldwide. AEG was particularly celebrated for vertical integration methods and a strong emphasis on supply chain management. [...] Rathenau developed an expertise in business restructuring, turning companies around. [...] Superb organizational capabilities made his company very rich, but it also produced the standards for new <b>chemical</b> <b>development,</b> such as Acetone in Manchester. [...] He made large profits from commercial lending on an industrial scale, which were reinvested in capital and assets.|$|E

50|$|In 1854, Reade {{testified at}} the Talbot v.

In his testimony, however, Reade upheld Talbot's originality, explaining that while he had used gallic acid for preprocessing the light-sensitive paper, Talbot {{was the first to}} discover that gallic acid can reveal the latent image in an already exposed paper, i.e. {{he was the first to}} develop a photographic material. In fact, Reade erred in making the latter broad statement, as the earlier Daguerreotype process also involved the <b>chemical</b> <b>development</b> of an initially invisible latent image.|$|E
50|$|One {{particular}} type of digital system uses a photostimulable phosphor plate (aka PSP - Phosphor Plate) {{in place of the}} film. After X-ray exposure the plate (sheet) is placed in a special scanner where the latent formed image is retrieved point by point and digitized, using a laser light scanning. The digitized images are stored and displayed on the computer screen. This method is in between old film based technology and the current direct digital imaging technology. It is similar to the film process because it involves the same image support handling and differs because the <b>chemical</b> <b>development</b> process is replaced by the scanning process. This is not much faster than film processing and the resolution and sensitivity performances are contested. However it has the clear advantage of being able to fit with any existing equipment without any modification because it replaces just the existing film.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. XANES {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} techniques for investigating the active centres of non-crystalline systems such as synthetic catalysts and enzymes. We have investigated XANES for an active species in the Ni-catalyzed polymerization of isocyanides, the activated Ni (t-amylisocyanide) complex, using two of the most popular theoretical approaches. This is a very large cluster for which it is extremely difficult to derive a converged solution using the Finite Difference Method. The cluster has been linked to important <b>chemical</b> <b>developments</b> for catalysts for isocyanide polymerization. Predicted XANES for the nano-cluster are compared with experimental data, providing an important test for different theoretical approaches. Developments of a finite element method gave excellent agreement with the experimental data, while simpler models were relatively unsuccessful...|$|R
50|$|A {{case study}} of {{particular}} interest involves {{the development of a}} fully continuous process by the process chemistry group at Eli Lilly and Company for an asymmetric hydrogenation to access a key intermediate in the synthesis of LY500307, a potent ERβ agonist that is entering clinical trials for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, in addition to a regimen of standard antipsychotic medications. In this key synthetic step, a chiral rhodium-catalyst is used for the enantioselective reduction of a tetrasubstituted olefin. After extensive optimization, it was found that {{in order to reduce the}} catalyst loading to a commercially practical level, the reaction required hydrogen pressure up to 70 atm. The pressure limit of a standard chemical reactor is about 10 atm, although high-pressure batch reactors may be acquired at significant capital cost for reactions up to 100 atm. Especially for an API in the early stages of <b>chemical</b> <b>development,</b> such an investment clearly bears a large risk.|$|E
5000|$|Having been {{successful}} with Velox, Baekeland {{set out to}} find another promising area for <b>chemical</b> <b>development.</b> As he had done with Velox, he looked for a problem that offered [...] "the best chance for the quickest possible results". [...] Asked why he entered the field of synthetic resins, Baekeland answered that his intention was to make money. By the 1900s, chemists had begun to recognize that many of the natural resins and fibers were polymeric, a term introduced in 1833 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius. Adolf von Baeyer had experimented with phenols and aldehydes in 1872, particularly Pyrogallol and benzaldehyde. [...] He created a [...] "black guck" [...] which he considered useless and irrelevant to his search for synthetic dyes. Baeyer's student, Werner Kleeberg, experimented with phenol and formaldehyde in 1891, but as Baekeland noted [...] "could not crystallize this mess, nor purify it to constant composition, nor in fact do anything with it once produced".|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{mechanisms}} for producing structures in resist materials is, in general, bond scissioning in positive resists such as PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), or cross-linking in negative resists such as SU-8. In positive resists the regions damaged by protons are removed by <b>chemical</b> <b>development</b> to produce structures, whereas in negative resists the development procedures remove the undamaged resist leaving the cross-linked structures behind. In e-beam writing, {{the primary and}} secondary electrons create the scissioning or cross-linking, whereas in p-beam writing the damage is caused by short range proton-induced secondary electrons. The proton fluence required for exposure varies from 30-150 nCmm−2 depending on the resist material, and is around 80-100 times less than that required by e-beam writing. Remark: The unit of the fluence in proton beam writing is usually given in [...] "charge/area". It can be converted into [...] "particles/area" [...] by dividing [...] "charge/area" [...] by the charge of a proton, Q = 1,602·10−19C.|$|E

Nanotechnology processes in the recent years have enabled paradigm changing developments in environmental science, medicine and importantly, catalysis. One of the key areas for achieving sustainability is to explore the generation of efficient catalytic processes, via nano-catalysis [1] as a viable option; catalysis has been an integral part of what is now defined more clearly under nanotechnology domain [2].|$|R
