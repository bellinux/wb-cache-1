40|$|<b>Cloned</b> <b>animals</b> {{are often}} {{understood}} as 'models' whose embodiments demonstrate {{the viability of}} somatic cell nuclear transfer and its applicability to a species body. In conceptualizing models through the trope of technoscience, Evelyn Fox Keller has argued that scientific models are not simply cognitive representations of something else, but are also embodiments of action and practice that constitute the kinds of scientific questions that can be asked and how those questions can be answered. Drawing on Keller's language, I would say that, while we understand <b>cloned</b> <b>animals</b> as 'models of' somatic cell nuclear transfer, little empirical scholarship has explored what these animals are 'models for'. This article asks what practices <b>cloned</b> <b>animals</b> embody, focusing on endeavours to clone endangered wildlife in the United States. Based on a multi-sited, ethnographic study, I show that these animals are models for conducting science in zoological parks, which entails questions regarding the kinds of knowledge practices that {{should be used to}} reproduce zoos and, in turn, meaningfully reconstitute wildlife. Based on this analysis, I contend that <b>cloned</b> <b>animals</b> not only model technique and scientific practices, but also new assemblages in the reproduction of zoos and, in turn, nature...|$|R

5000|$|... ● Student author Miriam Swedlow {{argues that}} Roslin would not prevent the {{patenting}} of extinct animals, {{such as the}} dodo, passenger pigeon, or wooly mammoth, because the <b>cloned</b> <b>animal</b> would not be identical to a natural animal. Like the cDNA in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., large portions of the genome of an extinct animal {{would need to be}} guessed at and extrapolated from non-extinct animals, because the DNA recoverable from fossils is decayed. Therefore, the [...] "re-created animal will not be an exact genetic copy of an animal that already exists and will have different structural characteristics than the original species." [...] They would therefore be comparable to artificial animals such as the Oncomouse, which was patented. Moreover, the [...] "fragile nature of extinct animal DNA allows for multiple avenues of differentiation" [...] from the original, now-extinct animal, preempting none.|$|E

40|$|In {{the area}} of risks to human health, the {{question}} is whether products from <b>cloned</b> <b>animals</b> or their progeny couldhaveadverseandunwantedeffectsonhumansand/ or the environment. The research so far shows {{that this is not the}} case (U. S. Food and Drug Administration 2008, European Food Safety Agency 2008). The socioeconomic concerns relate especially to agricultural applications of <b>animal</b> <b>cloning</b> and typically focus on the risk that <b>animal</b> <b>cloning</b> could further trends within agriculture toward fewer players in the market, greater specialization, and a deeper divide between rich and poor countries. Finally, there are concerns that our increasing utilization of animals will reduce our ability to relate to them as anything other than providers for human needs. We will thereby lose a sense of kinship and responsibility toward other living beings—features deemed essential to the development of a sound human psyche (Gjerris and Sandøe 2007). The ethical concerns regarding risks to animals can be divided into two aspects: risks to animal welfare and risks to animal integrity and naturalness. The low success rates tell a story of huge welfare problems related to the technology. Many animals are stillborn or born with health defects. Two things should be noted, though. First, the animal-welfare problems related to cloning are not special to cloning. They are the same as experienced with other reproductive technologies. It is just that they occur more often in cloning. Second, most of the problems seem to be related to the first generation of <b>animals.</b> Once <b>cloned</b> <b>animals</b> have reached a certain age, they seem to develop like conventional animals. Similarly, the welfare problems do not occur in animals sexually bred from <b>cloned</b> <b>animals</b> (Vajta and Gjerris 2006). Still, the welfare problems in cloning are serious enough that the ethical advisory committee for the European Union has suggested that <b>animal</b> <b>cloning</b> is justified only in researc...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{feature of}} cloning {{differentiating}} a clone {{from the original}} is altered epigenetics: primarily alterations to DNA and histones that result in changes in gene expression, which importantly can result in changes in appearance and behavior. Since epigenetics is different in different tissues, and changes {{over the course of}} an animals life the original pattern of gene expression that produced a particular animal is distorted in its clone, particularly if the tissue used for cloning was taken when the animal was older. [...] Finally, currently most cloning techniques poorly preserve epigenetic modifications (though there are some that are better—for example altering epigenetics is a primary mode by which dedifferentiation techniques dedifferentiate cells, so expect a somewhat different phenotype with these). The bottom line being that while a <b>cloned</b> <b>animal</b> may be more similar to the original than its sibling, it will not be as similar as an identical twin (whose epigenetics are very similar); and there may be ways of mitigating these differences to some extent.|$|E
5000|$|Dolly was cloned in 1996 by Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell {{and colleagues}} at the Roslin Institute, part of the University of Edinburgh Scotland. BBC News and Scientific American called Dolly [...] "the world's most famous sheep," [...] The cloning method Campbell and Wilmut used to create Dolly {{constituted}} a breakthrough in scientific discovery. Known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, this process involves removing the nucleus of a regular body cell and implanting that nucleus into an egg cell that has had its cell nucleus removed. A nucleus is the organelle that holds a cell's genetic material (its DNA). Campbell and Wilmut found that if the donor, somatic cell is arrested in {{the stage of the}} cell cycle where it is dormant and non-replicating (the quiescent phase) prior to nuclear transfer, the resulting fused cell will develop into an embryo. The resulting <b>cloned</b> <b>animal</b> is an exact genetic replica of the adult mammal from which the somatic cell nucleus was taken.|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{reprogramming}} {{requires the}} removal of epigenetic modifications imposed on the chromatin during cellular differentiation and division. The mammalian oocyte can reverse these alterations {{to a state of}} totipotency, allowing the production of viable cloned offspring from somatic cell nuclei. To determine whether nuclear reprogramming is complete in cloned animals, we assessed the telomerase activity and telomere length status in cloned embryos, fetuses, and newborn offspring derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer. In this report, we show that telomerase activity was significantly (P 0. 05). These results demonstrate that cloned embryos inherit genomic modifications acquired during the donor nuclei's in vivo and in vitro period but are subsequently reversed during development of the <b>cloned</b> <b>animal...</b>|$|E

40|$|Understanding of the {{molecular}} architecture necessary for selective K+ permeation through the pore of ion channels is {{based primarily on}} analysis of the crystal structure of the bacterial K+ channel KcsA, and structure:function studies of <b>cloned</b> <b>animal</b> K+ channels. Little {{is known about the}} conduction properties of a large family of plant proteins with structural similarities to <b>cloned</b> <b>animal</b> cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs). Animal CNGCs are nonselective cation channels that do not discriminate between Na+ and K+ permeation. These channels all have the same triplet of amino acids in the channel pore ion selectivity filter, and this sequence is {{different from that of the}} selectivity filter found in K+-selective channels. Plant CNGCs have unique pore selectivity filters; unlike those found in any other family of channels. At present, the significance of the unique pore selectivity filters of plant CNGCs, with regard to discrimination between Na+ and K+ permeation is unresolved. Here, we present an electrophysiological analysis of several members of this protein family; identifying the first cloned plant channel (AtCNGC 1) that conducts Na+. Another member of this ion channel family (AtCNGC 2) is shown to have a selectivity filter that provides a heretofore unknown molecular basis for discrimination between K+ and Na+ permeation. Specific amino acids within the AtCNGC 2 pore selectivity filter (Asn- 416, Asp- 417) are demonstrated to facilitate K+ over Na+ conductance. The selectivity filter of AtCNGC 2 represents an alternative mechanism to the well-known GYG amino acid triplet of K+ channels that has been identified as the critical basis for K+ over Na+ permeation through the pore of ion channels...|$|E
40|$|Agronomical {{applications}} of cloned livestock produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) have been authorized in the United States and the European Food Safety Authority published {{that there was}} no evidence of risks associated with the use of <b>cloned</b> <b>animal</b> in the breeding industry. Both assessments, however, underlined that complementary data are needed to update their conclusions. SCNT is associated with a high incidence of perinatal losses. After birth, cloned cattle appear to possibly present subtle immune defects, requiring extensive studies to be properly evidenced. Twenty-five cloned Holstein heifers from five distinct genotypes and their contemporary age- and sex-matched controls were compared. An extensive survey of leukocyte subsets was performed and the humoral and T-cell immune responses to exogenous antigens were studied. Cloned cattle presented a normal representation of leukocyte subsets. Functional immunity was not modified in cloned heifers, as they were able to raise an antibody response and to develop B and T cell-specific responses against the model antigen OVA (ovalbumin) and against a rotavirus vaccine as in controls. Thus, this extensive analysis supports previous data suggesting that cloned cattle have a normal immunity...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{investigated}} a very fundamental biological question: how telomere {{length and}} telomerase activity is regulated during embryo development in mammals. It {{is argued that}} the <b>cloned</b> <b>animal</b> might inherit the shortened telomere length from the donor cell and thus is born prematured. Present work studied the dynamics of telomere length and telomerase activity during embryo development in several systems: in vivo embryo development, in vitro fertilized embryo development, parthenogenetically activated embryo development and cloned embryo development, using cattle and rabbit as model animals. A conserved telomerase dynamic pattern was found in early bovine embryos, derived from in vitro fertilization, parthenogenetic activation and nuclear transfer. It is proposed that the successful telomerase reprogramming in early NT embryos {{may contribute to the}} successful restoring of telomere length in cloned animals. Telomerase activity and telomere length of rabbit embryos were examined during in vivo development. Rabbit telomere length ranges from 15 to 36 kb, much longer than that of human (5 – 10 kb), in various fetal and adult tissues. Telomerase activity is present in all fetal and adult samples examined. This {{is similar to that of}} mice; however, different from human, in which telomerase is only detected in fetus, but not in any normal somatic tissues. ...|$|E
