2500|$|The Hoverbarge {{technology}} is somewhat different from high-speed hovercraft, which {{has traditionally been}} constructed using aircraft technology. The initial concept of the air cushion barge {{has always been to}} provide a low-tech amphibious solution for accessing <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> using typical <b>equipment</b> found in this area, such as diesel engines, ventilating fans, winches and marine equipment. The load to move a 200ton payload ACV barge at [...] would only be 5tons. The skirt and air distribution design on high-speed craft again is more complex, as they have to cope with the air cushion being washed out by a wave and wave impact. The slow speed and large mono chamber of the hover barge actually helps reduce the effect of wave action, giving a very smooth ride.|$|R

These algorithms have the potential to prevent collisions between heavy equipment vehicles and other on-site objects. In this study, algorithms were developed for image data acquisition, real-time 3 D spatial modeling, obstacle avoidance, and shortest path finding and were all integrated to construct a comprehensive collision-free path. Preliminary research results show that the proposed approach is feasible and has the potential to be used as an active safety feature for heavy equipment...|$|R
