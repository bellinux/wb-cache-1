Also, its working range is at higher temperatures than the soft glasses, requiring the use of oxygen/gas flames instead of air/gas.

5000|$|Vat dyes {{characteristically}} {{require a}} reducing agent to solubilize them. The most common reducing agent is sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), which converts the dye to its [...] "leuco" [...] form that is soluble. Once {{attached to the}} fabric, the leuco dye is then oxidized to the insoluble state which is intensely <b>colored.</b> <b>Chemical</b> reactions such as oxidation, reduction, pH control are often necessary; even the dissolution process necessitates measuring out appropriate quantities of caustic soda and sodium hydrosulphite {{in order to achieve}} reduction. The dye is soluble only in its reduced (oxygen-free) form. The fiber is immersed repeatedly in this oxygen-free dyebath, then exposed to the air, whereupon the water-soluble reduced form changes color as oxygen turns it to the water-insoluble form. For these reasons, vat dyes are less suitable than fiber-reactive dyes for amateur use.|$|R
