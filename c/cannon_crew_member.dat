5000|$|In the bid lines approach, pairings {{are placed}} within {{pre-built}} lines by line optimizer, {{a computer program}} that puts the pairings into [...] "legal" [...] lines, and {{does not take into}} account the individual crew members' preferences, nor the constraints imposed by <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> The generic set of lines are then published for bidding. A <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> is free to choose any line and it will be awarded as long as no other senior <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> who also wants this same line. Unless the most senior in the bid package, <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> needs to submit multiple preferred lines in order to guarantee a preferred line; otherwise, a leftover line will be awarded. By the bidding process, the preferred line may not be awarded completely, because the line was created without reference to specific <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> constraints, it may conflict with crew members' predetermined activities. The conflicting pairings must then be reassigned to other <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> resulting in a wide range of inefficiencies. Clearly this post-award reallocation is costly to the airlines. These inefficiencies also force airlines to hire more <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> However, bid line does offer a transparent and easy process to bid and to award, and in many cases the conflict itself actually benefits the <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> that being paid without the work according to the contracts. Though management is eager to streamline operations, <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> may still prefer the bid lines.|$|R
