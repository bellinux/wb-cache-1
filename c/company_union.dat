The union established a board selected by workers to air employee grievances and make. Although it made employee desires known to management, the union had no administrative authority, and it served in a purely advisory capacity.|$|E
25|$|The Pullman Company's {{response}} was to denounce, {{with support from the}} ministers and African American newspapers whom it had cultivated (or bought), the new union as an outside entity motivated by foreign ideologies, while sponsoring its own <b>company</b> <b>union,</b> variously known as the Employee Representation Plan or the Pullman Porters and Maids Protective Association, to represent its loyal employees. Local authorities, such as Boss Crump in Memphis, Tennessee in some cases helped the company by interfering with or banning BSCP meetings.|$|E

25|$|By 1933, BSCP {{membership}} {{dropped to}} 658, and the headquarters lost telephone and electric service because of nonpayment of bills. In 1934 the Roosevelt administration, however, amended the RLA, then passed the Wagner-Connery Act, which outlawed company unions and covered porters, the following year. The BSCP immediately {{demanded that the}} NMB certify it as the representative of these porters. The BSCP defeated the <b>company</b> <b>union</b> in the election held by the NMB and on June 1, 1935 was certified. Two years later the union signed its first collective bargaining agreement with the Pullman Company.|$|E
25|$|The 1923 strike {{destroyed}} the ILA, {{and it was}} soon replaced a new organization, the Vancouver and District Waterfront Workers' Association (VDWWA). Set up originally by the bosses as a <b>company</b> <b>union,</b> the VDWWA soon began to take a confrontational stance towards the Shipping Federation. By 1935, nearly every port in British Columbia had been organised by the VDWWA. Following the pretext {{to the destruction of}} the ILA, the Shipping Federation provoked another major strike in the spring of 1935, locking out 50 dockers at the port at Powell River.|$|E
25|$|The Police Act of 1919 was {{the death}} knell of NUPPO. It {{established}} the Police Federation, a public sector version of a <b>company</b> <b>union,</b> to replace NUPPO. Under the Act, NUPPO was outlawed as a representative body for the police and forbade them from belonging to a trade union. NUPPO had no options but to fight or fold; unsurprisingly, it chose to fight. This time, however, it was the union that misread {{the mood of the}} men when it called for another strike. Out of a force of 18,200 men in the Metropolitan Police, only 1,156 participated in the strike in 1919.|$|E
5000|$|A {{company or}} [...] "yellow" [...] union is a worker {{organization}} which is dominated or influenced by an employer, {{and is therefore}} not an independent trade <b>union.</b> <b>Company</b> <b>unions</b> are contrary to international labour law (see ILO Convention 98, article 2).

These type of unions are legal in many countries such as Japan, but are illegal in the United States. Instead the law requires that all unions be outside unions. I believe this law should be repealed and that <b>company</b> <b>unions</b> should be as legal as any other kind of voluntary association." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{conversion}} to single-man operation meant {{that about half}} of the company's workforce was suddenly surplus. Many employees found it hard to get work and were often forced to take strange shifts. One worker recorded having a 17-hour shift from 4:24p.m. on Sunday to 9:49a.m. on Monday. There was a <b>company</b> <b>union,</b> although it hadn't done much good. By October 1933, the workers had gained backing from Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson, St. Paul Mayor William Mahoney and the National Recovery Administration, among others. The next year, the workers voted to join the Amalgamated Transit Union.|$|E
25|$|But within months, a {{large number}} of {{employers}} refused to cooperate with the NLB. The NLB relied on enforcement of its orders through the NRA (which only had the power to remove so-called Blue Eagle industrial code approval from a manufacturer) or prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice. These weak enforcement powers encouraged employer resistance. In July 1933, the Weirton Steel Company held a private election rather than submit to one ran and monitored by the NLB. The Budd Manufacturing Company established a <b>company</b> <b>union,</b> then refused to bargain with the AFL affiliate in the plant.|$|E
25|$|Although the United Mine Workers of America {{failed to}} win {{recognition}} by the company, the strike had a lasting impact both on conditions at the Colorado mines and on labor relations nationally. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. engaged labor relations expert and future Canadian Prime Minister W. L. Mackenzie King to help him develop reforms for the mines and towns, which included paved roads and recreational facilities, as well as worker representation on committees dealing with working conditions, safety, health, and recreation. There was to be no discrimination against workers who had belonged to unions, {{and the establishment of}} a <b>company</b> <b>union.</b> The Rockefeller plan was accepted by the miners in a vote. Rockefeller also brought in pioneer public relations guru Ivy Lee, who warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized versions of the Rockefellers.|$|E

2500|$|President Roosevelt quickly disavowed the Board's {{exclusive}} representation rule.

But the auto companies rejected the union's demand for recognition, set up <b>company</b> <b>unions</b> and refused to allow the NLB to mediate. Roosevelt intervened personally in the dispute. On March 25, 1934, Roosevelt announced a settlement that provided for proportional, rather than exclusive, representation—thus giving the <b>company</b> <b>unions</b> equal footing with the Auto Workers. The agreement also stripped the NLB of its jurisdiction over the auto industry. Worse, the agreement provided no authority for holding elections, and thus no means of determining which organizations truly represented workers.|$|R
