For experimental research, the specimens were made of micro alloyed steel type NIOMOL 490 K intended for making welded structures subjected to dynamic loads and effects of low temperature.

The microstructures of BM, WM and heat affected zone (HAZ) were analysed, due to possible formation of a heterogeneous microstructure, which can reduce toughness.
