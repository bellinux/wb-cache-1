50|$|The hand {{discharge}} {{was also}} present in The Tomb of the Cybermen, which featured a smaller, hand-held <b>Cyber-weapon</b> shaped like a pistol that was described as an X-ray laser. In The Wheel in Space, the Cybermen could use the discharge to also operate machinery, and had death rays built into their chest units. They displayed the same units in The Invasion as well as carrying large rifles for medium distance combat. In Revenge of the Cybermen and the audio play Real Time, their weapons were built into their helmets. Killing Ground indicates {{that this type of}} Cybermen also have more powerful hand weapons. Subsequent appearances have shown them armed almost exclusively with hand-held cyberguns.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 the Stuxnet worm that {{infected}} Natanz {{uranium enrichment}} facilities in Iran and is suspected to have destroyed up to a 1000 centrifuges was discovered, setting back Iran's nuclear program by several years. The Russian company Kaspersky said the virus {{could only have}} been deployed with nation-state support, and that it would lead {{to the creation of a}} new kind of arms race in the world. Considering the damage caused, along with the invasiveness, lack of clear legitimacy and the speculation that the worm was developed and deployed with help of U.S. government with possible Israeli or German assistance means Stuxnet could seen as a use of force. Though it might not be seen as an unlawful use of force since the Iran nuclear activities targeted were illegal. For this reason the virus has been called a <b>cyber-weapon,</b> although the Iranian government did not claim it had been victim of a cyber-attack. The Iranian government's inaction might have implications for the development of legal norms regarding cyberspace, and a state's inaction is not addressed by the Schmitt framework.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRapid technological advancements and societal inclusion of these technologies have expanded civil and defense capabilities but have also created significant vulnerabilities. <b>Cyber-weapons</b> {{have the potential}} to affect interaction between states by exploiting this vulnerability. To better understand the mechanics of how <b>cyber-weapons</b> affect state relations this research applies a common framework to explore the attributes of traditional weaponsconventional, nuclear, and RMAand how they typically influence this behavior. After proposing selected factors that influence the effectiveness of a cyber-attack, the research examines the cyber-attacks in 2007 on Estonia and 2008 on Georgia in order to refine and provide nuanced analysis {{on the role of the}} proposed causal factors. The proposed factors are government involvement, level of attack sophistication, and the degree to which the state is dependent upon digitally connected technology. The research indicates that the role of the state is one of the most significant factors in influencing the effectiveness of a cyber-attack and highlights the role that plausible deniability plays in this relationship. Some initial policy recommendations are made based on the finding that the use of <b>cyber-weapons</b> as a deterrent is still ill-defined and that the focus should be on decreasing state vulnerability to these attacks.

40|$|As the United States Air Force extends {{its mission}} {{into the realm}} of Cyberspace, the CyberCraft Initiative is {{designing}} a framework for command and control of future Air Force <b>Cyber-weapon</b> systems. These <b>Cyber-weapon</b> systems, CyberCraft, will autonomously operate and defend the Air Force networks and information systems to provide Cyberspace Superiority in support of the defense of the United States. The fundamental research question of the CyberCraft Initiative is “What is required for a commander to trust a CyberCraft to autonomously defend military information systems?” The Trust Vector model [17] is one method of integrating trust into the Cyber-Craft fleet. Trust Vectors define trust and distrust between agents based on three components; current and historical data, intrinsic knowledge of the remote agent’s abilities, and recommendations from other agents. This research explores the suit-ability of the Trust Vector model to the CyberCraft Initiative and defines the strengths and remaining challenges of using the Trust Vector model...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of the lecture is devoted to the {{description}} of the Stuxnet worm, the first <b>cyber-weapon</b> whose existence has been made public, discovered in 2010 and targeting a specific industrial control system; the worm is responsible for the damaging of many centrifuges at an uranium enrichment facility, with the goal of sabotaging Iran&# 39;s nuclear program. In the second part, the main features of cyber-warfare in conflict and pre-conflict activities will be discussed and compared to the conventional warfare domains, with also a general view at the international political debate on this topic.   Check the [URL] web site, an organisation that seeks a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere {{is a lack}} of attention to the aftermath of a deployed cyber weapon: There is no mechanism for the assignment of accountability for the restoration of affected infrastructure and remediation of violation of established laws of war after cyberattacks occur. This study analyzes International Humanitarian Law and international treaties as they apply to the cyber post-conflict period and explores current jus post bellum frameworks, which can be used to design a cyber-warfare jus post bellum framework. It also analyzes analogies to traditional warfare in the damage assessment and aid provided during the recovery period of the 1998 Kosovo and the 2003 Iraq Wars. It also discusses the available international cyber organizations. As an example, the study analyzes responses to cyberattacks in a case study involving South Korea and North Korea. Additionally, this study examines the related issues of the effects of deploying a <b>cyber-weapon,</b> the ways to establish acceptable levels of attribution, the challenges of cyber-damage assessments, and the ability to contain and reverse cyberattacks. This thesis proposes a cyber-warfare jus post bellum framework, with emphasis on prevention and cyber weapons control, proposes cyberattack relief-effort actions, and offers a post-cyberattack cost checklist.

40|$|Does {{the advent}} of cyber-war require us to abandon the {{traditional}} ethical framework for thinking about the morality of warfare - just war theory - and develop principles specific to the unique nature of cyber-attacks? Or can just war theory still provide an appropriate basis for thinking through the ethical issues raised by <b>cyber-weapons?</b> This article explores these questions via {{the issue of whether}} a cyber-attack can constitute a casus belli. The first half of the paper critically engages with recent attempts to provide a new theory of just information warfare (JIW) that is supposedly better suited to the unique character of cyber war insofar as it is grounded the broader meta-ethical framework of information ethics (IE). Yet the paper argues that not only is JIW fundamentally unsuitable as a way of thinking about cyber-war, but (in the second half) {{that it is possible to}} develop a different account of how we can understand a cyber-attack as constituting a casus belli in a way that is in keeping with traditional just war theory. In short, there is no need to reinvent just war theory for the digital age...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} of cyber-threats {{is a modern}} reality from which no state, including Iceland, can hope to escape. Cyber-attacks can cause major damage remotely, at minimal cost and while concealing the culprits. Groups and individuals can carry them out as effectively as states, reversing traditional power calculations and making deterrence especially difficult. Individuals can use the Net both for mischief and to escape from authoritarian controls; groups such as terrorists and criminals can target states, commerce and individuals; and states can attack other states both directly and by proxy. The complexity of possible online conflicts was seen clearly in the events triggered by Wikileaks disclosures against the USA in 2010 and 2011. Among other recent developments, {{an attack on the}} Pentagon and the ‘Stuxnet’ virus used against Iranian nuclear plants have shown how even the smallest devices can penetrate high-security systems, and that computer-driven infrastructures are no longer immune. Iceland, for its part, acknowledged the relevance of cyber-threats in its 2009 risk assessment, and recently decided to set up a coordinating team for protection; but it has lagged behind its Nordic neighbours in this field and should take full advantage of cooperation with them now. Vulnerable states also have an interest in international regulation and restraint on the use of <b>cyber-weapons,</b> but the context for this is complex and viable proposals are slow to emerge. Iceland can and should contribute to new thinking, and perhaps also assist poorer states: but it needs to put its own house in order first...|$|R
40|$|On June 17 th, 2010, {{security}} {{researchers at}} a small Belarusian firm known as VirusBlockAda identified malicious software (malware) that infected USB memory sticks. 1 In the months that followed, there was a flurry of activity in the computer security community – revealing that this discovery identified only one component of a new computer worm 2 known as Stuxnet. This software was designed to specifically target industrial equipment. Once {{it was revealed that}} the majority of infections were discovered in Iran, 3 along with an unexplained decommissioning of centrifuges at the Iranian fuel enrichment plant (FEP) at Natanz, 4 many in the media speculated that the ultimate goal of Stuxnet was to target Iranian nuclear facilities. In November of 2010, some of these suspicions were validated when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publically acknowledged that a computer worm created problems for a “limited number of our [nuclear] centrifuges. ” 5 Reputable experts in the computer security community have already labeled Stuxnet as “unprecedented,” 6 an “evolutionary leap,” 7 and “the type of threat we hope to never see again. " 8 In this paper, I argue that this malicious software represents a revolution of military affairs (RMA) 9 in the virtual realm – that is Stuxnet fundamentally changes the nature of cyber warfare. There are four reasons to this claim: (1) Stuxnet represents the first case in which industrial equipment was targeted with a <b>cyber-weapon,</b> (2) there is evidence that th...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{possible}} implications and consequences {{arising from the}} use of an artificial intelligence construct as a weapon of mass destruction. The digital age has ushered in many technological advances, as well as certain dangers. Chief among these pitfalls is the lack of reliable security found in critical information technology systems. These security gaps can give cybercriminals unauthorized access to highly sensitive computer networks that control the very infrastructure of the United States. Cyberattacks are rising in both frequency and severity and the response by the U. S. has been ineffective. A <b>cyber-weapon</b> of mass destruction (CWMD) implementing an artificial intelligence construct would operate on different fundamental principles than a kinetic WMD, but it would be no less effective in eliminating threats to the security of domestic information networks. This article will first examine the current state of artificial intelligence as it exists in both the private sector and in military and intelligence applications. Second, this article will discuss the distinctions between kinetic war and cyberwar and the deployment of WMDs; the capabilities and applications of a possible CWMD will be discussed at this point as well. Third, issues concerning international law will be addressed as applicable to artificial intelligence, automated warfare, and WMDs generally. Finally, this article will examine some dangers {{associated with the use of}} an artificial intelligence construct capable of learning as well as the necessity of such a program...|$|E
