2500|$|Temperature [...] affects {{cellular}} metabolic {{and growth}} rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds {{from the same}} plant germinate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16-24 C) , while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between warm and cool. Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C). [...] Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures (vernalization) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy. [...] For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. <b>Cold</b> <b>stratification</b> is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination [...] Four degrees Celsius is cool enough to end dormancy for most cool dormant seeds, but some groups, especially within the family Ranunculaceae and others, need conditions cooler than -5 C. Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a forest fire which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>stratification</b> is {{the term}} applied to the storing of seeds in (and, strictly, in layers with) a moist medium, often peat or sand, {{with a view to}} {{maintaining}} viability and overcoming dormancy. <b>Cold</b> <b>stratification</b> {{is the term}} applied to storage at near-freezing temperatures, even if no medium is used. A common method of <b>cold</b> <b>stratification,</b> is to soak seed in tap water for up to 24 h, superficially dry it, then store moist for some weeks or even months at temperatures just above freezing. Although Hellum (1968) found that <b>cold</b> <b>stratification</b> of an Alberta seed source led to irregular germination, with decreasing germination with increasing length of the stratification period, Hocking's (1972) paired test with stratified and nonstratified Alberta seed from several sources revealed no trends in response to stratification. Hocking suggested that seed maturity, handling, and storage needed to be controlled before the need for stratification could be determined. Later, Winston and Haddon (1981) found that the storage of white spruce cones for 4 weeks at 5 °C prior to extraction obviated the need for stratification.|$|E

The seeds originated from controlled pollinations within and between two closely related Danish populations. The seeds were sown ripe in seed packets in proximity of mother plants. Germination was first observed after 4. 5 y in the ground, following two successive cold and snowy winters, and only in one population. Seedlings expanded through the sides of the broken testa and were hair-less.

50|$|Any {{seeds that}} are {{indicated}} as needing {{a period of}} warm stratification followed by <b>cold</b> <b>stratification</b> should be subjected to the same measures, but the seeds should additionally be stratified in a warm area first, followed by the cold period in a refrigerator later. Warm stratification requires temperatures of 15-20°C (59-68°F).

50|$|Seed {{dormancy}} is {{a complex}} phenomenon and is not always consistent within species. <b>Cold</b> <b>stratification</b> of white spruce seed to break dormancy has been specified as a requirement, but Heit (1961) and Hellum (1968) regarded stratification as unnecessary. Cone handling and storage conditions affect dormancy in that cold, humid storage (5 °C, 75% to 95% relative humidity) of the cones prior to extraction seemingly eliminated dormancy by overcoming the need to stratify. Periods of cold, damp weather {{during the period of}} cone storage might provide natural <b>cold</b> (<b>stratification)</b> treatment. Once dormancy was removed in cone storage, subsequent kiln-drying and seed storage did not reactivate dormancy.|$|E

When combinations of sulfuric acid scarification (0 or 5 min) and stratification (0, 9, or 14 wk) treatments were tested on a Montana seedlot, the optimal treatment combination was a 5 -min acid soak and 14 -wk (98 -d) stratification. Although strati-fication {{was more effective}} than scarification when treatments were applied alone, germination improved from 27 % to 38 % when seeds were scarified prior to the 14 -wk stratification treatment, and, for seeds germinating after stratification, ger-mination occurred almost 4 d earlier on average. A 1 -wk imbi-bition test, where increase in seed weight is measured follow-ing scarification and 1 -wk cold-stratification, is proposed as a convenient method to determine the most effective acid scar-ification duration for individual seedlots.

40|$|In vitro {{culture of}} mycotrophic leaf-bearing {{seedlings}} of federally threatened Platanthera praeclara Sheviak and Bowles, a terrestrial orchid {{native to the}} midwestern prairies, is reported for the first time. Symbiotic germination was evaluated to: (1) determine need for <b>cold</b> moist <b>stratification</b> to enhance seed germination and seedling development and (2) identify the mycobionts that support in vitro germination and development. Germination was improved by exposing seeds to both 4 - and 6 -mo stratification periods; whereas seeds without stratification failed to germinate in a pilot study. Pretreatment of seeds with 6 mo of stratification combined with inoculation with mycorrhizal fungus derived from a seedling (Ceratorhiza sp., UAMH 9847) supported development of higher stage protocorms and some leaf-bearing seedlings of P. praeclara. Protocorms with developing leaf primordia were also obtained by coinoculation with strains of Epulorhiza and Ceratorhiza.

40|$|A {{primary goal}} of {{ecological}} restoration is to establish desirable plant species. This goal is particularly important following the removal of invasive plants. Understanding biological traits of plant species important to revegetation is crucial to plant establishment. In the globally important Great Salt Lake (GSL) wetlands, native habitat-forming bulrushes Bolboschoenus maritimus, Schoenoplectus acutus, and S. americanus are frequently displaced by the invasive grass Phragmites australis. Successful revegetation of bulrushes relies on improving our understanding of seed dormancy break, seed germination requirements, and the environmental factors affecting rhizome emergence and growth. We used a series of germination chamber and greenhouse experiments to examine effective seed dormancy break treatments and germination conditions for multiple collection sites of bulrushes B. maritimus, S. acutus, and S. americanus. We also performed a greenhouse experiment to investigate how water depth, nutrient, and salinity levels affect B. maritimus and S. acutus emergence and growth from rhizomes. <b>Cold,</b> moist <b>stratification</b> and bleach scarification were effective dormancy break treatments for all species, though magnitude of effect varied by species and source site. Soaking the seeds after application of dormancy break treatments improved germination for all species. Rhizome emergence of S. acutus was negatively affected by high water depth, likely due to oxygen limitation. Bolboschoenus maritimus was salinity tolerant relative to S. acutus.

40|$|Dormancy-breaking {{and seed}} {{germination}} studies in genus Lilium {{reveal that the}} majority of Lilium spp. studied have an underdeveloped embryo at maturity, which grows inside the seed before the radicle emerges. Additionally, the embryo, radicle or cotyledon has a physiological component of dormancy; thus, Lilium seeds have morphophysio-logical dormancy (MPD). A previous study suggested that seeds of Lilium polyphyllum have MPD but the study did not investigate the development of the embryo, {{which is one of the}} main criteria to determine MPD in seeds. To test this hypothesis, we investigated embryo growth and emergence of radicles and epicotyls in seeds over a range of temperatures. At maturity, seeds had underdeveloped embryos which developed fully at warm temperature within 6 weeks. Immediately after embryo growth, radicles also emerged at warm temperatures. However, epicotyls failed to emerge soon after radicle emergence. Epicotyls emerged from> 90 % seeds with an emerged radicle only after they were subjected to 2 weeks of <b>cold</b> moist <b>stratification.</b> The overall temperature requirements for dormancy-breaking and seed germination indicate a non-deep simple epicotyl MPD in L. polyphyllum.

40|$|In climate {{chamber and}} outdoor {{experiments}} we analysed germination traits of 42 vascular plant species typical of flood-meadows {{of the alliance}} Cnidion. In Central Europe such flood-meadows and their highly endangered character species are confined to large lowland river corridors with a dry and warm climate. Due to the prevailing ecological conditions, particularly the extremely high variability in soil moisture potential, it was hypothesised that flood-meadow species exhibit specific strate-gies in terms of germination phenology, temperature requirements and primary dormancy to avoid constraints on seedling recruitment imposed by flooding, drought and competition from established vegetation. Furthermore, we expected that germi-nation characteristics could be a key for the causal understanding of range size, confinement to large river corridors, recent rarification processes, seed bank persistence and establishment success in restoration projects. PCA ordination of germination traits reflected a continuous gradient of increasing primary dormancy levels ranging from species with a high capacity for fast and almost complete germination {{over a wide range}} of temperatures to those with high and narrow temperature requirements and/or a delayed and asynchronous emergence. Many of the studied species germinated only at relatively high temperature in the year of shedding, but the primary conditional dormancy disappeared in most cases after a period of <b>cold</b> wet <b>stratification.</b> Requirements for chilling and/or high germination temperature were revealed to be the most common strategies for avoidance of harmful autumn and winter germination.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} assessment {{results for}} the Natural Circulation Interruption (NCI) phenomenon during the cooldown phase in a nuclear Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). This phenomenon could take place due to several circumstances such as an asymmetric cooldown after {{the loss of the}} forced primary flow. Under NCI conditions, the connection of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) to the Residual Heat Removal System (RHRS) and the homogeneous boration of the RCS could be hindered. Moreover, at very low or no primary flow rates and an operating Safety Injection (SI) system, a Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS) could occur in the reactor vessel due to <b>cold</b> fluid <b>stratification</b> in the loops. It is therefore important to understand the cause of loop flow stagnation and what could be the appropriate operator actions in order to avoid such phenomenon. The main goal of the current study is to assess the effect of a cooldown strategy upon the single-phase NCI occurrence. For this purpose, two scenarios with asymmetric cooling between the reactor cooling loops were investigated: the first one concerns a Feed Water Line Break (FWLB) combined with a Loss Of Offsite Power (LOOP), while the second one is limited to the LOOP (or any other transient leading to the loss of the forced primary flow). The analyses were carried out using the CATHARE 2 /V 2. 5 _ 1 mod 8. 1 thermal-hydraulic system code.

In this study, we examined the ecophysiological aspects of seed germination and growth in three Allium species native to the Intermountain West (A. acuminatum, A. brandegei, and A. passeyi). Three populations of each species were studied along an elevation gradient resulting in low, mid, and high elevation sites for each species. We investigated seed dormancy patterns within and among species and their relation to habitat. Seeds collected at the study sites were subjected to cold (3 °C) moist stratification in low light to simulate the natural winter environment under snow. Stratification periods ranged from 0 to 24 weeks. After stratification, seeds were placed in lighted growth chambers at 8 °C to simulate the natural spring environment. Germination was observed for 4 weeks. Germinated seeds were then grown at either 12 °C or 16 °C until leaf senescence. Destructive sampling occurred at 2, 4, and 8 weeks.
