5000|$|During the {{synthesis}} of acetalated dextran both acyclic and <b>cyclic</b> <b>acetals</b> are formed. The acyclic acetals degrade into an acetone and an alcohol, whereas <b>cyclic</b> <b>acetals</b> degrade into acetone. The ratio of <b>cyclic</b> to acyclic <b>acetals</b> varies with reaction time since acyclic acetals are kinetically favored and <b>cyclic</b> <b>acetals</b> are the thermodynamically favored.

Acetlated dextran's degradation time can vary from hours to {{a month or more}} at pH 7.2. Also, acetalated dextran is unique because it is acid sensitive. Therefore, at lower pH acetalated dextran degrades more rapidly, which results in a polymer that degrades approximately two logs faster at pH 5 compared to pH 7.|$|R

Instead, a condensed-phase model in which the multicharged transition state for hydride abstraction is better solvated than the transition state for proton transfer appears to be a plausible explanation for the FAB data obtained for the nonlabeled cyclic acetals; however, this explanation is not entirely sufficient to rationalize the FAB data for the deuterated <b>cyclic</b> <b>acetals.</b> For these compounds, a dramatic time dependence of protonation versus hydride abstraction is observed that suggests that beam-induced reactive species are responsible for hydride abstraction in the condensed phase.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of some electrophilic reagents with <b>cyclic</b> <b>acetals</b> and ketals and other derivatives of polyols have been investigated. Friedel-Crafts reagents, such as acetic anhydride and methyl iodide {{in the presence}} of aluminium chloride, cause ring opening of <b>cyclic</b> <b>acetals</b> and ketals, but do not yield the expected acetates and methyl ethers. These may be formed during the reaction and then react further with the aluminium chloride; alternatively, aluminium chloride Itself may cause ring opening. Treatment with boron trichloride, followed by methanolysis, converts all except the most stable <b>cyclic</b> <b>acetals</b> and ketals into the parent polyols. The results of these reactions suggest that, of the different acetals and ketals, only the methylene acetals retain the alkylidene residue as an a-chloro ether group. Attempts have been made to replace the chlorine and obtain a more stable derivative and the reduction of the product of the reaction of boron trichloride with 2 : 5 - 0 -methylene-f-mannitol yielded 2 - 0 -methyl-D-mannitol, a new compound.

These biomaterials possess properties including biocompatibility, mechanical strength, and degradation as well as functionalities such as specific cell adhesion and directed cell migration. However, synthetic polymers are often not completely biologically inert and may non-specifically react with the surrounding in vivo environment. An example of this reactivity is the release of acidic degradation products from hydrolytically degradable polymers based upon an ester moiety. These degradation products can lower the local pH and incite an inflammatory response as well as increase scaffold degradation rate. Therefore {{there has been a}} concerted effort in the research community to develop alternatives. In order to address this concern, a novel class of biomaterials based upon a <b>cyclic</b> <b>acetal</b> unit has been developed and investigated for both soft and hard tissue repair.

Such processes are particularly advantageous when they are combined {{with the formation of}} a carbon-carbon bond. In the large majority of such reactions, stereoselectivity is controlled by enzymes, chiral auxiliaries, organocatalysts, or transition metal catalysts. In particular, enantioselective transition metal catalysis is a powerful tool in the synthesis of enantioenriched products. The M.

This thesis describes my progress towards establishing this alkynylation strategy for a much broader class of <b>cyclic</b> <b>acetal</b> substrates. The first chapter reviews developments in enantioselective additions of carbon nucleophiles to prochiral cyclic oxocarbenium ions using both organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis. The chapter briefly discusses the addition of carbon nucleophiles to aldehydes and ketones catalyzed by transition metals, as well as enantioselective alkynylation of iminium ions. The second chapter of this thesis describes my work on alkynylation of chroman acetals through cyclic oxocarbenium ions, specifically optimization of reaction conditions and my progress towards an asymmetric version of this reaction. The third chapter discusses diastereoselective alkynylation reactions. In addition to the routes for substrate synthesis for these studies, the alkynylation of several nonbenzopyranyl substrates through aliphatic oxocarbenium ion intermediates has been achieved.
