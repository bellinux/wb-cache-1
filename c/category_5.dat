5|$|Nine Atlantic hurricanes—Camille, Allen, Andrew, Isabel, Ivan, Dean, Felix, Irma and Maria—reached Category5 {{intensity}} on {{more than}} one occasion; that is, by reaching Category5 intensity, weakening to a Category4 or lower, and then becoming a Category5 again. Such hurricanes have their dates shown together. Camille, Andrew, Dean, Felix, Irma, and Maria each attained <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> status twice during their lifespans. Allen, Isabel, and Ivan reached <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> intensity on three separate occasions. However, no Atlantic hurricane has reached Category5 intensity more than three times during its lifespan. The November 1932 Cuba hurricane holds the record for most time spent as a Category5 (although it took place before satellite or aircraft reconnaissance, so this record may be somewhat suspect). Irma holds the record for longest continuous span as a <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> storm in the satellite era.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Carol in 1953 was {{the strongest}} storm of the 1953 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season and the first <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the 1938 New England hurricane. Carol is also the first named storm to attain <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> status. Carol developed on August28 off {{the west coast of}} Africa, although the Weather Bureau did not initiate advisories until five days later. On September2, Carol attained hurricane status, based on a ship report. It moved northwestward, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h), based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters. After weakening, it brushed Bermuda and turned northeastward near New England, passing west of Nova Scotia before making landfall near Saint John, New Brunswick on September7. While crossing Atlantic Canada, Carol became an extratropical cyclone, which dissipated on September9 southwest of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gilma {{was one of}} {{the most}} intense Pacific {{hurricane}}s on record and the second of three <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> hurricanes during the active 1994 Pacific hurricane season. Developing from a westward tracking tropical wave over the open waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean on July21, the pre-Gilma tropical depression was initially large and disorganized. Gradual development took place over the following day before rapid intensification began. By July23, the storm intensified into a hurricane and later a <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> storm on July24. As Gilma reached this intensity, it crossed into the Central Pacific basin, the fourth consecutive storm to do so.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{began as}} a {{tropical}} depression over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 16. After spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central Atlantic, it rapidly intensified into a powerful <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> hurricane while moving westward towards the Bahamas on August 23. Though it briefly weakened to Category 4 while traversing the Bahamas, it regained its <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> status before making landfall in Florida on Elliott Key and Homestead on August 24. With a barometric pressure of 922 mbar (27.23 inHg) {{at the time of}} landfall in Florida, Andrew is the fourth most intense hurricane to strike the United States. Several hours later, the hurricane emerged over the Gulf of Mexico at Category 4 strength, with the Gulf Coast of the United States in its path. After turning northwestward and weakening further, Andrew moved ashore near Morgan City, Louisiana, as a low-end Category 3 storm. After moving inland, the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity, merging with a frontal system over the southern Appalachian Mountains on August 28.|$|E

5|$|Continuing west-northwestward, Karen {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity on November 13 {{with a central}} pressure of 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg). Between November 13 and 14, Karen gradually turned towards the north as it underwent another eyewall replacement cycle. During this time, Karen finally weakened below <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> status as its winds dropped below 251 km/h (156 mph). This {{marked the end of}} its near-record 4.25-day span as a storm of such intensity, second only to Typhoon Nancy of 1961 which maintained <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> status for 5.5 days. Over the following days, the typhoon's structure gradually became disorganized, with its eye no longer well-defined by November 15. By this time, Karen began accelerating northeastward and later east-northeastward over the open ocean. The combination of its rapid movement and entrainment of cold air into the circulation ultimately caused the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone on November 17. The remnants of Karen continued tracking east-northeast and were last noted by the JTWC on November 18 roughly halfway between the southern Aleutian Islands and northern Hawaiian Islands.|$|E

Edith developed from a tropical wave on September 5 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane in the Caribbean Sea. Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. After moving across the Gulf of Mexico a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105mph (170km/h) on September 16. Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September 18.|$|E

5|$|Post-analysis on Andrew {{revealed}} that the storm was often stronger than operationally reported between early on August 22 and early on August 26. In real time, the National Hurricane Center assessed its peak intensity as , which was upgraded to 155 mph (250 km/h) in a post-storm analysis after the season ended. However, a 2004 paper by Christopher Landsea and others concluded that Andrew became a <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> hurricane near the Bahamas on August 23 and reached maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h). The paper also indicated that Andrew briefly re-intensified into a <b>Category</b> <b>5</b> hurricane {{around the time of}} landfall in South Florida early on August 24. The storm was found to have been slightly stronger while approaching Louisiana, but the landfall winds were decreased from 120 mph (195 km/h) to 115 mph (185 km/h).|$|E
