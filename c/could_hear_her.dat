25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer {{describes}} it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, {{as in the}} Athens lekythos, while Homer reports {{that it was a}} bow he had slung over his shoulder. In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> singing sweetly as she worked. In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|The first death {{during a}} {{performance}} occurred on 29 June 2013. Acrobat Sarah Guyard-Guillot, from Paris, France, was killed after she fell [...] {{into an open}} pit at the MGM Grand during the KÃ  show. After the fall, everyone on the stage looked [...] "visually scared and frightened". Then the audience <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> groans and screams from the floor.|$|E
500|$|... "Lisa's First Word" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Martin, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. The Simpsons writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss {{thought it would be}} cute to have her say [...] "daddy" [...] when no one <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b> Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.|$|E
60|$|But Mary Erskine did not answer. Mary Bell <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> {{the sound}} of the spinning-wheel in the house, and she {{wondered}} why the spinner <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her,</b> when she called so loud.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alack, not yet, Madame; {{they will}} come in a few days' time.' She gave a piteous sigh, and David <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> words.|$|R
60|$|He stood {{watching}} her, fearing to move. He listened hard {{and his face}} was very white. Even now he <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> breathing.|$|R
500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, as if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E
500|$|Two of {{the bridge}} players, Frederic Seward and William Sloper, {{accompanied}} Gibson and her mother to the lifeboats. The group boarded lifeboat no. 7, {{the first to be}} launched. Around 27 other people were on board the boat when it was lowered at 12:40am, just over an hour after the collision. The lifeboat's plug could not be found, causing water to gush in until, as Gibson later put it, [...] "this was remedied by volunteer contributions from the lingerie of the women and the garments of men." [...] Around 1,500 people were still aboard Titanic when she sank, throwing them into freezing water where they soon died of hypothermia. As they struggled in the water, Gibson heard what she described as a [...] "terrible cry that rang out from people who were thrown into the sea and others who were afraid for their loved ones." [...] The sinking deeply affected her; according to Sloper, she became [...] "quite hysterical and kept repeating over and over so that people near us <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her,</b> 'I'll never ride in my little grey car again.'" [...] The occupants of the lifeboat were finally rescued at 6:15am by the RMS Carpathia and taken to New York.|$|E
2500|$|... "Live Your Life" [...] {{was written}} by T.I. Dan Balan, Justin Smith, and Makeba Riddick whilst being {{produced}} by Just Blaze and Riddick. T.I. explained Rihanna's incorporation progress into the song to Artist Direct, [...] "It was a back and forth studio thing with Rihanna. I picked her. I was just able to 'hear' her voice on this record. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her,</b> so I reached out and she said, 'Yes,' thankfully." ...|$|E
60|$|And Harold, {{far away}} where {{the setting sun}} was lying red {{on the rim of}} the western sea, <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b> But perhaps God did.|$|R
60|$|When {{the door}} of No.62 was opened he <b>could</b> {{distinctly}} <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> singing, and said so at once, to prevent any chance of being denied entrance.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Frenchman has gone, father; and so noiselessly that I <b>could</b> hardly <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b> If {{we can get}} out {{as quietly}} there is little fear of our being noticed." ...|$|R
2500|$|Inayat Khan was {{classified}} as [...] "highly dangerous" [...] and shackled in chains most of the time. As the prison director testified after the war, Inayat Khan remained uncooperative and continued to refuse to give any information on her work or her fellow operatives, although in her despair at the appalling nature of her confinement, other prisoners <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> crying at night. However, by the ingenious method of scratching messages {{on the base of}} her mess cup, she was able to inform another inmate of her identity, giving the name of Nora Baker and the London address of her mother's house.|$|E
2500|$|The poem is {{different}} in style and form from other poems composed by Coleridge. While incomplete and subtitled a [...] "fragment", its language is highly stylised with {{a strong emphasis on}} sound devices that change between the poem's original two stanzas. The first stanza of the poem describes Khan's pleasure dome built alongside a sacred river fed by a powerful fountain. The second stanza of the poem is the narrator's response to the power and effects of an Abyssinian maid's song, which enraptures him but leaves him unable to act on her inspiration unless he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> once again. Together, they form a comparison of creative power that does not work with nature and creative power that is harmonious with nature.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had thought about it for years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E
50|$|In another case, {{a lawyer}} {{dressed in a}} niqab was told by an {{immigration}} judge {{that she could not}} represent a client because, he said, he <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Wot {{he could}} ha' seen in 'er I don't know. I asked 'im one evening--in a {{roundabout}} way--and he answered {{in such a}} long, roundabout way that I didn't know wot {{to make of it}} till I see that she was standing just behind me, listening. Arter that I heard 'er asking questions about me, but I didn't 'ave to listen: I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>'er</b> twenty yards away, and singing to myself at the same time.|$|R
60|$|She talked sagely {{about the}} crops and the weather, and asked innumerable questions. Often John <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> questions, which were like soft soliloquies, but she babbled on just the same.|$|R
60|$|Geraldine {{left the}} room without remark. She <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> father {{rustling}} his paper as she disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Laughing so shrilly {{that all}} the market-place <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her,</b> the weird old gentlewoman took her departure.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face was}} very close to his, and he fancied that he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> teeth chattering. She was {{obviously}} terrified.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here he comes," [...] she murmured, {{and they}} <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> that <b>her</b> lips were dry with emotion. [...] "And I {{have to put}} my arms round his neck and look into his face as Marian did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} you can help us with the concert," [...] she forced herself to say. Oh, if only Irene would stop looking at that boot! Rilla <b>could</b> just <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> giving Olive Kirk an account of it.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt very}} fiery on my aunt's account; but I {{said it would}} {{certainly}} be better, if Miss Murdstone pleased, not to mention <b>her.</b> I <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> disrespectfully mentioned, I added, without expressing my opinion in a decided tone.|$|R
60|$|Before Lemuel {{knew what}} she was doing, she flew out of the door, and he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> flying down the stairs.|$|E
60|$|Presently Eve spoke. They <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> faintly, yet distinctly, {{through the}} cracked and patched windows, and listened {{with all their}} ears.|$|E
60|$|Back {{she came}} in the silent, swaying, ghostly dance. They saw she was smiling beneath the mask, and they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> {{breathing}} hard.|$|E
60|$|Magdalen rose {{slowly from}} the mound. A hopeless depression, a sullen despair, showed itself in her look and manner. She refused the captain's offered hand; and her tones, when she {{answered}} him, were {{so low that}} he <b>could</b> hardly <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Jeanne obeyed her breathlessly. At {{first she}} <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing. <b>Her</b> own {{heart was beating}} fast, and the boughs of the trees above them were {{creaking}} and groaning in the wind. Presently, however, she gave a little cry. From somewhere underground it seemed to <b>her</b> that she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> a faint hammering.|$|R
6000|$|Tears again glittered {{in those}} sweet eyes {{and she turned}} her head away so that I <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> reply. [...] "He's--he's very fond of gentle creatures you know. And he'd--he'd be so sorry! I don't want him to be made sorry." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{door slammed}} violently, and Saxon, ere she fell to crying again, <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> {{sister-in-law}} lumbering about {{the kitchen and}} talking loudly to herself.|$|E
60|$|She {{was briefly}} {{informed}} of the timber people's obstinacy; and then Giles <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> telling the footman to direct the timber people to turn their horses' heads.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} half past eight. Mrs. Welsh was setting her {{bread in the}} kitchen; they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> moving about. Hartley was {{downtown}} finishing up his business.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} to the doctor," [...] said Lady Ella as if <b>her</b> husband <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "There is {{something}} that will make things clearer to the doctor. I must {{speak to the}} doctor {{for a moment before}} he sees him." ...|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning they}} made the experiment. It failed. Other {{experiments}} followed at intervals, {{most of which were}} fiascos, although some were partially successful.

6000|$|...
