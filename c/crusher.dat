5|$|Odan's {{presence}} becomes dominating over Riker, and Dr. <b>Crusher</b> {{finds herself}} initially confused when Odan continues {{to try to}} engage with her to continue their relationship. Dr. <b>Crusher</b> is puzzled and full of emotion as she later confides to Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and wonders about the true depth of her feelings for Odan. With some effort, Odan in Riker's body manages to convince the delegates from the warring planets to work with him. However, Riker's body begins to deteriorate due to the incompatibility of different biologies. The ship transporting the new host has encountered engine malfunctions. Dr. <b>Crusher</b> does everything she can to extend Riker's and Odan's chances while the Enterprise races to meet the Trill ship, and has a deeply emotional moment with Captain Picard.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Crushing</b> {{plant is}} {{one-stop}} <b>crushing</b> installation, {{which can be}} used for rock <b>crushing,</b> garbage <b>crushing,</b> building materials <b>crushing</b> and other similar operations. <b>Crushing</b> plants may be either fixed or mobile.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{resistance}} of tablets is usually described by <b>crushing</b> force, or by tensile strength. Method {{used in this}} thesis records <b>crushing</b> force and path of <b>crushing.</b> This force-path record {{can be used to}} calculate <b>crushing</b> energy. <b>Crushing</b> force, <b>crushing</b> path and <b>crushing</b> energy can be used to calculate other parameters that characterize tablet properties. This thesis uses <b>crushing</b> force, volume <b>crushing</b> force, tensile strength, <b>crushing</b> energy, volume <b>crushing</b> energy and <b>crushing</b> energy related to tablet weight to describe tablets compressed of powdered cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and lactose monohydrate. Results of this thesis shows descent of tensile strength in this order: microcrystalline cellulose Avicel PH- 112, microcrystalline cellulose Avicel PH- 101, hydroxypropylcellulose, powdered cellulose and lactose monohydrate. Kinetic characteristics of tablets descent in this order: hydroxypropylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose Avicel PH- 101, microcrystalline cellulose Avicel PH- 112, powdered cellulose and lactose monohydrate...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} non-axial <b>crushing,</b> {{off-axis}} <b>crushing</b> and angled <b>crushing,</b> {{have been identified}} and significant differences found between the E-glass/polyester pultruded tubes <b>crushed</b> in these different configurations. Energy absorption for {{the two types of}} <b>crushing</b> was found also to vary significantly with the angle of inclination, with the difference being largest at high angles of inclination. Reasons for energy absorption differences between the <b>crushing</b> configurations include the initiation of different crack patterns, different loading of individual fibers, and altered friction. For all angles, the load required for continued <b>crushing</b> was found to fluctuate more for off-axis <b>crushing</b> than for angled <b>crushing...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Enterprise {{meets with}} a Ferengi vessel whose captain, DaiMon Bok, {{requests}} {{a meeting with}} Captain Picard. Picard meanwhile is suffering from persistent headaches and seeks the help of Doctor Beverly <b>Crusher</b> (Gates McFadden). She scans Picard, but can not find what is causing them. Meanwhile, on the bridge, Wesley <b>Crusher</b> (Wil Wheaton) reports that a second vessel is approaching. Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) identifies it as a Federation Constellation-class starship.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{successfully}} rendezvous in time {{to bring}} aboard the new host, a female (Nicole Orth-Pallavicini), much to Dr. Crusher's surprise. She helps with the other Trill to transplant Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. <b>Crusher</b> is uncomfortable, knowing both that the Trill appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will continue to live on {{in any number of}} hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. <b>Crusher,</b> but understands her confusion and discomfort, and promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. <b>Crusher</b> replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female host body, Odan then kisses the inner wrist of her hand.|$|E
5|$|Gates McFadden {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Doctor Beverly <b>Crusher</b> in the third season, the character had been written out for season two and replaced with Diana Muldaur playing Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Roddenberry had ensured that <b>Crusher</b> was not written out permanently to allow for her return in the future. Keith DeCandido blamed her departure on Maurice Hurley. After he left the series, McFadden returned. Fans started a letter-writing campaign to reinstate McFadden throughout the second season. Both Roddenberry and Berman decided {{that it would be better}} to bring back McFadden than to look for a third doctor in three years as they agreed that the Pulaski character was not working.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} crushing-surface {{roughness}} on the energy-absorption capability of graphite and glass-epoxy composite tubes were investigated. Fifty {{different combinations of}} fiber, matrix, and specimen ply orientation were evaluated. Two different <b>crushing</b> surface roughnesses were used in this investigation. <b>Crushing</b> surface significantly influences the energy-absorption capability only of tubes that <b>crush</b> in the lamina bending <b>crushing</b> mode; tubes that <b>crush</b> in other modes are not influenced because their lamina bundles do not slide against the <b>crushing</b> surface. Those tubes that <b>crush</b> in the lamina bending mode can achieve higher, lower, or no change in energy-absorption capability as <b>crushing</b> surface roughness increases. If the fiber failure strain of tubes that <b>crush</b> in the lamina bending <b>crushing</b> mode exceeds the matrix failure strain then the energy-absorption capability increases as <b>crushing</b> surface roughness increases. However, if the matrix failure strain exceeds the fiber failure strain then the energy-absorption capability increases as <b>crushing</b> surface roughness decreases. Energy-absorption capability is uninfluenced by <b>crushing</b> surface roughness for tubes that have equal fiber and matrix failure strains...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} match featured Shawn Michaels {{defending his}} WWF Intercontinental Championship against <b>Crush.</b> <b>Crush</b> controlled the early {{portion of the}} match by performing several dropkicks on Michaels, which he followed with a military press slam and a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker. Michaels left the ring to recover and returned to attack <b>Crush's</b> head. Michaels was unable to pin <b>Crush,</b> however, and <b>Crush</b> threw Michaels out of the ring. Two wrestlers dressed as Doink the Clown, with whom <b>Crush</b> had been feuding, came to the ring to distract <b>Crush.</b> Michaels performed a superkick, his signature move, and pinned <b>Crush</b> to retain the championship.|$|R
40|$|The diploma work is {{concerned}} with a study of mechanical resistance which is assessed through the tablet <b>crushing</b> force and tensile strenght. In this work there was used tablet measuring method resulting from the recording of force - path, while the <b>crushing</b> process is assessed not only by <b>crushing</b> strenght {{but also by the}} path of <b>crushing.</b> Using the <b>crushing</b> force, <b>crushing</b> path and tablet <b>crushing</b> force is possible to compute next parameteres of <b>crushing</b> process detailing tablet properties as are volume <b>crushing</b> force, volume <b>crushing</b> energy and weight <b>crushing</b> energy. Assessed tablets were compacted of microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcelulos, lactose and calcium hydrogen phosphate. From the result of work follows that <b>crushing</b> force (possibly tensile strenght) is decreasing in assessed adjuvants microcrystalline cellulose Ceolus, hydroxypropylmethycellulose HPMC K 4, hydroxypropymethylcellulose HPMC K 100, calcium hydrogen phosphate Emcompress, lactose Tablettosa respectively. Tablet breakage kinetics parameteres were decreasing with used substances in order microcrystalline cellulose Ceolus, hydroxypropymethylcellulose HPMC K 100, hydroxypropylmethycellulose HPMC K 4, and the lowest results were registered with lactose Tablettossa and calcium hydrogen phosphate Emcompress...|$|R
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco as Hugh of Borg, a Borg drone who was {{disconnected}} from the collective by Geordi La Forge and Beverly <b>Crusher.</b>|$|E
5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly <b>Crusher</b> (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist <b>Crusher</b> in bringing the Borg back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. <b>Crusher</b> is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E

50|$|A <b>crush</b> fetish is a fetish and a {{paraphilia}} {{in which}} one is sexually aroused when someone <b>crushes</b> objects, food, and sometimes small animals (frequently insects) with their body, usually under their foot, or when <b>crushed</b> oneself. The term soft <b>crush</b> refers to the more common fetish surrounding videos involving inanimate objects (such as food) or small invertebrates (e.g. insects, snails, worms, cockroaches, ants, arachnids) being <b>crushed,</b> while the term hard <b>crush</b> refers to such videos involving vertebrate animals (e.g. reptiles, birds, mammals). The preference could be barefoot, high-heels, flip flops, socks, sandals and so on, depending on the fetishist. Most soft <b>crush</b> fetishists prefer to distinguish themselves from hard <b>crush</b> fetishists, believing that <b>crush</b> films with larger animals give the entire group a bad label.|$|R

5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. <b>Crusher</b> to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. <b>Crusher</b> reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Many planned {{elements}} were never filmed, due to production time constraints. Moore {{had hoped for}} an extended battle scene in which Data would be electrocuted, and Wesley <b>Crusher</b> blown up in an explosion. Production of the episode ended on December 19.|$|E
40|$|Demolition {{materials}} are generated by demolition activities and {{account for a}} major proportion of the waste materials present in landfills. <b>Crushed</b> brick and <b>crushed</b> concrete are major components of demolition materials. Recycled <b>crushed</b> concrete, <b>crushed</b> brick and <b>crushed</b> rock are however viable substitute materials for natural resources used as construction materials in engineering applications. This paper presents the laboratory testing results of various proportions of <b>crushed</b> brick blends with <b>crushed</b> concrete. The engineering properties obtained were compared with existing local authority specifications for pavement subbase and drainage systems to ascertain the potential use of <b>crushed</b> brick blends in these applications. The demolition materials for the experimental works were collected from a recycling site in Victoria, Australia...|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} {{summarize}} the tablet's parameters such as pressing, <b>crushing</b> and the kinetics of the tablets. Moreover, the <b>crushing</b> force, tensile strenght, volume <b>crushing</b> force, trajectory, <b>crushing</b> energy, volume <b>crushing</b> energy and relations between compression force and compression pressure, <b>crushing</b> force {{and influence of}} compression force onto the tensile strenght, <b>crushing</b> force and volume <b>crushing</b> force. These characteristics have been investigated by using tablets made of microcrystalline celulosis called Avicel 103 and Avicel 301, saccharosis, sorbitole and mannitole (Pearlitole). Tablets were pressed with the using of various pressing pressures and then <b>crushed.</b> Parameters and relations inbetween them are followed by the force-trajectory data record, that has been acquired {{during the process of}} <b>crushing.</b> As the results are, the dependance among <b>crushing</b> and pressing forces is linear in the latitude of 4 - 15 kN, therefore for other enumerations I used the values gained during these measurements. Parameters of the destructing process for the numbers of <b>crushing</b> force, tensile strenght ans volume destruction energy were the highest with usage of Avicel 103 and then descending through Avicel 301, sorbitole, pearlitole and saccharose.

5|$|Picard and an away team {{board the}} Stargazer, and he orders a chest of his {{belongings}} {{to be sent}} to the Enterprise. Hidden in the chest is an orb, which glows brighter as Bok activates it, causing Picard to be hit by a wave of pain. Dr. <b>Crusher</b> orders him back to the Enterprise. Data meanwhile finds a discrepancy in the Stargazers logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a flag of truce. Upon further investigation, Data and La Forge report to Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that the logs were certainly faked. Dr. <b>Crusher</b> and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) discuss the Captain, and Wesley shows them some unusual activity from the Ferengi ship. They head to inform Riker to alert him to the signals, who is informed by the Enterprise computer that Picard has transported to the Stargazer.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet crew of the Federation {{starship}} Enterprise-D.

5|$|The Enterprise {{heads to}} Torona IV to open {{negotiations}} with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock (Lawrence Tierney) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. Beverly <b>Crusher</b> (Gates McFadden) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen (David Selburg) {{to join him in}} the holodeck. While <b>Crusher</b> is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary (Gary Armagnac) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is scanned from a distance by the Jaradan, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. <b>Crusher</b> later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.|$|E
