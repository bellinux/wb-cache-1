40|$|This study {{characterized}} {{measures of}} <b>community</b> <b>activity</b> and participation of transtibial amputees based on combined data from separate accelerometer and GPS devices. The relationship between <b>community</b> <b>activity</b> and participation and standard clinical measures was assessed. Forty-seven {{participants were recruited}} (78 % male, mean age 60. 5 years). Participants wore the accelerometer and GPS devices for seven consecutive days. Data were linked to assess <b>community</b> <b>activity</b> (<b>community</b> based step counts) and community participation (number of <b>community</b> visits). <b>Community</b> <b>activity</b> and participation were compared across amputee K-level groups. Forty-six participants completed the study. On average each participant completed 16, 645 (standard deviation (SD) 13, 274) community steps and 16 (SD 10. 9) community visits over seven days. There were differences between K-level groups for measures of <b>community</b> <b>activity</b> (F(2, 45) = 9. 4, p < 0. 001) and participation (F(2, 45) = 6. 9, p = 0. 002) with lower functioning K 1 / 2 amputees demonstrating lower levels of <b>community</b> <b>activity</b> and participation than K 3 and K 4 amputees. There {{was no significant difference}} between K 3 and K 4 for <b>community</b> <b>activity</b> (p = 0. 28) or participation (p = 0. 43). This study demonstrated methodology to link accelerometer and GPS data to assess <b>community</b> <b>activity</b> and participation in a group of transtibial amputees.

5|$|Initially, {{the library}} had {{a cache of}} books waiting for the {{completion}} and grand opening that was provided by local residents and schools, as Carnegie's gift for the construction did not cover the initial costs of new books. A call was also put out for citizens to donate books to the new facility to expand the collection. In 1907, the Seattle Public Library {{took control of the}} Carnegie library, when Ballard was annexed by the neighboring City of Seattle government. Early Scandinavian immigrants to Ballard and the Pacific Northwest in particular made use of the new facility; Ballard as an area has a strong historical presence of Scandinavian people. Early in the library's existence, it had a turnstile at the entrance to its book stacks, to count the number of book borrowers that passed through. With the arrival of World War I, the Carnegie Library became home to various <b>community</b> <b>activities,</b> such as dispensing information on the war, and also provided Red Cross and English language classes. In 1942, during World War II, one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, Lucille Smith, was assigned to the Carnegie library.|$|E
