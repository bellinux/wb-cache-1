5|$|The creek turns sharply {{west and}} then back south, then shortly after, is forced into a concrete-lined box culvert that <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> through {{downtown}} Laguna Beach (This stretch {{is also known as}} Broadway Creek.) It then is diverted completely underground and its channel winds to an outfall at Main Beach, {{one of the most popular}} beaches in Laguna Beach.|$|E
5|$|The female usually {{attaches}} the egg {{case to a}} substrate, inserts it into a suitably protective crevice, or <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> about {{until just}} before the eggs hatch. Some species, however, are ovoviviparous, keeping the eggs inside their body, with or without an egg case, until they hatch. At least one genus, Diploptera, is fully viviparous.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E
60|$|Hans Hecklemann had no luck at all. Now {{and then}} we hear folks {{say that they have}} no luck, but they only mean that their luck is bad and that they are ashamed of it. Everybody but Hans Hecklemann had luck of some kind, either good or bad, and, what is more, {{everybody}} carries his luck about with him; some <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> in their pocket-books, some <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> in their hats, some <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> on their finger tips, and some <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> under their tongues--these are lawyers. Mine is at this moment sitting astride of my pen, though I can no more see it than though it was thin air; whether it is good or bad depends entirely as to how you look upon it.|$|R

50|$|Until 1993, many area {{cable systems}} {{chose not to}} <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> {{due to a lack}} of {{compelling}} programming, poor signal quality or inadequate viewership—most notably Marcus Cable (now part of Charter Communications), the largest cable provider in Milwaukee's outer suburbs. On the systems that did <b>carry</b> <b>it,</b> it was relegated to a lower-tier slot; it aired on channel 29 on Milwaukee's Time Warner Cable system, and on channel 48 in outlying areas.|$|R
5|$|He then {{falls in}} love with Delilah in the valley of Sorek. The Philistines {{approach}} Delilah and induce her with 1,100 silver coins to find the secret of Samson's strength so that they can capture their enemy, but Samson refuses to reveal the secret and teases her, telling her that he will lose his strength if he is bound with fresh bowstrings. She does so while he sleeps, but when he wakes up he snaps the strings. She persists, and he tells her that he can be bound with new ropes. She ties him up with new ropes while he sleeps, and he snaps them, too. She asks again, and he says that he can be bound if his locks are woven into a weaver's loom. She weaves them into a loom, but he simply destroys the entire loom and <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> off when he wakes.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Chris takes {{a shotgun}} from his father-in-law's home and <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> {{to his office}} in a tennis bag. On leaving, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news for her. He goes to Nola's {{building}} and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, who he shoots and kills and then stages a burglary by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns he shoots her in the stairwell. Chris then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. Scotland Yard investigates the crime and concludes it was committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E

5|$|Tequila {{finds the}} last {{baby in the}} {{maternity}} unit, and <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> to safety while fighting off {{the last of the}} gangsters. Alan and Tequila meet up again and are confronted by Wong, who has set bombs to blow up the building. Alan pursues Wong as Tequila escapes the hospital with the last baby, the hospital exploding around him. Outside, Wong suddenly appears holding Alan at gunpoint. After watching Wong humiliate Tequila, Alan grabs Wong's pistol. In a struggle, Alan shoots himself through the stomach giving Tequila enough time to shoot Wong dead. Later at the police station, Pang and Tequila burn Alan's police file. Alan then sails away from Hong Kong in his boat.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving Port Penn, DE 9 heads through {{marshland}} {{with some}} fields and woods within the Augustine Wildlife Area. The route rises onto the Reedy Point Bridge, which <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. After crossing over the canal, the road crosses over Fort DuPont State Park, curving northwest and passing {{to the southwest}} of Fort DuPont and the Governor Bacon Health Center. DE 9 continues into Delaware City and becomes 5th Street, crossing the Delaware City Channel on a drawbridge. Past the drawbridge, the road heads through residential {{areas of the city}} and intersects Clinton Street, which leads northeast to the Forts Ferry Crossing which provides access to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island, part of Fort Delaware State Park.|$|E
5|$|MD363 {{begins at}} a dead end in the {{community}} of Wenona {{at the southern end of}} Deal Island. The state highway heads north, sharply curving before crossing Middle Creek. The road runs through another series of sharp curves through marshland before straightening out and passing St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and the old post office building, two examples of buildings on the island preserved as part of the Deal Island Historic District. The route passes a boat ramp accessed from Ralph Abbott Road before a high-level bridge <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> over Upper Thorofare, a strait between Laws Cove and Tangier Sound. On the north side of the bridge, MD363 intersects MD363A, the northern approach to the previous bridge to Deal Island, before passing through the community of Chance, the site of Rock Creek Methodist Episcopal Church. After passing Haines Point Road, which leads to a large public boat ramp, the state highway continues northeast across the two branches of Rock Creek and through more marshland before entering Dames Quarter. MD363 traverses Dames Quarter Creek and passes through Deal Island Wildlife Management Area.|$|E

5000|$|In recent decades, Northampton {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of Pennsylvania's [...] "swing counties," [...] with statewide winners <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> in most cases; since 1952, it has gone to the statewide winner in the presidential election. All five statewide winners <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> in November 2004 and all four statewide Democratic candidates <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> in November 2008, with its District Attorney John Morganelli doing well there despite losing statewide to incumbent Attorney General Tom Corbett. The Democratic Party has been dominant most of the time in county-level politics in recent decades. In 2016, Donald Trump ended that streak when he became the first Republican presidential candidate to win Northampton County since 1988.|$|R
5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E
5|$|The bushcrow feeds both on {{the ground}} and in trees. It begins {{foraging}} at sunrise. While foraging, a bushcrow can be alone, in a pair, or in a group of six or seven other bushcrows. A foraging bushcrow digs vigorously in the soil while its beak is held slightly open to catch any insects it unearths. When it catches something, it <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> to the nearest tree or bush, pins it down with its foot, and kills and eats the prey. This species has also been seen using its beak to tear apart rotten wood and inspecting cattle dung in the search for food. It may also land on the backs of cattle to search for parasites. It can also chase flying insects, which it does on foot, abruptly changing direction and taking flying leaps after its prey. It often mixes with white-crowned starlings, red-billed hornbills, red-billed buffalo weavers, and superb starlings while foraging. When hunting in the trees, it is capable of walking atop horizontal branches and jumping upwards towards the crown, then descending in a glide from the crown to the ground.|$|E

To attract and stimulate macrophages, the cholesterol must {{be released from}} the LDL particles and oxidized, a key step in the ongoing inflammatory process. The process is worsened if there is insufficient high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the lipoprotein particle that removes cholesterol from tissues and <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> back to the liver.|$|E

Subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation.|$|E
25|$|Swordfish {{charge at}} high speeds through forage fish schools, {{slashing}} with their swords to kill or stun prey. They then turn and return to consume their catch. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes. Spinner sharks charge vertically through schools, spinning on their axis with their mouths open and snapping all around. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiralling runs often <b>carries</b> <b>it</b> into the air.|$|E
