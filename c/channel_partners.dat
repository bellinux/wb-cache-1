500|$|In September 2004, Juniper {{entered the}} market for {{enterprise}} access routers with three routers that were {{the first of the}} J-series product family. It used the <b>channel</b> <b>partners</b> acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market. Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches. According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was [...] "the first serious threat" [...] to competing products from Cisco. Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.|$|E

2500|$|Tim Cook, {{who joined}} Apple in 1998 as Senior Vice President for Worldwide Operations, {{announced}} {{the company would}} [...] "cut some <b>channel</b> <b>partners</b> {{that may not be}} providing the buying experience [...] We're not happy with everybody." [...] Jobs severed Apple's ties of every big box retailer, including Sears, Best Buy, Circuit City, Computer City and Office Max to focus its retail efforts with CompUSA. Between 1997 and 2000, the number of Mac authorized resellers dropped from 20,000 to just 11,000. The majority of these were cuts made by Apple itself. Jobs proclaimed that Apple would be targeting Dell, with Cook's mandate to match or exceed Dell's lean inventories and streamlined supply chain, [...] "with our new products and our new store and our new build-to-order, we're coming after you, buddy." [...] While Dell had operated as a direct mail order and online order company, having pulled out of retailers to realize greater profit margins and efficiency, Apple had direct orders with sales handled by its <b>channel</b> <b>partners,</b> other mail order resellers, independent dealerships, and the new relationship with CompUSA to build [...] "stores within a store".|$|E

40|$|Many {{suppliers}} invest {{heavily in}} <b>channel</b> <b>partner</b> programs that incentivize selling and learning. The authors conduct a multi-wave field study {{to investigate the}} roles of indebtedness and gratitude in transforming these investments into returns. The results show that indebtedness has negative effects on commitment to the supplier, {{as well as the}} reseller's sales effort. Gratitude however attenuates the effects of indebtedness on sales effort and commitment, and thus offers a buffer against indebtedness' negative effects. Indebtedness and gratitude thus play key roles in <b>channel</b> <b>partner</b> programs. In addition, the results highlight the importance of perceived motives as they differentially predict these two states. Benevolent motives are found to increase gratitude, though ulterior motives do not detract from it. Ulterior motives do however increase indebtedness. Finally, the results also reveal how entitlement negatively impacts <b>channel</b> <b>partner</b> programs: It decreases the positive effect of perceived program value on partner gratitude while increasing the effect of ulterior motives on indebtedness. This study thus assesses the simultaneous yet contrasting role of gratitude and indebtedness, as well as the complexity associated with realizing the full benefits of <b>channel</b> <b>partner</b> programs. The findings have implications for suppliers, marketers, and further research...|$|R
