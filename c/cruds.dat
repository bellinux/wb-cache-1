40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{iron oxide}} <b>crud</b> was studied at 25 ºC {{and over the}} range 240 to 270 ºC in a high pressure water loop. <b>Crud</b> deposition and removal was measured in two parallel, heated Zircaloy- 2 tubes using iron- 59 as a radioactive tracer. This {{proved to be a}} powerful technique capable of detecting <b>crud</b> deposits less than 3 run thick. Rapid deposition of <b>crud</b> was observed following injection into the loop of an iron oxide suspension or a ferric nitrate solution. <b>Crud</b> deposited preferentially on heated surfaces when they were present but not to the exclusion of deposition elsewhere; hot spots on heated surfaces attracted additional deposits. Subcooled boiling appeared to be a more important factor than bulk boiling in the enhancement of <b>crud</b> deposition. The initial rapid deposition of the bulk of the <b>crud</b> throughout the loop was usually followed by a slower transfer of <b>crud</b> from other surfaces to any heated surface present. Unsteady operating conditions, e. g. a change in power, temperature or pH, frequently caused <b>crud</b> bursts, but once steady conditions were re-established the entrained <b>crud</b> was quickly redeposited. The bulk of deposited <b>crud</b> was not readily re-entrained, particularly from heated surfaces, so that <b>crud</b> bursts involved {{only a fraction of the}} total <b>crud</b> deposited. Ferric nitrate solutions injected into the loop formed haematite which deposited more slowly and formed more mobile deposits than magnetite which was injected directly into the loop as a slurry. Examination of deposits from both sources showed them to be even and tightly adherent, being removed only with difficulty...|$|R

40|$|<b>CRUD</b> {{is a term}} {{commonly}} used to describe deposited corrosion products that form {{on the surface of}} fuel cladding rods during the operation of Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR). <b>CRUD</b> has deleterious effects on reactor operation and currently, there is no effective way to mitigate its formation. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) <b>CRUD</b> Resistant Fuel Cladding project has the objective to study the effect of different surface modifications of Zircaloy cladding on the formation of <b>CRUD,</b> and ultimately minimize its effects. This modification will alter the surface chemistry and therefore the <b>CRUD</b> formation rate. The objective {{of this study was to}} construct a pool boiling facility at atmospheric pressure and sub-cooled boiling conditions, and test a series of samples in simulated PWR water with a high concentration of nanoparticulate <b>CRUD</b> precursors. After testing, ZrC was the only material out of six that did not develop dark, circular spots, which are hypothesized to be the beginnings of <b>CRUD</b> boiling chimneys.

40|$|<b>CRUD</b> (Chalk River Unidentified Deposits) is {{buildup of}} metal oxides on the {{interior}} of nuclear reactors. This is caused by corrosion in reactor internals, leading to problems such as coolant contamination in porous deposits left by <b>CRUD.</b> <b>CRUD</b> has forced many nuclear reactors into temporary shutdown or production downgrades, costing millions of dollars US per reactor. If the <b>CRUD</b> growth factors could be fully understood, they could be controlled, and the <b>CRUD</b> problem could be eliminated altogether. Atomic force microscopy {{can be used to}} measure the force, or the strength of the CRUD-clad bond with different materials. This research focuses on answering this question: How does the force change between <b>CRUD</b> particles and different materials {{that could be used for}} reactor cladding? This study will analyze lab-grown <b>CRUD</b> samples on different substrate materials and characterize <b>CRUD</b> growth on each. It was found the CRUD-bond forces (from least to greatest) on silicon carbide (SiC), Titanium aluminum carbide (Ti 2 AlC), and max-phase zirconium alloy 211 (Zr 4 M 211) behaved similarly in air and in water. The forces on each surface increased with increasing dwell time for the Fe 3 O 4 particle AFM tip; in contrast, most adhesion forces stayed constant with the NiO AFM tip. Furthermore, these <b>CRUD</b> forces were compared to other non-accident tolerant fuels, and there are cases in which non-ATF materials show more <b>CRUD</b> resistance (less adhesive force) than ATF-materials. This study's analysis could be applied to other materials to be used for reactor cladding. Once the material with the lowest-strength <b>CRUD</b> bond is identified and installed, the nuclear industry could save millions of dollars US per reactor fuel cycle. by Rasheed Auguste. Thesis: S.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the microwave assisted remediation of organic containing aqueous solutions has been conducted. Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), the nuclear thel reprocessing solvent, and its diluents, {{are known to be}} responsible for the formation of interfacial deposits (<b>cruds)</b> in the alkali solvent wash stage of the Purex process for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. The presence of <b>cruds</b> in the process is managed by regular wash out and the collected <b>cruds</b> are separated from aqueous washings and stored. Chemical oxidation of the <b>cruds</b> is one way of destroying them. This project explored microwave assisted oxidation, using TBP as a simple simulant for the crud. Low concentration TBP streams were circulated through an activated carbon loaded glass reaction vessel. The vessel was then subject to microwave radiation applied in short pulses. Studies were performed to assess the variation in reaction parameters using two oxidants; air and hydrogen peroxide. The analytical techniques used to assess the extent of decomposition were ion chromatography and UV-V is spectroscopy.

40|$|Fouling {{has been}} a {{persistent}} problem for fluid-solid interfaces, varying from heat exchangers to ship hulls. In nuclear power plants, buildup of <b>CRUD</b> can accelerate corrosion, increase pressure drops, cause axial power shifts, and increase radiation dose to workers. In this experiment, we studied the effect of induced microcavity and micropost patterns on <b>CRUD</b> morphology at atmospheric pressure. Samples with various pitches of microcavities and microposts were boiled in simulated PWR coolant. The effect of heat flux on <b>CRUD</b> formation was also examined. The experiments support previous theories that subcooled nucleate boiling is enhanced at microcavities, and that <b>CRUD</b> deposition is promoted at those sites. A thin ring of particles, less than a micrometer in width, was seen around most microcavities even when the surrounding areas were <b>crudded.</b> However, some of the samples with microcavity pitches 50 pm and smaller experienced a pattern of clean and <b>crudded</b> areas, with the region around the microcavities free of <b>CRUD</b> more often than not. A theory is put forth that this is caused by interfering forces due to bubbles collapsing. The micropost samples showed substantial <b>CRUD</b> growth, particularly for the sample subjected to a high heat flux. The results of this experiment could have major implications for development of a self-cleaning material for heated surfaces. by Leigh Lin. Thesis: S.

40|$|In {{water-cooled}} nuclear reactors, {{various species}} {{are present in}} the coolant, either in ionic solution, or entrained as very fine particles. Most arise from corrosion of primary circuit surfaces, or from chemicals, such as boric acid, lithium hydroxide, zinc and hydrogen, deliberately added to the coolant. These materials deposit on the surfaces of fuel pins, typically in the upper regions of the core, forming what is generally termed “crud”. This thesis reports a study of the thermal-hydraulic consequences of this deposit. These <b>crud</b> deposits are generally found to contain a large population of through-thickness chimneys, and it is believed that this gives rise to a wick-boiling mechanism of heat transfer. A coupled two-dimensional model of the processes of heat conduction, advection and species diffusion in the <b>crud</b> has been developed. An iterative scheme has been employed to solve the set of coupled equations of each process. The wick boiling process {{has been found to be}} an efficient heat transfer mode, taking away about 80 % of the heat generated. It has also been found that consideration of heat transfer in the clad can increase the predicted solute concentration in the <b>crud.</b> The effects of some important parameters, such as chimney density, chimney radius, porosity of the <b>crud,</b> <b>crud</b> thickness, clad heat flux and boron concentration in the coolant have been investigated. The fuel thermal performance has been characterized in terms of an effective <b>crud</b> thermal conductivity, and the non-linear dependence this has on parameters such as <b>crud</b> thickness and chimney density had been determined. Lastly, it is observed that plausible pore sizes of the <b>crud,</b> coupled with higher temperatures in the <b>crud,</b> may be such that a film of vapour is generated at the base of the <b>crud.</b> Initial estimates are presented of the cladding temperatures and solute concentration that may be generated as a consequence of this vapour layer.
