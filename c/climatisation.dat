50|$|Below the narthex of {{the church}} is the crypt which was adapted during 2007. It is {{installed}} new ground marble, <b>climatisation</b> and ventilation, sound system and graves ware readopted. In it are several tombs transferred from the original church: Metropolitan Teodosije (1815-1892), Bishop Viktor of Niš Viktor (1797-1888), Bishop Gavrilo (Popović, 1811-1871) of Šabac, and Bishop Mojsije of Timok (1835-1896). Also interred here are King Alexander Obrenović and Queen Draga (†1903), Ana Jovana Obrenović (†1880), Princes Milan M. Obrenović (1819-1839) and Sergije M. Obrenović († 1878), and the grave of the patron endower of the old church, Lazar Panća. Generally speaking, the entire space of the very large crypt is little used and suitable for a gallery, museum or display area. The church treasury is presently located in a room on the south side and contains a rich collection of icons and precious artifacts. The most valuable icons are Theotokos with Christ from the 16th century; Jesus Christ on the Throne, an icon {{from the end of the}} 18th century; St. Nicholas on the Throne, Holy Emperor Constantine and Empress Helen, an icon from the first half of the 19th century; St. Demetrios and St. George, an icon from 1849; Theotokos with the Saints, an icon from the first half of the 19th century; St. George and St. Demetrios, an icon from the mid-19th century; Crowning of the Most Holy Theotokos, an icon from the mid-19th century; Holy Emperor Constantine and Empress Helen (Exaltation of the Honorable Cross), an icon from the mid-19th century; Theotokos with Christ, the Holy Prophet Daniel and St. John the Baptist, an icon from 1863; Theotokos ofArabia, an icon from 1872; St. Sava of Serbia, an icon from 1870; Holy King Stefan of Dečani, an icon from 1883; Holy Apostle and Evangelist Mark, an icon from the end of the 19th century; Holy Archangel Michael, an icon from 1889; the Pilgrims' icon (the Theotokos, Jesus Christ, the apostles, the Final Judgment), an icon from the end of the 19th century; St. George Killing the Dragon, an icon from 1926; and many other icons.

Therefore, exergy analysis has been widely applied in parallel with energy analysis in order to find the most rational use of energy.

Room’s dimensions (6 m x 6 m in plant and 4 m height) and lighting from above are compatible with uses as show-room of art gallery or museum, class room and lecture room. The device includes an heliostat with variable geometry, that can exploits direct or sky diffuse solar radiation as function of season and weather conditions. During the cold season the direct radiation, if present, is re-directed inside the room on diffusing ceiling. During the warm season the device modifies its configuration and allows to enter only to the fraction of sky diffuse radiation that is required for daylighting. This radiation comes from the North side of the sky-dome. The direct radiation impinging on the South side of the device is used to create in its interior a solar stack effect, that contribute to air extraction and natural ventilation. Dimensions of aperture on ceiling, device’s geometry and its control logic have been optimised by means of computer simulations, with the aim to minimise the total annual energy demand for <b>climatisation</b> and illumination.

The principal electrical load of an electric vehicle used in equatorial regions comprises of the traction motor and the air-conditioning compressor motor.

Lecture by: ing. Marc Jacobs (Department of Technology), dr. ir. Michel Van Dessel (Department of Applied Engineering) Institute: Campus De Nayer Country: Belgium Date of Lecture: 10 June 2010 The Campus De Nayer located near Mechelen (Belgium) offers Master degree programmes at the department of Applied Engineering and Bachelor degree programmes at the department of Technology. The four-year programmes lead to a master degree in the following engineering disciplines: civil construction, land surveying, biochemical engineering, chemical engineering, electromechanical engineering, automotive engineering, electrical engineering (automation, electrical energy) and electronics-ICT. The three-year programmes form a bachelor degree in the disciplines automotive engineering, electromechanics (automation, <b>climatisation,</b> maintenance), electronics-ICT (domotics / immotics, electronics, ICT) and mechanical design and production technology. Different types of student projects exist in the 3 rd year of the bachelor programme. In the short term projects a team of students is given a technological task that has to be realised within a 6 -week period, including demonstration and presentation. The other project type is the bachelor degree project, usually performed by two students in a 12 -week period. The technological problem to be solved in the bachelor degree project is preferably formulated within a company and has to be implemented in demonstration phase or as a prototype design. In the lecture the task description, implementation strategy and results from student projects using innovative automation technology are presented.

Different software tools have been systematically evaluated and the most useful ones for historic buildings were Hambase [9, 10] and WUFIplus [8, 11, 12]. The results of hygrothermal whole building simulation cover the whole range of hourly energy demand for building conditioning for each zone, hourly indoor temperature and relative humidity for comfort and damage assessment as well as hygrothermal conditions on and in the envelope components to assess hygric issues like mould growth [8]. Thus, the full building simulations give a better representation of the hygrothermal performance of the building but this is at a high cost of developing the model and relatively long times for computing.|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{aircraft}} cabin <b>climatisation</b> {{has been developed}} in which the seat is the main Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and temperature control system for the passengers containing provisions for local supply and local exhaust of air. Direct supply of clean outside air in the breathing zone, through the headrest of the seat, yields a high ventilation efficiency enabling e. g. local humidification and, depending on disturbances of the cabin ventilation system, 57 - 96 % shielding against contaminants from other passengers. Exhaust of 0 - 2 dm 3 /s per seat involves a cooling load of 0 - 20 W, which is up to 20 % of the metabolism of a seated person. Control of cabin temperature takes place at two levels: 1.

The Paris Agreement has changed this situation. Its preamble recognises “the rights of indigenous peoples” and the possibility for some cultures to conceptualise “biodiversity” as “Mother Earth”. How does the climate regime affect the traditional knowledge category, and conversely, how does the inclusion of traditional knowledge affect the climate regime? Using the “translation” concept, we argue that this cross-translation process results from a kind of metaphoric barter. The <b>climatisation</b> of traditional knowledge leads {{to a form of}} strategic objectification through politics and science.

40|$|The {{building}} sector represents 40 % of {{the total}} primary energy consumption, half of which is used for space heating and cooling. In low-energy buildings with both a heating and cooling demand, a ground coupled heat pump system (GCHP) can reduce the primary energy consumption for <b>climatisation</b> by almost 50 % compared to conventional heating and cooling technologies. The bottleneck for a large market penetration of GCHPs is the high investment cost related to the borefield with vertical ground loop heat exchangers.

40|$|Population {{growth and}} rapid {{urbanisation}} {{may result in}} a shortage of food supplies for cities in the foreseeable future. Research on closed plant production systems, such as plant factories, has attempted to offer perspectives for robust (urban) agricultural systems. Insight into the explicit role of plant processes in the total energy balance of these production systems is required to determine their potential. We describe a crop transpiration model that is able to determine the relation between sensible and latent heat exchange, as well as the corresponding vapour flux for the production of lettuce in closed systems. Subsequently, this model is validated for the effect of photosynthetic photon flux, cultivation area cover and air humidity on lettuce transpiration, using literature research and experiments. Results demonstrate that the transpiration rate was accurately simulated for the aforementioned effects. Thereafter we quantify and discuss the energy productivity of a standardised plant factory and illustrate the importance of transpiration as a design parameter for <b>climatisation.</b> Our model can provide a greater insight into the energetic expenditure and performance of closed systems. Consequently, it can provide a starting point for determining the viability and optimisation of plant factories...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a literature review about the exergetic analyses of cooling systems in buildings. The main {{focus is on}} temperate climate zones where mainly cooling systems like heat pumps, natural cooling, solar <b>climatisation</b> and PCM`s are used. In the past, exergy was only determined for steady state conditions. Consequently, significant errors arose from the non-consideration of the constantly changing reference environment. These errors are greater for cooling than for heating systems, since under summer conditions, indoor air temperature is almost identical to the external air temperature. This leads to strong fluctuations of the Carnot factor during the summer cooling period, and thus, the exergy flows. Dynamic fluctuations of the indoor and outdoor humidity strongly influence the chemical and physical exergy of the system. If the humidity is regarded in the analysis, dynamic calculations are necessary to allow a more precise determination of the exergy flows. Therefore, {{the most important question}} is the problem of the humidity treatment in context of cooling applications under dynamic conditions. In addition, an important issue is how the exergy concept can help in increasing the use of renewable energies or passive systems that are adjusted to the buildings and their utilization...|$|E

Four 2080 s scenarios were analysed for 6 European locations, using {{as a case study}} fattening pig farms and 3 cooling technologies: natural and forced ventilation, and cooling pads. The climate scenarios were constructed as a combination of general circulation models (Had CM 2 and ECHAM 4) downscaled for Europe with the HIRHAM and RCA 3 regional models and driven by the A 2 and B 2 socio-economic scenarios. A steady-state heat balance model was used for the energy analysis in the livestock farms. The results showed that no changes in cooling technologies are necessary in the Mediterranean Basin; cooling pads were efficient enough for adequate <b>climatisation</b> both in the present and future scenarios. In northern European locations results were different, depending on the future scenario. Most scenarios indicated that cooling pads will be needed in fattening pig farms in the 2080 s, while ventilation is efficient enough in the present scenario.

This points to a broader two-way shift in the global climate debate. On the one hand, we are witnessing a globalisation of the climate problem through the inclusion of new issues and actors into the climate regime. This globalisation is more sectorial than spatial, as it mainly relates to the extension of the climate problem to other domains (even if this territorial dimension is also important). On the other hand, a <b>climatisation</b> of the world can be observed, whereby actors present particular issues that were formerly unrelated to the climate regime through a ‘climatic lens’.

40|$|Low-e-coatings on {{the outer}} surface of {{architectural}} glazing are used for several years to prevent fog and frost for a clear view in the winter. Also for outdoor parked cars at night they were successfully tested. In the article, the occurrence of condensation on automotive glazing is simulated depending on the weather conditions, the emissivity of the outer surface, day or night, parking or moving vehicle. It is shown {{that the risk of}} outside condensation arises from the cooling down of the car cabin below the outside air temperature. The highest risk occurs for inclined windshields at night with clear sky and no wind. With decreasing emissivity, however, it decreases sharply. Further calculations show that due to low-e-coatings {{on the outer}} surface the solar energy balance Q bal. i of the vehicle cabin increases during daytime. At low solar irradiance this has a positive effect on the cabin <b>climatisation</b> during the heating season, especially in the morning time after outdoor parking. At high irradiation in midsummer, the air conditioner is however only slightly loaded more both when parking as well as driving.
