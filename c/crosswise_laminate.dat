40|$|Recently, {{some reports}} {{show that the}} {{ultra-low}} thermal conductivity of bulk polymers can be enhanced along one direction, which limits its applications. Here, we proposed paved <b>crosswise</b> <b>laminate</b> methods which can enhance the thermal conductivity of bulk polyethylene (PE) along two directions. We find that the thermal conductivity of paved crosswise polyethylene laminate (PPEL) reaches as high as 181 W/m-K along two in-plane directions, which is three orders of magnitude larger than bulk amorphous polyethylene and even more than two times larger than PE single chain (54 W/m-K). The analyses of mechanism indicated that PPEL {{is a much more}} crystal-like structure due to the inter-chain van der Waals interactions. Our study may provide guides on the design and fabrication of polymer structures with high thermal conductivity. Comment: 21 page...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject-matter}} of the diploma {{thesis is}} {{the research of}} effects of acoustic properties which are used for making piano bridges. In this work technological process of different piano bridges is discussed and problems related to it. In the next step materials like: maple, hardrock maple, laminated maple, laminated maple and mahagony, ebony, beech, <b>laminated</b> beech, <b>crosswise</b> glued beech, <b>laminated</b> beech and lignamon and hornbeam are compared in the aspect of acoustic properties. The differences among acoustic properties were searched by non-destructive methods {{with the help of}} device metering and final elements method. A frequence analysis of embedded grand piano soundboard was made. Statically eminent differences of acoustic properties were found among metering samples. There were found out the own frequences of metering soundboard and frequency spectrum in particular parts of piano bridg...|$|R
