5|$|Padayappa was {{released}} on 10 April 1999 {{on the eve of}} Tamil New Year's day. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide without the involvement of distributors. It was also the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 prints, and 700,000 audio cassettes. The film's rights in Japan were sold for US$50,000, which was the highest an Indian film fetched for commercial release in 1999. Co-producer Thenappan registered the film posters as a Class 34 trademark in 1998, to be used for trademarking such items as beedis, cigarettes, <b>cheroots</b> and tobacco, making it the first instance of brand extension in the Tamil film industry. The pre-release business of the film's overseas rights amounted to 30 million. According to an estimate by trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai, the value of the theatrical and satellite rights for Padayappa was approximately 20 million.|$|E
500|$|Cotton-ginning {{and weaving}} {{were two of}} the main {{industries}} in the Madras Presidency. Cotton was produced in large quantities in the Bellary district and was pressed in Georgetown, Madras. The scarcity of cotton in Lancashire caused by a decline in trade due to the American Civil War gave an impetus to cotton and textile production and led to cotton presses being established all over the Presidency. In {{the early years of the}} 20th century, Coimbatore emerged as an important centre for cotton textiles and earned the epithet [...] "Manchester of South India". The northern districts of Godavari, Vizagapatam and Kistna were well-known cotton-weaving centres. There was a sugar factory at Aska in Ganjam run by F. J. V. Minchin and another at Nellikuppam in South Arcot district run by the East India Distilleries and Sugar Factories Company. In the Telugu-speaking northern districts of the presidency large quantities of tobacco were cultivated to be subsequently rolled into <b>cheroots.</b> Trichinopoly, Madras and Dindigul were the main cheroot-producing areas. Until the discovery of artificial aniline and alizarine dyes, Madras possessed a thriving vegetable dye manufacturing industry. The city also imported large quantities of aluminium for the manufacture of aluminium utensils. In the early 20th century, the government established the Chrome Tanning Factory which manufactured high-quality leather. The first brewery in the Presidency was founded in the Nilgiri Hills in 1826. Coffee was cultivated in the region of Wynad and the kingdoms of Coorg and Mysore while tea was grown on the slopes of the Nilgiri Hills. Coffee plantations were also established in Travancore but a severe blight at the end of the 19th century destroyed coffee cultivation in the kingdom and almost wiped out coffee plantations in neighbouring Wynad. [...] Coffee-curing works were located at Calicut, Tellicherry, Mangalore and Coimbatore. In 1947, Madras had 3,761 factories with 276,586 operatives.|$|E
2500|$|Another common {{practise}} is {{for individuals}} to renovate the shrines to create a better-looking or grander shrine for the Datuk. In most places {{where there is a}} heavy presence of Datuk spirits, it is common to see shrines becoming larger over time, especially if individuals consider the Datuk to be [...] "powerful". The kenduri items usually consist of yellow (saffron) rice, lamb or chicken curries, vegetables, pisang rastali (bananas), young coconuts, rose syrup, <b>cheroots</b> (local cigars) and local fruits. Visitors are also asked to show respect when inside or around a shrine.|$|E
50|$|Feluda then sets about {{checking}} the masks in Rajen-babu's room. He tries {{them on and}} discovers a faint smell of <b>cheroot.</b> The {{only person in the}} vicinity who smoked <b>cheroot</b> is Tinkori-babu. Tinkori-babu, though, had left for Kolkata a day ago.|$|R
60|$|Finding {{his way to}} Trafalgar Square, Mr Sparks {{threw away}} {{the end of his}} <b>cheroot,</b> and, mending his pace, walked smartly along Piccadilly until he gained the {{neighbourhood}} of Knightsbridge. Here he purchased another <b>cheroot,</b> and while lighting it took occasion to ask if there was a street thereabouts named Conway Street.|$|R
60|$|She took a <b>cheroot</b> {{from the}} case, lit it at my proffered match, {{and went on}} talking.|$|R
2500|$|Born {{into an old}} {{established}} Mandalay {{family that}} traded in tobacco and manufactured <b>cheroots,</b> Amar was the fourth {{in a family of}} twelve, of whom only six survived to adulthood. She was educated at the American Baptist Mission School and subsequently the National High School under the headmaster Abdul Razak who later became the Education Minister in Aung San's cabinet and was assassinated with him and others in July 1947. She read science at the Mandalay Intermediate College and went on to Rangoon University for a Bachelor's degree. Her first notable work was a translation of Trials in Burma by Maurice Collis in 1938, and by that time she was already published in the university's Owei ( [...] , Peacock's Call) magazine, and also Kyipwa Yay ( [...] , Progress) magazine, run by her future husband U Hla, under her own name as well as the pen names Mya Myint Zu and Khin La Win.|$|E
60|$|The <b>cheroots,</b> it seemed, {{he could}} better spare, but a {{cigarette}} became his symbol for his lost steadiness and ease.|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{it was a}} {{very new}} land--a land where the people {{understood}} colour--a delightfully lazy land full of pretty girls and very bad <b>cheroots.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{door was}} open, and I {{took off my}} hat and walked in. It wasn't very light; inside, but there she sat in a rocking-chair by the window smoking a black <b>cheroot.</b> And when I got closer I {{saw that she was}} about thirty-nine, and had never seen a {{straight}} front in her life. I sat down on the arm of her chair, and took the <b>cheroot</b> out of her mouth and stole a kiss.|$|R
60|$|Marlow {{paused to}} put {{new life into}} his expiring <b>cheroot,</b> seemed to forget all about the story, and {{abruptly}} began again.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Murthwaite {{took his}} <b>cheroot</b> {{out of his}} mouth, and leaned, in his weary way, against {{the trunk of a}} tree.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a general}} {{expression}} of agreement. <b>Cheroots</b> were lighted, and Harry told his story, with some detail. When he had finished, the colonel said: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped into}} a chair which {{commanded}} {{a clear view of}} Kim and Mahbub Ali in conference beneath the tree. The Padre went indoors for <b>cheroots.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We lit our <b>cheroots</b> {{and rode}} for some miles {{at a brisk}} canter without remark. When we were within a short {{distance}} of home we reined up.|$|E
60|$|We quarrelled about Havanas--we fought o'er a good <b>cheroot,</b> And I {{knew she}} is exacting, {{and she says}} I am a brute.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{the story}} has been an unconscionably long one. I think I will go on deck and smoke a last <b>cheroot,</b> and then turn in." ...|$|R
60|$|The Bride and the Bridegroom {{came out}} into the {{verandah}} after dinner, in order that the smoke of Georgie Porgie's <b>cheroots</b> might not hang in the new drawing-room curtains.|$|E
6000|$|... 'By Jove! I forgot. Of course. Happy to meet you, old man, {{any time}} you like. Got {{everything}} you want? <b>Cheroots,</b> ice, bedding? That's all right. Well, au revoir, Dirkovitch.' ...|$|E
60|$|The musicians play light, zephyr-like airs. MENG BENG and MAH PHRU talk together. MENG BENG smokes a cigar, MAH PHRU {{has one of}} the big yellow <b>cheroots</b> {{affected}} by Burmese women to-day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Out of bounds. Bounds beastly strict these days, too. Besides, {{we shall}} cat." [...] Beetle sniffed the <b>cheroot</b> critically. [...] "It's a regular Pomposo Stinkadore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I to {{understand}} that Colonel Geraldine is afraid?" [...] asked his Highness, taking his <b>cheroot</b> from his lips, and looking keenly into the other's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, light a <b>cheroot,</b> Bathurst," [...] the Major said, [...] "and drink {{off this}} tumbler of brandy and soda, {{and then let}} us hear your story." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{the meal}} was over, <b>cheroots</b> lighted, and a {{decanter}} of port placed on the table, Fairclough asked Harry for the story he had promised him; and the latter accordingly gave them a sketch {{of his life and}} adventures.|$|E
60|$|Heemskirk was not insensible to this suggestion. It {{answered}} to {{his secret}} longing, {{which was not}} a longing for drink, however. Old Nelson shouted solicitously after his broad back a recommendation to make himself comfortable, {{and that there was}} a box of <b>cheroots</b> on the verandah.|$|E
60|$|When {{the curtain}} rises, the {{circular}} platform is deserted. Statues of Buddha seated and recumbent fill the numberless niches in the wall, and before each burn long candles; heaped-up pink roses and japonica on brass trays are lit from above by swinging coloured lamps. At intervals are stalls laden with fruit and <b>cheroots.</b> All is mysterious, solemn, beautiful.|$|E
60|$|Marlow sat up {{abruptly}} and flung away his <b>cheroot</b> with force. It made a darting red trail like a toy rocket fired through the drapery of creepers. Nobody stirred.|$|R
5000|$|Apparently, <b>cheroot</b> smoking {{was also}} {{associated}} with resistance against tropical disease in India. Verrier Elwin wrote in a foreword (1957) to Leaves from the Jungle: Life in a Gond Village, ...|$|R
6000|$|Seating {{himself on}} a {{fragment}} of split rock, he smoked his <b>cheroot</b> to the butt, hearing men breathe hard all about him. Then he cried, so suddenly that they jumped: ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, at Bekwai, {{the list}} of sick and invalids {{steadily}} increased; and every convoy that {{went down to the}} coast was accompanied by a number of white and black victims to the climate. The kits of the men who died realized enormous prices. A box that contained three cakes of soap fetched 27 shillings, and a box of twenty-five <b>cheroots</b> 2 pounds, 2 shillings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll have {{a stroll}} {{down the road}} with you, {{if you have no}} objection. Have a manilla." [...] He drew a couple of <b>cheroots</b> from his pocket and handed one to me. [...] "You'll find they are not bad," [...] he said. [...] "I became a {{connoisseur}} in tobacco when I was in India. I hope I am not interfering with your business in coming along with you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then we {{went away}} to breakfast, the stomach being always more worthy than any amount of sentiment. A turn in the road hid the gardens and stopped {{the noise of the}} waters, and that {{experience}} was over for all time. Experiences are very like <b>cheroots.</b> They generally begin badly, taste perfect half way through, and at the butt-end are things to be thrown away and never picked up again....|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Fox Terrier <b>Cheroot</b> {{was born}} in 1886 and is {{a link between the}} working Fox Terriers of the early 19th century and the show dogs {{at the end of the}} century.|$|R
6000|$|Lingard {{took his}} <b>cheroot</b> out, and, {{with his mouth}} full of white smoke that oozed out through his parted lips, listened, attentive. After a short pause Almayer went on, looking at the floor moodily-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faix it did," [...] said Larry, emphatically; [...] "and {{they shall}} have it, too;-- here, waiter, a brandy-smash and a <b>cheroot,</b> and be aisy {{as to the}} cost; I think me bank'll stand it." ...|$|R
