5000|$|A {{young woman}} remembers the wrongs {{done to her}} in her past life and takes rebirth to avenge herself. As her mission unfolds, many secrets of the past are unveiled.Adinath Shastri (Umesh Kamat), the second child of Madhusudan Shastri returns to India from America for a sabbatical and has plans to get married to Sulekha (Neelam Shirke-Kulkarni) who is his Aunt's (Madhurani Prabhu) sister. They fall in love over the {{internet}} and plan to marry {{as soon as he}} comes back and has plan to go back to America with his wife. Adinath and Sulekha get engaged and plan to get married soon. However fate takes an unexpected twist when he travels to Konkan for work and accidentally meets Shubhra (Urmila Kanetkar) after he meets with an accident. Shubhra lives with her mother and is supposed to get married soon to a person named Ramakant Khot. She nurses Adinath back to health and congratulates him on his engagement. Adinath is surprised as he does not remember telling Shubhra about it to which she replies that she had a vision in which she saw him getting engaged. Adinath is taken by surprise. As few days passes by Shubhra and Adinath spend time together and get married without any plans. They return to the [...] "Wada" [...] (Ancestorial Mansion) in Vasai (near Mumbai) on the day he was supposed to get married to Sulekha where his family members are in full swing with the marriage preparations. He introduces Shubhra as his wife to which everyone react in an atrocious manner. Sulekha is heartbroken and fumes at Adinath and Shubhra. Initially, the family members reject his decision but later accept Shubhra. Adinath's grandfather- Dinanath Shastri (Anand Abhyankar) tells that Shubra has a striking resemblance to his sister-in-law Parvati Vahini who mysteriously disappeared 60-70 years ago. He welcomes Shubhra and regards her as the re-incarnation of Parvati. That night, an old {{man by the name of}} Sopan (who used to be the servant at the Wada 60-70 years ago and now lived in the outhouse of the Wada) mysteriously disappears and later confronts Sulekha. At first Sulekha doesn’t pay any heed to him until he addresses her as Indumati and later explains her that she is [...] "his Indumati" [...] who died mysteriously when he was young. (Here it is implied that Sulekha is in fact a re-incarnation of Indumati, the antagonist) Sopan presents her with an ugly figurine that of a woman playing a tambourine (later revealed to be The Idol of Fire Force used in Black Magic) and says that the figurine will help her regain her memories of past life and give her the strength to finish the goal which she had vowed then. And returns to Wada. At the mean time at the Shastri's, things go on in a mundane way until Shubra has visions again where she sees a black car hitting a teenage boy, although she doesn’t know who the boy is. She has the visions repeatedly but Adinath doesn’t take it seriously. Later Shubra has a vision of the outhouse being set on fire and warns Adinath about it. A day later the outhouse really has a fire accident and Sopan escapes and takes refuge at Sulekha's house. Everyone considers Sopan as dead. Adinath's nephew (<b>Chandu's</b> son) Prathamesh is mute but he mumbles and addresses Shubhra as Parvati even though no one tells him about her. He becomes friends with Shubra and both of them have a good understanding among themselves. Prathamesh behaves in a strange fashion and sketches all the visions Shubra has although no one tells him anything. Later on it is revealed that Prathamesh is a re-incarnation of Goda(Indumati's younger sister), a timid but good maid who used to work at the Wada when Parvati existed. It is also revealed that Adinath is in fact the reincarnation of Mahadev Shastri (Parvati's husband, Dinanath's elder brother) and hence fate brought Shubhra and Adinath (past life's Parvati and Mahadev) together under mystical circumstances and got them married as strangers.Adinath's sister Priya Shastri (Sharvari Patankar) has an unexplained resent towards Sulekha from the time Adinath introduces her to his family. As the story progresses, the visions seen by Parvati comes true. The boy seen by Shubhra is in fact Nikhil Shastri(Sulekha's Nephew & Adinath's Cousin) who is hit by the black car. (Sulekha hypnotizes Nikhil and hence causes the accident) and in the similar way brings about the death of her own mother (Meena Naik), Kshipra (Sujata Joshi), BalKrishna Shastri (her brother in law, Nikhil's Father)Shubra and Adinath consult a neurophysiologist Dr. Samant (Sunil Barve) to regain the memories of their past life while in parallel Sulekha consults a lady by the name Tanishka (Manjusha Godse-Datar) to learn the art of mind control and hypnosis more profoundly. Dr. Samant is shown to be the reincarnation of Shrirang Ranade(Mahadev's Best friend). Both Sulekha and Shubra dive into their past birth and the story unfolds that Parvati and Mahdev were once a happy couple but did not have any children and Parvati was a staunch believer of Lord Shri Krishna and plans to name her children after the names of Krishna (which unfortunately never happens). Dinanath Shstri hence fulfills her wish with his own children (Hence the names Madhusudan Shastri (Adinath's father), BalKrishna Shastri)While at around that time in the village of Vasai came two sisters: Goda and Indumati. Bhalchandra the brother in law of Mahadev has an extra marital affair with Indumati which when discovered infuriates the patriarch of the Shastri Family (Mahadev's father) and he humiliates Indumati in front of the entire village by applying back color on her face and making her ride a donkey.Simultaneously a person by the name Shrirang Ranade comes to the Wada and Mahadev takes to the misunderstanding(Thanks to Bhalchandra) that there is something going on between Parvati and him (Shrirang) and banishes Parvati from the Wada.Indumati (present day's Sulekha) then vowes that she would destroy the Shastri family and uses black magic and kills everyone from Shastri family except young Dinanath Shastri (who is saved at the last moment by Parvati) and in the process, she, Indumati and Goda are buried alive in a landslide in the underground passage way near the wada. Since the story of revenge remains incomplete in the past birth, Indumati, Parvati, Goda, Mahadev and other characters take rebirth and finish the incomplete vows.|$|R

25|$|The first {{military}} units in Malaysia {{can be traced}} back to the Penang Rifle Volunteers raised on 1 March 1861, and the Malay States Volunteer Rifles which existed from 1915 to 1936. The birth of the modern Malaysian Army came about when the Federal Council of the Federated Malay States passed the Malay Regiment Bill on 23 January 1933. This allowed the initial recruitment of 25 males for the First Experimental Malay Company on 1 March 1933. Major G. McI. S. Bruce of the Lincolnshire Regiment was the first Commanding Officer. By 1 January 1935, the Experimental Company became The Malay Regiment with a complement of 150 men. A battalion was formed on 1 January 1938 and eventually a second battalion on 1 December 1941. The 1st Bn Malay Regiment was famous for its defence of Opium Hill or Bukit <b>Chandu</b> in Singapore. The ‘Battle of Opium Hill’ on 14 February 1942 involved 42 soldiers commanded by Lt. Adnan Bin Saidi who defended their position against attack from the 18th Division of the Japanese Imperial Army under Lt. Gen. Renya Mutaguchi. After World War II and during the Malayan Emergency, the number of battalions was increased to seven in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The tournament was {{organised}} by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and {{sponsored by}} PepsiCo {{as part of}} the many national celebrations being held in 1997 for the 50th anniversary of India's independence from colonial rule. The Independence Cup trophy featured a gold inscripted image of Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi and his followers on the Dandi March during the 1930–31 Salt Satyagraha. The tournament concept was later emulated in Sri Lanka, which held an Independence Cup tournament to mark its 50th anniversary of independence in 1998, and in Bangladesh in 1998. The BCCI also used the tournament to celebrate 50 years of Indian cricket. Along with a television documentary on the history of Indian cricket broadcast on Doordarshan, India's Test cricket captains were honoured during the 2nd final at the Eden Gardens in Calcutta (now Kolkata) – from the then 86-year-old Lala Amarnath to the then-captain, 24-year-old Sachin Tendulkar. All the captains took a lap around the Eden Gardens in a jeep, receiving a standing ovation from the 75,000-strong assembled crowd. Each man received a silver salver, while Vijay Hazare received the C. K. Nayadu Trophy. The captains honoured included Polly Umrigar, Datta Gaekwad, Pankaj Roy, Gulabrai Ramchand, Nari Contractor, <b>Chandu</b> Borde, Ajit Wadekar, Bishen Singh Bedi, Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Mohammad Azharuddin.|$|E
25|$|The 1958-59 Ashes {{series was}} {{the end of an era}} in English cricket; after losing 4–0 in Australia Trevor Bailey, Godfrey Evans, Frank Tyson and Barrington's Surrey {{teammates}} Jim Laker and Peter Loader all retired from Test cricket. The team needed to be rebuilt and a solid batsman was needed to shore up the top order. Peter May took leave to get married and Arthur McIntyre took over as wicketkeeper-captain of Surrey. An earlier attempt to turn Barrington into an opener had failed, but McIntyre promoted him to number 3 in the order to stop him getting nervous while pacing around the dressing room waiting to bat. He made 97 against Cambridge University soon followed by 186 and 118 not out against Warwickshire at Edgbaston; 85 and 59 not out against the Indians at the Oval and 113 not out against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. This earned him a recall to the England cricket team against a weak Indian side, perfect for playing a batsman into a Test career. In the First Test at Trent Bridge he joined his Surrey and England captain Peter May at 63/3 and was told not to worry about scoring as long as he fought it out. Barrington took 20 minutes to get off the mark, but hit two sixes off <b>Chandu</b> Borde to bring up his 50 and was out for 56 in a stand of 175 as England won by an innings. In the Second Test at Lord's England were 100/7 when Barrington top-scored with 80, adding 126 for the last three wickets to set up another big win. The Third Test at Headingley saw him making 80 again, this time adding 193 runs with Colin Cowdrey in an 8 wicket victory. The Fourth Test at Old Trafford gave him 87 as his missed out on another century, but captain Colin Cowdrey gave him the ball and he took 3/36 with his leg-spin. In the second innings he was told to go for quick runs and hit 46 in 36 minutes with 6 fours and a six, then wrapped things up with 2/75 and a catch as England won by 171 runs. Back home at the Oval for the Fifth Test Barrington was out for 8, but England completed the 5–0 whitewash with an innings victory. Barrington made 357 runs (59.50) in the series – more than anybody else – and had had his most prolific summer with 2,499 first-class runs (54.32), but Surrey failed to win the County Championship for the first time in 8 years, coming third. His consistent run-making won him the honour of being named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year and he was an automatic choice for the forthcoming tour of the West Indies in 1959–60.|$|E

On the final day, Miller's friend Compton, who was playing for East Zone while on deployment with the British Army in India, was nearing a century as his team closed in on victory. The rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch again. The leader of the demonstrators ran up to Compton and said: [...] "Mr Compton, you very good player, but you must stop". In later years, Miller would quote this remark whenever Compton came to the crease in matches featuring both of them. Compton told the rioters to ask Hassett, saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings.
