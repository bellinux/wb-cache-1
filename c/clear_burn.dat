Around the same time Fleckenstein and Bass (1953) iut forward the interesting hypothesis that denervation reduces the continuous libera-tion of NE from the postganglionic nerve fibers and thus decreases “accommodation ” (increases sensitivity) of the muscle to this transmitter substance. The hypothesis of Burn and Robinson (1953) is {{not consistent with the}} finding that inhibition of monoamine oxidase, by agents such as iI) roniazid, does not potentiate norepineph-rine-induced contractions of smooth muscle (Griesemer et a!., 1953; Furchgott, 1955; Kamijo et al., 1956). Burn and Rand (1959) have also given reasons for abandoning this hypothesis. Burn and Rand (1959) have recently in-troduced the hypothesis that the supersensitivity of denervated sympathetic effector organs to NE and E is (lue to the loss of stores of NE in such organs.

50|$|Eighty-three {{percent of}} the reserve is {{categorized}} as Valdivian temperate rainforest and 7.8% had previously been <b>cleared,</b> <b>burned</b> and planted with eucalyptus plantations. Some native forest types in the reserve includes olivillo Aextoxicon punctatum that forms dense forests near the coast and alerce Fitzroya cupressoides that grows at the higher elevations. The 9 km long Colún Beach and the Twin Lagoons of Colún lies inside the reserve just some kilometers north of Colún River. The lower flow of Bueno River makes up the southern boundary of the reserve. The reserve has 36 km of coastline including beaches, rocky shores and significant estuaries. Most of this coastline falls currently falls within Benthic Marine Management Areas owned and managed by local fishing associations. Extensive collaboration between the reserve, local NGOs and fishing associations has yielded a pilot cooperative management agreement to study and work to recover benthic resources {{in one of these}} areas.|$|R
40|$|Nitrous oxide flux {{and soil}} {{nutrient}} characteristics were measured in three undisturbed tropical ecosystem types, in <b>cleared</b> and <b>burned</b> areas, and {{in areas of}} forest converted to pasture near Manaus, Brazil. Nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, and soil nitrogen pools were high in upland forests on clay soils (terra firme) and low in the sand-type and floodplain (varzea) soils. Nitrous oxide flux followed the same pattern, with an average flux of 1. 9 ng/sq cm per hr in terra firme, 0. 3 in sand types, and 0. 1 in varzea. Flux from recently <b>cleared</b> and <b>burned</b> areas {{did not differ from}} terra firme forest, but pastures had significantly elevated fluxes (10. 3 ng/sq cm per hr). These data were combined with satellite data-based areal estimates of land cover classes to estimate total N 2 O-N flux from the intensive study area used by the Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment. Total N 2 O-N flux from the area was 22. 9 kg/h; pastures covered 11 percent of the area but accounted for over 40 percent of the flux...|$|R

50|$|The Gbaya, Mbum, and Dourou are the region's most {{prolific}} farmers, though even the herdsmen {{farm in the}} rainy season. Farms are typically small plots that are <b>cleared</b> or <b>burned</b> out of the brush and then planted during the dry season. Crops grow during the rainy season, when they are harvested.

40|$|Termites {{are major}} {{decomposers}} in tropical regions and play critical roles in many soil-related processes. Studies conducted in Asia and the Neotropics suggest that habitat modification can strongly affect termite assemblages, but data on termite communities from forests in Africa, especially West Africa, are scarce. Here, we measured the short-term impact of slash-and-burn agriculture on termite assemblages in an agricultural region of central Côte d'Ivoire. We assessed termite diversity and relative abundance in four habitat types: secondary forest, <b>cleared</b> forest, <b>burned</b> forest, and crop fields. The secondary forest had higher species richness {{compared with the}} other habitats, but all habitat types had similar assemblage structures. Fungus-growing termites were the most abundant feeding group in all habitats. Soil feeders were most abundant in secondary forest, intermediately abundant in <b>cleared</b> and <b>burned</b> forests, and almost entirely absent in crop fields. Wood-feeding species showed clear responses to burning; their abundances decreased after fire. We conclude that slash-and-burn agriculture {{does not appear to}} severely erode the diversity of termite assemblages. This could be due to the dominance of ecologically versatile fungus growers or to the relatively long time between clearing and burning. However, forest clearing negatively affects soil feeders, with the Apicotermitinae most affected by canopy loss. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|Inadvisably, trees can be removed, or better, leaves <b>cleared</b> and <b>burned</b> before adult {{emergence}} {{by the end}} of March. Use of {{the systemic}} insecticide imidacloprid is usually banned as it kills bees. Fenoxycarb causes up to 100% pupal mortality, has low environmental toxicity and can be combined successfully with manual leaf removal. A synthetic pheromone can be used to trap males, but effective control may be hard to thus achieve. In any case, infestation levels could diminish over time as Cameraria ohridella starts to recruit generalist members of the local parasitoid wasp community.|$|R
50|$|Other forest {{ecosystems}} have suffered {{as much or}} more destruction as tropical rainforests. Farming and logging have severely disturbed at least 94% of temperate broadleaf forests; many old growth forest stands have lost more than 98% of their previous area because of human activities. Tropical deciduous dry forests are easier to <b>clear</b> and <b>burn</b> and are more suitable for agriculture and cattle ranching than tropical rainforests; consequently, less than 0.1% of dry forests in Central America's Pacific Coast and less than 8% in Madagascar remain from their original extents.|$|R

50|$|The Bunyoro rabbit is nocturnal, hiding {{during the}} day in a form in dense {{vegetation}} or a hole among rocks and coming out to feed {{as part of a}} family group at night. Its diet consists of grasses and flowering plants and it likes the succulent young shoots that sprout from the ground after land has been <b>cleared</b> or <b>burned.</b> When living in proximity to cultivated land, it feeds on rice and peanut plants. Predators that feed on the Bunyoro rabbit probably include owls, hawks, servals (Felis serval), cape genets (Genetta tigrina) and servaline genets (Genetta servalina).|$|R

50|$|The red owl inhabits dry {{deciduous}} {{forests to}} humid evergreen forests. They prefer to roost on rock ledges in ravines and cave entrances that are near degraded {{primary and secondary}} vegetation. Roost sites are typically at least 3.7 m from the ground. The species appear to prefer areas along the forest edge and slightly to heavily disturbed habitat, including rice paddies and tavies (areas where the forest has been <b>cleared</b> and <b>burned</b> {{to make way for}} cultivation). Their home ranges, roost sites, and hunting range typically encompass this type of habitat. An individual red owl has never been recorded to be in a closed canopy forest or a mature forest stand.|$|R
40|$|Slash-and-burn land {{clearing}} on sloping land {{may lead to}} increased soil run-off following disappearance of the protective vegetative cover. In turn, soil run-off and redeposition affects soil fertility and spatial patterns of fertility parameters in a field. This study seeks to clarify the role of spatial patterns of post-burn dead biomass (necromass) in soil run-off and redeposition and their combined effect on spatial patterns in soil pH and resin-extractable P. The study is carried out on a post-productive rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforest in Sumatra, Indonesia. Soils are classified as Dystric Fluvisols. After slash-and-burn of vegetation, the field was planted with rubber seedlings and rice (Oryza sativa). For comparison the adjacent rubber agroforest site was sampled. Soil run-off is expressed here as the quantity of downward moving soil that passed the specific location of a flow trap. Existing physical soil run-off barriers and crop performance were scored. Despite serious soil run-off from the steeper upper slopes little soil was actually lost because of the slope form of the field, presence of natural soil run-off barriers, and the planted crop. Spatial variability of soil pH decreased {{at the expense of}} small-scale, within-strata, variability mainly because of the patchy distribution of soil run-off barriers. Soil run-off, aggravated by slash-and-burn, did not result in development of a clear soil fertility gradient down slope. In areas of high soil run-off potential, <b>clear</b> <b>burns</b> should be avoided because soil run-off barriers like remnants of slash-and-burn and surface litter maintain the soil and its fertility.
