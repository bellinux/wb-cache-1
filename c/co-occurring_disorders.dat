The most commonly used stimulant medications include methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). Non-stimulant medications with a specific indication for ADHD include atomoxetine (Strattera), guanfacine (Intuniv), and clonidine (Kapvay).

2500|$|Comorbidity of {{addictive}} {{disorders and}} other psychiatric disorders, i.e., dual disorders, {{is very common}} and {{a large body of}} literature has accumulated demonstrating that mental disorders are strongly associated with substance use disorders. The 2011 USA National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 17.5% of adults with a mental illness had a co-occurring substance use disorder; this works out to 7.98 million people.

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate to which extent <b>co-occurring</b> psychiatric <b>disorders</b> are diagnosed in a clinical population of substance abusers, and which factors (including the use of MINI-Plus) that influence the diagnosing of <b>co-occurring</b> psychiatric <b>disorders.</b> Patients (N[*]=[*] 275) who received inpatient substance use treatment in five different units in Northern Norway participated in the study. The patientsâ€™ clinicians gave information on diagnoses given during the stay in the units, and whether a systematic diagnostic tool was used for the diagnosing (MINI-Plus).

40|$|Background: Trichotillomania {{appears to}} be a fairly common disorder, with high rates of <b>co-occurring</b> anxiety <b>disorders.</b> Many {{individuals}} with trichotillomania also report that pulling worsens during periods of increased anxiety. Even with these clinical links to anxiety, little research has explored whether trichotillomania with co-occurring anxiety is a meaningful subtype. Methods: One hundred sixty-five adults with trichotillomania were examined on a variety of clinical measures including symptom severity, functioning, and comorbidity. Participants also underwent cognitive testing assessing motor inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Clinical features and cognitive functioning were compared between those with current <b>co-occurring</b> anxiety <b>disorders</b> (i. e. social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and anxiety disorder NOS) (n = 38) and those with no anxiety disorder (n = 127). Results: Participants with trichotillomania and co-occurring anxiety reported significantly worse hair pulling symptoms, {{were more likely to have}} co-occurring depression, and were more likely to have a first-degree relative with obsessive compulsive disorder. Those with anxiety disorders also exhibited significantly worse motor inhibitory performance on a task of motor inhibition (stop-signal task). Conclusions: This study suggests that anxiety disorders affect the clinical presentation of hair pulling behavior. Further research is needed to validate our findings and to consider whether treatments should be specially tailored differently for adults with trichotillomania who have <b>co-occurring</b> anxiety <b>disorders,</b> or more pronounced cognitive impairment...|$|R
