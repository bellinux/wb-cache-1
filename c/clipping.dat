50|$|A money <b>clip</b> wallet is a <b>clip</b> {{designed}} specifically to hold both credit cards and cash.

5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: <b>clipping</b> and coiling. <b>Clipping</b> requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E

5000|$|Magnetic Timeline: Inventing an {{alternative}} to track-based timelines found in traditional NLEs, Final Cut's Magnetic Timeline uses <b>Clip</b> Connections to keep Connected <b>Clips</b> and Secondary Storylines in sync with <b>clips</b> located on the Primary Storyline.

40|$|Background <b>Clip</b> {{closure of}} large {{colorectal}} EMR defects sometimes results in bumpy scars that are normal on biopsy. We refer to these as “clip artifact. ” If unrecognized, <b>clip</b> artifact can {{be mistaken for}} residual polyp, leading to thermal treatment and potential adverse events. Objective To describe the incidence of and define predictors of <b>clip</b> artifact. Design Review of photographs of scars from consecutive <b>clipped</b> EMR defects. Setting University outpatient endoscopy center. Patients A total of 284 consecutive patients with <b>clip</b> closure of defects after EMR of lesions 20 mm or larger and follow-up colonoscopy. Interventions EMR, <b>clip</b> closure. Main Outcome Measurements Incidence of <b>clip</b> artifact. Results A total of 303 large polyps met the inclusion criteria. On review of photographs, 96 scars (31. 7 %) had <b>clip</b> artifact. <b>Clip</b> artifact was associated with increased numbers of <b>clips</b> placed (odds ratio for each additional <b>clip,</b> 1. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 02 - 1. 38) but not polyp histology, size, or location. The rate of residual polyp by histology was 8. 9 % (27 / 303), with 21 of 27 scars with residual polyp evident endoscopically. The rate of residual polyp evident only by histology in scars with <b>clip</b> artifact (3 / 93; 3. 2 %) was not different from the rate in scars without <b>clip</b> artifact (3 / 189; 1. 6 %). Limitations Retrospective design. Sites closed primarily with 1 type of <b>clip.</b> Single-operator assessment of endoscopic photographs. Conclusion <b>Clip</b> artifact occurred in the scars of approximately one-third of large <b>clipped</b> EMR sites and increased with number of <b>clips</b> placed. <b>Clip</b> artifact could be consistently distinguished from residual polyp by its endoscopic appearance...|$|R
5|$|The {{huge number}} of clipped coins in the Hoxne Hoard has made it {{possible}} for archaeologists to observe the process of coin-clipping in detail.

5|$|The {{possible}} {{reasons for the}} <b>clipping</b> of coins are controversial.

5000|$|A {{stripper}} <b>clip</b> (also {{sometimes referred}} to as a charger <b>clip)</b> is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function, unlike an en bloc <b>clip,</b> which requires the <b>clip</b> with its ammunition to be inserted into the weapon to function. Generally, a weapon that can use a stripper <b>clip</b> for loading can also be loaded one round at a time, while a weapon designed for an en bloc <b>clip</b> cannot be used without the <b>clip.</b> It is called a 'stripper' <b>clip</b> because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper <b>clip</b> is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the user presses on the cartridges from above, sliding them down and off the <b>clip,</b> thereby 'stripping' them off the stripper <b>clip</b> and into the magazine. After the magazine is loaded, the stripper <b>clip</b> is removed and set aside for reloading, or simply discarded during combat. [...] Depending on the firearm, magazine, and cartridge, stripper <b>clips</b> {{come in a variety of}} shapes, some quite complex, though most are either straight or crescent-shaped pieces of stamped metal—usually brass, steel (often blued or parkerized), or plastic.|$|R

5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by <b>clipping</b> (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; <b>clipping,</b> using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
