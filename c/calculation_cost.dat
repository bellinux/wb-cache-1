The particle is modeled by either an electric dipole parallel to the electric field or a pair of crossed electric and magnetic dipoles parallel to the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, of the applied wave. These dipoles are the leading terms in the multipole series. They are the only existing ones for a homogeneous sphere, whose polarizability can be easily obtained from the Mie scattering coefficients.

Especially, we think that smile is important facial ex-pression to communicate well between human beings and also between human and machines. Therefore, if we can detect smile and also estimate its intensity at low <b>calculation</b> <b>cost</b> and high accuracy, it will raise the possibility of inviting many new applications in the future. In this pa-per, we focus on smile in facial expressions and study feature extraction methods to detect a smile and estimate its intensity only by facial ap-pearance information (Facial parts detection, not required). We use Lo-cal Intensity Histogram (LIH), Center-Symmetric Local Binary Pattern (CS-LBP) or features concatenated LIH and CS-LBP to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) for smile detection. Moreover, we construct SVM smile detector as a cascaded structure both to keep the performance and reduce the <b>calculation</b> <b>cost,</b> and estimate the smile intensity by poste-rior probability. As a consequence, we achieved both low <b>calculation</b> <b>cost</b> and high performance with practical images and we also implemented the proposed methods to the PC demonstration system. ...|$|E

One model was the F-net 1 D velocity structure model (Kubo et al. 2002), which has been used in F-net routine analyses. Green’s functions of the F-net 1 D model were evaluated via a computer program for wave number integration provided by Herrmann (2013), which can be conducted on desktop personal computers. The other model was the JIVSM without the accretionary prism and seawater layers. In the accretionary prism and seawater layers of this model, physical parameters were replaced with ones of the upper crust and air columns, respectively. Since <b>calculation</b> <b>costs</b> of FDM simulations are controlled by the grid interval and minimum S-wave velocity, if we obtained accurate source parameters by using this model, the <b>calculation</b> <b>costs</b> for evaluating the 3 D Green’s functions were significantly reduced compared to those for the model with low-velocity (<[*] 2  km/s) layers.
