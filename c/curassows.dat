50|$|There {{are over}} 550 species of birds, {{including}} many endemic species.Seasonal migrant birds includewhite-throated toucan (Ramphastos tucanus), parrots (Amazona genus) and macaws (Ara genus).Non-migratory birds include tanagers (Tangara and Tachyphonus genera), woodcreepers (Xiphorhynchus genus), pavonine quetzal (Pharomachrus pavoninus), wattled <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa), nocturnal <b>curassow</b> (Nothocrax urumutum), razor-billed <b>curassow</b> (Mitu tuberosum) and tinamous (Crypturellus and Tinamus genera).Endangered birds include wattled <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa) and green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster).|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} proven to produce fertile hybrids with its closest living relative, the blue-billed <b>curassow,</b> and also with the much more distantly related black <b>curassow.</b>|$|R
25|$|Tinamous are {{exclusively}} neotropical and all 47 species live in South America, Mexico, and Central America. The {{range of}} the northernmost species extends to Mexico but not much further north than the Tropic of Cancer. Chilean tinamous have been introduced to Easter Island. The greatest concentration of species is in the tropics, {{and in particular the}} Amazon Basin. In the north, they tend to be forest or woodland birds, while in the south they prefer open habitats. Tinamous form the dominant group of terrestrial birds in South America, where they largely replace the Galliformes ecologically, with no other bird family there having comparable diversity, distribution, or suite of habitat adaptations. Rheas are only found in open country, <b>curassows</b> and guans are generally limited to forests, and the pheasant family is only represented by a few species in the north of the region.|$|E
25|$|World of Birds, which {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades {{in the summer}} of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed <b>curassows,</b> white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden lion tamarins, Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so. In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works towards preserving this species in the wild as well.|$|E
500|$|From the Latin cera meaning [...] "wax", a waxy {{structure}} {{which covers}} {{the base of}} the [...] of some birds species from a handful of families—including raptors, owls, skuas, parrots, turkeys and <b>curassows.</b> The cere structure typically contains the , except in owls, where the nares are distal to the cere. Although it is sometimes feathered in parrots, the cere is typically bare and often brightly coloured. In raptors, the cere is a sexual signal which indicates the [...] "quality" [...] of a bird; the orangeness of a Montague's harrier's cere, for example, correlates to its body mass and physical condition. The colour or appearance of the cere can be used to distinguish between males and females in some species. For example, the male great curassow has a yellow cere, which the female (and young males) lack, and the male budgerigar's cere is blue, while the female's is pinkish or brown.|$|E
50|$|The Alagoas <b>curassow</b> became {{extinct in}} the wild due to {{deforestation}} and hunting. The last wild Alagoas <b>curassow</b> was seen and killed in 1984, or possibly 1987 or 1988. The captive population has been extensively hybridized with the razor-billed <b>curassow,</b> {{and there are several}} dozen purebred birds left. These are being maintained and bred in two privately owned professional aviaries in Brazil mainly due to lack of official interest owing to the long-standing doubt about the taxon's validity.|$|R
50|$|The razor-billed <b>curassow</b> (Mitu tuberosum) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Cracidae. It is found {{throughout}} {{a large part of}} the Amazon Rainforest, though largely restricted to regions south of the Amazon River. Unlike other members of the genus Mitu, its crissum (the area around the cloaca) is deep chestnut and the tail-tip is white. The razor-billed <b>curassow</b> was formerly treated as a subspecies of Mitu mitu, but today this scientific name is restricted to the extremely rare Alagoas <b>curassow.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sira <b>curassow</b> is {{very similar}} morphologically to the horned <b>curassow,</b> however the casque is less erect and more rounded (ellipsoidal instead of {{elongated}} cone). Additionally the outer tail feathers have narrower white tips and the four central tail feather completely lack white colouring.|$|R

2500|$|Nukak are expert hunters. The men hunt using blowguns, with darts {{coated with}} curare [...] "manyi", a poison made from {{different}} plants (curares). They specially hunt {{several species of}} monkeys (Alouatta spp., Cebus spp., Saimiri sp., Lagothrix spp., Ateles sp., Saguinus spp., Callicebus torquatus), and birds (Muscovy duck, chachalacas, guans, <b>curassows,</b> grey-winged trumpeter and toucans). Also they use javelins of Socratea exorrhiza palm wood to hunt two species of peccaries (Tayassu pecari and T. tajacu) and spectacled caimans, whose eggs they consume too. Nukak neither hunt nor eat brocket deer, [...] Odocoileus virginianus and tapirs (Tapirus terrestris); these animals are considered by {{them as part of}} the same group of origin as human beings.|$|E
60|$|We {{must also}} notice the {{preponderance}} of low or archaic types among the animals of South America. Edentates, marsupials, and rodents form {{the majority of the}} terrestrial mammalia; while such higher groups as the carnivora and hoofed animals are exceedingly deficient. Among birds a low type of Passeres, characterised by the absence of the singing muscles, is excessively prevalent, the enormous groups of the ant-thrushes, tyrants, tree-creepers, manakins, and chatterers belonging to it. The Picariæ (a lower group) also prevail to a far greater extent than in any other regions, both in variety of forms and number of species; and the chief representatives of the gallinaceous birds--the <b>curassows</b> and tinamous, are believed to be allied, the former to the brush-turkeys of Australia, the latter (very remotely) to the ostriches, two of the least developed types of birds.|$|E
50|$|The horned <b>curassow</b> {{is among}} the largest cracid species. It {{measures}} 85 to 95 cm in length. Body mass in large males is up to 3.7 to 3.9 kg and only the great <b>curassow</b> is heavier amongst the cracids, although the black <b>curassow</b> and the closely related helmeted <b>curassow</b> are around the same length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38.1 to 40.2 cm, the tail is 31 to 34.8 cm and the tarsus is 10 to 10.8 cm. It has a distinctive horn or casque on the forehead which projects for over 6 cm. The plumage is generally black, but lacks a blue sheen in primary feathers, and has a white belly, thigh tufts and under-tail coverts. The tail also has white tips.|$|R
5000|$|The {{evolution}} of the 4 southern species was somewhat more complex. In the Messinian, about 6-5.5 mya, the ancestors of the wattled <b>curassow</b> became isolated in the western Amazonas basin. With increasing aridification of southeastern Brazil, the ancestors of the red-billed <b>curassow</b> found refuge in the mountain ranges between the Brazilian Highlands and the Atlantic during the mid-Zanclean, some 4.5-4 mya. The divergence between the bare-faced and black <b>curassow</b> lineages apparently took place around the Uquian - Ensenadan boundary, some 1.5 mya. This which coincides with one or several period(s) of elevated sea levels during which the lower Amazonas basin was a brackish lagoon which offered little <b>curassow</b> habitat. Their present ranges are consequently still separated by the Amazonas river. (Pereira & Baker 2004) ...|$|R

60|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} facts, as showing how susceptible to changed conditions or to slight constitutional changes are the reproductive powers of animals, is the very general difficulty of getting those which are kept in confinement to breed; and this is frequently the only bar to domesticating wild species. Thus, elephants, bears, foxes, and numbers of species of rodents, very rarely breed in confinement; while other species do so more or less freely. Hawks, vultures, and owls hardly ever breed in confinement; neither did the falcons kept for hawking ever breed. Of the numerous small seed-eating birds kept in aviaries, hardly any breed, neither do parrots. Gallinaceous birds usually breed freely in confinement, but some do not; and even the guans and <b>curassows,</b> kept tame by the South American Indians, never breed. This shows that change of climate {{has nothing to do with}} the phenomenon; and, in fact, the same species that refuse to breed in Europe do so, in almost every case, when tamed or confined in their native countries. This inability to reproduce is not due to ill-health, since many of these creatures are perfectly vigorous and live very long.|$|E
60|$|Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Neotropical Region.--The Neotropical region {{requires}} {{very little}} definition, since it comprises {{the whole of}} America south of the Nearctic region, {{with the addition of}} the Antilles or West Indian Islands. Its zoological peculiarities are almost as marked as those of Australia, which, however, it far exceeds in the extreme richness and variety of all its forms of life. To show how distinct it is from all the other regions of the globe, we need only enumerate some of the best known and more conspicuous of the animal forms which are peculiar to it. Such are, among mammalia--the prehensile-tailed monkeys and the marmosets, the blood-sucking bats, the coati-mundis, the peccaries, the llamas and alpacas, the chinchillas, the agoutis, the sloths, the armadillos, and the ant-eaters; a series of types more varied, and more distinct from those {{of the rest of the}} world than any other continent can boast of. Among birds we have the charming sugar-birds, forming the family Coerebidæ; the immense and wonderfully varied group of tanagers; the exquisite little manakins, and the gorgeously-coloured chatterers; the host of tree-creepers of the family Dendrocolaptidæ; the wonderful toucans; the puff-birds, jacamars, todies and motmots; the marvellous assemblage of four hundred distinct kinds of humming-birds; the gorgeous macaws; the <b>curassows,</b> the trumpeters, and the sun-bitterns. Here again there is no other continent or region that can produce such an assemblage of remarkable and perfectly distinct groups of birds; and no less wonderful is its richness in species, since these fully equal, if they do not surpass, those of the {52} two great tropical regions of the Eastern Hemisphere (the Ethiopian and the Oriental) combined.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the evening}} of that same day he had an {{adventure}} which induced him to suspect, more strongly even than Bunco, that terrestrial paradise was indeed {{still a long way}} off. The party landed at a small clearing, where they were hospitably received by a professional tiger-hunter, who, although nearly half-naked and almost black, was a very dignified personage, and called himself Don Emanuel. This Don invited them up to smoke and eat at his residence, {{which turned out to be}} a very large one--no less than the wild forest itself, for he disdained houses, and was wont to sling his hammock, nightly, between two trees. At his encampment they were introduced to his wife and two daughters, who were as wild and as lightly clad as himself, and the only evidence (if evidence it was) that the ladies belonged to the gentler sex was, that Donna Isabella--the elder sister--fondled a large cat, for which she appeared to entertain a strong affection. Having supped and smoked, the travellers slung their hammocks to the trees and went to sleep. In the middle of the night, several times, they were awakened by the cries of the denizens of the thickets. It was supposed that when any two of these took to fighting the others were stirred up to roar in sympathy! Be this as it may, the mingled cries, roars, and shrieks, of sapajous, alouates, jaguars, cougars, pacaris, sloths, <b>curassows,</b> parraquas, etcetera, broke forth from time to time with such fury, that sleep was almost unattainable; then a thunderstorm came on which wet them to the skin; after that a large vampire-bat bit Bunco on the nose, causing that worthy to add his noise to the general concert; and, finally, a soft hairy animal dropt from a branch into Larry O'Hale's hammock. The Irishman received it with open arms and a yell of terror. He crushed it to his chest, which drew forth a responsive yell of agony from the animal, whose claws and teeth were instantly fixed in Larry's chin and cheeks. He caught it by the tail--the teeth and claws were at once transferred to his hands; then he seized it by the throat, from which there issued a gasping shriek as he hurled it high into the air, whence it descended into the embers of the expiring fire, and, bolting violently from that too-warm spot, sent up a shower of sparks which revealed the fact that the unfortunate man had all but annihilated Donna Isabella's favourite cat! ...|$|E
