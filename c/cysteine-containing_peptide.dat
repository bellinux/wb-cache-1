The method {{is based on}} the specific labelling of thiol groups with a hydrophobic chromophore followed by enzymic fragmentation of the labelled protein and reversed-phase high-pressure liquid-chromatographic separation of the peptide mixture. This new method has several distinct advantages: (1) the hydrophobic-chromophore-labelled <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptides</b> are easily separated from non-cysteine-containing peptides by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography; (2) only <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptides</b> are detected in the visible region with sensitivity at the low picomole level; this high sensitivity allows isolation of nanogram amounts of pure cysteine-containing peptide; (3) during sequence determination of the chromophore-labelled <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptides,</b> the cysteine residues are released as coloured anilinothiazolinone derivatives and can be detected directly in the picomole range; (4) with proteins bearing several disulphide groups, each disulphide group may undergo a different degree of reduction, and therefore the recovery of individual <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptides</b> may be used to deduce the disulphide linkages present in the native protein. Two thiol-specific reagents, 4 -dimethylaminoazobenzene- 4 '-iodoacetamide and 4 -dimethylaminoazobenzene- 4 '-N-maleimide, were synthesized and characterized.

The quinone compounds can rapidly and specifically bind to the thiol group of cysteine residues by a Michael addition reaction, {{which is used to}} identify both CCP and the number of cysteine residues in CCP through the direct observation of untagged and tagged products. After reduced with DL-dithiothreitol, the intra-molecular disulfide bond can also be identified. Using benzoquinone (BQ) and methyl-p-benzoquinone (MBQ) as dual tags and a peptide with an amino acid sequence of SSDQFRPDDCT (C-pep 1) as a model target, respectively, the quantitation {{strategy is}} performed through the intensity ratio of MBQ-tagged C-pep 1 to BQ-tagged C-pep 1 as the internal standard.

To join two oligonucleotides, each is first {{converted to a}}n adduct in which cystamine is joined to the 5 '-terminal phosphate of the oligonucleotide by a phosphoramidate bond. The adducts are mixed and reduced with dithiothreitol. The dithiothreitol is then removed by dialysis. Oxidation by atmospheric oxygen occurs to yield the required dimer. To join an oligonucleotide to a <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptide</b> or protein, the 5 '-cystamine oligomer is first converted to a 2 '-pyridyldisulfide adduct and then reacted with an excess of the peptide or protein.

Moreover, {{by taking advantage of}} the large mass shift of 321 Da, unique isotopic pattern, and enhanced MS signal of PMB-labeled <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptide</b> fragments, the surface-exposed cysteines in proteins can be accurately identified by peptide mapping. The number and sites of reactive cysteines on the surface of human and rat hemoglobins (hHb and rHb) were identified as examples. Collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of specific peptides further confirmed the selective labeling of PMB in hHb. The subtle difference between the different cysteine residues in rHb was also evaluated by multiple PMB titrations. The difference between the two cysteines in their environment may partially explain their reaction specificity. Cysteine 1. 25 in the beta unit of rHb is exposed on the surface, explaining its reactivity with glutathione. Cysteine 13 in the alpha subunit of rHb is much less exposed, and is located in a hydrophobic pocket, a conclusion that is consistent with the previous observation of its selective binding with dimethylarsinous acid, a reactive arsenic metabolite. The method is potentially useful for probing cysteines in other biologically important proteins and for studying proteins that are associated with conformational or structural changes induced by denaturing processes, protein modifications, protein-protein interactions and protein assemblies.

Here we present the results of immunization studies with two linear multiepitopic constructs, a 60 -residue (P 60) and a 32 -residue (P 32) peptide, containing the conserved motif sequence. Both the peptides per se generated high levels of specific antibodies in BALB/c mice. P 32 was found to be genetically restricted to H- 2 d and H- 2 b haplotypes of mice, whereas P 60 was found to be immunogenic in five different strains of mice. The antibody response was predominantly targeted to the otherwise cryptic, conserved motif sequence in P 60. Anti-P 60 antibodies specifically stained the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii in an immunofluorescence assay, recognized a 60 - to 65 -kDa parasite protein in an immunoblot assay, and blocked P. falciparum merozoite invasion of erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Immunization with P 60 also induced significant levels of the cytokines interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), IL- 4, and gamma interferon in BALB/c mice. Moreover, > 60 % of mice immunized with P 60 survived a heterologous challenge infection with a lethal strain of P. yoelii. These results indicate that appropriate medium-sized synthetic peptides might prove useful in generating specific immune responses to an otherwise cryptic but critical and putatively protective epitope in an antigen and could form part of a multicomponent malaria vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Photo-oxidation is a light-dependent reaction, catalysed by {{photo-sensitive}} dyes, {{which can}} result in the oxidation of a large variety of substances. The photo-oxidation of enzymes with the anionic dye rose bengal was shown to follow one of two types of pH dependence; {{with an increase in}} pH the rates of photo-inactivation either increased (conventional photo-oxidation pH profiles), or decreased (unconventional photo-oxidation pH profiles). Photo-oxidation of the same enzymes with the cationic dye methylene blue gave rise to conventional pH profiles, irrespective of the type of pH dependence obtained with rose bengal. The production of unconventional photo-oxidation pH profiles was found to be dependent on the anionic nature of the photo-sensitiser. Using visible absorption spectroscopy and enzyme kinetic studies, rose bengal, but not methylene blue, was found to be capable of binding to and inhibiting the activity of enzymes. However, amino acid analysis of pig heart citrate synthase demonstrated that the occurrence of unconventional photo-oxidation pH profiles and dye-enzyme interactions was not accompanied by increased specificity of residue destruction. Some restriction of dye-protein interactions was achieved by the immobilisation of rose bengal on Sepharose. The photo-oxidation of various enzymes with this immobilised form of the dye was found to result in the formation of unconventional pH profiles only, irrespective of the type of photo-oxidation pH profile originally observed with the free form of the dye. The total prevention of all contact between rose bengal and enzymes was attained by compartmentalising the immobilised dye within a dialysis sac, the protein remaining on the outside. Photo-oxidation of enzymes with this compartmentalised dye again resulted only in the formation of unconventional pH profiles. Both the free and immobilised states of rose bengal were shown to photo-oxidise the five known susceptible amino acids [...] -cysteine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan and tyrosine. The <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptide</b> glutathione, and a glutathione-Sepharose complex, were also shown to be sensitive to photo-oxidation by free rose bengal, and the formation of conventional pH profiles only was observed. Although glutathione was shown to be similarly sensitive to photo-oxidation by the immobilised dye, no loss of cysteine occurred when the glutathione-Sepharose complex was irradiated in the presence of either immobilised or compartmentalised dye. Furthermore, the cysteine residues of mercaptalbumin proved insensitive to photo-oxidation by these two states of the dye. This demonstrated the necessity of direct interactions between rose bengal and cysteine residues as a prerequisite for their photo-oxidation. In the case of photo-oxidation of enzymes with free or immobilised rose bengal, the involvement of singlet oxygen was indicated by the enhanced rates of photo-inactivation obtained when H 2 O was replaced by D 2 O as solvent and also by the protective effects of sodium azide. It is therefore suggested that the pH profile obtained on photo-oxidation of enzymes by rose bengal consists of two components; a component at high pH which involves the photo-oxidation of cysteine residues by a direct contact mechanism and a component at low pH which involves the photo-oxidation of other susceptible residues by a singlet oxygen mechanism. This suggestion is supported by the demonstration of a correlation between the type of pH profile obtained on the photo-oxidation of various enzymes with free rose bengal and the presence of cysteine residues in their active sites, as indicated by inactivation experiments with the thiol-specific reagents DTNB and pHMB. The combined use of all the three forms of rose bengal may therefore both increase the specificity for residue destruction and provide information on the mechanisms involved in the photo-oxidation of biological macromolecules {{to a greater extent than}} is possible with the free dye alone. Immobilised rose bengal was found capable of photo-oxidising the active site of Acinetobacter citrate synthase yet, in contrast to free rose bengal, was incapable of desensitising the enzyme to NADH inhibition. The advantages and potential offered by the use of immobilised and compartmentalised rose bengal are discussed in this thesis and attention is drawn to the difficulties encountered and the caution required in the interpretation of photo-oxidation pH profiles...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{complex and}} dynamic protein {{mixtures}} are hardly comprehensively resolved by direct shotgun proteomic analysis. As many proteins of biological interest are of low abundance, numerous analytical methodologies {{have been developed}} to reduce sample complexity and go deeper into proteomes. The present work describes an analytical strategy to perform cysteinyl-peptide subset enrichment and relative quantification through successive cysteine and amine-isobaric tagging. A cysteine-reactive covalent capture tag (C³T) allowed derivatization of cysteines and specific isolation on a covalent capture (CC) resin. The 6 -plex amine-reactive tandem mass tags (TMT) served for relative quantification of the targeted peptides. The strategy was first evaluated on a model protein mixture with increasing concentrations to assess the specificity of the enrichment and the quantitative performances of the workflow. It was then applied to human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from post-mortem and ante-mortem samples. These studies confirmed the specificity of the C³T and the CC technique to <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptides.</b> The model protein mixture analysis showed high precision and accuracy of the quantification with coefficients of variation and mean absolute errors of less than 10 % on average. The CSF experiments demonstrated the potential of the strategy to study complex biological samples and identify differential brain-related proteins. In addition, the quantification data were highly correlated with a classical TMT experiment (i. e., without C³T cysteine-tagging and enrichment steps). Altogether, these results legitimate the use of this quantitative C³T strategy to enrich and relatively quantify <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptides</b> in complex mixtures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{oxidation}} of the sulfhydryl {{group in}} cysteine to sulfenic acid, sulfinic acid, and sulfonic acid in proteins {{is important in}} a number of enzymatic processes. In this study we examined the fragmentation of four peptides containing cysteine, cysteine sulfinic acid (Cys-SO 2 H), and cysteine sulfonic acid (Cys-SO 3 H) in an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Our results show that the presence of a Cys-SO 2 H in a peptide leads to preferential cleavage of the amide bond at the C-terminal side of the oxidized cysteine residue. The results are important for the determination of the site of the cysteine oxidation and might be useful for the sequencing of <b>cysteine-containing</b> <b>peptides...</b>|$|R
