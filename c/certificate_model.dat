50|$|Critics {{stated that}} {{encryption}} has non-negligible computing costs {{and that many}} HTTP applications have actually no need for encryption and their providers {{have no desire to}} spend additional resources on it. Encryption proponents have stated that this encryption overhead is negligible in practice. Poul-Henning Kamp has criticised IETF for following a particular political agenda with HTTP/2. The criticism of the agenda of mandatory encryption within the existing certificate framework is not new, nor is it unique to members of the open-source community a Cisco employee stated in 2013 that the present <b>certificate</b> <b>model</b> is not compatible with small devices like routers, because the present model requires not only annual enrollment and remission of non-trivial fees for each certificate, but must be continually repeated on an annual basis. Working Group finally did not reach consensus over the mandatory encryption, although most client implementations require it, which makes encryption a de facto requirement.|$|E

So I should be remembering their certificate. If someone else comes in with a different certificate, signed by a different authority, I still dont trust them. And if we did it that way, then that would solve {{a lot of the}} problems- it would solve the problems of rogue CAs, to some extent, it wouldnt help you with the initial bootstrapping but the initial bootstrapping would use the initial model, and then for continued interaction with the site you would use the ssh model which would allow you continued strength beyond what we have now. So the model we have now can be continued to be re-used, for only the initial acceptance. So why dont we do this?"Dan: [...] "So, Im a former SSH developer, and let me walk very quickly, every time theres an error in the ssh key generation, the user is asked, please type yes to trusting this new key, or, please go into your known hosts file and delete that value, and every last time they do it, because its always the fault of a server misconfiguration. The SSH model is cool, it dont scale".Moxie: [...] "And I would just add, what youre talking about is called Trust on First Use, or tofu, and theres a project that Im involved in called perspectives, that tries to leverage that to be less confusing than the pure SSH model, and I think its a really great project and you should check it out if youre interested in alternatives to the CA system." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: With {{the rapid}} growth of the {{wireless}} Internet service, the interest in security technology over the wireless Internet has been increased. Wireless Internet security technology provides users with confidentiality, authentication and non-repudiation based on WPKI(Wireless Public Key Infrastructure). To provide these services, the method that enables the wireless Internet using users to validate the other party’s certificate efficiently must be provided. But, there is no standard about the certificate validation using the mobile device over the wireless Internet environment. Therefore, we propose the <b>certificate</b> validation <b>model</b> applicable to the wireless Internet environment based on the previous <b>certificate</b> validation <b>model</b> based on the wired Internet environment.

40|$|Certificate {{verification}} in PKI is {{a complex}} and time consuming process. In the classical PKI methodology, {{in order to obtain}} a public key and to accept a certificate as valid, a verifier needs to extract a certificate path from the PKI and to verify the certificates on this path recursively. Levi proposed a nested <b>certificate</b> <b>model</b> vvith the aim to simplify and speed up certificate verification. Such a nested certificate-based PKI significantly improves certificate verification, but it also requires a large {{increase in the number of}} issued certificates, which makes this model impractical for real life deployment. In order to solve this drawback of nested PKI, while retaining its speed in certificate verification, we propose in this paper the innovative concept of a compressed nested certificate, which is a significantly modified version of the nested <b>certificate</b> <b>model.</b> Compressed nested certificate PKI deploys compressed nested certificates which speed up and simplify certificate verification while keeping certificate load to a minimum, thus providing implementers the option of integrating it into the existing PKI model or building it separately as an independent model. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Limited {{valuable}} resources {{need protection}} from unintended users and excessive usage. This {{problem can be}} solved using access control of some form. Many good technologies exist for centralised systems, but distributed systems present interest-ing challenges as the technologies are not ideally suited for situations like multiple alternative resources, distributed management or anonymous users. A proposed solution, SPKI authorisation certificates, naturally provide many of the required characteristics, but they are inadequate to protect limited resources against exploitation. They cannot support use cases where the right can be used e. g. only {{a certain number of}} times or up to a specified amount. Instead, they always grant unlimited access. In this thesis, the author analyses the SPKI <b>certificate</b> <b>model,</b> identifies the missing elements and provides the necessary additions. The resulting model enables numer-ous new application areas. The model is then analysed from points of view of us-ability, security and scalability. The author concludes that good usability is achiev-able with careful design, that the new model has no new substantial security weak-nesses, but that the issue of scalability still merits further work...|$|E
40|$|Several {{western states}} have {{considered}} developing a regulatory approach to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the electric power industry, {{referred to as}} a load-based (LB) cap-and-trade scheme. A LB approach differs from the traditional source-based (SB) cap-and-trade approach in that the emission reduction obligation is placed upon Load Serving Entities (LSEs), rather than electric generators. The LB approach can potentially reduce the problem of emissions leakage, relative to a SB system. For any of these proposed LB schemes to be effective, they must be compatible with modern, and increasingly competitive, wholesale electricity markets. LSE's are unlikely to know the emissions associated with their power purchases. Therefore, a key challenge for a LB scheme is how to assign emissions to each LSE. This paper discusses the problems with one model for assigning emissions under a LB scheme and proposes an alternative, using unbundled Generation Emission Attribute Certificates. By providing a mechanism to internalize an emissions price signal at the generator dispatch level, the tradable <b>certificate</b> <b>model</b> addresses both these problems and provides incentives identical to a SB scheme.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Compare the {{discrimination}} of risk-adjustment models for primary cesarean delivery derived from medical record data and birth certificate data and {{determine if the}} two types of models yield similar hospital profiles of risk-adjusted cesarean delivery rates. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: The study involved 29, 234 women without prior cesarean delivery admitted for labor and delivery in 1993 - 95 to 20 hospitals in northeast Ohio for whom data abstracted from patient medical records and data from birth certificates could be linked. STUDY DESIGN: Three pairs of multivariate models of the risk of cesarean delivery were developed using (1) the full complement of variables in medical records or birth certificates; (2) variables that were common to the two sources; and (3) variables for which agreement between the two data sources was high. Using each of the six models, predicted rates of cesarean delivery were determined for each hospital. Hospitals were classified as outliers if observed and predicted rates of cesarean delivery differed (p <. 05). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Discrimination of the full medical record and birth certificate models was higher (p <. 001) than {{the discrimination}} of the more limited common and reliable variable models. Based on the full medical record model, six hospitals were classified as statistical (p <. 01) outliers (three high and three low). In contrast, the full birth <b>certificate</b> <b>model</b> identified five low and four high outliers, and classifications differed for seven of the 20 hospitals. Even so, the correlation between adjusted hospital rates was substantial (r =. 71). Interestingly, correlations between the full medical record model and the more limited common (r =. 84) and reliable (r =. 88) variable birth certificate models were higher, and differences in classification of hospital outlier status were fewer. CONCLUSION: Birth certificates can be used to develop cesarean delivery risk-adjustment models that have excellent discrimination. However, using the full complement of birth certificate variables may lead to biased hospital comparisons. In contrast, limiting models to data elements with known reliability may yield rankings that are more similar to rankings based on medical record data...|$|E
