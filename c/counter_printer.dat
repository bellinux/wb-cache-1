50|$|Hengstler {{stands for}} a {{complete}} project management with custom-made applications concerning process control and environmental technology.It exists a varied product portfolio of encoder (incremental and absolute encodes for example), relay, mechanical <b>counters</b> and <b>printer</b> and cutter for industrial needs.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical systems {{including}} the card reader, <b>printer,</b> <b>counters</b> and storage units were all {{driven by a}} single motor, which also drove an oil pump and a generator that provided 46-volt power for the electrical logic. This included about 900 relays which were mounted on three swing-out gates. The control panel had a matrix of 43 by 52 holes, {{most of which were}} assigned.|$|R
50|$|The watchmaker Johannes Hengstler {{started in}} 1846, {{in the south}} of Germany, with the series {{production}} of springs. Over the coming decades, the production was enlarged with relay, rotary encoder, mechanical <b>counter</b> and also <b>printer</b> & cutter.In 1995, the company has been taken over by Danaher Corporation, an American concern which includes more than 400 companies. Today, Hengstler has various prominent customers like Siemens, IBM, Festo or Bosch.|$|R
2500|$|A {{servo system}} differs from some stepper motor {{applications}} {{in that the}} position feedback is continuous while the motor is running; a stepper system relies on the motor not to [...] "miss steps" [...] for short term accuracy, although a stepper system may include a [...] "home" [...] switch or other element to provide long-term stability of control. For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional <b>counter</b> in the <b>printer's</b> microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.|$|R
40|$|The queue number - {{print out}} - system use {{microcontroller}} AT 89 S 51 {{has been designed}} and realized. This Instrument can be exploited as queue number - print out - system on the automatic queue system {{at the place where}} queue system needed. The system consisted of hardware and software. The hardware consists of minimum system of microcontroller AT 89 S 51, knob input circuit, seven segment circuit and Epson LX- 800 printer. The microcontroller software in this research was built by using assembly language. This system work after microcontroller is turn on then the microcontroller will do the <b>counter</b> initialization and <b>printer</b> setting. After the initialization and setting process finished, the system will be waiting the counter button pressed, if the counter button pressed, microcontroller will send instruction data to the printer for printing and will represent the queue number counter result at seven segment. In the Epson LX- 800 printer will do the printing process suitable with input data from microcontroller. This system have been realized and be able to print the queue number print out and also represent the queue number counter result on the seven segment after the button was pressed...|$|R
40|$|The digital {{printing}} market is changing faster now than {{before and the}} ability to adjust to newsituations has become more importat to a printing company. An efficient internal communicationis essential. At Elanders Digitaltryck a decision was made in august 2002 to look over the shiftworking system for the printer operators. In this paper, an investigation of the possibilities tochange the existing system to a better one was made. The project resultet in four different timetabels. The construction was based on theoretical studiesand an analysis of the current situation at the workplace. The analysis showed that a strong resistanseagainst a change of the working hours exists among the workers and that this should beconsidered before a decision is made. An analasys of the <b>printers</b> <b>counters</b> shows that they areused more efficient during shorter shift periods compared to the longer ones. A closeer look at theabcense due to sickness shows that it is relatively high but no connection between abcense andworking hours could be made. Working hours is a sensitive issue and should be treated with care. It is important that the workersare well informed and preferly involved {{in the development of a}} new timetable...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years of the 16 th c. the Venetian {{printing}} industry was still one of the major economic sectorsin the city, but production had dwindled to levels inferior to those of the middle years of the century because of the intellectual and moral crisis of the Republic, of the complete re-haul of the editorial geography of Europe, in which Venice ceased to be a capital, and of the repressive policy of the <b>Counter</b> Reformation. <b>Printers</b> and booksellers tried to react with the creation, in 1549, of the Corporazione or Università degli stampatori e librari. But the narrow-mindedness and restrictive policies of the corporation, that denied to non-members the right to exercize their trade and imposed strict rules on the activity of members, just worsened the plight of the industry. Among the many minor printers that were still active in Venice {{during the second half of}} the century, Pietro Deuchino, who was mainly a typecaster, would have remained in the shadows of history but for an anonymous denunciation accusing him of heretical behaviour and of possession of books listed in the index librorum prohibitorum, which led him to be tried by the Holy Office. Thanks to the pressing demands of the inquisitors when they interrogated Pietro and a great number of witnesses, I was able to piece together the career of a member of the booktrade who worked in France and Switzerland before settling in Italy, as well as his original voice “from the bottom” about the religious conflict that raged in Venice, as in the rest of Europe, during the second half of the century. I established for the first time a check-list of the 46 titles that Deuchino printed in Venice between 1570 and 1581, for himself or for other booksellers, and used it to complement the indications of the archival document. It is published here as an appendix. Not Reviewe...|$|R
