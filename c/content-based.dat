The DLC packs are both story-based and <b>content-based,</b> and added in elements that were cut from the base game, such as Shale, a stone-based companion who always gets stuck in doors and causes trouble with the camera system. A crossover with Mass Effect 2, an item called the Blood Dragon Armor, is also available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated <b>content-based</b> {{regulation}} of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E

25|$|For a {{recommender}} system, {{sentiment analysis}} {{has been proven}} to be a valuable technique. A recommender system aims to predict the preference to an item of a target user. Mainstream recommender systems work on explicit data set. For example, collaborative filtering works on the rating matrix, and <b>content-based</b> filtering works on the meta-data of the items.|$|E

The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image (give me all images similar to image X), or in terms of high-level search criteria given as text input (give me all images which contains many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them).|$|E
25|$|Performance {{art is a}} term usually {{reserved}} {{to refer to a}} conceptual art which conveys a <b>content-based</b> meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.|$|E
25|$|In {{many social}} {{networking}} services or e-commerce websites, users can provide text review, comment or {{feedback to the}} items. These user-generated text provide {{a rich source of}} user's sentiment opinions about numerous products and items. Potentially, for an item, such text can reveal both the related feature/aspects of the item and the users' sentiments on each feature. The item's feature/aspects described in the text play the same role with the meta-data in <b>content-based</b> filtering, but the former are more valuable for the recommender system. Since these features are broadly mentioned by users in their reviews, they {{can be seen as the}} most crucial features that can significantly influence the user's experience on the item, while the meta-data of the item (usually provided by the producers instead of consumers) may ignore features that are concerned by the users. For different items with common features, a user may give different sentiments. Also, a feature of the same item may receive different sentiments from different users. Users' sentiments on the features can be regarded as a multi-dimensional rating score, reflecting their preference on the items.|$|E
25|$|Having {{no further}} {{recourse}} in the University of Virginia, Wide Awake magazine and Rosenberger asked the legal {{help of the}} Center for Individual Rights, which {{filed a lawsuit against}} the UVA, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, who granted summary judgment to the University, ruling that denying student activities funding to Wide Awake was neither unconstitutional <b>content-based</b> discrimination, nor unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, and that the University's interest in avoiding violating the Establishment Clause justified not subsidizing the magazine. Yet, the district court did not conclusively rule upon the related {{question of whether or not}} the UVA subsidizing the student religious magazine would violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Wide Awake appealed its lost case to the Fourth Circuit court, which ruled that the University had engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, but that the University’s subsidizing the religious magazine would affirmatively violate the Establishment Clause. Wide Awake then appealed the Fourth Circuit Court’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to review the case.|$|E
500|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{wrote an}} opinion concurring in the judgment, {{in which he}} argued that <b>content-based</b> {{discrimination}} {{should be considered a}} [...] "rule of thumb, rather than as an automatic 'strict scrutiny' trigger, leading to almost certain legal condemnation". Justice Breyer conceded that <b>content-based</b> regulations sometimes reveal weaknesses in the government's rationale for limiting speech, and that <b>content-based</b> regulations interfere with the [...] "free marketplace of idea". [...] However, he also argued that [...] "virtually all government activities involve speech", and many involve <b>content-based</b> regulations on speech. Therefore, he concluded that a rule triggering strict scrutiny for all cases involving <b>content-based</b> restrictions would be a [...] "recipe for judicial management of ordinary government regulatory activity". Justice Breyer argued that instead of the automatic trigger, courts should determine the constitutionality of <b>content-based</b> regulations by [...] "examining the seriousness of the harm to speech, the importance of the countervailing objectives, {{the extent to which the}} law will achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so". Although he did not believe strict scrutiny should be applied to the town's sign ordinance, he agreed that the town's ordinance was unconstitutional because the town did not provide a rational justification for treating some signs differently than other.|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the town's sign ordinance imposed <b>content-based</b> restrictions that did not survive strict scrutiny because the ordinance was not narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest. Justice Thomas also clarified that strict scrutiny should always be applied when a law is <b>content-based</b> on its face. Justice Stephen Breyer and Justice Elena Kagan both wrote opinions concurring in the judgment, in which they argued that <b>content-based</b> regulations should not always automatically trigger strict scrutiny. Although some commentators praised the court's decision as a victory for [...] "individual liberty", other commentators criticized the Court's methodology. Some analysts have also suggested that the case left open several important questions within First Amendment jurisprudence that may be re-litigated in future years.|$|E
500|$|The Act is a presumptively invalid <b>content-based</b> {{restriction}} on speech, {{so it is}} subject to strict scrutiny and not the [...] "variable obscenity" [...] standard from Ginsberg v. New York.|$|E
500|$|Justice Samuel Alito wrote a {{separate}} concurring opinion, {{in which he}} was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. He agreed that <b>content-based</b> regulations present the same dangers as viewpoint-based regulations because <b>content-based</b> regulations [...] "may interfere with democratic self-government and the search for truth". He also agreed that the town's ordinance was [...] "replete with <b>content-based</b> distinctions" [...] that were subject to strict scrutiny. However, Justice Alito wrote separately to emphasize that the Court's opinion would not [...] "prevent cities from regulating signs in a way that fully protects public safety and serves legitimate esthetic objectives". To support his argument, Justice Alito provided a list of examples of content-neutral sign regulations, including: regulations that target the size of signs, regulations that target the locations at which signs may be placed, regulations distinguishing between lighted and unlighted signs, regulations that distinguish between the placement of signs on public and private property, rules that restrict the total number of signs [...] "per mile of roadway", and rules that distinguish between freestanding signs and signs that are attached to buildings.|$|E
500|$|Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. ___ (2015), {{is a case}} {{in which}} the United States Supreme Court {{clarified}} when municipalities may impose <b>content-based</b> restrictions on signage. The case also clarified the level of constitutional scrutiny that should be applied to <b>content-based</b> restrictions on speech. In 2005, Gilbert, Arizona adopted a municipal sign ordinance that regulated the manner in which signs could be displayed in public areas. The ordinance imposed stricter limitations on signs advertising religious services than signs that displayed [...] "political" [...] or [...] "ideological" [...] messages. When the town's Sign Code compliance manager cited a local church for violating the ordinance, the church filed a lawsuit in which they argued the town's sign regulations violated its First Amendment right to the freedom of speech.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Justice Thomas {{rejected}} the town's assertion that a law is only <b>content-based</b> if it [...] "censor or favor" [...] specific viewpoints or ideas. The town argued that its sign code was not unconstitutional because it neither endorsed nor suppressed any particular viewpoints or ideas. However, Justice Thomas clarified that a statute is <b>content-based</b> if it singles out a specific subject, {{even though it}} may not target ideas or viewpoints within that subject matter. Furthermore, he also {{rejected the}} Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the ordinance was content-neutral because it targeted specific classes of speakers, rather than the content of their speech. Although he recognized that speaker-based restrictions were only [...] "the beginning — not the end — of the inquiry", Justice Thomas held that [...] "laws favoring some speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the legislature’s speaker preference reflects a content preference".|$|E
500|$|Justice Elena Kagan {{also wrote}} an opinion concurring in the judgment, {{in which she}} was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer. Like Justice Breyer, Justice Kagan argued that it was not {{necessary}} to apply strict scrutiny to all <b>content-based</b> restrictions on speech. She argued that the majority's opinion would jeopardize too many [...] "entirely reasonable" [...] existing sign ordinances across the country. In light of the court's opinion, Justice Kagan suggested that municipalities will now be forced to choose between repealing [...] "exemptions that allow for helpful signs on streets and sidewalks" [...] and lifting [...] "sign restrictions altogether and resign themselves to the resulting clutter". Instead of applying strict scrutiny in every case, Justice Kagan claimed that strict scrutiny is only appropriate when there is a [...] "realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot". Likewise, she also claimed that strict scrutiny is not necessary when there is no risk that regulations will [...] "skew the public’s debate of ideas". Applying these principles to this case, Justice Kagan held the ordinance [...] "does not pass strict scrutiny, or intermediate scrutiny, or even the laugh test" [...] because the town did not provide [...] "any sensible basis" [...] for the <b>content-based</b> distinctions within its sign ordinance.|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the town's sign ordinance was [...] "content-based on its face" [...] {{in light of the fact}} that the [...] "restrictions in the Sign Code that apply to any given sign [...] entirely on the communicative content of the sign". Because the church's signs were [...] "treated differently from signs conveying other types of ideas", there was [...] "no need to consider the government’s justifications or purposes for enacting the Code to determine whether it is subject to strict scrutiny". Justice Thomas rejected the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the ordinance was content-neutral because the regulations were not based on [...] "disagree with the message conveyed" [...] and the reasons for regulating the various categories of signs were [...] "unrelated to the content of the sign". Rather, he emphasized that [...] " [...] law that is <b>content-based</b> on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government’s benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of 'animus toward the ideas contained' in the regulated speech". Justice Thomas explained that [...] "innocent motives" [...] do not eliminate the danger of censorship, because governments may one day use <b>content-based</b> laws to regulate [...] "disfavored speech".|$|E
500|$|<b>Content-based</b> {{regulation}} {{of television and}} radio, however, have been sustained by the Supreme Court in various cases. Since there is {{a limited number of}} frequencies for non-cable television and radio stations, the government licenses them to various companies. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the problem of scarcity does not allow the raising of a First Amendment issue. The government may restrain broadcasters, but only on a content-neutral basis. In Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation, the Supreme Court upheld the Federal Communications Commission's authority to restrict the use of [...] "indecent" [...] material in broadcasting.|$|E
500|$|Because the {{ordinance}} imposed <b>content-based</b> restrictions on free speech, Justice Thomas held that {{the ordinance}} would only be constitutional if it survived strict scrutiny. Assuming that the town's interests of preserving aesthetic appeal and traffic safety were compelling, he concluded that these were [...] "hopelessly underinclusive" [...] because the ordinance allowed for the proliferation of an unlimited number of larger, ideological signs that pose the same threats to aesthetics and traffic as directional signs. In fact, Justice Thomas suggested that a [...] "sharply worded" [...] ideological sign {{may be more likely}} to distract drivers than a directional sign. Justice Thomas also suggested that some directional signs [...] "may be essential, both for vehicles and pedestrians, to guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety". Therefore, Justice Thomas remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the Court's opinion.|$|E
500|$|The {{ruling was}} praised by {{the video game}} industry, which had {{expected}} the law to be ruled unconstitutional, but sought affirmation by the Court. ESA's CEO, Michael Gallagher, responded that [...] "The Court declared forcefully that <b>content-based</b> restrictions on games are unconstitutional; and that parents, not government bureaucrats, {{have the right to}} decide what is appropriate for their children." [...] Bo Anderson of the EMA stated that [...] "there now can be no argument whether video games are entitled to the same protection as books, movies, music, and other expressive entertainment," [...] while Electronic Arts' (former) CEO John Riccitiello asserted that the decision [...] "affirmed the constitutional rights of game developers." [...] Other entertainment industries, such as the Motion Picture Association of America, also showed support for the Court's decision. [...] Former U.S. Senator and current head of the Association Chris Dodd recognized that the motion picture industry has seen similar attempts to limit its freedom of expression, and that [...] "We applaud the Supreme Court for recognizing the far-reaching First-Amendment implications posed by the California law." ...|$|E
500|$|The church {{filed suit}} in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona in March 2008, where they claimed the town [...] "abridged their freedom of speech in {{violation}} of the First and Fourteenth Amendments". The district court first denied the church's request for a preliminary injunction, and the church then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit, analyzing the likelihood of success on the merits requirement for a preliminary injunction, affirmed the decision of the district court, holding that the town's restrictions for temporary directional signs [...] "did not regulate speech on the basis of content" [...] Although the Ninth Circuit conceded that enforcement officers would need to read a sign to determine which portions of the sign ordinance applied to the sign, the Ninth Circuit concluded that this [...] "cursory examination" [...] was not equivalent to [...] "synthesizing the expressive content of the sign". The Ninth Circuit then remanded the case back to the district court to determine [...] "in the first instance whether the Sign Code’s distinctions among temporary directional signs, political signs, and ideological signs nevertheless constituted a <b>content-based</b> regulation of speech." ...|$|E
2500|$|Milford {{also argued}} that its {{interest}} in not violating the Establishment Clause justified its excluding the Good News Club from its facilities. [...] In Widmar v. Vincent, , the Court held that [...] "a state interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation may be characterized as compelling, and therefore may justify <b>content-based</b> discrimination" [...] {{on the part of}} the state entity. [...] But in Lamb's Chapel, the Court left open the question of whether such a concern could also justify viewpoint discrimination. [...] The Court ruled that it could not, and gave four reasons for distinguishing <b>content-based</b> discrimination from viewpoint discrimination on this score.|$|E
2500|$|Advocates of {{the idea}} argue {{that it will be}} easier for parents and {{employers}} to block the entire TLD, rather than using more complex and error-prone <b>content-based</b> filtering, without imposing any restrictions on those who wish to access it. Editors of explicit content sites, however, were afraid that the use of a single TLD like [...]xxx would also make it easier for search engines to block all of their content.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{began its}} {{substantive}} analysis with {{a review of}} the principles of free speech clause jurisprudence, beginning with the general rule that the First Amendment prevents the government from proscribing speech, or even expressive conduct, because of disapproval of the ideas expressed. The Court noted that while <b>content-based</b> regulations are presumptively invalid, society has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are [...] "of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Blackmun concurred in part, concurred in the {{judgment}} in part, and dissented in part. He joined the plurality's preservation of Roe – of which he wrote the majority – and he too rejected the spousal notification law. Justice Blackmun, however, argued for a woman's right to privacy and insisted, {{as he did in}} Roe, that all non-de-minimis abortion regulations were subject to strict scrutiny. Using such an analysis, Justice Blackmun argued that the <b>content-based</b> counseling, the 24-hour waiting period, informed parental consent, and the reporting regulations were unconstitutional. He also dissented from the plurality's undue burden test, and instead found his trimester framework [...] "far less manipulable" [...] and [...] "administrable." [...] Blackmun even went further in his opinion than Stevens, sharply attacking and criticizing the anti-Roe bloc of the Court.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Scalia concurred in the Court's opinion, but wrote {{separately}} {{to express}} his own views. [...] He {{did not believe that}} the Club's activities were coercive at all. [...] "As to endorsement, I have previously written that religious expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause where it (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a traditional or designated public forum, publicly announced and open to all on equal terms. [...] The same is true of private speech that occurs in a limited public forum, publicly announced, whose boundaries are not drawn in favor of religious groups but instead permit a cross-section of uses." [...] Milford could not justify excluding the Club simply because its speech was religious in nature, and so Scalia did not worry whether the discrimination was <b>content-based</b> or viewpoint-based. [...] In any event, Scalia stressed that Milford was engaging in viewpoint discrimination.|$|E
2500|$|The University of Virginia defense {{distinguished}} between its funds-denial {{action and the}} actions tried in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District noting that it involved use of public school buildings, whilst the case of Rosenberger v. University of Virginia involved the use of school money. [...] "Were the reasoning of Lamb's Chapel to apply to funding decisions {{as well as to}} those involving access to facilities, it is urged, its holding would become a judicial juggernaut, constitutionalizing the ubiquitous <b>content-based</b> decisions that schools, colleges, and other government entities routinely make in the allocation of public funds." [...] The Court held that when a public school or university spends its own money to disseminate its own message, it may control the content and perspective, yet [...] "it does not follow [...] [...] [...] that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the University does not, itself, speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors, but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of viewpoints from private speakers". UVA student organizations are not University agents subject to University control, and are not a University responsibility. Because the University of Virginia will pay third-party printing costs of private speakers communicating their own messages, it may not [...] "silence the expression of selected viewpoints".|$|E
2500|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and knowledge engineering {{are central to}} AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of [...] "what exists" [...] is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web Ontology Language. The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations are suitable for <b>content-based</b> indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery via automated reasoning (inferring new statements based on explicitly stated knowledge), etc. Video events are often represented as SWRL rules, which can be used, among others, to automatically generate subtitles for constrained videos.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, the MRC began {{monitoring}} {{the entertainment industry}} through its Entertainment Division and newsletter TV, etc. MRC president L.

The PTC monitors prime-time television for what it believes is indecent content and publishes <b>content-based</b> reviews of television shows and oversees campaigns to make advertisers withdraw from programs that they believe are morally offensive. Extra!, the magazine published by left-wing group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, asserted that the MRC's former newsletter TV, etc. inspired the group and [...] "tracked the allegedly leftist politics of entertainment industry figures". In July 2002, MRC and affiliate Parents Television Council (PTC) paid an out-of-court settlement ending a lawsuit launched by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in November 2000. WWE alleged 13 instances of defamation, copyright infringement and interference with prospective business relations after PTC produced a fundraising video using unauthorized WWE footage, falsely claimed WWE {{was responsible for the}} murders of four children, and falsely claimed advertisers had pulled their commercials from the show. MRC paid US$3.5 million.

2500|$|Regarding {{whether to}} choose the SAT or ACT, the {{consensus}} view is that both tests are roughly equivalent and tend to bring similar results, and that each test is equally accepted by colleges. Reporter Jacques Steinberg in the New York Times suggested that admissions deans repeatedly inform him that colleges view the ACT and SAT tests equally {{and do not have}} a preference. At the same time, small differences between the tests may translate into a slight benefit for the test-taker. One report suggested that the SAT favors [...] "white male students" [...] from upper income backgrounds. Another report suggests that the ACT has more questions geared to higher levels of high school mathematics, suggesting that students who do well in math may perform better, but that the SAT is a better choice for students with an excellent vocabulary. According to one view, the SAT is more focused on testing reasoning ability while the ACT is more of a <b>content-based</b> test of achievement. In addition, according to this view, some SAT questions can be trickier and harder to decipher while some ACT questions may be longer; question difficulty progresses within each SAT section while difficult questions are randomly interspersed in the ACT; the SAT has a separate vocabulary section while the ACT has a separate science reasoning section. In 2016 the SAT was updated to remove the penalty for random guessing; the College Board advises that test-takers will benefit by guessing.|$|E
