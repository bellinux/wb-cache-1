5000|$|Numerous {{systems are}} used to secure {{containers}} aboard ships, depending on {{factors such as the}} type of ship, the type of container, and the location of the container. [...] Stowage inside the holds of fully cellular (FC) ships is simplest, typically using simple metal forms called container guides, locating cones, and anti-rack spacers to lock the containers together. [...] Above-decks, without the extra support of the cell guides, more complicated equipment is used. [...] Three types of systems are currently in wide use: lashing systems, locking systems, and buttress systems. [...] Lashing systems secure containers to the ship using devices made from wire rope, rigid rods, or chains and devices to tension the lashings, such as turnbuckles. [...] The effectiveness of lashings is increased by securing containers to each other, either by simple metal forms (such as stacking cones) or more complicated devices such as twist-lock stackers. [...] A typical twist-lock is inserted into the <b>casting</b> <b>hole</b> of one container and rotated to hold it in place, then another container is lowered on top of it. [...] The two containers are locked together by twisting the device's handle. [...] A typical twist-lock is constructed of forged steel and ductile iron and has a shear strength of 48 metric tons.|$|E

The clamp load consistency concern is founded {{in the fact that}} a portion of the input torque used to create clamp load is also used to create threads. The torque used for thread forming may not be consistent due to variations in <b>casting</b> material, <b>hole</b> size and shape due to tooling wear and process variation (thermal and mechanical). There is little data available to understand the magnitude of this concern or to form the basis of potential solutions if the range of clamp load variation is very high (> +/- 30 %). The range of variation that can be expected in as-cast hole size and shape over the full life cycle of a high pressure die casting die was established in previous work completed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, (PNNL). This established range of variation was captured in a set of 12 cast bosses by designing core pins at the size and draft angles identified in the sited previous work.

There were two sets of experiments run. First, a series of cast aluminum nuts were made reflecting the range of shape and size variations to be expected over the life cycle of a die casting die. Taptite thread forming fasteners, (a widely used thread forming fastener suitable for aluminum applications), were driven into the various cored, as-cast nuts at a constant input torque and resulting clamp loads were recorded continuously. The clamp load data was used to determine the range of clamp loads to be expected. The bolts were driven to failure. The clamp load corresponding to the target input of 18. 5 Nm was recorded for each fastener. In a like fashion, a second set of experiments were run with cast magnesium nuts and ALtracs thread forming fasteners, (a widely used thread forming fastener suitable for magnesium applications). Again all clamp loads were recorded and analyzed similarly to the Taptites in aluminum cast nuts. Results from previous work performed on the same test cell for a Battelle project using standard M 8 bolts into standard M 8 nuts were included as a comparator for a standard bolt and nut application. The results for the thread forming fasteners in aluminum <b>cast</b> <b>holes</b> were well within industry expectations of +/- 30 % for out of the box and robustness range testing. The results for the dry and lubed extreme conditions were only slightly higher than industry expectations at +/- 35. 6 %. However, when compared to the actual Battelle results (+/- 40 %) for a standard bolt and nut the tread forming fasteners performed slightly better. The results for the thread forming fasteners in magnesium <b>cast</b> <b>holes</b> were all well within industry expectations of +/- 30 % for all three conditions. The robustness range (. 05 mm larger and smaller holes than the expected wear pattern of a die casting die at full life cycle) results also fell within the industry expectations for standard threaded fasteners. These results were very encouraging. It was concluded that this work showed that clamp load variation with thread forming fasteners is consistent with industry expectations for standard steel bolts and nuts at +/- 30 %. There does not appear to be any significant increase in clamp load variation due to the application of thread forming fasteners in as-cast holes of aluminum or magnesium over the effective life of a die casting mold. The fully implemented potential benefit of thread forming fasteners in as-cast holes of aluminum and magnesium is estimated to be 6 trillion Btu per year for North America. Economic benefit is estimated to be nearly $ 800 million per year. Environmental benefits and quality improvements will also result from full implementation of this technology...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion {{investigations}} and testing standards normally use standard surface pre-treatments, e. g. ground samples. This {{is in order}} to be able to determine the impact of various elements. The end users of materials therefore generally have access to good data regarding the impact of the alloy composition. The problem is that alloys are almost never used in a ground condition, as the surface condition strongly depends on the production route used. This study addresses this problem. The metal dusting resistance of wrought and spun cast 20 Cr 32 NiFe with different surface states has been investigated. The samples came from commercially available tubes with their standard surface condition; the wrought alloys in a pickled state and the spun <b>cast</b> deep <b>hole</b> drilled. Samples with the original and ground surfaces were exposed for 300 h at 600 °C in a CO/CO 2 /H 2 /H 2 O mixture, P tot= 5. 5 bar (ac: Boudouard/COred/Water-Gas- Shift: 558 / 232 / 379), corresponding to conditions in some furnaces used for the direct reduction of iron ore. The results clearly show that that 20 Cr 32 NiFe is not suitable for high carbon activities. However, the pickled surface was sensitive toward metal dusting attack while the drilled and the ground samples had better resistance. This shows that the surface pre-treatment plays a crucial role. © 2011 by NACE International...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the {{characterisation}} and numerical modelling of advanced sheet metal components reinforced by light metal cast structures (SADH). The modelling is focused on full car simulation. One major aspect is the discretisation of form closure connections between sheet metal and aluminium cast structure which realise the compound between both materials. A SADH structure consists of a steel sheet metal and an integrated stiffening structure of aluminium. For the manufacturing process a perforated sheet metal is placed in a high pressure die casting tool before the casting. During the <b>casting</b> the <b>holes</b> of the sheet metal are filled with aluminium and a fixed form closure connection is generated. At a demonstrator structure of a SADH typical characteristics are named and analysed. Resulting from different thermal expansion coefficients and manufacturing temperatures residual stresses and distortion are analysed. Static loading tests are carried out to analyse the mechanical performance. For a virtual development process a numerical model of a SADH is generated. To model the material characteristics thermal loading test become necessary for the sheet metal. The sheet metal is exposed to a short and high thermal treatment during the high pressure die casting process which has to be considered for the material card. At a special form closure specimen manufacturing details are investigated. This specimen is further used to generate a loading profile of form closure connections under different conditions. Based on the test data a numerical model of the form closure connections is developed on full car modelling level. The verified form closure model is then transferred to the SADH structural model. Concluding the correlation between numerical calculation and experiments is shown on the SADH structural tests...|$|R

In the near future, major developments in instrumentation will provide the tools for high-precision studies of its spacetime via observations of relativistic effects in stellar orbits, in the timing of pulsars, and in horizon-scale images of its accretion flow. We explore here the prospect of measuring the properties of the black-hole spacetime using all these three types of observations.

40|$|The {{need for}} a {{consistent}} quantum evolution for black holes has led to proposals that their semiclassical description is modified not just near the singularity, but at horizon or larger scales. If such modifications extend beyond the horizon, they influence regions accessible to distant observeration. Natural candidates for these modifications behave like metric fluctuations, with characteristic length and time scales set by the horizon radius. We investigate {{the possibility of using}} the Event Horizon Telescope to observe these effects, if they have a strength sufficient to make quantum evolution consistent with unitarity. We find that such quantum fluctuations can introduce a strong time dependence for the shape and size of the shadow that a black <b>hole</b> <b>casts</b> on its surrounding emission. For the black hole {{in the center of the}} Milky Way, detecting the rapid time variability of its shadow will require non-imaging timing techniques.
