40|$|We examine prize {{allocation}} in contests {{in which}} the number of <b>contenders</b> affects prizes. The government allocates a fixed prize between two groups of <b>contenders.</b> The prize share of each group is determined endogenously through the inter-group share contest. Then, the <b>contenders</b> in each group respectively compete for the prize. Examining prize allocation in such contests, we obtain the following results. The <b>contenders</b> expend more resources when they cooperate than when they contribute non-cooperatively in the inter-group share contest. The size effect through prizes increases the prize share of the larger group. The larger group can even obtain the larger share if the size effect through prizes is sufficiently strong...|$|R
