The first association outside the British Empire was founded in Chile in May 21, 1909 after a visit to Baden Powell. In most <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> there is now at least one Scouting (or Guiding) organization. Each is independent, but international cooperation continues {{to be seen as}} part of the Scout Movement. In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing body on policy for the national Scouting organizations (then male only).

The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in high-volume situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres.|$|E

The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.|$|E
