40|$|Two {{children}} are described with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia and encephalitis associated with echovirus infection. One {{also developed a}} condition resembling dermatomyositis which improved after he was given infusions of plasma containing antibody to the echovirus. Although both died of their encephalitis, {{the course of the}} brain disease in one of them may have been prolonged by treatment with specific antibody. These cases, together with another briefly mentioned case in an adult with <b>congenital</b> <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> and echovirus infection, indicate that these patients are particularly susceptible to echoviruses...|$|E
40|$|A {{boy with}} <b>congenital</b> <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> {{died at the}} age of 12 years after a viral meningoencephalitis of two and a half years {{duration}} due to an untypable picornavirus. He had received intravenous immunoglobulin every four weeks from the time of the start of immunoglobulin replacement treatment at the age of 3 years. The encephalitis did not respond to high dose intravenous gammaglobulin (2500 g during 22 months). The virus could not be isolated during the administration of intraventricular immunoglobulin (38. 15 g) and intraventricular recombinant alpha interferon (121 X 10 (6) units), but recurred rapidly each time intraventricular treatment was stopped. Further modes of treatment are still required for prevention and treatment of this disorder...|$|E
40|$|A boy aged 6 months who {{presented}} with poor weight gain, diarrhoea, and infection with Pneumocystis carinii {{was found to}} have <b>congenital</b> <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> which did not improve despite monthly treatment with intravenous gammaglobulin. At the age of 3 years and 2 months he developed severe vomiting and diarrhoea due to cryptosporidiosis, which failed to respond to conventional treatment. Infusion of hyperimmune bovine colostrum produced against parasite antigen, given by nasogastric tube, was started after symptoms had persisted for three weeks. His vomiting and diarrhoea resolved within five days of treatment, and oocysts were no longer seen in the stools after eight days. Later, however, he developed a rare complication, and oocysts were found in the common bile duct. Hyperimmune bovine colostrum may be useful in the treatment of many patients with immunodeficiency disorders...|$|E
40|$|The {{previous}} report of {{low levels of}} purine 5 '-nucleotidase activity in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (lymphocytes and monocytes) from patients with non-familial adult onset `variable' primary hypogammaglobulinaemia has been confirmed and the observation extended to include patients with other types of primary immunodeficiency. Patients with sex-linked <b>congenital</b> <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> have values for mononuclear cell 5 '-nucleotidase activity which are in the normal range, whereas most cases of non-familial adult onset `variable' primary hypogammaglobulinaemia have clearly subnormal values. The three patients with isolated IgA deficiency who were tested also had subnormal values. Evidence that the measured enzyme activity is in fact 5 '-nucleotidase and independent of interfering phosphatase activities is presented. No significant or consistent alterations in the activities of the following enzymes were detected in mononuclear cells or erythrocytes: adenosine deaminase, purine nucleoside (inosine) phosphorylase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase. The erythrocyte PRPP content and the mononuclear cell PRPP amidotransferase activity were normal in the small number of patients in which they were measured. These findings are discussed {{in the light of the}} current interest in the inter-relationship between some disorders of purine metabolism and the immunological deficiency syndromes...|$|E
40|$|Males with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) due to {{mutations}} in the Bruton tyrosine kinase gene constitute the major group of <b>congenital</b> <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> with absence of peripheral B cells. In these cases, blockages between the pro-B and pre-B cell {{stage in the}} bone marrow are found. The remaining male and female cases clinically similar to XLA represent a genotypically heterogeneous group of diseases. In these patients, various autosomal recessive disorders have been identified such as mutations affecting IGHM, CD 79 A, IGLL 1 genes involved {{in the composition of}} the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) or the BLNK gene implicated in pre-BCR signal transduction. In this paper, we report on a young female patient characterised by a severe non-XLA agammaglobulinaemia that represents a new case of Igmu defect. We show that the B cell blockage at the pro-B to pre-B cell transition is due to a large homologous deletion in the IGH locus encompassing the IGHM gene leading to the inability to form a functional pre-BCR. The deletion extends {{from the beginning of the}} diversity (D) region to the IGHG 2 gene, with all JH segments and IGHM, IGHD, IGHG 3 and IGHG 1 genes missing. CONCLUSION: alteration in Igmu expression seems to be relatively frequent and could account for most of the reported cases of autosomal recessive agammaglobulinaemia...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{neopterin}} {{levels were}} analysed in 43 patients with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia (25 common variable immunodeficiency (CVI), 12 <b>congenital</b> <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> (CH), six X-linked hypogammaglobulinaemia (XLH)), and in 33 healthy controls. The neopterin values were correlated to lymphocyte subset counts in peripheral blood, lymphocyte mitogen responses and clinical and histological manifestations {{in the study}} group. Serum neopterin levels were significantly elevated in all subgroups of patients {{and particularly in the}} CVI groups where the highest concentrations were found (P less than 0. 001, CVI versus controls). Furthermore, in CVI and CH patients elevated neopterin levels were strongly correlated to decreased number of CD 4 + lymphocytes (rs = - 0. 61, P less than 0. 005 and rs = - 0. 83, P less than 0. 001, respectively). In the CVI group high neopterin levels were also significantly correlated to low number of circulatory B (CD 19 +) lymphocytes (rs = - 0. 58, P less than 0. 05). Both patients with moderately and those with severely depressed lymphocyte mitogen responses had significantly higher neopterin levels than those with normal responses. In addition, high neopterin levels were significantly associated with the occurrence of splenomegaly and nodular intestinal lymphoid hyperplasia. The immunological findings were consistently observed in longitudinal testing, and appeared to be characteristic for the individual patient. High serum neopterin levels are thought to be a marker for hyperactivity in monocytes/macrophages, and dysfunction of these cells may therefore be associated with fundamental immune pathology in some subgroups of primary hypogammaglobulinaemia...|$|E
