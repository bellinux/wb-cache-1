40|$|Cotton fibre {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commodity fibre and is widely employed in apparels. At present, the share of natural fibres in production of nonwoven fabrics is low and employed in opt applications. The cotton fibre is conventionally converted into woven and knitted fabrics by short staple spinning methods. The <b>comber</b> <b>noil</b> is short fibre waste during production of combed cotton yarns. The aims of the current study were to employ <b>comber</b> <b>noil</b> for preparation of hydroentangled cotton nonwovens at varying water jet pressures and conveyor speeds. The effect of these parameters is studied with respect to mechanical and comfort properties of prepared fabrics. The results showed that these variables can help to manufacture fibrous assemblies with engineered properties according to required application area...|$|E
40|$|Nonwoven webs {{containing}} {{five different}} blends of bleached cotton with Lyocell rayon, bicomponent core/sheath polyester/polyethylene, or cotton <b>comber</b> <b>noil</b> were prepared by either light needlepunching, or light needlepunching followed by spunlacing (hydroentanglement). We optically acquired fiber bundle size measurements {{to learn about}} the pre-needling process, the hydroentangling process and the influence of fiber blend composition on fiber entanglement. Fiber entanglement measurements were compared to basis weight uniformity measurements. One of the bed sheet developments utilized a combination of bonding technologies (spunlacing and thermal bonding) that used low energy. Results from this work indicate that spunlacing produced high quality cosmetic pads and economical short-life bed sheeting...|$|E
40|$|New {{nonwoven}} products containing {{cotton and}} Lyocell (Trademarked name Tencel), low temperature thermal-bondable bicomponent olefin/polyester, or <b>comber</b> <b>noils</b> were developed using needlepunching and spunlacing (hydroentanglement). Webs containing five different blends were prepared by either light needlepunching, or light needlepunching followed by hydroentangling. We acquired detailed basis weight uniformity measurements {{to learn about}} processing {{and the influence of}} fiber blend composition on web uniformity. Basis weight uniformity was evaluated without regard to web direction ("Total" uniformity), along the machine direction (MD uniformity) and across the cross direction (CD uniformity) at numerous size resolutions. We observed that blending manufactured fibers (either Tencel or olefin/polyester) with bleached cotton and <b>comber</b> <b>noils</b> substantially improved basis weight uniformity of both types of nonwovens. We also observed that subjecting needled webs to hydroentangling significantly improved Total and MD uniformities...|$|R
