50|$|Serviacero Worthington, a Worthington Industries-Serviacero Planos joint venture, {{operates}} three steel service {{centers in}} Mexico, providing {{services such as}} slitting, pickling, multi-blanking and <b>cutting-to-length</b> to customers {{in a variety of}} industries including automotive, appliance, electronics and heavy equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{services}} include <b>cutting-to-length,</b> slitting, and shearing. It {{also offers}} value-added {{processes such as}} blanking, tempering, plate burning, precision machining, welding, and fabricating and painting to process steel to specified lengths, widths, and shapes. It also owns two subsidiaries, Chicago Tube and Iron and Integrity Stainless.|$|E
40|$|New {{diode laser}} devices use the modular {{character}} of diode lasers to form beam shapes that are {{adapted to the}} processing task. In this paper cutting and welding applications of these tools are presented. A linear laser line is applied for the <b>cutting-to-length</b> of coil material. Diode laser modules that form an annular laser spot are utilized for optical flame cutting of steel material and simultaneous welding of annular seams. Furthermore, cutting of thin materials with a diode laser cutting plotter device is demonstrated. Moreover, new results of welding experiments with commercial diode lasers are presented...|$|E
