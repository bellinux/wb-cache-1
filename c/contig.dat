The cattle rumen microflora and the carbohydrate-active enzymes were functionally classified through a whole metagenomic sequencing approach. Analysis of the assembled sequences by the Carbohydrate-active enzyme a﻿nalysis Toolkit identified the candidate genes encoding fibrolytic enzymes belonging to different classes of glycoside hydrolases(11, 010 <b>contigs),</b> glycosyltransferases (6366 <b>contigs),</b> carbohydrate esterases (4945 <b>contigs),</b> carbohydrate-binding modules (1975 <b>contigs),</b> polysaccharide lyases (480 <b>contigs),</b> and auxiliary activities (115 <b>contigs).</b> Phylogenetic analysis of CAZyme encoding <b>contigs</b> revealed that a significant proportion of CAZymes were contributed by bacteria belonging to genera Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fibrobacter, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus.

Our method also fulfills the critical need for open source computa-tional methods for analyzing optical mapping data.

We generated and used stimulated optical mapping data for loblolly pine and F. tularensis and used real optical mapping data for rice and budgerigar.
