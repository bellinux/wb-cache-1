50|$|Expansion Module #3 was {{originally}} the Super Game Module. It was advertised for an August 1983 release but was ultimately cancelled {{and replaced with}} the Adam <b>computer</b> <b>expansion.</b> The Super Game Module expanded the ColecoVision RAM, said to add 30KB, and added a tape drive known as the Exatron Stringy Floppy with 128KB capacity. Games could be distributed on tiny tapes, called wafers, {{much larger than the}} 16KB or 32KB ROM cartridges of the day. Super Donkey Kong, with all screens and animations, Super Donkey Kong Jr, and Super Smurf Rescue were demonstrated with the Super Game Module. The Adam <b>computer</b> <b>expansion</b> with 64KB RAM and 256KB tape drives fulfilled the specifications promised by the Super Game Module.|$|R
50|$|For cost reasons, {{the unit}} {{did not provide}} for daisy-chaining of further devices on the <b>computer's</b> <b>expansion</b> port.

50|$|M.2, {{formerly}} known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF), is a specification for internally mounted <b>computer</b> <b>expansion</b> cards and associated connectors. It replaces the mSATA standard, which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical card layout and connectors. M.2's more flexible physical specification allows different module widths and lengths, and, paired with the availability of more advanced interfacing features, makes the M.2 more suitable than mSATA for solid-state storage applications in general and particularly for the use in small devices such as ultrabooks or tablets.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2014, Intel Z97 and H97 {{chipsets}} became available, bringing {{support for}} both SATA Express and M.2, {{which is a}} specification for SATA Express storage devices in form of internally mounted <b>computer</b> <b>expansion</b> cards. Z97 and H97 chipsets use two PCI Express 2.0 lanes for each of their SATA Express ports, providing 1 GB/s of bandwidth to PCI Express storage devices.

50|$|PCI Express (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express), officially {{abbreviated}} as PCIe or PCI-e, is {{a high-speed}} serial <b>computer</b> <b>expansion</b> bus standard, designed {{to replace the}} older PCI, PCI-X, and AGP bus standards. PCIe has numerous improvements over the older standards, including higher maximum system bus throughput, lower I/O pin count and smaller physical footprint, better performance scaling for bus devices, a more detailed error detection and reporting mechanism (Advanced Error Reporting, AER), and native hot-plug functionality. More recent revisions of the PCIe standard provide hardware support for I/O virtualization.|$|R
