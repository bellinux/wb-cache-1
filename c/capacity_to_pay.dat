25|$|The German {{people saw}} reparations as a {{national}} humiliation; the German Government worked to undermine {{the validity of the}} Treaty of Versailles and the requirement to pay. British economist John Maynard Keynes called the treaty a Carthaginian peace that would economically destroy Germany. His arguments {{had a profound effect on}} historians, politicians, and the public at large. Despite Keynes' arguments and those by later historians supporting or reinforcing Keynes' views, the consensus of contemporary historians is that reparations were not as intolerable as the Germans or Keynes had suggested and were within Germany's <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> had there been the political will to do so.|$|E
500|$|Compensation demanded {{from the}} {{defeated}} party {{was a common}} feature of peace treaties. The financial burden of the Treaty of Versailles was labelled [...] "reparations", which distinguished them from punitive settlements usually known as indemnities. The reparations were intended for reconstruction and as compensation for families who had been bereaved by the war. Sally Marks wrote that the article [...] "was designed to lay a legal basis for reparations" [...] to be paid. Article 231 [...] "established an unlimited theoretical liability" [...] for which Germany {{would have to pay}} but the following article [...] "in fact narrowed German responsibility to civilian damages". When the final reparation figure was established in 1921, it was based on an Allied assessment of [...] German <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> {{not on the basis of}} Allied claims.|$|E

2500|$|The Treaty of Versailles {{stated that}} a Reparation Commission would be {{established}} in 1921. This commission would consider the resources available to Germany and her <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> provide the German Government {{with an opportunity to}} be heard on the subject, and decide on the final reparation figure that Germany would be required to pay. In the interim, Germany was required to pay an equivalent of [...] gold marks [...] in gold, commodities, ships, securities, or other forms. The money would be used to pay Allied occupation costs and to buy food and raw materials for Germany. Article 121 of the Treaty of Neuilly acknowledged that [...] "the resources of Bulgaria are not sufficient to enable her to make complete reparation". Therefore, the treaty required Bulgaria to pay a sum equivalent of 2.250 billion Gold francs in reparations.|$|E
2500|$|Higgins J {{held that}} for McKay {{to pay a}} fair and {{reasonable}} wage meant paying his employees a wages that met [...] "the normal needs of an average employee, regarded as [...] a human being in a civilised community", regardless of his <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> This {{gave rise to the}} legal requirement for a basic wage. In defining a 'fair and reasonable wage', Higgins (without explicit acknowledgement) employed Pope Leo XIII's Rerum novarum of 1891, an open letter to all the bishops that addressed the condition of the working classes. Higgins ruled that remuneration [...] "must be enough to support the wage earner in reasonable and frugal comfort." [...] A 'fair and reasonable' minimum wage for unskilled workers of 7/- (7 shillings), which is around 70 cents, or 42/- per week. Later surveys showed that this minimum was adequate to provide subsistence.|$|E

[...] The brotherhood, owing to their satisfaction, obliged the artisan, since they felt the project was well conceived and executed, but subtracted a promised eight alqueires of corn (which was also promised at the time). The ombudsman of the Confraria das Almas, solicited the participation of the brothers of the Misericórdia in order to realize a remodelling of their altar, since there was exposed wood and damage, and since they alone did not have the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the costs of such a project on their own.

2500|$|The actual {{amount of}} reparations that Germany {{was obliged to}} pay out was not the 132 billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 million marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112 billion marks in [...] "C bonds" [...] were entirely chimerical—a device to fool the public into {{thinking}} Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20 billion German gold marks, worth about $5 billion US dollars or £1 billion British pounds. 12.5 billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods like coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 {{on the basis of}} a German <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> not on the basis of Allied claims. The highly publicized rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans' benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US received $100 million.|$|E
2500|$|Bernadotte Schmitt {{writes that}} if [...] "pensions and {{separation}} allowances...not been included, reparations would probably never {{have become the}} bogey that poisoned the post-war world for so many years. Taylor says, [...] "no doubt the impoverishment of Germany was caused by war, not by reparations. Not doubt the Germans could have paid reparations, if they had regarded them as an obligation of honour, honestly incurred." [...] However, he says, [...] "reparations ...kept the passions of war alive". Peter Liberman writes that while the Germans believed they could not meet such demands of them, the [...] "French believed that Germany could pay and only lacked the requisite will" [...] to do so. Liberman says this is [...] "a position that has gained support from recent historical research". In regard to Germany's <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> he focuses on coal and says that German coal consumption per capita was higher than France's despite coal shipments being consistently short. He also says, [...] "the reparations demanded at Versailles were not far {{out of proportion to}} German economic potential" [...] and that in terms of national income it was similar to what the Germans demanded of France following the Franco-Prussian War. Martin Kitchen also says the impression that Germany was crippled by the reparations is a myth. Rather than a weakened Germany, he states the opposite was true.|$|E

Proudhon had many arguments against entitlement {{to land and}} capital, including reasons based on morality, economics, politics, and individual liberty.

60|$|But {{this was}} {{impossible}} for two reasons. Two different kinds of false statements had been widely promulgated, one as to Germany's <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> the other as {{to the amount of}} the Allies' just claims in respect of the devastated areas. The fixing of either of these figures presented a dilemma. A figure for Germany's prospective <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> not too much in excess of the estimates of most candid and well-informed authorities, would have fallen hopelessly far short of popular expectations both in England and in France. On the other hand, a definitive figure for damage done which would not disastrously disappoint the expectations which had been raised in France and Belgium might have been incapable of substantiation under challenge,[105] and open to damaging criticism {{on the part of the}} Germans, who were believed to have been prudent enough to accumulate considerable evidence as to the extent of their own misdoings.|$|E
60|$|In this event, {{and if my}} {{estimate}} is accepted, as given below, that Germany's <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> will be exhausted by the direct and legitimate claims which the Allies hold against her, the question of her contingent liability for her allies becomes academic.

60|$|I reach, therefore, {{the final}} {{conclusion}} that, including all methods of payment--immediately transferable wealth, ceded property, {{and an annual}} tribute--$10,000,000,000 is a safe maximum figure of Germany's <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> In all the actual circumstances, I {{do not believe that}} she can pay as much. Let those who consider this a very low figure, bear in mind the following remarkable comparison. The wealth of France in 1871 was estimated at a little less than half that of Germany in 1913. Apart from changes in the value of money, an indemnity from Germany of $2,500,000,000 would, therefore, be about comparable to the sum paid by France in 1871; and as the real burden of an indemnity increases more than in proportion to its amount, the payment of $10,000,000,000 by Germany would have far severer consequences than the $1,000,000,000 paid by France in 1871.|$|E
