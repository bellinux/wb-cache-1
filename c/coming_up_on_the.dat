25|$|News, {{sport and}} {{detailed}} weather reports were presented on the half-hour. As of 6 August 2012 either Henry or Robinson also presented news headlines on the quarter-hour. In addition Metropolitan viewers also received regular traffic updates for their respective city from SUNA traffic. Until 3 August 2012 after the 8:30am news, the hosts crossed to Yumi Stynes, Gorgi Coghlan or another Circle guest host {{to find out}} what was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Circle. The hosts were joined by Wendell Sailor and Roger Oldridge respectively to preview and review NRL and AFL matches Monday and Friday mornings at 6:40am during the respective seasons. Viewers were able to express their views by phoning the Henry Hotline, a talkback radio style segment; these calls were replayed later in the show.|$|E
25|$|After Ayres's {{division}} {{had captured}} the return, Warren again went {{to search for}} Crawford. He found Crawford's division in good order {{on the east side}} of the Boisseau farm, facing west. Unfortunately for Warren, Sheridan asked for Warren at about this time and no one could say where he was. Sheridan then ordered Griffin to take command of the corps. Meanwhile, Warren ordered Crawford to wheel to the left and drive south against Five Forks because Warren perceived that the Confederates still held the crossroads because of artillery fire coming from that direction. Coulter's brigade led the attack on the left of Ford's Road with Kellogg's and Baxter's brigades and four of Bartlett's separated regiments <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. From woods on the south of the Boisseau farm, the Confederates fired steadily on the Union battle line. Three companies of the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment routed a patrol of Rosser's cavalry across Hatcher's Run before rejoining their regiment. Warren assigned the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment and the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment to watch the ford across Hatcher's Run.|$|E

500|$|Just as Exmouth was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{group at}} 20:45, Audacious heeled sharply, paused, and then capsized. She floated upside {{down with the}} bow raised until 21:00, when an {{explosion}} occurred that threw wreckage [...] into the air, followed by two more. The explosion appeared {{to come from the}} area of 'B' magazine and was probably caused by one or more high-explosive shells falling from their racks and exploding, then igniting the cordite in the magazine. A piece of armour plate flew [...] and killed a petty officer on Liverpool. This was the only casualty in connection with the sinking.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah faced a {{field of}} 10 horses, most of whom, {{including}} Keen Ice, he had previously defeated. [...] Espinoza had concerns at the starting gate when he noticed that his mount was already sweating, even though the weather was not particularly hot. [...] While the horse led {{for much of the}} race, he was hard-pressed throughout by Frosted, a change from Frosted's previous stalking style, attributed to a rider change less than an hour before the race, when Jose Lezcano replaced an injured Joel Rosario, altering the [...] "complexion" [...] of the race. [...] The unexpected tactics of Lezcano may have been decisive. Espinoza stated that he [...] "knew he was in trouble" [...] by the half-mile pole because American Pharoah did not pull away from his rival and lacked his usual energy. Frosted challenged American Pharoah for the lead at the far turn, and the horses bumped several times, but American Pharoah dug in and fought back when Frosted took a very brief lead. While American Pharoah fended off the challenge from Frosted, Keen Ice was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside, also under a new jockey, Javier Castellano. They overtook American Pharoah at the sixteenth pole, going on to defeat him by three-quarters of a length. Once again the Saratoga track lived up to its reputation.|$|E
500|$|Although the two fleets {{both had}} eight ships in their lines, the British had an {{advantage}} in firepower: the 90-gun [...] was the largest ship of either fleet (compared to the 84-gun Duc de Bourgogne), while the French fleet also included the recently captured 44-gun Romulus, the smallest vessel on either line. [...] When Arbuthnot spotted the French fleet to his northeast at 6 am on March 16, they were about [...] east-northeast of Cape Henry. [...] Arbuthnot came about, and Destouches ordered his ships to form a line of battle heading west, with the wind. [...] Between 8 and 9 am the winds began shifting, but visibility remained poor, and the two fleets manoeuvred for several hours, each seeking {{the advantage of the}} weather gage. [...] By 1 pm the wind had stabilised from the northeast, and Arbuthnot, with superior seamanship, was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear of the French line as both headed east-southeast, tacking against the wind. [...] Destouches, in order to escape this position, gave orders to wear ship in sequence, and brought his line around in front of the advancing British line. [...] With this manoeuvre he surrendered the weather gage (giving Arbuthnot the advantage in determining the attack), but it also positioned his ships relative to the wind such that he could open his lower gundecks in the heavy seas, which the British could not do without the risk of water washing onto the lower decks.|$|E

2500|$|Equipment {{utilized}} by competitors {{in this class}} may include sighted guides, guide rails, beeping balls and clap sticks. The use of a sighted guide by people in this class {{is dependent on the}} specific requirements of the sport. Para-alpine and para-Nordic skiers use guides, with the guide for B1 skiers generally skiing behind the skier in order to maximize the ability of the skier to hear the guide. [...] The guide tells the skier things like when weight should be shifted, elements <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> course, and how to position themselves to maximize the diagonal run of the course. In cycling, this classification also uses a guide, utilizing a tandem bicycle with the guide sitting at the front.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Simplicity {{and more}} {{intelligence}} in its functionality are key {{features of the}} Magneto Rheological Fluid (MRF) technology. This technology is an old “newcomers ” <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> rapidly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> research and commercial front. In this paper, Magneto Rheological fluid samples are prepared. In this, silicone oil {{is used as a}} carrier fluid and is mixed with micron sized iron particles. In order to reduce the sedimentation, white lithium grease is also mixed as an additive in the fluid sample. An experimental setup consisting of an electrical stirrer with speed control unit is designed and developed and fabricated for preparation of the fluid samples. The observations of the surface morphology of iron particles were carried out using digital scanning electron microscope (SEM). The sedimentation properties are studied by visual inspection. The off-state rheological properties e. g. viscosity and shear stress variation with respect to shear rate of the fluid samples are investigated and are measured with a rotational rheometer...|$|R

60|$|We rode {{down the}} ridge {{to the left}} of Middle Canyon, and had trouble with the hounds all the way. First they ran foul of a coyote, which was the one and only beast they could not resist. Spreading out to head them off, we separated. I cut into a hollow and rode to its head, where I went up. I heard the hounds and {{presently}} saw a big, white coyote making fast time through the forest glades. It looked as if he would cross close in front of me, so I pulled Foxie to a standstill, jumped off and knelt with my rifle ready. But the sharp-eyed coyote saw my horse and shied off. I had not much hope to hit him so far away, and the five bullets I sent after him, singing and zipping, served only to make him run faster.

40|$|Automotive {{engineering}} is {{looking back on}} more than 120 years of history. Most of this time was marked by mechanical design improvements. In recent years, electronics {{is more and more}} dominating the formerly mechanical cars, for now more in the sense of optimizing the mechanical functions than replacing them by new mechatronic solution principles. This is however foreseeable for the future, with completely new concepts <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ongoing electrification of the drive system. Mechanical engineering as such has a much longer history, with engineering design methodology research entering the scene around 150 years ago. Also in design methodology, mechanical thinking has been predominant over most of the time. Later developments have led to standardized mechatronics-focused process models, which are however not consistently applied in industrial practice, yet. This paper investigates how state-of-the-art systems engineering methodology can be brought closer together with engineering practice, focusing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> example of automotive engineering. It identifies gaps and proposes steps towards a better theory/practice fit of engineering methodology. In a first step, chapters 2 and 3 analyze mechatronic systems engineering in theory and automotive engineering in practice, respectively. This is done based on observations at German and Swedish car manufacturers...|$|R
