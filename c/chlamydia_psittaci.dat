40|$|<b>Chlamydia</b> (C.) <b>psittaci</b> is a {{zoonotic}} pathogen with a {{wide range}} of avian hosts and worldwide geographical spread. Zoonotic transfer occurs by inhalation or direct contact and may cause psittacosis or parrot disease. Host reservoirs of particular epidemiological interest include gregarious or migratory species, as colonial behaviour facilitates microbial spread amongst conspecifics and a migratory ecology permits disperse over a wide geographic region. The current study detected C. psittaci antibodies in 76 of 81 (93. 8 %) feral Canada geese (Branta canadensis) using a species-specific ELISA. Viable C. psittaci were isolated from pharyngeal swabs of 47 of 81 (58 %) birds and subsequent ompA-based genotyping revealed genotypes E, B and E/B. Absence of clinical symptoms in these geese could reflect a strong natural protection or a persistent infection. Canada geese are considered an important alien species in Europe.

40|$|<b>Chlamydia</b> (C.) <b>psittaci,</b> {{formerly}} known as Chlamydophila psittaci infections cause important economical losses to the poultry industry and are a danger to public health. The economic and zoonotic impact of C. psittaci infections in the Western poultry industry is well documented. Less is known on its occurrence in Asia. In the following review we address C. psittaci infections in Chinese poultry in view of China supplying 40. 8 % of global egg production and 14. 2, 69. 3 and 91. 1 % of global chicken, duck and goose meat, respectively. The current paper compiles English and Chinese scientific literature on C. psittaci infections in Chinese poultry. The paper is focusing on seroprevalence, culture, direct antigen detection, molecular characterisation, observed symptoms, Chinese traditional medicine and psittacosis case reports. A review on the epidemiology of chlamydiosis in Chinese poultry clearly illustrates the widespread presence of virulent C. psittaci strains in chickens, ducks and geese across China. In Western countries, C. psittaci infections in poultry are principally treated with antibiotics.

40|$|Enteric infections {{caused by}} <b>Chlamydia</b> (C.) <b>psittaci</b> are {{frequent}} in ducks, but mostly remain subclinical under field conditions. To emulate natural infection, we investigated the pathogenic {{potential of a}} C. psittaci field strain in orally inoculated 4 -day-old ducklings. Three different challenge doses were tested and seven contact animals were also mock-inoculated with buffer in each group. Over the course of ten days, the birds were monitored for clinical symptoms and chlamydial dissemination before final examination of tissues using histopathology and immunohistochemistry. While the challenge strain disseminated systemically to all internal organs, mild signs of diarrhea were confined to ducklings inoculated with the highest dose (4. 3 x 108 IFU/mL, Group 1). No other clinical symptoms or histopathological lesions were seen. The chlamydial load in internal organs as measured by PCR depended on the challenge dose and was unevenly distributed, i. e. high loads in spleen, liver, and distal small and large intestinal tract (ileum, cecum and rectum) vs. ten times lower values in lungs and proximal small intestinal tract (duodenum and jejunum). Notably, the C. psittaci infection of contact birds became evident on day 10 post-infection, with bacterial loads {{comparable to those of}} experimentally-infected animals, thus suggesting rapid bird-to-bird transmission of the challenge strain...|$|R

In this prospective study, intrabronchial inoculation of 10 (8) inclusion-forming units of C. psittaci (n =  21 calves) led to reproducible acute respiratory illness (of approximately one week), accompanied by a systemic inflammatory reaction with an innate immune response dominated by neutrophils. Excretion and/or exhalation of the pathogen was sufficient to transmit the infection to naïve sentinel calves (n =  3) co-housed with the infected animals. Sentinel calves developed mild to subclinical infections only. Notably, excretion of the pathogen, predominantly via feces, occurred more frequently in animals naturally exposed to C. psittaci (i. e. sentinels) as compared to experimentally-inoculated calves.

Despite recent progress, our knowledge about immune response mechanisms capable of counteracting the infection and preventing its detrimental effects is still limited. A well-established model of bovine acute respiratory <b>Chlamydia</b> (C.) <b>psittaci</b> infection was used here to characterize the kinetics of the local and systemic immune reactions in calves. In the course of two weeks following inoculation, leukocyte surface marker expression was monitored by flow cytometry in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Immune-related protein and receptor transcription were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR in blood, BALF and lung tissue. An early increase of IL 2 RA, IL 10 and HSPA 1 A mRNA expressions was followed by a rise of lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes exhibiting activated phenotypes in blood. Monocytes showed elevated expression rates of CD 11 b, CD 14 and MHC class II. The rates of CD 62 L expression on CD 8 hi T cells in blood and on CD 4 + T cells in BALF were also augmented and peaked between 2 and 4 dpi. Notably, CD 25 antigen expression was significantly elevated, not only on CD 8 dim/CD 62 L+ and CD 8 -/CD 62 L+ cells in blood, but also on granulocytes in blood and BALF between 2 - 3 dpi.

In the present study, knockout mice lacking C 3 and thus all main complement effector functions were intranasally infected with C. psittaci strain DC 15. Clinical parameters, lung histology, and cytokine levels were determined. A subset of infections was additionally performed with mice lacking C 5 or C 5 a receptors. Complement activation occurred before symptoms of pneumonia appeared. Mice lacking C 3 were ∼ 100 times more susceptible to the intracellular bacteria compared to wild-type mice, with all C 3 (-/-) mice succumbing to infection after day 9. At a low infective dose, C 3 (-/-) mice became severely ill after an even longer delay, the kinetics suggesting a so far unknown link of complement to the adaptive, protective immune response against chlamydiae. The lethal phenotype of C 3 (-/-) mice {{is not based on}} differences in the anti-chlamydial IgG response (which is slightly delayed) as demonstrated by serum transfer experiments. In addition, {{during the first week of}} infection, the absence of C 3 was associated with partial protection characterized by reduced weight loss, better clinical score and lower bacterial burden, which might be explained by a different mechanism.

50|$|<b>Chlamydia</b> <b>psittaci</b> {{is a small}} {{bacterium}} (0.5 micrometres) that undergoes several transformations {{during its}} life cycle. It exists as an elementary body (EB) in between hosts. The EB is not biologically active, but is resistant to environmental stresses and can survive outside a host. The EB travels from an infected bird to the lungs of an uninfected bird or person in small droplets, and is responsible for infection. Once in the lungs, the EB is taken up by cells in a pouch called an endosome by a process called phagocytosis. However, the EB is not destroyed by fusion with lysosomes, as is typical for phagocytosed material. Instead, it transforms into a reticulate body and begins to replicate within the endosome. The reticulate bodies must {{use some of the}} host's cellular machinery to complete its replication. The reticulate bodies then convert back to elementary bodies, and are released back into the lung, often after causing the death of the host cell. The EBs are thereafter able to infect new cells, either in the same organism or in a new host. Thus, the life cycle of C. psittaci is divided between the elementary body which is able to infect new hosts, but can not replicate, and the reticulate body, which replicates, but is not able to cause new infection.|$|E

To evaluate organism viability, we extracted RNA, reverse transcribed it, and subjected it to quantitative real-time PCR. We found that 71 (70. 3 %) villagers were in-fected. ArrayTube sensitivity was 91. 7 % and specificity was 100 % compared with that of real-time PCR. Concordance between genotypes detected by microarray and ompA ge-notyping was 100 %. Species distribution included 54 (76 %) single infections with <b>Chlamydia</b> trachomatis, C. <b>psittaci,</b> C. suis, or C. pecorum, and 17 (24 %) mixed infections that in-cludied C. pneumoniae. Ocular infections were caused by 5 Chlamydiaceae species. Additional studies of trachoma pathogenesis involving Chlamydiaceae species other than C. trachomatis and their zoonotic origins are needed. Trachoma was first recognized as an ocular disease in the 27 th century BC in China (1). Subsequent reports docu-mented the disease among the Egyptians and Greeks in the 19 th and 1 st centuries BC, respectively. The word trachoma derives from the Greek word for rough swelling, referring to the follicles that appear on the tarsal conjunctiva. Epidemic trachoma was spread from the Middle East to Europe during the Crusades and was a major cause of blindness during the Napoleonic era (1). The disease was eliminated from most industrialized countries after the industrial revolution, which heralded the institution of improved sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition. Currently, trachoma prevalence is hypoendemic, mesoendemic, and hyperendemic among populations resid-ing in tropical developing countries. During the past few decades, rates of trachoma have increased; in response, at the end of the 1990 s, the World Health Organization developed the SAFE program with the goal of eliminating blinding trachoma by the year 2020. SAFE refers to Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvements, specifically, surger...|$|R
