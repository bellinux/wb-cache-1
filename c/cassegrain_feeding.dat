50|$|The 8.8 m {{diameter}} parabolic antenna, using a <b>Cassegrain</b> antenna <b>feed,</b> had a 0.4° beamwidth and {{a gain of}} 51 dB.

50|$|To avoid {{spillover}} {{from the}} effects of over-illumination of the main reflector surface and diffraction, a microwave absorber is sometimes employed. This lossy material helps prevent excessive side-lobe levels radiating from edge effects and over-illumination. Note {{that in the case of}} a front-fed <b>Cassegrain</b> the <b>feed</b> horn and feeder (usually waveguide) need to be covered with an edge absorber in addition to the circumference of the main paraboloid.|$|R
2500|$|Cassegrain– In a <b>Cassegrain</b> antenna, the <b>feed</b> {{is located}} on or behind the dish, and radiates forward, {{illuminating}} a convex hyperboloidal secondary reflector at {{the focus of the}} dish. The radio waves from the feed reflect back off the secondary reflector to the dish, which forms the outgoing beam. An advantage of this configuration is that the feed, with its waveguides and [...] "front end" [...] electronics {{does not have to be}} suspended in front of the dish, so it is used for antennas with complicated or bulky feeds, such as large satellite communication antennas and radio telescopes. Aperture efficiency is on the order of 65–70% ...|$|R
