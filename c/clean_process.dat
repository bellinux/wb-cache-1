6000|$|I {{once knew}} {{a little girl}} who said she could not bear spring-water; she did not think it was clean, coming out of the ground in that way. I asked her if she liked well-water; but she thought that was worse yet, {{especially}} when it was hauled up in old buckets. River-water she would not even consider, for that was too much exposed to all sorts of dirty things to be fit to drink. I then wished to know what kind of water she did like, and she answered, readily enough, [...] "hydrant-water." [...] I don't know where she imagined hydrant-water came from, but she may have thought it was manufactured, by some <b>clean</b> <b>process,</b> out at the water-works.|$|E

5000|$|According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), wet {{cleaning}} {{is the most}} environmentally sensitive professional method of garment cleaning. It does not use hazardous chemicals, it does not generate hazardous waste, nor does the process create air pollution and it reduces the potential for water and soil contamination. The specialized detergents and conditioner used in the wet <b>clean</b> <b>process</b> are milder than home laundry products. All of the products are disposed of down the drain and easily handled by the local waste water treatment facility. [...] For professional cleaners, wet-cleaning is argued to offer several advantages, such as lowered costs for start-up capital, supplies, equipment and hazardous waste disposal, as well as less reliance on skilled labor.|$|E

5000|$|Welding: Processes such as gas metal {{arc welding}} and {{shielded}} metal arc welding cannot be used, due to the deposition of impure material and potential introduction of voids or porosity. Gas tungsten arc welding (with an appropriate heat profile and properly selected filler material) is necessary. Other <b>clean</b> <b>processes,</b> such as electron beam welding or laser beam welding, are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential slag inclusions (such as submerged arc welding and Flux-cored arc welding) are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.|$|R
50|$|Siting of the {{individual}} ROFs north and west of this line was of vital importance. ROFs involved with explosive manufacture or filling needed, on safety grounds, to be located away from centres of population. However they needed access to good transport links, such as railways; the availability of adequate workers within reasonable travelling distance; a plentiful guaranteed supply of <b>clean</b> <b>process</b> water; and (to avoid the danger of frozen explosives) tended to be located at or just above sea Level.

50|$|A less {{commonly}} used thermal oxidizer {{technology is a}} thermal recuperative oxidizer. Thermal recuperative oxidizers have a primary and/or secondary heat exchanger within the system. A primary heat exchanger preheats the incoming dirty air by recuperating heat from the exiting clean air. This is done by a shell and tube heat exchanger or a plate heat exchanger. As the incoming air passes {{on one side of}} the metal tube or plate, hot clean air from the combustion chamber passes on the other side of the tube or plate and heat is transferred to the incoming air through the process of conduction using the metal as the medium of heat transfer. In a secondary heat exchanger the same concept applies for heat transfer, but the air being heated by the outgoing <b>clean</b> <b>process</b> stream is being returned to another part of the plant - perhaps back to the process.|$|E
