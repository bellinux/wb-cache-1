40|$|Abstract | In this paper, a Fiduccia-Mattheyses (FM) {{algorithm}} {{incorporating a}} novel initial partition gen-erating method is proposed. The proposed algorithm applies to both bipartitioning and multi-way partition-ing problems with or <b>without</b> <b>replication.</b> The initial partition generating method {{is based on}} a gradient de-cent algorithm. On partitioning <b>without</b> <b>replication,</b> our algorithm achieves an average of 17 % improve-ment over the analytical method, PARABOLI, on bi-partitioning, 10 % better than Primal Dual method on 4 -way partitioning and 51 % better than net-based method. On partitioning allowing replication, our al-gorithm achieves an average of 23 % improvement over the directed Fiduccia-Mattheyses algorithm on Repli-cation Graph (FMRG) method on bipartitioning...|$|R
