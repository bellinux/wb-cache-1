25|$|The {{suspension}} of the 2CV was very soft; a person could easily rock the car side to side dramatically. The swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system with inboard front brakes had a much smaller unsprung mass than existing <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> or leaf spring designs. The design was modified by Marcel Chinon.|$|E
25|$|Most plough makers {{offer an}} {{automatic}} reset system for tough conditions or rocky soils. The re-set mechanism allows each body to move rearward and upward to pass over obstacle (e.g. rocks hidden below soil surface) without damage. A heavy leaf or <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> mechanism, which holds {{the body in}} its working position under normal conditions, resets the plough after the obstruction is passed.|$|E

25|$|<b>Coil</b> <b>spring</b> {{independent}} suspension features {{by way of}} a MacPherson strut type with stabilizer and strut bar up front, and a MacPherson rear setup with parallel lower arms. Steering uses a rack and pinion design; braking hardware is made up of front ventilated discs and rear drums with a double proportioning valve to suppress lock-up. Innovatively, a sensor is fitted to detect worn-out brake pads, alerted by use of an audible chime.|$|E
25|$|The Model S has {{independent}} <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> suspension on {{all four}} wheels front double wishbone, virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink. As an extra-cost option, the car is available with self-leveling, height-adjustable air suspension. This is accomplished via adjustable Bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver. The car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain, despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{independent}} {{double wishbone}} suspension was employed at all four corners. Another significant change {{made from the}} P61 design was to move the suspension shock absorber components outboard at the rear. This switch was initially made to accommodate the extra cam-cover space needed to employ the 32-valve motor, but though that unit was shelved the suspension geometry was retained. At the front, the <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and damper units were retained within the monocoque skin, resulting in a clean, aerodynamic profile around the car's nose-cone. Braking was by outboard-mounted, Dunlop disc brakes all round.|$|E

25|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> between the two control arms, seated on the lower wishbone arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings {{in and out of the}} mounting brackets.|$|E
25|$|Aesthetically and aerodynamically the T51 was {{a natural}} {{development}} of the T43 and T45 cars that had given Cooper their first two wins. The Coopers continued their practice of building spaceframe chassis that ignored orthodox design thinking in having several curved links and the rear-engine layout meant weight savings and aerodynamic advantages over the front-engined cars, which typically had separate gearbox and differential cases, and had to find room for propshafts to the rear wheels. Also {{the location of the}} fuel tanks {{on either side of the}} cockpit rather than at the rear meant the car handled more consistently with different fuel loads, a vital factor during races which lasted up to three hours. One notable throwback, however, was the car's leaf spring rear suspension, although it used a more modern <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and wishbone setup at the front.|$|E
25|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had a Type 90 57mm cannon as {{its main}} armament, with one machine {{gun in the}} front hull glacis and another located in a small rear turret. The armour was riveted steel plates with a minimum {{thickness}} of 6mm and a maximum of 17mm. The engine compartment was located {{in the middle of}} the hull and the tank was powered by a V8 gasoline engine. The tank chassis had a complex parallelogram suspension system with two pairs of road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement. Hara later designed a bell crank scissors suspension which paired the bogie wheels and connected them to a <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on the majority of the subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|E
50|$|While <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> {{were invented}} in the 15th century, {{they were not}} used in {{mattresses}} until the mid-late 19th century, following the use of upholstery <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> in furniture and carriages.|$|R
40|$|Ceramic <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{components}} in mechanical systems under harsh chemical conditions and high temperatures. In real applications of ceramic <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> knowing the effect of sintering temperature on their microstructure and strength distribution plays a crucial role. In this paper, the microstructure and strength distribution of alumina <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> sintered at 1550, 1600 and 1650 °C are investigated. Strength data of alumina <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> are fitted by a Weibull distribution and according to the coefficient of determination, the deviation from the Weibull distribution can be determined. It is shown that the Weibull distribution best fits the strength data of alumina <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> sintered at 1600 °C. The probable reasons for deviation from the Weibull distribution are discussed in terms of grain size, porosity, and R curve behaviour...|$|R
50|$|The front suspension, as {{with its}} predecessors, {{is of the}} double {{wishbone}} type with <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and an anti-roll bar while the rear suspension uses a solid axle with <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and a Panhard rod.|$|R
25|$|This period saw Land Rover {{market the}} utility Land Rover {{as a private}} {{recreational}} vehicle. While the basic pick-up, 4x4 and van versions were still working vehicles, the County 4x4s were sold as multi-purpose family vehicles, featuring improved interior trim and more comfortable seats. This change was reflected in Land Rover starting what had long been common practice in the car industry— detail changes and improvements to the County model {{from year to year}} in order to attract new buyers and to encourage existing owners to trade in for a new vehicle. These changes included different exterior styling graphics and colour options, and the introduction of new options, such as radio-cassette players, Rostyle wheels, headlamp wash and wipe systems, as well as accessories such as surfboard carriers and bike racks. The switch from leaf spring to <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> suspension was {{a key part of the}} new model's success. It offered improved off-road ability, load capacity, handling, and ride comfort.|$|E
25|$|The AC Ace LM Prototype was {{a single}} piece from the year 1958 with the unusual chassis number LM5000, which John Tojeiro {{designed}} {{on behalf of the}} brothers Hurlock specifically for the AC factory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and for further long distance racing]. The vehicle was only 737-kilogram and differed fundamentally from the standard model: it had a load-bearing, lightweight, tubular steel frame without the massive ladder structure, a new front axle with single wheel suspension, this time in the form of upper and lower triangular steering with <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> / shock units, and a newly designed pendulum axle at the rear. The open aluminium body was much flatter, with larger overhangs at the front and rear and aerodynamically rounded with a lowered down front and high tail. It was designed by the body builder Cavendish Morton. The engine/ transmission unit, a tuned production unit, came from the Bristol Type 100D2 / S. After a test ride on the Brooklands circuit, just a few kilometres from the AC factory, the prototype, which was not yet mature, completed two assignments in 1958: in June as a factory car in the Le Mans 24-hour race and in September in the Rudac Racing Team at the RAC Tourist Trophy at the Goodwood Circuit. Due to changes in the regulations, the car was no longer able to compete in the next-class category in the FIA - Sportscar World Championship. The 'Bristol' engine / gearbox unit went back there, the racing car was sold without drive and later rebuilt. It still exists today as a collector's item.|$|E
