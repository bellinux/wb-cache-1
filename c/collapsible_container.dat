40|$|A {{series of}} tests was carried out to {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} crash barrier designed to protect the occupants of an automobile from serious injury. The JPL barrier design is a configuration of empty aluminum beverage cans contained in a tear-resistant bag which, in turn, is encased in a <b>collapsible</b> <b>container</b> made of plywood and steel. Tests were conducted with a driven vehicle impacting the barrier. The basic requirements of NCHRP Report 153 were followed except that speeds of 30 mph rather than 60 mph were used. Accelerometer readings on the driver's helmet showed that the driver was never subjected to dangerous decelerations, and never experienced more than temporary discomfort. Also, all of the requirements of the cited report were met. An extrapolation of data indicated that the JPL barrier installed in front of a tree or telephone pole along a roadside would also have met the requirements at a speed of 40 mph...|$|E

50|$|Immediately {{following}} Pat's passage, the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki {{a disaster}} zone. In {{accordance with the}} FRANZ agreement, the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February 13. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February 15. The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair of schools and hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents. The {{lack of access to}} clean water prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February 12 to assist with restoration efforts. Immediate provisions of 600 water bottles were sent to the island on February 16. The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages. Through September 24, they provided over 100,000 litres of clean water. Distribution of 2,050 <b>collapsible</b> <b>containers</b> and 200 hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross's water pump.|$|R

Previous quarterly Technical Progress Reports have set forth the specific objectives of the program, and a discussion of these is not repeated here. Rather, this report discusses the technical progress made during the period April 1 - June 30, 1995. A final topical report on the SEEC, Inc. demonstration of its technology for the transporting of coal combustion residues was completed during the quarter, although final printing of the report was accomplished early in July, 1995. The SEEC technology involves the use of <b>Collapsible</b> Intermodal <b>Containers</b> (CIC`s) developed by SEEC, and the transportation of such containers - filled with fly ash or other coal combustion residues - on rail coal cars or other transportation means. Copies of the final topical report, entitled {open_quotes}The Development and Testing of <b>Collapsible</b> Intermodal <b>Containers</b> for the Handling and Transport of Coal Combustion Residues{close_quotes} were furnished to the Morgantown Energy Technology Center. The Rapid Aging Test colums were placed in operation during the quarter.

40|$|Tis article {{addresses}} the diﬀerent functions of anesthesia reservoir bag in a breathing system. A {{main purpose of}} the contribution was to explain complex interaction between the reservoir bag and fresh gas ﬂow during mechanical ventilation. The anesthesia reservoir bag is a <b>collapsible</b> gas <b>container</b> which is {{an essential component of}} most breathing systems. The anesthesia reservoir bag permits manual ventilation and acts as a visual or tactile indicator of spontaneous ventilation. The bag was excluded from traditional breathing system when the ventilator was in use. Discrepancies between the set and actual tidal volume can occur. However, on some anesthesia workstation systems, such as the Dräger Primus, the reservoir bag {{is an integral part of}} the breathing system during mechanical ventilation, where it serves as a reservoir for oxygen and anaesthetic gases. In mechanically ventilated patients, gases enter the bag from the fresh gas ﬂow during inspiration, when the decoupling valve closes. The safe administration of general anesthesia requires understanding of the technological advances in highly sophisticated anesthetic equipment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Disposal of coal {{combustion}} by-products (CCBs) in an environmentally sound manner {{is a major}} issue facing the coal and utility industries in the US today. Disposal into abandoned sections of underground coal mines may overcome many of the surface disposal problems along with added benefits such as mitigation of subsidence and acid mine drainage. However, many of the abandoned underground coal mines are located far from power plants, requiring long distance hauling of by-products which will significantly contribute {{to the cost of}} disposal. For underground disposal to be economically competitive, the transportation and handling cost must be minimized. This requires careful selection of the system and optimal design for efficient operation. The materials handling and system economics research addresses these issues. Transportation and handling technologies for CCBs were investigated from technical, environmental and economic points of view. Five technologies were found promising: (1) Pneumatic Trucks, (2) Pressure Differential Rail Cars, (3) <b>Collapsible</b> Intermodal <b>Containers,</b> (4) Cylindrical Intermodal Tanks, and (5) Coal Hopper Cars with Automatic Retractable Tarping. The first two technologies are currently being utilized in transporting by-products from power plants to disposal sites, whereas the next three are either in development or in conceptualization phases. In this research project, engineering design and cost models were developed for the first four technologies. The engineering design models are in the form of spreadsheets and serve the purpose of determining efficient operating schedules and sizing of system components...|$|R

40|$|SEEC, Incorporated, is {{developing}} a <b>collapsible</b> intermodal <b>container</b> (CIC{trademark}) designed for containment and transport of fly ash and other dry-flowable bulk commodities. The CIC is specially configured to ride in open top rail cars, but as an intermodal container, it also rides in barges and on flat bed trailers. This allows SEEC to use unit coal train back haul capacity to transport fly ash to markets at and near coal mines. SEEC`s goals for this project were to design a CIC for handling and transporting dry fly ash, and then demonstrate the CIC technology. During this project, SEEC has performed extensive initial design work, leading to the manufacture of three prototype CICs for demonstration. Preliminary tests to examine safety issues included finite element analyses and an overload test in which the CIC was lifted while carrying weight in excess of its rated capacity. In both cases, the CIC met all safety requirements. With the above information satisfying possible safety concerns in hand, SEEC worked with SIU and other cooperators to plan and carry out field demonstration and testing of three CICs. This demonstration/testing including filling the CICs with fly ash, transporting them in a coal hopper car, handling with standard intermodal equipment, and emptying by inverting (two CICs) and by vacuuming (one CIC). Results were very positive. Filling with fly ash, transporting, and intermodal handling went very well, as did emptying by vacuum. Emptying by inverting was less successful, {{but most of the}} problems were predicted ahead of time, and were mostly due to lack of fly ash fluidizing equipment as much as anything. Throughout the testing, valuable information was gathered that will greatly accelerate refinement of both the CIC and the system of CIC handling...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of switching from an open (glass or semi-rigid plastic) infusion container to a closed, fully <b>collapsible</b> plastic infusion <b>container</b> (Viaflex®) on rate and time to onset of central lineassociated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). An open-label, prospective cohort, active healthcare-associated infection surveillance, sequential study was conducted in three intensive care units in Brazil. The CLABSI rate using open infusion containers was compared to the rate using a closed infusion container. Probability of acquiring CLABSI was assessed over time and compared between open and closed infusion container periods; three-day intervals were examined. A total of 1125 adult ICU patients were enrolled. CLABSI rate was significantly higher during the open compared with the closed infusion container period (6. 5 versus 3. 2 CLABSI/ 1000 CL days; RR= 0. 49, 95 %CI= 0. 26 - 0. 95, p= 0. 031). During the closed infusion container period, the probability of acquiring a CLABSI remained relatively constant along the time of central line use (0. 8 % Days 2 - 4 to 0. 7 % Days 11 - 13) but increased in the open infusion container period (1. 5 % Days 2 - 4 to 2. 3 % Days 11 - 13). Combined across all time intervals, the chance of a patient acquiring a CLABSI was significantly lower (55 %) in the closed infusion container period (Cox proportional hazard ratio 0. 45, p= 0. 019). CLABSIs can be reduced with the use of full barrier precautions, education, and performance feedback. Our results show that switching from an open to a closed infusion container may further reduce CLABSI rate as well as delay the onset of CLABSIs. Closed infusion containers significantly reduced CLABSI rate and the probability of acquiring CLABSI...|$|R
