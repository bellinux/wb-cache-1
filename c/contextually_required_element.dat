30|$|In addition, {{we propose}} that {{psychological}} empowerment can predict employee proactive behavior. SDT suggests that individuals whose basic psychological needs (competence, relatedness and autonomy) are satisfied {{in the organization}} will exhibit <b>contextually</b> <b>required</b> behaviors. Researchers show that employees with autonomy (like self-determination) {{are more likely to}} engage in proactive behaviors, including problem-solving and idea implementation (Parker et al. 2006; Zhang 2010). In fact, previous research, such as the effects of psychological empowerment on feedback-seeking behavior and role expansion, has provided some evidence supporting this view (Axtell and Parker 2003; Parker et al. 1997).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The gene {{encoding}} cytosolic {{phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase}} (PEPCK) {{is expressed in}} multiple cell types in diverse tissues including liver, kidney, intestine, and white and brown adipose tissues. It can thus be considered a model system for examining the regulation of cell-specific transcription. The PEPCK gene is transcribed from a single start site, but studies of transgenic mice have revealed that distinct cis-acting elements (and thus different trans-acting factors) regulate PEPCK expression in hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, and adipocytes. Hepatocytes <b>require</b> <b>elements</b> between- 457 and + 69 bp; renal proximal tubule epithelia <b>require</b> <b>elements</b> between- 363 and + 69 bp; and adipocytes <b>require</b> <b>elements</b> between- 2086 and- 888 bp.
