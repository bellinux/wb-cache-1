40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the outcome of}} treatment for minimally displaced femoral neck fractures using multiple threaded pins versus sliding <b>compression</b> <b>screws</b> for internal fixation. METHODS: The medical records of 62 consecutive elderly patients with minimally displaced intra-capsular femoral neck fractures who underwent internal fixation of the fracture (37 with multiple threaded pins, and 25 with sliding <b>compression</b> <b>screws)</b> were reviewed. Clinical and radiological assessment of fracture healing at follow-up visits were noted. RESULTS: In the 55 patients seen for follow-up at 3 months, 21. 9 % (n= 7) of those treated by pinning demonstrated non-union of the fracture, and 0 % of fractures treated with sliding <b>compression</b> <b>screws</b> (p= 0. 02). 46 patients were seen for follow-up at one year, with 10 % (n= 2) of those treated with sliding <b>compression</b> <b>screws</b> found to have osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The 2 fractures in the group treated by pinning demonstrating non-union at 3 months failed to unite by one year (p= 0. 11). 34 patients were seen for follow-up for at least 2 years, with no additional complications noted. CONCLUSION: Using sliding <b>compression</b> <b>screws</b> to treat minimally displaced femoral neck fractures can achieve a higher union rate than using pinning. The reason may be the better stability in the osteoporotic bone. However, osteonecrosis of the femoral head may occur with use of sliding <b>compression</b> <b>screws</b> because of greater intramedullary vascular damage {{as a result of}} wider reaming...|$|R

50|$|His {{invention}} {{consisted of}} putting interruptions in the flighting of a <b>compression</b> <b>screw.</b> It was much {{like having a}} hanger bearing in a screw conveyor: there is no flighting on the shaft at that point, so material tends to stop moving and pile up.

The result is better dewatering and thus a more consistent press cake.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{clinical}} outcomes of patients with femoral neck fractures treated with the dynamic hip system blade (DHS-BLADE) or cannulated <b>compression</b> <b>screws.</b> Methods: Eighty-six patients with femoral neck fractures were treated by closed reduction internal fixation with a DHS-BLADE (n =  42; 18 males and 24 females; mean age: 56. 3 years (37 – 87)) or cannulated <b>compression</b> <b>screws</b> (n =  44; 20 males and 24 females; mean age: 53. 8 years (26 – 83)) between March 2011 and August 2013. The groups were compared with Harris hip score, operation time, surgical blood loss, incision size, hospital stay, and related complications. Results: The average follow-up time was 27 months (range, 24 – 36 months). There was no significant difference for the operation time, incision size, hospital stay, and Harris hip score between the groups. Also, no statistically significant differences in the rates of nonunion (4. 5 % vs. 0) and avascular necrosis of the femoral head (9. 1 % vs. 7. 1 %) were observed. However, the screw group experienced significantly less surgical blood loss (32. 4  ±  24. 7  ml) than the blade group (87. 2  ±  46. 6  ml; P =  0. 041). The incidence of femoral neck shortening above 10  mm in the screw group was significantly higher than that in the blade group (15. 9 % vs. 2. 4 %, P =  0. 031). The blade group had a significantly lower incidence of screw migration than the screw group (4. 8 % vs. 22. 7 %, P =  0. 016).

40|$|Abstract Background The dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> is a {{plate and}} screws implant used to treat {{fractures}} of the distal femur. The Biomet Matthews Nail is a new retrograde intramedullary nail designed as an alternative surgical option to treat these fractures. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the comparative endurance of both devices. Method The dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> (DCS) and Biomet Matthews Nail (BMN) were implanted into composite femurs, which were subsequently cyclically loaded using a materials testing machine. Simulated fractures were applied to each femur prior to the application of load. Either a Y type fracture or a transverse osteotomy was prepared on each composite femur using a jig to enable consistent positioning of cuts. Results The Biomet Matthews Nail demonstrated a greater endurance limit load over the dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> in both fracture configurations. Conclusion The distal locking screws pass through the Biomet Matthews Nail in a unique "cruciate" orientation. This allows for greater purchase in the bone of the femoral condyle and potentially improves the stability of the fracture fixation. As these fractures are usually in weak osteoporotic bone, the Biomet Matthews Nail represents a favourable surgical option in these patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the radiographic and clinical outcomes of the Frag-Loc(A (R)) <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> with palmar plate fixation on distal radius fractures that include a displaced dorsoulnar fragment. This retrospective comparative study enrolled 48 patients who had an unstable distal radius fracture and a dorsoulnar fragment that was more than 2 mm displaced and that had involvement of more than one-quarter of the articular surface. Twenty-six of the 48 patients were treated with a palmar locking plate without a Frag-Loc(A (R)) <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> (group 1) and the other 22 patients were treated with palmar locking plate with a Frag-Loc(A (R)) <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> to fix the dorsoulnar fragment (group 2). First, we reviewed all pre-surgical computerized tomographic (CT) scans. Second, we used the gap distance between the dorsoulnar and palmar fragment as seen on post-surgical axial and sagittal CT scans to determine outcome. The gap distance was measured at the point of maximum distance perpendicular to the plane of the main fracture line. Clinical outcomes were evaluated based on the patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) score; the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score; wrist active range of motion; and grip strength. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcome between the two groups. However, there were statistically significant differences in post-surgical gap distance. The mean post-surgical gap distances for group 1 were 1. 3 mm (range 0. 2 - 3. 8 mm) on axial CT scans and 1. 4 mm (range 0. 5 - 2. 4 mm) on sagittal CT scans, while the mean post-surgical gap distances for group 2 were 0. 7 mm (range 0. 7 - 1. 6 mm) and 0. 7 mm (range 0. 3 - 1. 1 mm). This study shows that the Frag-Loc(A (R)) <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> can reduce the gap distance between the dorsoulnar fragment and the distal radius, according to evaluation of post-surgical axial and sagittal CT scans. This result suggests that the Frag-Loc(A (R)) <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> is an effective and simple treatment option to immobilize a dorsoulnar fragment associated with distal radius fracture...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ender and Simon Weidner popularized {{the concept}} of closed condylocephlic nailing for intertrochanteric {{fractures}} in 1970. The clinical experience of authors revealed that Ender nailing alone cannot provide secure fixation in elderly patients with osteoporosis. Hence we conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy of a combined fixation procedure using Ender nails and a cannulated <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> for intertrochanteric fractures. Materials and Methods: 76 patients with intertrochanteric fractures were treated using intramedullary Ender nails and cannulated <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> from January 2004 to December 2007. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 80 years (range 70 - 105 years). Using the Evan&#x 2032;s system of classification 49 were stable and 27 unstable fractures. Inclusion criteria was high risk elderly patients (age > 70 years) with intertrochanteric fracture. The exclusion criteria included patients with pressure sores over the trochanteric region. Many patients had pre-existing co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, COPD, ischemic heart disease, CVA and coronary artery bypass surgery. The two Ender nails of 4. 5 mm each were passed across the fracture site into the proximal neck. This was reinforced with a 6. 5 mm cannulated <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> passed from the sub trochanteric region, across the fracture into the head. Results: The mean follow-up was 14 months (range 9 - 19 months) Average time to fracture union was 10 weeks (range 6 - 16 weeks). The mean knee ROM was 130 o (&# 177; 5 o). There was no case of nail penetration into hip joint. In five cases with advanced osteoporosis there was minimal migration of Ender nails distally. Conclusions: The Ender nailing combined with <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> fixation in cases of intertrochanteric fractures in high risk elderly patients could achieve reliable fracture stability with minimal complications...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the interfragmentary {{compression}} force across a simulated scaphoid fracture by two commonly used <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> systems; the Acutrak 2 Standard and the 3. 0 mm Synthes headless <b>compression</b> <b>screw.</b> METHODS: Sixteen (8 pairs; 6 female, 2 male) cadaver scaphoids were randomly assigned to receive either the Acutrak 2 or Synthes screw with the contralateral scaphoid designated to receive the opposite. Guide wires were inserted under fluoroscopic control. Following transverse osteotomy, the distal and proximal fragments were placed on either side of a custom load cell, to measure interfragmentary compression. Screws were placed under fluoroscopic control using the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommended surgical technique. Compressive forces were measured during screw insertion. Recording continued for an additional 60 s in order to measure any loss of compression after installation was complete. The peak and final interfragmentary compression were recorded and paired t-tests performed. RESULTS: The mean peak compression generated by the Acutrak 2 Standard was greater than that produced by the Synthes <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> (103. 9 ± 33. 2 N vs. 88. 7 ± 38. 6 N respectively, p = 0. 13). The mean final interfragmentary compression generated by the Acutrak 2 screw (68. 6 ± 36. 4 N) was significantly greater (p = 0. 04) than the Synthes screw (37. 2 ± 26. 8 N). Specimens typically reached a steady state of compression by 120 - 150 s after final tightening. CONCLUSION: Peak interfragmentary compression observed during screw installation was similar for both screw systems. However, the mean interfragmentary compression generated by the Acutrak 2 Standard was significantly greater. Our study demonstrates that the Synthes headless <b>compression</b> <b>screw</b> experienced a greater loss of interfragmentary compressive force from the time of installation to the final steady state compression level. The higher post-installation compression of the Acutrak 2 Standard may be attributable to the greater number of threads throughout the entire length of the screw. The clinical significance of these results, are, at this point uncertain.

Methods: Open reduction and internal fixation {{was performed on}} all patients. The fractures were anatomically reduced and held temporarily by K-wire. If the ends of fractures were atrophic, autologous bone graft from the ipsilateral iliac crest was packed between the ends. Then the fracture fragments were fixed with AO 6. 5 mm headless <b>compression</b> cannulated <b>screws.</b> At least two screws were used to provide rotational stability.

Results: All the patients were followed up for at least 12 months (range 12 - 25 months). All fractures achieved anatomical reduction and healed clinically and radiographically. At recent follow-up, the mean flexion degree was 120. 6 ° (range 110 °- 135 °) and the mean extension degree was 2. 5 ° (range 0 °- 5 °). The average visual analogue scale score was 1. 6 points (range 0 - 3). Six patients were assessed as excellent and 2 as good according to the hospital for special surgery knee score system. There were no superficial or deep infections, or hardware breakages. No patient had giving way or locking of the knee, though some had intermittent pain and swelling after strenuous exercise.

In a series of 16 patients of ununited ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures, the author advocated subtrochanteric valgus osteotomy with sliding <b>compression</b> <b>screws</b> for neck fractures, and dynamic compression plating with supplementary cancellous bone grafting for shaft fracture stabilization [15]. The author considered the surgical procedure to be relatively simple [15].|$|R
