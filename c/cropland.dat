30|$|Land Policy: Prior to 1978, {{there was}} no local {{ownership}} of the <b>croplands.</b> This was {{a major factor in}} low productivity of <b>croplands</b> as there was little motivation for locals to cultivate efficiently. In 1978, when the third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee in China took place, a directive for local management of <b>croplands</b> was proposed. This came into effect in 1985, triggering an increase in productivity of <b>croplands</b> and reducing the need to more land-uses of this type.|$|R

40|$|Globally, {{irrigated}} agriculture is both essential for food {{production and the}} largest user of water. A major challenge for hydrologic and agricultural research communities is assessing the sustainability of irrigated <b>croplands</b> under climate variability and change. Simulations of irrigated <b>croplands</b> generally lack key interactions between water supply, water distribution, and agricultural water demand. In this article, we explore the critical interface between water resources and agriculture by motivating, developing, and illustrating the application of an integrated modeling framework to advance simulations of irrigated <b>croplands.</b> We motivate the framework by examining historical dynamics of irrigation water withdrawals in the United States and quantitatively reviewing previous modeling studies of irrigated <b>croplands</b> {{with a focus on}} representations of water supply, agricultural water demand, and impacts on crop yields when water demand exceeds water supply. We then describe the integrated modeling framework for simulating irrigated <b>croplands,</b> which links trends and scenarios with water supply, water allocation, and agricultural water demand. Finally, we provide examples of efforts that leverage the framework to improve simulations of irrigated <b>croplands</b> as well as identify opportunities for interventions that increase agricultural productivity, resiliency, and sustainability...|$|R
5|$|In 2008 Timothy Searchinger, {{a lawyer}} from Environmental Defense Fund, {{concluded}} that ILUC affects {{the life cycle}} assessment and that instead of saving, both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. Ethanol from Brazilian sugarcane performed better, recovering initial carbon emissions in 4 years, while U.S. corn ethanol required 167 years and cellulosic ethanol required a 52 years payback period. The study limited the analysis a 30-year period, assuming that land conversion emits 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, China, and India were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur {{as a result of}} diverting U.S. corn <b>cropland,</b> and it was assumed that new <b>cropland</b> in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Barbara was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall during the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. The second storm of the season, Barbara developed from a small low pressure area on May 29 about 235miles (380km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The system drifted southward before turning to a steadily eastward motion, and quickly intensified into a tropical storm. Increased wind shear weakened Barbara, though it re-organized to attain peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) before moving ashore {{just west of the}} border of Mexico and Guatemala. It rapidly weakened over land, and on June 2 the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on the storm. Despite expectations that the storm would attain hurricane status, Barbara moved ashore as a small, weak tropical storm. It produced locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds, and in most locations damage was minor. However, in southern Mexico, the rainfall destroyed large areas of <b>cropland,</b> with crop damage totaling 200million pesos (2007MXN, $55million 2007USD). In El Salvador, four people were killed by storm-induced floods.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} inundation {{caused by}} Vera's storm surge submerged {{areas around the}} periphery of the bay for extended periods of time, with some low-lying areas remaining underwater in excess of four months. Due to the failure of multiple flood mitigation systems in quick succession, coupled with the narrow coverage of telecommunications exacerbated by Vera's strong winds, many persons in affected regions had very little time to evacuate. Nagoya {{was one of the worst}} impacted cities by Vera, and as a result of the storm surge and wind, its harbor was put out of service in under three hours. The effects of the typhoon's storm surge there were further worsened by the destruction of lumber yards in Nagoya Harbor, which set loose large quantities of logs that caused considerable damage to structures. The release of logs also hampered relief efforts following the typhoon's passage. Citywide, 50,000homes were severely damaged by flood waters, and 1,800other residences were washed away off of their foundations. Total damage to crops was estimated at US$30million. Rice crops sustained heavy impacts, with 150,000tons (135,000tonnes) of rice lost. In addition to the crop damage, US$2.5million worth of fruits and US$4million worth of vegetables were lost. The collapse of a single apartment home in the city buried 84people under debris; a similar incident in Naka, Ibaraki buried roughly 300people. Beach houses were destroyed, and large swaths of nearby <b>cropland</b> were heavily damaged. In addition to the storm surge, Nagoya experienced sustained winds of about 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching as high as 260km/h (160mph), downing power lines and causing power outage. Southeast of Nagoya, in Handa, Aichi, around 300people were killed after Vera's waves engulfed more than 250homes. Casualties throughout Aichi totaled 3,168 and roughly 59,000people were injured, based on an enumeration conducted in March1960.|$|E
40|$|When {{urban areas}} expand without {{concomitant}} increases in wastewater treatment capacity, {{vast quantities of}} wastewater are released to surface waters {{with little or no}} treatment. Downstream of many urban areas are large areas of irrigated <b>croplands</b> reliant on these same surface water sources. Case studies document the widespread use of untreated wastewater in irrigated agriculture, but due to the practical and political challenges of conducting a true census of this practice, its global extent is not well known except where reuse has been planned. This study used GIS-based modeling methods to develop the first spatially explicit estimate of the global extent of irrigated <b>croplands</b> influenced by urban wastewater flows, including indirect wastewater use. These <b>croplands</b> were further classified by their likelihood of using poor quality water based on the spatial proximity of <b>croplands</b> to urban areas, urban wastewater return flow ratios, and proportion of wastewater treated. This study found that 65 percent (35. 9 Mha) of downstream irrigated <b>croplands</b> were located in catchments with high levels of dependence on urban wastewater flows. These same catchments were home to 1. 37 billion urban residents. Of these <b>croplands,</b> 29. 3 Mha were located in countries with low levels of wastewater treatment and home to 885 million urban residents. These figures provide insight into the key role that water reuse plays in meeting the water and food needs of people around the world, and the need to invest in wastewater treatment to protect public health...|$|R
40|$|The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), {{initiated}} by the Conservation Title of the Food Security Act of 1985, is the primary federal program to control nonpointsource pollution in agricultural watersheds of the United States. However, the program is designed primarily to reduce soil erosion rather than to retire <b>croplands</b> in a manner optimal for controlling runoff of sediment and associated pollutants. This study estimates potential enrollment of streamside and floodplain <b>croplands</b> in this ten-year retirement program in order to gauge {{the potential of the}} CRP as a water-quality improvement policy. A contingent choice survey design was employed in Fayette County, Illinois, to demonstrate that there is substantial potential for retirement of streamside and floodplain <b>croplands</b> in the CRP. Enrollments in each program climb from less than 6 % to over 83 % of eligible <b>croplands</b> as the annual rental rate is increased from $ 20 to $ 200 /acre. Potential retirement of streamside and floodplain <b>croplands</b> declines, however, if tree planting, drainage removal, or a 20 -year contract are required. The potential of a CRP-based water-quality program to improve water quality and aquatic ecosystems in agricultural watersheds is thus substantial but constrained by the economic trade-offs that farmers make between crop production and conservation incentives in determining the use of their riparian lands...|$|R
40|$|Grasslands host a high {{diversity}} {{of plant and}} animal species. In Serbia, most alkali grasslands are located in the province of Vojvodina. The majority are not subject to conservation. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the relationship between the proportion of <b>croplands</b> and (1) the number of breeding species and (2) the number of breeding pairs in the alkali grasslands of the upper Mostonga River catchment basin (NW Serbia). The size of the study area was 400 ha. Birds were surveyed along seven parallel transects eight times per breeding season. Lengths of the cross sections of both grasslands and <b>croplands</b> were measured. The proportion of <b>croplands</b> per transect was calculated by dividing the total length of cross sections of <b>croplands</b> by the total length of transect. The relationship between the proportion of <b>croplands</b> and the number of breeding pairs and the number of breeding species, respectively, was studied using simple linear regression. We recorded a total of 171 nesting pairs belonging to 23 species in the alkali grassland investigated, with breeding densities between 2. 2 and 10. 3 pairs per 10 ha. The number of species per transect ranged between 6 and 11. The most abundant species were Skylark Alauda arvensis, Yellow Wagtail Motacilla flava and Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra. The numbers of breeding pairs (F 6 = 21. 761, P < 0. 0001) and of breeding species (F 6 = 13. 758, P = 0. 001) were both influenced negatively by the proportion of <b>croplands.</b> These findings highlight the need for coordinated conservation measures on the alkali grasslands of Vojvodina...|$|R

40|$|<b>Croplands</b> cover 12 % of the {{ice-free}} land {{surface and}} {{play an important}} role in the global carbon cycle. Light use efficiency (LUE) models have often been employed to estimate the exchange of CO 2 between <b>croplands</b> and the atmosphere. A key parameter in these models is the maximum light use efficiency (ε*), but estimates of ε* vary by at least a factor 2. Here we used 12 agricultural eddy-flux measurement sites in North America and Europe to constrain LUE models in general and ε* in particular. We found that LUE models could explain on average about 70 % of the variability in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) when we increased the ε* from 0. 5 to 0. 65 - 2. 0 g C per MJ Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR). Our results imply that <b>croplands</b> are more important in the global carbon budget than often thought. In addition, inverse modeling approaches that utilize LUE model outputs as a-priori input may have to be revisited in areas where <b>croplands</b> are an important contributor to regional carbon fluxes.
