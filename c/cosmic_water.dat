However, the distinction between motherhood and <b>cosmic</b> <b>water</b> later diversified and led to the separation of these identities, and Mut gained aspects of a creator goddess, since she was the mother from which the cosmos emerged.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{we compare}} {{specific}} humidity profiles derived from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) radio occultation (RO) from August to November 2006 {{with those from}} different types of radiosonde and from ECMWF global analysis. Comparisons show that COSMIC specific humidity data agree well with ECMWF analysis over {{different regions of the}} world for both day and night times. On the contrary, evaluation against COSMIC specific humidity shows a distinct dry bias of Shang-E radiosonde (China) and an obvious wet bias of VIZ-type (USA). No obvious specific humidity biases are found for MRZ (Russia) and MEISEI (Japan) radiosondes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of <b>COSMIC</b> <b>water</b> vapor for quantifying the dry/wet biases among different sensor types...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we review the cosmic image of water, from the theory of Gaston Bachelard, in two long poems of João Cabral de Melo Neto: O Rio ("The River") and O cão sem plumas ("The dog without feathers"). I will see the river as cosmic image of the {{helpless}} in "The River" and {{the first part of}} "The dog without feathers", Paisagem do Capibaribe, understanding that poetry is not a complaint, but these texts denouncing misery. This poems project the worldview of those who resist the rigor, not only hunger and social spoils, but the river. The creatures that inhabit this world are as far away, the neglected, ignored what society. In the river, these beings are confused with the lama, not just your bank or depth, but the margin between liquid and solid, between the filth and survival. The gift of the destitute is his strength. Thus, the different shades reaching <b>cosmic</b> <b>water</b> image helps us to perceive the existence deployments in the "helpless" than lyrical subjects are depicted in Brazilian poetry...|$|E
40|$|The Joe Cell, {{although}} simple in design, is {{an incredible}} device that is able to tap free energy from the universe {{that can be used}} to run a car. Many experimenters and researchers around the world have replicated the Joe Cell and maid claims about these <b>cosmic</b> <b>water</b> cells and their anomalies that can not be explained within our current scientific framework and understanding of physics. This article will present a theoretical explanation on how the Joe Cell might work. In order to understand the Joe Cell, we adopt a radical new view on electricity and charge that is not accepted by mainstream physics. But first let’s explain what a Joe Cell really is. The Joe Cell in its basic design is a set of three cylinders that is submerged in a canister of water. The outer cylinder is a positive terminal and the inner cylinder is a negative terminal with one or more neutral cylinders in the centre. When a 12 V DC power supply or car battery is connected an electrolyses process is initiated. When the power is disconnected after 5 minutes of charging, an anomalous ‘cosmic charging ’ of the cell continues for days. This process allegedly takes free energy from the universe and ‘stores...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the city}} of Eridu, Enki's temple was known as E2-abzu (house of the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters)</b> and was located {{at the edge of}} a swamp, an abzu. [...] Certain tanks of holy water in Babylonian and Assyrian temple courtyards were also called abzu (apsû). [...] Typical in {{religious}} washing, these tanks were similar to Judaism's mikvot, the washing pools of Islamic mosques, or the baptismal font in Christian churches.|$|R
5000|$|In Yasht 19 of the Avesta Apąm Napāt {{appears as}} the Creator of mankind. Here, {{there is an}} evident link between the glory of {{sovereignty}} (Khvarenah) and Apąm Napāt who protects Khvarenah as the royal glory of Iranian kings. Apām Napāt is sometimes, for example in Rigveda book 2 hymn 35 verse 2, described as the supreme creator deity who originates in the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters</b> (see: Agni). Apam Napat has a golden splendour and {{is said to be}} kindled by the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters.</b> The reference to fire may have originally referred to flames from natural gas or oil seepages surfacing through water, as in a fire temple at Surakhany near Baku in Azerbaijan (Jivanji Jamshedji Modi 1926). This Will-o'-the-wisp-like phenomenon would explain the otherwise puzzling concept of fire arising in water (fire and water being usually conceived of as opposing elements, with water the natural quencher of fire, rather than its engenderer). In this connection, there is a suggestive conjecture that the word [...] "naphtha" [...] came (via Greek, where it meant any sort of petroleum) from the name [...] "Apam Napat".|$|R
40|$|According to {{an ancient}} Hindu myth the goddess Earth was once imprisoned {{at the bottom of}} the ocean, in the nether world, by a demon who had laid waste to the earth, causing havoc to the order of things. To rescue her from the demon, Lord Vishnu incarnated as a boar, as Varaha Avatar. He fought and killed the demon and {{released}} the goddess Earth by carrying her on his tusk to float free once more on the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R
50|$|The act of {{creation}} was thought of {{in more than}} one manner. One of the oldest cosmogonic myth in the Rigveda (RV 10.121) had come into existence as a cosmic egg, hiranyagarbha (a golden egg). The Purusha Sukta (RV 10.90) narrates that all things were made out of the mangled limbs of Purusha, a magnified non-natural man, who was sacrificed by the gods. In the Puranas, Vishnu, {{in the shape of a}} boar, plunged into the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters</b> and brought forth the earth (Bhumi or Prithivi).|$|R
2500|$|In Hindu mythology Lord Vishnu is said {{to sleep}} while {{floating}} on the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters</b> on the serpent Shesha. In the Puranas Shesha holds all the planets of the universe on his hoods and constantly sings the glories of Vishnu from all his mouths. He is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Ananta-Shesha," [...] which means [...] "Endless Shesha". In the Samudra manthan chapter of the Puranas, Shesha loosens Mount Mandara for it {{to be used as a}} churning rod by the Asuras and Devas to churn the ocean of milk in the heavens in order to make Soma (or Amrita), the divine elixir of immortality. As a churning rope another giant serpent called Vasuki is used.|$|R
5000|$|Narayana {{engages in}} the {{creation}} of 14 worlds within the universe as Brahma when he deliberately accepts rajas guna. Narayana himself sustains, maintains and preserves the universe as Vishnu when he accepts sattva guna and annihilates the universe at the end of maha-kalpa as Shiva or Rudra when he accepts tamas guna. According to the Bhagavata Purana, Lord Narayana is the supreme controller and is supreme among deities, the ultimate soul. He is also called as Surya Narayana, one who shines like the brilliant sun. [...] He is said to pervade whatever is seen or heard in this universe from inside and outside alike. He is also mainly associated with the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters</b> of creation.|$|R
5|$|The Bhagavata Purana {{describes}} Naraka as {{beneath the}} earth: between the seven realms {{of the underworld}} (Patala) and the Garbhodaka Ocean, which is {{the bottom of the}} universe. It is located in the South of the universe. Pitrloka, where the dead ancestors (Pitrs) headed by Agniṣvāttā reside, is also located in this region. Yama, the Lord of Naraka, resides in this realm with his assistants. The Devi Bhagavata Purana mentions that Naraka is the southern part of universe, below the earth but above Patala. The Vishnu Purana mentions that it is located below the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters</b> {{at the bottom of the}} universe. The Hindu epics too agree that Naraka is located in the South, the direction which is governed by Yama and is often associated with Death. Pitrloka is considered as the capital of Yama, from where Yama delivers his justice.|$|R
5|$|The central Vishnu {{head and}} side heads of Varaha and Narasimha may be {{influenced}} by other configurations in architecture. For example, Vishnu, Varaha and Narasimha may be depicted on back (western) and side (northern/southern) walls of temples. Varaha (rescues the earth from the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters</b> at the beginning of an eon), Vishnu (as a human) and Narasimha (destroying a demon) may represent creation, preservation and destruction - the three functions in the Hindu universe. Vaikuntha Chaturmurti represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being, Creator of the Universe. Also, Varaha and Narasimha are oldest in antiquity (avatars Matsya and Kurma which are described in sacred texts to be appearing before Varaha and Narasimha were associated with Vishnu at a later date). Their presence in the iconography of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti suggests that this form originated in the Gupta era, where their cults were at their peak.|$|R

In June 2012 Makandal, together with Ayiti Fasafas, the Center for Traditional Music and Dance, and the Haiti Cultural Exchange, presented a memorial performance to Augustin in Brooklyn, New York. Other memorial projects in process include an annotated online archive (NEA 2013 Spring Grant Announcements, page 111) of his life and work, a biography, and ongoing performances and workshops that promote his style and aesthetic.|$|R
5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the <b>cosmic</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
50|$|They write how {{the solar}} {{magnetic}} field grew over twice {{as strong as}} before over the 20th century, and they peg this as a primary driver of the approximately 0.6 °C warming over that time.

40|$|Convective {{overshooting}} over tropical land is key {{contributor to}} troposphere-tostratosphere transport, known to inject adiabatically cooled air, trace gases, ice water and tropospheric air, {{in the lower}} stratosphere. But unexpectedly, all studies from radio-sondes, GPS <b>Cosmic</b> temperatures, MLS <b>water</b> vapor, ODIN-SMR N 2 O, HALOE CH 4 and CALIPSO aerosols, are showing much more intense convective uplift reaching 20 - 21 km during the austral summer over southern tropical continents compared to the northern tropics where they are limited to altitudes below the tropopause. The tentative explanation for that is the stronger and faster daytime heating and development of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) in the cleaner southern hemisphere compared to the dirty northern where the larger optical depth is attenuating the solar radiation. Shown in the presentation will be experimental evidence {{from a variety of}} observations of the stronger convective vigor in the southern tropics, a tentative explanation of the origin of the CAPE difference and, implications for relationship between pollution and climate...|$|R
50|$|Somayajulu {{is known}} to have done {{extensive}} researches on the physico-chemical reactions within the oceans and the water-sediment interface and has developed many research methodologies which include the nuclear methods for the determination of the growth rates of manganese nodules, advection-diffusion mixing of ocean <b>waters,</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray-produced 32Si and 10Be in studies for determining the calculation of sediment accumulation rates and geochemical methods for studying reactive elements in sea water. He conducted beryllium-10 studies on manganese nodules which helped establish the slow rate of growth of the nodules. His researches have been documented as chapter in a book, The Indian Human Heritage, and as several peer-reviewed articles, the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 100 of them. He has also edited a book, From Mantle to Meteorites: A Garland of Perspectives - A Festschrift for Devendra Lal, published by Indian Academy of Sciences in 1990 and his work has been cited by several authors.|$|R
40|$|Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC), {{consisting}} of six Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Global Position System (GPS) receivers, {{on board the}} Formosat Satellite 3 (FORMOSAT- 3) is providing dense observations of density, refractivity, temperature and water vapor profiles of the neutral atmosphere since middle of July 2006. Special radiosonde (Väisälä) campaign was conducted at Gadanki (13. 48 °N, 79. 18 °E), a tropical site in India, during July 2006 to March 2007 to validate these meteorological parameters. Co-located Nd: YAG Rayleigh lidar was also operated during the overpass of COSMIC and is utilized to validate the temperatures in the height range of 30 to 40 km. Atotal of 142 overpasses occurred during the above mentioned period within 300 km distance from Gadanki out of which 41 overpasses occurred within a time difference of ± 4 hours of radiosonde launch. In addition, 18 overpasses occurred within the time difference of ± 4 hours of lidar operation. A detailed comparison has been made with all these overpasses for the refractivity, temperature and water vapor obtained from <b>COSMIC.</b> The <b>water</b> vapor comparison has shown generally a good agreement with a mean difference of 5 - 10 % below 6 - 7 km. Although there is a colder bias between COSMIC and radiosonde, a very good comparison in temperature is also found between 10 and 27 km with a mean difference of less than 1 K (RMS difference is only 0. 64 K). There exists a large difference in temperature of about 8 K between 30 and 40 km (between COSMIC and lidar). Possible reasons for these large differences are given. There was one event that occurred just over Gadanki for which a detailed comparison has been made with special emphasis on water vapor retrievals. Sensitivity test is also done on the fractional difference in N for the event that occurred on 24 July 2006 between COSMIC (1 D-var) and radiosonde and found that pressure {{plays a key role}} than temperature in determining the refractivity...|$|R
