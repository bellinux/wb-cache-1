Based on {{the test}} data {{analysis}} and processing which are acquired from a solar energy/air source <b>compound</b> heat <b>pump</b> system in the actual building, the {{seasonal energy efficiency ratio}} under the two modes and the energy-saving rate are obtained.

Application of air source heat pump of traditional single heat source is constrained by the climatic conditions.

Solar Energy heat pump using single heat source is directly affected by solar radiation and rainy days so that it can only operate intermittently or need some auxiliary heat source.

50|$|Sublimation is a {{technique}} used by chemists to purify compounds. A solid is typically placed in a sublimation apparatus and heated under vacuum. Under this reduced pressure, the solid volatilizes and condenses as a purified compound on a cooled surface (cold finger), leaving a non-volatile residue of impurities behind. Once heating ceases and the vacuum is removed, the purified compound may be collected from the cooling surface.For even higher purification efficiencies a temperature gradient is applied, which also allows for the separation of different fractions. Typical setups use an evacuated glass tube that is gradually heated in a controlled manner. The material flow is from the hot end, where the initial material is placed, to the cold end that is connected to a pump stand. By controlling temperatures {{along the length of}} the tube the operator can control the zones of recondensation, with very volatile <b>compounds</b> being <b>pumped</b> out of the system completely (or caught by a separate cold trap), moderately volatile compounds recondensating along the tube according to their different volatilities, and non-volatile compounds remaining in the hot end.Vacuum sublimation of this type is also the method of choice for purification of organic compounds for the use in the organic electronics industry, where very high purities (often > 99.99%) are needed to satisfy the standards for consumer electronics and other applications.|$|R

A subset of participants in a wintertime engine performance study provided blood samples before and after pumping gasoline (30 using regular gasoline and 30 using E- 10). The biological and environmental samples were analyzed for selected aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in gasoline (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, m-/p-xylene, and o-xylene); the biological samples were also analyzed for three chemicals not found in gasoline (1, 4 -dichlorobenzene, chloroform, and styrene).

Strain MW 2 (USA 400 lineage) and other community methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains most commonly cause skin infections with abscess formation. Multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps contribute to antimicrobial resistance but may also contribute to bacterial survival by removal of environmental toxins.

To determine the role of these efflux pumps in a natural environment in the absence of antibiotics, we used strain MW 2 in a mouse subcutaneous abscess model and compared pump gene expression as determined by reverse transcription-PCR in the abscesses and in vitro. norB and tet 38 were selectively upregulated in vivo more than 171 - and 24 -fold, respectively, whereas norA and norC were downregulated. These changes were associated with an increase in expression of mgrA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator known to affect pump gene expression. In competition experiments using equal inocula of a norB or tet 38 mutant and parent strain MW 2, each mutant exhibited growth defects of about two- to threefold in vivo. In complementation experiments, a single-copy insertion of norB (but not a single-copy insertion of tet 38) in the attB site within geh restored the growth fitness of the norB mutant in vivo.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on {{the development of a new}} experimental apparatus that combines two powerful techniques: Chirped-Pulse Fourier-Transform Microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy and uniform supersonic flows. This combination promises a nearly universal detection method that can deliver quantitative isomer, conformer, and vibrational level specific detection; characterize unstable reaction products and intermediates; and perform unique spectroscopic, kinetics and dynamics measurements. Thus, a new high-power Ka band (26 – 40 GHz) chirped pulse spectrometer with sub-MHz resolution was designed and constructed. In order to study smaller molecules, E-band (60 – 90 GHz) capabilities were also added to the spectrometer. A novel strategy for generating a pulsed uniform supersonic flow through a Laval nozzle is introduced. A new high-throughput pulsed piezoelectric stack valve was constructed and used to produce a cold (20 K) uniform flow with large volumes and densities (~ 1016 molecules cm- 3). The uniform flow conditions for two of noble gases (argon and helium) were characterized using impact pressure measurements and rotational diagrams. It was demonstrated that a flow uniformity extending as far as 20 cm from the Laval nozzle exit can be achieved with a single <b>compound</b> turbo-molecular <b>pump</b> to maintain the operating pressure. Two benchmark reactive systems were used to illustrate and characterize the performance of the new apparatus CPUF: the photodissociation of SO 2 at 193 nm, for which the vibrational populations of the SO product are monitored, and the reaction between CN and C 2 H 2, for which the HCCCN product is detected in its vibrational ground-state. The results show that the combination also provides insight into the vibrational and rotational relaxation kinetics of the nascent reaction products. CPUF has been used to determine product branching in a multichannel reaction. This work, the CN + CH 3 CCH reaction was found to yield HCN via a direct H-abstraction reaction, while indirect addition/elimination pathways to HC 3 N, CH 3 C 3 N, and H 2 C 3 HCN were also probed. From these observations, quantitative branching ratios were established for all products as 12 (5) %, 66 (4) %, 22 (6) % and 0 (8) % into HCN, HC 3 N, CH 3 C 3 N, and H 2 C 3 HCN, respectively. The values are consistent with statistical calculations based on new ab initio results at the CBS-QB 3 level of theory.

40|$|The {{literature}} part of {{this thesis}} consists of a review of recently introduced forms of solid phase microextraction (SPME) : thin film microextraction (TFME), in-tube solid phase microextraction(IT-SPME) and the closely related techniques of capillary in tube adsorption trap/solid phase dynamic extraction (INCAT/SPDE). The experimental part covers the study of reagents for on-fiber derivatization of low molecular weight aliphatic amines in atmospheric concentrations. In TFME a thin film of sorbent is used for extraction instead of a rod-like sorbent as in fiber-SPME. This increases analyte uptake and capacity compared to fiber-SPME, making TFME suitable for non-equilibrium extraction. TFME is used with both gas and liquid chromatography, although the large size of the film presents problems in desorption, especially in gas chromatography. Common applications of TFME are environmental monitoring and in vivo extraction. IT-SPME is a dynamic type of SPME most often coupled with liquid chromatography, in which a liquid sample is pumped through an extraction capillary. It is relatively easily automated with most autosamplers. In {{the most common form}} a sorbent is coated on the inside walls of the capillary. Recently, packed types of IT-SPME have been introduced, which can achieve very high extraction efficiencies. In addition, sorbent materials which change their properties according to environmental factors such as temperature, potential and magnetic field seem promising for future development. INCAT/SPDE utilizes internally coated metal needles for extraction. Although similar to IT-SPME, it is used for sampling gaseous <b>compounds</b> by <b>pumping</b> them through the needle. Desorption and analysis is usually performed with a gas chromatograph. INCAT/SPDE has some advantages over fiber-SPME, such as larger sorbent volume and robustness. However, it is currently limited to only polydimethylsiloxane-based sorbents, which limits possible applications. In the experimental part, the possibilities of using allyl isothiocyanate, pentafluorobenzaldehyde(PFBAY) and pentafluorobenzyl chloroformate (PFBCF) in simultaneous extraction and on-fiber derivatization of low molecular weight aliphatic amines were explored. Separation and analysis was performed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Allyl isothiocyanate did not derivatize the analytes. On-fiber derivatization with PFBAY was successful for both ethylamine and methylamine, but the concentrations required to observe signal from the derivatives were too high to use PFBAY for air samples. PFBCF was identified as the most promising reagent, working for both dimethylamine and ethylamine. It was also possible to construct a calibration function for gaseous dimethylamine...|$|R
