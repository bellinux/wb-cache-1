Something decent and salt-of-the-earth-sounding. Rope-wranglers. Or knuckle-ringers. You should have asked your brother about it when you had the chance. You could have asked him how to get one around your neck while you were at it. Or is that more your sister’s speciality? You cannot give your sister <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> everything, old man; she did not persuade you to start tying such decent goddamned knots. You became all decent and honourable on your own. Give yourself <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> that much, at least...|$|R
