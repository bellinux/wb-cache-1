5|$|During the 1999 Marlboro 500 CART race, Canadian driver Greg Moore {{died in a}} crash {{along the}} backstretch of the track. It was {{determined}} that after sliding along the infield grass, Moore's car hit the edge of oncoming pavement, which caused the car to flip into a concrete retaining wall. The incident prompted the track owners, ISC, to pave the backstretch of both Auto Club Speedway and its sister track Michigan International Speedway {{in an attempt to}} prevent a similar accident. Shortly after the <b>crash,</b> <b>CART</b> mandated the use of a head-and-neck restraint system on all ovals. The rule eventually became mandatory on all tracks.|$|E
500|$|When Brian {{returns home}} to warn Peter about the {{consequences}} of this development, Peter reveals that he had regained his memory after Ernie the Giant Chicken hit him on the head with [...] "an odd number of objects" [...] earlier that day. Alerted by Brian's warnings, Peter rushes to reclaim Lois, just as Quagmire's plans had been delayed by guilt-induced impotence when Lois confessed that she [...] "trusts" [...] him. Peter then professes his love for her, and desire to be with her {{for the rest of his}} life, causing Lois to love him again. The two walk home, happy in their reunion, leaving Quagmire as he frustratedly attempts increasingly drastic measures to [...] "resuscitate" [...] his genitalia using: a penis pump, intravenous therapy, and a <b>crash</b> <b>cart</b> with a defibrillator in his closet.|$|E
50|$|The first cardiac <b>crash</b> <b>cart</b> {{was created}} in 1962 at Bethany Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas, home to the first Cardiac Care Unit in the country. The first <b>crash</b> <b>cart</b> was {{fabricated}} by the father {{of one of the}} doctors. It contained an Ambu bag, defibrillator paddles, a bed board and endotracheal tubes.|$|E
50|$|It may {{be stored}} in <b>crash</b> <b>carts</b> to {{counteract}} severe peripheral vasoconstriction secondary to extravasation of peripherally placed vasopressor infusions, typically of norepinephrine. Epinephrine infusions are less vasoconstrictive than norepinephrine as they primarily stimulate β receptor more than α receptors, but the effect remains dose-dependent.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crash</b> <b>carts</b> are {{a method}} of last resort in data centers which employ various forms of {{out-of-band}} management. In those cases it is used for equipment which {{does not support the}} requisite out-of-band infrastructure (OOBI) features or in cases where the OOBI devices (concentrators, switches, terminal servers, etc.) or services themselves have failed.|$|R
5000|$|Nevis Range, near Fort William, Scotland, a {{cable car}} was {{reported}} to have derailed and crashed to the ground seriously injuring all 5 passengers on 13 July 2006.

5000|$|Joel Judovich Nobel (December 8, 1934 - August 13, 2014) was an American {{anesthesiologist}} {{and patient}} safety advocate {{best known for}} founding the <b>crash</b> <b>cart</b> and ECRI Institute.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "crash cart" [...] {{can also}} {{refer to a}} {{bootable}} removable medium containing an operating system and any relevant software used to recover computer equipment (such as a server or PC) from a state of failure. This is done when such recovery is not possible using the computer's existing operating system and software. <b>Crash</b> <b>carts</b> in this sense are historically tape cartridges ("carts") or more recently, external or removable hard drives.|$|R
500|$|The episodes {{produced}} by Johnson and Vincent included Dr. Mercy exploiting a 125-year-old Civil War veteran {{and dealing with}} a strike by the doctors and nurses. Another episode saw Noland create a mythical patient and then claim that the patient died, {{the cause of death}} being the result of a lack of cardiac <b>crash</b> <b>carts</b> on each floor of the hospital. Johnson and Vincent's favorite episode was one where the X-rays of a professional footballer are misread, resulting in him being placed by mistake in [...] "Crutchfield's Traction", in which holes are drilled in his head and tongs inserted in them.|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{identify}} bacterial contamination {{rates of}} laryngoscope blades and handles stored in emergency <b>crash</b> <b>carts</b> by hospital and area {{according to the}} frequency of intubation attempts. Methods One hundred forty-eight handles and 71 blades deemed ready for patient use from two tertiary hospitals were sampled with sterile swabs using a standardized rolling technique. Samples were considered negative (not contaminated) if no colonies were present on the blood agar plate after an 18 -hour incubation period. Samples were stratified by hospital {{and according to the}} frequency of intubation attempts (10 attempts per year) using the χ 2 -test and Fisher exact test. Results One or more species of bacteria were isolated from 4 (5. 6 %) handle tops, 20 (28. 2 %) handles with knurled surfaces, and 27 (18. 2 %) blades. No significant differences were found in microbial contamination levels on the handle tops and blades between the two hospitals and two areas according to the frequency of intubation attempts. However, {{significant differences were found between}} the two hospitals and two areas in the level of microbial contamination on the handles with knurled surfaces (p< 0. 05). Conclusions Protocols and policies must be reviewed to standardize procedures to clean and disinfect laryngoscope blades and handles; handles should be re-designed to eliminate points of contact with the blade; and single-use, one-piece laryngoscopes should be introduced...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>crash</b> <b>cart</b> was {{originally}} designed and patented by ECRI Institute founder, Joel J. Nobel, M.D., while a surgical resident at Philadelphia’s Pennsylvania Hospital in 1965. MAX helped enhance hospital’s efficiency in emergencies by enabling {{doctors and nurses}} to save time, thereby increasing the chances of saving a life.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technical}} innovation was {{the introduction}} of the HANS Device, a restraint that reduced the amount of lateral head movement by the driver {{in the event of a}} <b>crash.</b> <b>CART</b> had made it mandatory for all drivers on oval courses at the beginning of the season, and the race at Nazareth would be the first professional open-wheel race where all drivers would be required to use it.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess current MRI safety {{practices}} among MRI facilities in Ghana, and their compliance with the 2013 American College of Radiology (ACR) guidance document on MR safe practices. Material and methods: A questionnaire developed from the 2013 ACR Guidance Document was used to collect information on magnetic field strengths, MR safety policy and compliance, patient screening, emergency preparedness, infection control, MRI safety accessories, equipment safety, signage and barriers, report of adverse incidents, and access and communication. Results: Out of the 13 MRI facilities identified, response rate of 92 % was obtained. Six (50 %) facilities indicated they have MRI safety policy and have it present and readily available to facility staff. Five (42 %) facilities indicated they have handheld magnets, and 1 (8 %) has ferromagnetic detection system. Only one (8 %) had <b>crash</b> <b>carts.</b> Seven (58 %) facilities have zone 4 clearly marked with a red light and lighted sign stating “The Magnet is On”. One (8 %) recorded projectile incident and fire outbreak. Eight (67 %) facilities have direct visual observation of access corridors to zone IV. Conclusion: There was compliance in some areas of MRI safety practice, however there were some shortfalls which need to be addressed. We therefore recommend improvement in the following areas: (1) establishment, implementation, and maintenance of current MRI safety policy, (2) patient screening, (3) provision of training and routine drills on emergency response protocols with documentations, (4) emergency preparedness, and (5) provision of colour codes for equipment used within MRI environment...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{computer}} industry, the term <b>crash</b> <b>cart</b> is used, by analogy {{to its original}} meaning in medicine, to mean a cart that can be connected to a server that is malfunctioning so badly that remote access to it is impossible, the intention being to [...] "resuscitate" [...] the server {{to the point where}} remote administration works again. Crash carts most commonly include a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, because most servers in a modern high-density environment don't have user input/output devices.|$|E
5000|$|Hospitals {{typically}} have internal intercom codes used for situations when someone {{has suffered a}} cardiac arrest or a similar potentially fatal condition outside of the emergency room or intensive care unit (where such conditions already happen frequently and do not require special announcements). When such codes are given, hospital staff and volunteers are expected to clear the corridors, and to direct visitors to stand aside as the <b>crash</b> <b>cart</b> {{and a team of}} physicians, pharmacists and nurses may come through at any moment.

50|$|The {{medication}} {{should be}} administered {{by a physician}} or nurse and documented (dosage, name, time, etc.). Children should not receive the sedative without supervision of a skilled and knowledgeable medical personnel (at home, technician). Emergency equipment including <b>crash</b> <b>cart</b> must be readily available and respiration monitoring should be done visually or with stethoscope. Family member needs to remain in room with patient, especially if tester steps out. In this scenario, respiration can be monitored acoustically with a talk-back system microphone placed near patient's head. Medical personnel should be notified of slow respiration state.|$|E

60|$|Where London {{becomes more}} {{interesting}} is Charing Cross. Looking to Northumberland House, and turning your back upon Trafalgar Square, the Strand {{is perhaps the}} finest street in Europe, blending the architecture of many periods; and its river ways are a peculiar feature and rich with associations. Fleet Street, with its Temple, is not unworthy of being contiguous to the Strand. The fire of London has deprived us of the delight of a real old quarter of the city; but some bits remain, and everywhere there is a stirring multitude, and a great crush and <b>crash</b> of <b>carts</b> and wains. The Inns of Court, and the quarters {{in the vicinity of}} the port, Thames Street, Tower Hill, Billingsgate, Wapping, Rotherhithe, are the best parts of London; they are full of character: the buildings bear a nearer relation to what the people are doing than in the more polished quarters.|$|R
