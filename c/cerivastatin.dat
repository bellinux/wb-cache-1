2500|$|Lipophilicity of the statins is {{considered}} to be quite important since the hepatoselectivity of the statins is related to their lipophilicity. [...] The more lipophilic statins tend to achieve higher levels of exposure in non-hepatic tissues, while the hydrophilic statins tend to be more hepatoselective.

50|$|The {{scientific}} {{field of}} activity associated with drug safety is increasingly government-regulated, and is of major concern for the public, {{as well as to}} drug manufacturers. The distinction between adverse and nonadverse effects is a major undertaking when a new drug is developed and tested before marketing it. This is done in toxicity studies to determine the nonadverse effect level (NOAEL). These studies are used to define the dosage to be used in human testing (phase I), as well as to calculate the maximum admissible daily intake.

50|$|The OATPs {{play a role}} in the {{transport}} of some classes of drugs across the cell membrane, particularly in the liver and kidney. In the liver, OATPs are expressed on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, transporting compounds into the hepatocyte for biotransformation. A number of drug-drug interactions have been associated with the OATPs, affecting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs. This is most commonly where one drug inhibits {{the transport}} of another drug into the hepatocyte, so that it is retained longer in the body (i.e. increased plasma half-life). The OATPs most associated with these interactions are OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1, which are all present on the hepatocyte basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane. OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are known to play an important role in hepatic drug disposition. These OATPs contribute towards first step of hepatic accumulation and can influence the disposition of drug via hepatic route. The most clinically relevant interactions have been associated with the lipid lowering drugs statins, which led to the removal of <b>cerivastatin</b> from the market in 2002.

50|$|A Phase IV {{trial is}} also known as postmarketing {{surveillance}} trial, or informally as a confirmatory trial. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold (e.g. after approval under the FDA Accelerated Approval Program). Phase IV studies may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken by the sponsoring company for competitive (finding a new market for the drug) or other reasons (for example, the drug may not have been tested for interactions with other drugs, or on certain population groups such as pregnant women, who are unlikely to subject themselves to trials). The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials. Harmful effects discovered by Phase IV trials may result in a drug being no longer sold, or restricted to certain uses; recent examples involve <b>cerivastatin</b> (brand names Baycol and Lipobay), troglitazone (Rezulin) and rofecoxib (Vioxx).

40|$|Background—Although statins {{preserve}} endothelial function {{by reducing}} serum cholesterol levels, {{it has been}} suggested they may also stimulate nitric oxide (NO) synthase in endothelium with concurrent increase in superoxide (O 2) generation, leading to impairment of NO activity. Therefore, measurements of biologically active NO and O 2 in endothelium after exposure to the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor <b>cerivastatin</b> were undertaken to evaluate its potential effect on NO biological activity. Methods and Results—Highly sensitive electrochemical NO and O 2 microsensors were placed near the surface of a single human umbilical vein endothelial cell, and the kinetics of NO and O 2 release were recorded in vitro. <b>Cerivastatin</b> demonstrated a time-dependent effect on NO release in endothelial cells. The initial release (approximately the first 3 minutes) was concentration-dependent (0. 01 to 10 mol/L) and was similar to that observed for typical NO synthase agonists calcium ionophore or acetylcholine. <b>Cerivastatin</b> stimulated NO release at a favorable rate and scavenged O 2, which led to the preservation of the active concentration of NO.

40|$|Background—Despite the {{development}} of effective immunosuppressive therapy, transplant graft arterial disease (GAD) remains the major limitation to long-term graft survival.

This study tested the hypothesis that statins can suppress GAD by cholesterol-independent pathways. Methods and Results—We performed heterotopic murine cardiac transplants in total allogeneic or major histocompatibility complex class II–mismatched combinations. Transplanted animals received either control chow, chow containing 25 ppm <b>cerivastatin</b> (low dose), or chow containing 125 ppm <b>cerivastatin</b> (high dose). Mean plasma <b>cerivastatin</b> concentrations were 0. 0 (control), 10. 1 (low dose), and 21. 9 (high dose) nmol/L, respectively. Plasma cholesterol levels were the same in all groups. GAD scores decreased in low-dose (P 0. 05) and high-dose (P 0. 0001) <b>cerivastatin</b> groups compared with controls, with concomitant reduction in graft-infiltrating cells and significantly decreased intragraft RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 mRNA expression. <b>Cerivastatin,</b> as well as other statins, also reduced RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 production in mouse endothelial cells stimulated with interferon- and tumor necrosis factor- in vitro.

40|$|Background: Pancreatic {{cancer is}} {{recognized}} as one of the most fatal tumors due to its aggressiveness and resistance to therapy. Statins were previously shown to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells via various signaling pathways. In healthy tissues, statins activate the heme oxygenase pathway, nevertheless the role of heme oxygenase in pancreatic cancer is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate, whether anti-proliferative effects of statins in pancreatic cancer cells are mediated via the heme oxygenase pathway. Methods: In vitro effects of various statins and hemin, a heme oxygenase inducer, on cell proliferation were evaluated in PA-TU- 8902, MiaPaCa- 2 and BxPC- 3 human pancreatic cancer cell lines. The effect of statins on heme oxygenase activity was assessed and heme oxygenase-silenced cells were used for pancreatic cancer cell proliferation studies. Cell death rate and reactive oxygen species production were measured in PA-TU- 8902 cells, followed by evaluation of the effect of <b>cerivastatin</b> on GFP-K-Ras trafficking and expression of markers of invasiveness, osteopontin (SPP 1) and SOX 2. Results: While simvastatin and <b>cerivastatin</b> displayed major anti-proliferative properties in all cell lines tested, pravastatin did not affect the cell growth at all. Strong anti-proliferative effect was observed also for hemin. Co-treatment of <b>cerivastatin</b> and hemin increased anti-proliferative potential of these agents, via increased production of reactive oxygen species and cell death compared to individual treatment. Heme oxygenase silencing did not prevent pancreatic cancer cells from the tumor-suppressive effect of <b>cerivastatin</b> or hemin. <b>Cerivastatin,</b> but not pravastatin, protected Ras protein from trafficking to the cell membrane and significantly reduced expressions of SPP 1 (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) and SOX 2 (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Conclusions: Anti-proliferative effects of statins and hemin on human pancreatic cancer cell lines do not seem to be related to the heme oxygenase pathway. While hemin triggers reactive oxygen species-induced cell death, <b>cerivastatin</b> targets Ras protein trafficking and affects markers of invasiveness. Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract— 3 -Hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl {{coenzyme}} A reductase inhibitors, or statins, {{have been}} reported to exert actions independent of their lipid-lowering effects. To critically assess the effects of statins on monocyte–endothelial cell interactions, we used an in vitro model that mimicked physiological flow conditions. Monocytic U 937 cells were incubated in the presence of <b>cerivastatin</b> for 48 hours. Adhesive interactions of statin-treated U 937 cells were then analyzed by use of activated (interleukin- 1 b 10 U/mL, 4 hours) human umbilical vein endothelial cells in an in vitro flow apparatus. Flow cytometric analysis of adhesion molecules and measurement of F-actin content in U 937 cells were performed before and after statin treatment. Preincubation with <b>cerivastatin</b> significantly decreased U 937 firm adhesion to activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells, whereas U 937 rolling was not decreased. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed downregulation of U 937 surface expression of CD 11 a, CD 18, and VLA 4 after statin treatment. <b>Cerivastatin</b> significantly reduced F-actin content in U 937 cells and inhibited RhoA translocation, whereas preincubation with C 3 exoenzyme reduced U 937 adhesion under flow. <b>Cerivastatin</b> reduces monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium under physiological flow conditions via downregulation of integrin adhesion molecules and inhibition of actin polymerization via RhoA inactivation. Our findings have important implications for the lipid-independent effects of statins. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2001; 21 : 1165 - 1171.)

Rhabdomyolysis was 10 times more common with <b>cerivastatin</b> than the other five approved statins. We address three important questions raised by this withdrawal. Should we continue to approve drugs on surrogate efficacy? Are all statins interchangeable? Do the benefits outweigh the risks of statins?
