40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Cinchophen</b> (I) was {{synthesized}} from pyruvic acid, aniline and benzaldehyde by Doebner synthesis. <b>Cinchophen</b> acid chloride (II) was synthesised from <b>cinchophen</b> and {{oxalyl chloride}} by acylation reaction. The 2 -phenylquinoline- 4 -carboxylic acid amide (III) was synthesized from acid chloride and ammonia by simple reaction. The 2 -phenylquinoline- 4 -carboxylic acid amine (IV) was synthesized from <b>cinchophen</b> amide by the reduction reaction by using lithium alluminium hydride as reducing {{agent in the}} proper solvent like THF and ether. Then the compound V was prepared according to scheme III {{by the use of}} aldehyde The newly synthesized compound are characterized by spectral (I R, 1 H NMR and Mass) data. The purity of the compounds was confirmed by TLC. The physicochemical properties such as melting point and % yield were determined. A number of molecular docking experiments were carried out to identify potential inhibitor of AmpC enzyme of E. Coli HKY 28. All these compounds were evaluated for their in vitro activity against several microbes. The results indicate that all the synthesized compound shown mild to good activity against the pathogenic bacteria and fungi and {{have been shown to be}} more potent than <b>cinchophen</b> with the reference standard ciprofloxacin and fluconazole.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{and efficacy}} of a <b>cinchophen</b> prednisolone combination preparation (PLT) were assessed in the dog. <b>Cinchophen</b> administered at a dose rate of 12 - 5 mg/kg intravenously had a volume of distribution (Vd area) of 0 ??? 13 litres/kg, a clearance rate (Cl) of 0 ??? 15 litres/h and a half-life (t 1 / 2 ?? of 7 ??? 92 hours. Following oral administration the bioavailability was 87 - 21 per cent. Prednisolone administered at a dose rate of 0 ??? 15 mg/kg intravenously had a Vd area of 2 ??? 7 litres/kg, a CI of 0 ??? 116 litres/h and a t 1 / 2 ?? of 1 ??? 11 hours.

40|$|<b>CINCHOPHEN</b> {{was first}} intro-duced to {{therapeutics}} in 1908 by Nicolaier and Dohrn {{for the treatment}} of gout. Since then its use has been extended to arthritis in gen-eral and as an analgesic. Various closely allied chemical compounds and derivatives have been brought out from time to time until now there are many similar drugs on the market, and with the multiplicity of trade names it is doubtful whether persons using or prescribing them are fully acquaint-ed with the toxicity which they pos-sess.

40|$|Determination of {{the binding}} affinities of ‘ 25 l-labeled cholecystographic agents to human serum albumin by {{ultrafiltration}} techniques {{is complicated by}} the appearance of radiochemical impurities resulting from radiolysis of the parent compound. With labeled compounds purified daily by two extractions through chloroform, iophenoxic acid has an extremely high binding affinity. The dissociation constant (K) is 0. 013 tiM for iophenoxate, compared to 0. 15 tiM for iopanoate, its close analogue. However, at the weaker sites, iophenoxic acid is less strongly bound than iopanoate. The exceptionally high affinity of iophenoxate for a single site of serum albumin appears to underlie its unusual persistence in plasma. Binding in vivo is reversible and not covalent in nature. The choleretic compounds <b>cinchophen</b> and taurocholate have differential effects on the biliary excretion of iophenoxate and iopanoate. This cannot be attributed to selective inhibition of binding to plasma protein. lophenoxic acid (Teridax) is an iodinated radio-paque cholecystographic agent [a-ethyl-$-(3 -hy-droxy- 2, 4, 6 -triiodophenyl) propionic acid].

40|$|The flow of bile {{from the}} liver {{is known to}} be {{increased}} by a variety of sub-stances. Agents which stimulate the output of a bile characterized by increased water content and low specific gravity, viscosity and total solids, have been defined as hydrocholeretics (Ivy, 1944). The specific mechanisms involved in hydrocholeresis have not been elucidated. Increases in hepatic arterial blood flow have been observed following intravenous injections of sodium dehydrocholate, ketocholanic acids and <b>cinchophen</b> (Grodins, 1941). However, studies in the isolated rat liver (Brauer and Pessotti, 1952) in which potential regulatory fac-tors can be controlled, demonstrated hydrocholeresis in the presence of constant portal blood flow. Experiments in dogs (Wirts and Cantarow, 1942; Cantarow et al., 1948) indicated that dehydrocholate delayed the biliary excretion of bromsulfalein (BSP). A similar situation was found in the human (Mendeloff et aL, 1949). In the latter report, measurements of BSP concentration in peripheral blood suggested that dehydrocholate blocked the liver uptake of BSP. In an earlier report (Cook et al., 1952) evidence was presented that two prin...|$|E
40|$|THERE {{are many}} {{substances}} now known to produce definite hepatic injury, such as chloroform, various arsenicals, {{various members of}} the quinoline series such as <b>cinchophen,</b> etc. As a result of numerous publications regarding their danger the medical profession has learned to exercise greater caution in their use. Because of the increasing popularity of its use as a cleaning fluid by the general public, carbon tetrachloride (and trade marked cleaning agents con-taining it) should also be included in this group. Indeed, in current interest, it now leads the list of chemicals which can produce liver injury. For many years it has been considered an industrial hazard. There {{is no doubt that the}} large dry cleaning establishments now use greater care to protect their employees because of the increasing number of medical publications which have appeared. But the general public needs continued caution as to its danger. Its poisonous effect can reach the liver by inhalation through the lungs; by absorption through the injured skin; or—as occurs less frequently—by absorption from the digestive tract when it is administered orally. In addition to producin...|$|E
40|$|The {{antagonism}} between analgesic antipyretic {{drugs and}} bradykinin was examined quantitatively, using the bronchoconstrictor response of guinea-pigs in vivo. The dose of bradykinin required to overcome antagonism by calcium acetylsalicylate increased with the dose of acetylsalicylate given, the ratio being roughly constant. Fifty times {{the quantity of}} acetylsalicylate which just antagonized bradykinin did not modify bronchoconstriction due to small doses of histamine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, or acetylcholine. A method of measuring the potency of this anti-bradykinin action was developed. Acetylsalicylic acid, phenylbutazone, amidopyrine, and phenazone had a high potency; paracetamol, <b>cinchophen,</b> sodium salicylate, and acetanilide had a moderate potency; and phenacetin, salicylamide, and 4 -hydroxyisophthalic acid had little or none. Cortisone, hydrocortisone, aldosterone, amodiaquine, and morphine were ineffective or their action was non-specific. In sensitized guinea-pigs, an injection of antigen caused bronchospasm. This response was greatly lessened by pretreatment with mepyramine, but was not affected by calcium acetylsalicylate, lysergic acid diethylamide, or atropine. Acetylsalicylic acid, phenylbutazone, and amidopyrine did not specifically antagonize the action of bradykinin on the capillaries of guinea-pig skin in vivo, on guinea-pig ileum in vitro or on rat duodenum in vitro...|$|E
40|$|GOUT, one of man's oldest known afflictions, has {{for many}} years defied {{consistently}} effective and sustained control. The use of colchicine, a drug long associated with the disease gout, has become established for the relief of acute attacks and is thought by some investigators {{to aid in the}} prevention of recurring attacks, but it is well recognized that its effect in no way alters the basic problem of gout, that of hyperuricemia. Because of the hyper-uricemia, attempts to control gout by a low purine, low fat diet have been made but, as in diabetes, there are definite gradations of the disease, so that diet restrictions alone are in most cases inadequate. Over the years urico-suric agents have been added to purine restriction, but these substances, <b>cinchophen,</b> a potentially toxic drug, and salicylates are not sufficiently active to restore the serum uric acid level to normal except in cases of early or mild gout, or in cases in which the serum uric acid is only slightly elevated. Those interested in gout (the goutologists) have been waiting patiently for the discovery of a substance that would accomplish for gout what insuli...|$|E
40|$|The general {{pharmacology}} of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used in {{dogs and}} cats has been described in part 1 of this review (Lees and others 1991). This paper outlines {{the properties of the}} individual agents as they are used in small animal practice. The NSAIDs which have been used extensively in small animals include the older agents such as Aspirin, <b>cinchophen</b> and phenylbutazone. These agents have previously been used empirically by extrapolation of dosages from other species and by clinical experience. Studies are now available which provide a scientific rationale for the dosage rate recommended. A number of new drugs have recently been licensed for use in the dog or may be licensed in the near future. These include flunixin, carprofen and tolfenamic acid and the data generated from these products provides very useful information for formulating I effective dosage regimens. There are also some NSAIDs such as piroxicam which have been investigated in the dog because they have particular properties which may be of use in common clinical conditions and others, such as Paracetamol and Ibuprofen, which are readily available to the public and which owners may administer to dogs or cats at toxic dose...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study (1) the suggestion was made that the action of <b>cinchophen</b> on the uric acid excretion {{might be due to}} its action through the central nervous system. It was in order to test this hypothesis that it was decided to determine the action on the allantoin excretion in dogs before and after denervation of the kidneys. Anatomically the innervation of the kidney has been known to proceed from the sympathetic chain in the coat of the renal artery and terminal filaments have been demonstrated near the secretory cells. It has been {{known for a long time}} that these nerves subserve a vasomotor function but whether or not the changes in the urinary picture were due solely to the increased blood flow or to actual changes induced by the nerves in the secretory cells is still a matter of doubt. Asher and Pearce (2), Jungmann and Meyer (3), Jost (4), Mauerhofer (5), all believed that they demonstrated a change in secretion after stimulation of the nerves. In 1916 Quinby (6) did the first adequate sur-vival experiments from which he concluded that the effects on secretion were largely due to the increased blood flow and that regeneration took place comparatively quickly after the renal artery was stripped. Marshall and Kolls (7) in a very extensive series of experiments also believed that they demonstrated that certain changes were due entirely to changes in the blood flow...|$|E
40|$|With the {{administration}} of histamine there occurs a transient increase of the urinary excretion of free histamine in the female rat being loaded with water and whose urine being collected every 30 minutes. In the previous paper (Folia pharmacol. japon. 54, 1221, 1958) {{it was reported that}} such an increase is dependent upon the basal rate (a) of the urinary excretion of histamine and the amount (b) of histamine excessively excreted after intraperitoneal injection of a limited amount of histamine {{and that there is a}} relationship of b/a=k (k stands for constant pertaining dose). On the basis of these findings and taking the increase in the urinary excretion of histamine as an index, the author compared the potency and time course of in vivo histamine release as demonstrated by sinomenine hydrochloride, Compound 48 / 80, quinine hydrochoride, sodium cholate, dextran, egg white, decylamine and Tween 20, administered intraperitoneally. Judging from the relationship between the degree of the increase in the urinary excretion of histamine and the amount of the substances being administered, the histamine-releasing ability of these substances was found to be in the order of; Compound 48 / 80 >decylamine>sinomenine>sodium cholate>quinine, Tween 20 >dextran and egg white. Of them, Compound 48 / 80 and sinomenine showed the increase in the urinary histamine exactly identical with that observed after histamine administration, taking the shortest time course; while in the cases of quinine, sodium cholate, dextran, and egg white the increase was somewhat slower; and by decylamine and Tween 20 it developed most slowly yet most persistently. In the rats previously treated with guaiazulene, cortisone, aminopyrine or <b>cinchophen</b> sodium, increases in the urinary excretion of histamine by all the releasers mentioned above were similarly inhibited. Since mechanisms of histamine release action are not the same by different releasers, it seems that the action of these inhibitors is of such a nature as to be manifested at a common stage involved in different patterns of the mechanism of histamine release. Such an action of cortisone was more marked in a relatively small dose rather than in a large dose, suggesting presence of an adequate amount of this steroid to be used for the manifestation of this action. The histamine-releasing ability of egg white was inhibited in the alloxan-diabetic rat, while on the contrary, it was greatly accelerated in the insulin-treated rat. Such an effect of alloxan was completely antagonized by an adequate amount of insulin. However, in the rat with glycosuria induced by glucose administration, sensitivity to egg white was not altered. Succinic acid or oxaloacetic acid given with the purpose to inhibit the formation of keton bodies, could not eliminate the above mentioned alloxan effect. Both alloxan and insulin did not in any way modify the histamine-releasing effect of sinomenine...|$|E
