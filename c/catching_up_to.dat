Most countries in South-East Asia, particularly the five founding ASEAN member countries (ASEAN- 5), have experienced substantial economic growth, with {{the pace of}} growth having varied substantially across countries. Recent empirical studies have found evidence of several convergence clubs, in which per capita incomes have converged for selected groupings of countries and regions. This paper applies different time series tests of convergence {{to determine if there}} is a convergence club for ASEAN- 5, as well as ASEAN- 5 and the USA. The <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> hypothesis states that the lagging country, with low initial income and productivity levels, will tend to grow more rapidly by copying the technology of the leader country, without having to bear the associated costs of research and development.

25|$|From {{the onset}} of the war the Chinese navy was {{severely}} disadvantaged. Chinese war junks were intended for use against pirates or equivalent types of vessels, and were most effective in close range river engagements. Due to their ships' slow speeds, Qing captains consistently found themselves sailing towards much more maneuverable British ships, and as a consequence the Chinese could only use their bow guns. The size of the British ships made traditional boarding tactics useless, and the junks carried smaller numbers of inferior weaponry. In addition, the Chinese ships were poorly armored; in several battles, British shells and rockets penetrated Chinese magazines and detonated gunpowder stores. Highly maneuverable steamships such the HMS Nemesis could decimate small fleets of junks, as the junks had little chance of <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> and engaging the faster British steamers.

40|$|This paper {{theoretically}} and empirically {{analyzes the}} sources of the observed pattern that the levels and growth rates of technology are different across countries. The model is extended version of endogenous growth models with <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> model which is formulated by the relative backwardness hypothesis and the adoption capacity. The relative backwardness hypothesis states that the backward countries attain a high productivity growth rate because adopting advanced technologies is easier and less costly than innovation, Thus, the technologically less advanced countries tend to grow faster than technologically leading countries. A necessary condition, in order that the laggard countries might be {{able to take advantage of}} the available technology, is the well-developed capacity, ``Adoption capacity'', to adopt the superior technology. This is determined by policy variables that are conducive to technology adoption. The <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> theory states that technological <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> is strongest in countries that are not only technologically backward but also in those countries which have policy determinants conducive to technology adoption. Theoretically, it is shown that the steady state growth rate of technology is determined by population growth rate while the steady state relative backwardness depends on the adoption capacity, the productivity in the R&D sector, and the relative human capital stock. The empirical relevance of the <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> theory is investigated as well. The empirical results support the formalized <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> theory by showing the significant role which policy determinants conducive to technological adoption play. The robust role of scale effects in explaining technological <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> is also shown. Further, the speeds of technological <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> are estimated <b>to</b> be around 2 percent. ...|$|R

He later breaks off business with the GRE when they halt the supply drops and refuse to help the Tower. The situation in the tower worsens, and a whole floor is sealed off when an outbreak occurs. In desperate hopes to find Antizin, Crane and Jade pull a raid on a supply storage facility run by Rais, which was formerly a school. They find no Antizin, but rather plastic explosives, which they choose to confiscate to prevent Rais from using them in the future.

40|$|The {{productivity}} {{slowdown in}} Europe since the mid- 1990 s {{is a reason}} for concern. Labour market rigidity, hampering innovation, may be a cause of the slowdown. In the paper this argument is placed in a broader perspective. Labour force participation {{is an important factor}} in explaining differences in productivity and welfare over time and across regions as can be illustrated by comparing the US and the EU- 15. Moreover, technological change is not entirely exogenous. Dynamic increasing returns as introduced by Kaldor and Verdoorn may boost productivity. For countries other than the US <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> appears <b>to</b> be of importance. The question is then to what extent labour market institutions account for productivity growth. Regression analysis on a panel of 21 OECD countries covering the period 1960 - 2005 reveals that employment protection is relevant but that the impact is qualitatively different before and after 1980. The reason is that in the first sub-period technological change is driven in most countries by imitation, whereas in the second sub-period innovation becomes the predominant factor everywhere. ...|$|R
