40|$|This {{correspondence}} {{presents a}} new technique to compute efficiently the spectra of the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components {{as well as the}} cross-spectrum of the in-phase and quadrature (I-Q) components of self-noise appearing at the output of the zero-memory, high-order nonlinear (NL) device employed in a clock recovery system. It is known that these spectra {{play an important role in}} the phase jitter performance of the <b>clock</b> <b>regenerator.</b> The results are very general and applicable to many cases of practical interest. Numerical examples and computer simulations provided show that the new approach yields very accurate results and is much faster than the usual computer simulation method. in addition, we give a theorem to show that for the signal shapes having linear phase, the cross-power spectrum of self-noise is zero. We also provide a general expression for the jitter variance of the generated clock signal in terms of the power spectra of self-noise in-phase and quadrature components. It is shown that the cross-power spectrum will also contribute to timing jitter if the selected signaling shape does not have any symmetry in time domain. The optimal periodic sampling instants Eire determined by the axis crossings of the clock signal in the positive direction. The axis is set at a level whereby the jitter variance takes on a minimum value. It is concluded that when the cross-power spectrum is zero for all frequencies then the optimal sampling instants occur at the positive zero crossings of the clock signal and only the Q noise contributes to the timing jitter performance.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} new GHz clock {{distribution}} scheme, injection-locked clocking (ILC). This new scheme uses injectionlocked oscillators {{as the local}} <b>clock</b> <b>regenerators.</b> It can achieve better power efficiency and jitter performance than conventional buffered trees with the additional benefit of built-in deskewing. A test chip is implemented in a standard 0. 18 �m digital CMOS technology. It has four divide-by- 2 ILOs at the leaves of a 3 section H-tree, generating 5 GHz local clocks from the 10 GHz input clock with 17 % locking range and no phase noise degradation. Measured jitter of generated clocks is {{lower than that of}} the input signal. Two local clocks can be differentially deskewed up to 80 ps relative to each other. The test chip consumes only 7. 3 mW excluding test-port buffers. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of all-optical signal processing techniques and circuits has attracted particular interest {{over the last}} decades, aiming at the enhancement of optical networks transparency and the exploitation of the huge bandwidth, being made available by the optical fiber as a transmission line. One of the most preferable options {{for the implementation of}} this type of circuits is the use of nonlinear fibers, and in general of nonlinear Kerr media, mainly due to their potential for high-speed operation that originates from the nature of the Kerr effect itself and the practically instantaneous response of the Kerr nonlinearity. Within this framework, the thesis focuses on the study, development and experimental demonstration of novel, nonlinear fiber-based, all-optical signal processing subsystems that exhibit a high-degree of network functionality and compatibility with novel modulation formats, and additionally verify further characteristics of the fiber-based processors, such as their capability of multi-wavelength operation and thus, of simultaneous processing multiple WDM channels. In this sense, the present doctoral thesis represents a complete and well-defined research effort, complementary to other efforts over the last decade that have been aiming at implementing simpler concepts at increasingly high data rates and with the use of advanced Kerr media and integrated circuits. Within the framework of the thesis, four particular circuits were studied and experimentally demonstrated for the first time. These include a multi-wavelength regeneration circuit for on-off keying (OOK) signals, a clock recovery circuit for ultra-short, synchronous or asynchronous optical packets, a circuit for regeneration of optical differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) signals and a feedback circuit for rate multiplication of pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS). The multi-wavelength regeneration circuit is based on the implementation of a carefully designed dispersion map that allows for the elimination of the nonlinear interaction between the WDM channels and for their simultaneous regeneration by means of the self-phase modulation effect. The clock recovery circuit is based, in turn, on the use of a Fabry-Perot filter (FPF) and a subsequent optical power limiter, which drastically suppresses the intense amplitude modulation of the FPF output and delivers the high-quality signal of the recovered <b>clock.</b> The DPSK <b>regenerator</b> relies on the decoding of the input data streams and the phase re-modulation of a new optical carrier using a nonlinear fiber-based Sagnac interferometer. The concept exploits the nonlinear transfer function of the Sagnac gate and offers the possibility for suppressing both the phase- and the amplitude-noise of the input signals, thus resulting in their regeneration. Finally, the all-optical feedback circuit exploits the feedback topology and the functionality of an optical OR gate to achieve the data rate multiplication of PRBS with higher flexibility, favorable scaling laws and higher operation quality as compared to the conventional, linear techniques. The optical implementation of the OR gate relies again on the nonlinear fiber-based Sagnac interferometer. All four circuits were experimentally demonstrated at 40 Gb/s data rate range, but the capability of extending their operation at higher data rates is given. Their practical significance refers to their potential for deployment in first-, second- and third-generation optical communication networks, as well as in test & measurement systems for the performance evaluation of a variety of optical elements, circuits, subsystems and systems...|$|R
