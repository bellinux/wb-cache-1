The project {{is part of the}} ongoing modernization and development of the capital. According to former Mayor Mohamed Ahmed Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up on security and resolve housing ownership disputes. In March 2015, the Benadir administration likewise launched a renovation project on the Hawo Asir-Fagah major road in Mogadishu. The government-public partnership aims to facilitate vehicle access in the area. According to Karaan district commissioner Ahmed Hassan Yalah'ow, the reconstruction initiative will also make the road all-weather resistant and is slated to be completed shortly.|$|E

5|$|With {{the passing}} of a new Constitution in 2012 and the {{subsequent}} election of an inaugural President in the new Federal Government, the mayorship continued to oversee Mogadishu's ongoing post-conflict reconstruction. Building off the initial pilot, the Benadir administration launched a citywide street naming, house numbering and postal codes project. Officially called the House Numbering and Post <b>Code</b> <b>System,</b> it is a joint initiative of the municipal authorities and Somali business community representatives. According to Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up on security and resolve housing ownership disputes. , there are postal codes for 176 localities and sub-localities, including the Mogadishu metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} large firms also have their {{headquarters}} in Mogadishu. Among these is the Trans-National Industrial Electricity and Gas Company, an energy conglomerate founded in 2010 that unites five major Somali companies from the trade, finance, security and telecommunications sectors. Other firms based in the city include Hormuud Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in southern and central Somalia. Telcom is another telecommunications service provider that is centered in the capital. The local Somali Energy Company specializes in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to residents and businesses within its service area in Banaadir. Villa and Mansion Architects, an international architectural firm founded by the Somali-British architect Alexander Yusuf, likewise has its regional offices in Mogadishu. Additionally, the International Bank of Somalia, which opened downtown in 2014, offers Islamic finance and international banking services via a swift <b>code</b> <b>system.</b> The Islamic Insurance Company (First Takaful and Re-Takaful Insurance Company) was concurrently established, and is the city's first full service insurance firm in many years. The Central Bank of Somalia, the national monetary authority, also has its headquarters in Mogadishu.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu's {{municipal}} government is currently led by Yusuf Hussein Jimaale, who succeeded Mayor Hassan Mohamed Hussein Mungab, a former military court chairman. Among the administration's development initiatives are a US$100 million urban renewal project, {{the creation of}} garbage disposal and incineration plants, the launch of a citywide cleanup project, the creation of asphalt and cement plants, rehabilitation of the Town Hall and parliament buildings, reconstruction of the former Defence Ministry offices, reconstruction of correctional facilities, rehabilitation and construction of health facilities, establishment of a Police Training Center and a permanent base in Jasiira for the new Somali Armed Forces, rebuilding of the Somali Postal Service headquarters, and rehabilitation of public playgrounds in several districts. In January 2014, the Benadir administration launched the House Numbering and Post <b>Code</b> <b>System.</b> It also began distributing national identity cards in March of the same year. In addition, the municipal authorities started renovating important local government centers in September 2014, including the capital's former Fisho Guverno compound. In January 2015, the Benadir administration also opened a new Health & Safety Office to supervise health and safety practices in the city, and launched a municipal beautification campaign ahead of various international conferences that are slated to be held there.|$|E

40|$|Performance of two <b>coding</b> <b>systems</b> is {{analyzed}} for a noisy optical channel with M(= 2 (L) -ary orthogonal signaling and random gain photomultiplier detection.

40|$|In {{connection}} with attempts to achieve very low error probabilities, Odenwalder (1970) proposed a concatenated <b>coding</b> <b>system</b> using the Viterbi-decoded convolutional codes as the inner code and Reed-Solomon (RS) codes as the outer code.

50|$|There {{are three}} main <b>coding</b> <b>systems</b> {{typically}} {{used in the}} analysis of categorical variables in regression: dummy coding, effects coding, and contrast coding.

500|$|World War I and the Prohibition impelled local {{lawmakers to}} {{initiate}} a crackdown on Butte's red light district; by 1917, the district was effectively closed. Signs saying [...] "Men Under 21 Keep Out" [...] were commonplace, {{and in the next}} census, prostitution had completely disappeared as a declared profession in Butte. The Dumas, however, remained in operation. In 1925 Anne Vallet began overseeing the Dumas for the Nadeau family, and in the 1930s, operations had passed to Madam Rose Davis. In 1940 Lillian Walden and her husband Dick began running the brothel, raising the price of sex at the brothel to $2. Three years later, the US government ordered all brothels shut down {{to prevent the spread of}} venereal diseases among soldiers in World War II. In response, the Dumas began operating even more furtively, now under the guise of being a boardinghouse.
