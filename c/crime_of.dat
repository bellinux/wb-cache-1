Cowart was also charged with damaging religious property and use of a firearm during a <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> violence. On November 6, Schlesselman and Cowart pleaded not guilty before a federal magistrate in Memphis, Tennessee. The two were placed into federal custody without bail. The charges carry a maximum punishment of 50 years in prison and $540,000 in fines.|$|E
5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the <b>Crime</b> <b>of</b> Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E

He was also present for the trial of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was posthumously found guilty for the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> maiestas (treason). On 16 December, his father gave a eulogy for Germanicus during a Senate meeting, and he gave a eulogy the next meeting.

Yet, in a show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property.

40|$|Zero {{tolerance}} and public shaming are increasingly advocated for both <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the powerless and <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the powerful. In this essay we argue against zero tolerance {{with respect to}} both kinds <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> However, we defend naming and shaming with respect to <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the powerful. Part I of the paper begins from the assumption that both zero {{tolerance and}} naming and shaming are policies that do not merit serious consideration with <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the powerless. It {{then goes on to}} consider harder questions: first whether zero tolerance and then naming and shaming have a place with <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the powerful. Drug abuse is used in Part II as a case study to explore these distinctions. It will be contended that zero tolerance is a prescription for increasing drug abuse, but that naming and shaming is essential to the prevention of drug abuse. This conclusion is reached by viewing the drug problem differently from conventional criminological analyses in a radically reconfigured context as a corporate crime and organizational regulation problem...|$|R

At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E

5|$|Nikolai Polikarpov {{was arrested}} by the OGPU in September 1929 for the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> {{industrial}} sabotage for these failures and sentenced to death, although this was commuted to ten years imprisonment in a labor camp. In December 1929 the OGPU gathered a number of aircraft engineers together at Butyrka prison, including Polikarpov, and formed the Internal Prison Design Bureau (Konstruktorskoye Byuro Vnutrenniya Tyurma—KB VT) {{under the leadership of}} Dmitry Pavlovich Grigorovich. The KB VT was transferred to quarters on the grounds of Factory (Zavod) Nr. 30 in Moscow-Khodinka in early 1930. Shortly afterwards Polikarpov replaced Grigorovich as the head designer when his concept for the I-5 was approved by the OGPU. The full-scale mock-up was approved on 28 March 1930 and the first prototype, designated VT-11 (Vnutrenniya Tyurma—Internal Prison), was completed a month later.|$|E
5|$|Polikarpov {{was arrested}} and imprisoned by the OGPU in September 1929 for the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> {{industrial}} sabotage when neither the I-6 nor the I-5 projects met their stipulated deadlines, and this delayed the first flight of the I-6 until 30 March 1930. The second prototype was completed shortly thereafter and both aircraft appeared in that year's May Day fly-past over Moscow. Both aircraft likely used imported engines before they were replaced by the Soviet-built copy of the Jupiter, the Shvetsov M-22.
