5|$|Hergé {{had long}} sought to regain <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> old friend Zhang Chongren, {{with whom he}} had lost contact. He {{regularly}} asked any Chinese people that he met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang's godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> old friend. The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Meher Baba began {{a period}} of {{extensive}} world travel, with several trips to Europe and the United States. It was during this period that he established <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> first close group of Western disciples. He traveled on a Persian passport because {{he had given up}} writing as well as speaking and would not sign the forms required by the British government of India.|$|E

As a result, Long remained in Saigon Central Prison, serving his life sentence with hard labour. The French were unaware that Long was still in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> supporters.|$|E
5|$|After Busch {{had spent}} six months with his uncle Kleine at Lüthorst, he {{expressed}} an aim to continue study in Munich. This request caused a rift with his father who, however, eventually funded this move; - see for comparison Busch's illustrated story of Painter Klecksel. Busch's expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> parents had been broken off. In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to be without prospects, he contemplated emigration to Brazil to keep bees.|$|E
5|$|After celebrating his 45th {{birthday}} {{alone at}} The Dorchester, Bond {{is sent to}} Zanzarim to bring a speedy end to {{the civil war in}} the country which has seen the delta region of the country split to form the Democratic Republic of Dahum. Before leaving for Africa, Bond visits Gabriel Adeka—the rebel leader's brother—who runs AfriKIN, a London-based charity who send aid to Dahumni children; Gabriel tells Bond that he is not in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother Solomon, as the pair have fallen out.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, {{he participated}} in the Synod of Bishops’ Assembly on Africa. <b>His</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> native diocese of Roermond {{continued}} through the years, as Roermond financially supported projects in Jinja, and as Bishop Willigers had family back home.|$|R
5|$|At 09:00 Sefik {{and his two}} battalions were {{approaching}} Kavak Tepe, and made <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> 2nd Battalion that had conducted a fighting withdrawal, and {{an hour and a}} half later the regiment was deployed to stop the ANZACs advancing any further. Around 10:00 Kemal arrived at Scrubby Knoll and steadied some retreating troops, pushing them back into a defensive position. As they arrived, the 57th Infantry Regiment were given their orders and prepared to counter-attack. Scrubby Knoll, known to the Turks as Kemalyeri (Kemal's Place), now became the site of the Turkish headquarters for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantages}} posed by his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position {{he is known}} to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. He could have maintained <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his premature death in 43 or 44.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} as bishop Foliot served for many years as a papal judge-delegate, {{especially}} in his later years. He was active in both of his dioceses in supporting his cathedral chapters and other religious houses of the dioceses. He kept in constant <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> archdeacons and deans about {{the administration of the}} dioceses. He also gathered about himself a group of clerks who compiled a collection of decretals known as the Belvoir collection. This collection mainly relates to Foliot's activities at London, and probably dates to before 1175.|$|E
5|$|Emperors {{could choose}} whether to {{supervise}} the policy bureaucracy or to pursue scholarship, cults, hobbies, or women instead. However, Frederick W. Mote argues that most Song emperors – who spent much of their childhood confined and isolated within a luxurious palace – were aloof conformists detached {{from the world of}} normal affairs and thus relied on officialdom to administer the government. While the mainstream view is that the Song court exercised the highest degree of restraint and courtesy towards civil officials, the new protocol of enhanced deferential treatment by officials towards the emperor during conferences and meetings further eroded the emperor's close <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> ministers.|$|E
5|$|He married Julia Stanley in 1938. John {{was their}} only child together, but as Alf was often away at sea during World War II, {{he did not see}} much of his child during his infancy. During this period, Julia became {{pregnant}} with another man's child. He offered to look after his wife, their child and the expected baby, but Julia rejected the idea. He had very little <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> son until Beatlemania, when they met again, but later had only intermittent contact with each other. He died in Brighton, where he had gone to live after marrying 19-year-old Pauline Jones, with whom he had two sons.|$|E

5|$|In May, Jarrah {{received}} a visa from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, arriving in Florida in June 2000. There, he began taking flying lessons {{as well as}} training in hand-to-hand combat. Jarrah maintained <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend in Germany and {{with his family in}} Lebanon in the months preceding the attacks. This close contact upset Mohamed Atta, the tactical leader of the plot, and al-Qaeda planners may have considered another operative, Zacarias Moussaoui, to replace him if he backed out.|$|E

Later, Zhang moved back to his homeland and Hergé lost <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> friend after the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Hergé felt Chang and Tintin must be reunited, just as he hoped to see his friend again some day.|$|E
