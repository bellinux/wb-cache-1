5|$|Inocybe maculata is an ectomycorrhizal species, {{with a wide}} {{ecological}} range. It can {{be found}} in all biomes from low-lying deciduous woodland to arctic-alpine areas. It typically grows on the ground in deciduous (or mixed) woodland, favouring beech. It grows best on <b>chalky</b> <b>soil,</b> among leaf litter. In North America, it favours sandy soil, clay or moss. It is also encountered on pathsides. As well as beech, the species has been recorded growing in association with hornbeam, hazel, oak and lime. Inocybe maculata f. fulva favours birch, spruce, pine, Populus, willow, (as well as Dryas and Polygonum in alpine regions). Mushrooms grow individually or in scattered groups. Though widespread in the areas it is found, it is not a common species. It can be found from western Europe to eastern Asia; and in North America, from where it was first collected in the 1960s. Inocybe maculata f. fulva was first identified in France, and has since been found elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is mycorrhizal. It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (<b>chalky)</b> <b>soil,</b> {{it will be in}} moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown product of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetation}} is deciduous oak forest: both sessile oaks (Quercus petraea) and pedunculate oaks (Quercus robur), with European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and hazels in {{the coolest}} and deepest soil {{at the bottom}} of the valley. The mountain layer is characterised by the presence of beeches and at times, in the Pyrenees, by silver firs (Abies alba); these beeches and silver firs occupy the cool slopes with shallow soil. The Mediterranean influence is felt in the presence of Holm oaks (Quercus ilex) with bay laurel, which are situated on the warmest crests and slopes, especially above <b>chalky</b> <b>soil,</b> where the dryness becomes more pronounced.|$|E
50|$|On arable land, bare ground, on paths, on dry or <b>chalky</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
50|$|It prefers <b>chalky</b> <b>soils</b> and dry {{pastures}} in environments from valleys up to {{an altitude}} of 2,800 m.|$|R
50|$|It {{grows on}} the dry, rocky hillside, slopes, open steppes, or mixed forests. In {{limestone}} or <b>chalky</b> <b>soils,</b> in full sun.|$|R
25|$|Irish tales {{depict the}} Dagda {{as a figure}} of power, armed with a club. In Dorset there is a famous outline of an ithyphallic giant known as the Cerne Abbas Giant with a club cut into the <b>chalky</b> <b>soil.</b> While this was {{probably}} produced in relatively modern times (English Civil War era), it was long {{thought to be a}} representation of the Dagda. This has been called into question by recent studies which show {{that there may have been}} a representation of what looks like a large drapery hanging from the horizontal arm of the figure, leading to suspicion that this figure actually represents Hercules (Heracles), with the skin of the Nemean lion over his arm and carrying the club he used to kill it. In Gaul, it is speculated that the Dagda is associated with Sucellus, the striker, equipped with a hammer and cup.|$|E
25|$|The Satan's bolete {{is found}} in the entire {{temperate}} zone, but in Europe it definitely occurs more in southern regions. It is only found in the south of England. It is rare in Scandinavia, occurring primarily on a few islands in the Baltic Sea where the conditions are perfect, with highly calcareous (<b>chalky)</b> <b>soil.</b> It has been recorded in the Black Sea and eastern Anatolia regions of Turkey. as well as the Bar'am Forest in the Upper Galilee in northern Israel. Also, it has been recorded from Iran. It has been recorded from coastal areas of California, with a possible record from the southeastern US, however these sightings are of the closely related species Rubroboletus eastwoodiae. It grows in hardwood forests, mainly under beech (Fagus). It appears in summer {{and the beginning of the}} autumn in the southernmost areas. It is rather rare in the north, as it grows only in hot and sunny periods. It fruits in autumn.|$|E
500|$|Inocybe godeyi can {{be found}} in Europe. It is found in {{deciduous}} woodland on the ground, particularly on <b>chalky</b> <b>soil.</b> The species is ectomycorrhizal, favouring beech. Mushrooms are encountered in the autumn months of August to November, solitarily or in [...] "trooping groups". While the mushrooms can be locally common, the species is typically uncommon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plant is}} found growing on sandy or <b>chalky</b> <b>soils.</b> It is present at an {{altitude}} of 0 - 1200 m above sea level.|$|R
50|$|Wild basil {{occurs in}} {{suitable}} locations {{in most of}} Europe, in western and central Asia and in North Africa. Its typical habitat is dry grassland and heathland, usually on limestone or <b>chalky</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{woodland}} is {{a secondary}} woodland comprising oaks, sweet chestnuts and beech trees. [...] The soil is freely draining, highly acidic and loamy/sandy, sitting {{just south of}} a band of very <b>chalky</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
500|$|This region also {{produces}} milk-fed lamb. Unpasteurized ewe's milk {{is used to}} produce the Roquefort in Aveyron, while [...] in Laguiole is producing unpasteurized cow's milk cheese. The Salers cattle produce quality milk for cheese, as well as beef and veal products. The volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well. Cabécou cheese is from Rocamadour, a medieval settlement erected directly on a cliff, in the rich countryside of Causses du Quercy. [...] This area {{is one of the}} region’s oldest milk producers; it has <b>chalky</b> <b>soil,</b> marked by history and human activity, and is favourable for the raising of goats.|$|E
500|$|Imperator torosus is {{native to}} {{southern}} Europe east to the Caucasus and Israel. A mycorrhizal species, the fungus is generally associated with deciduous trees such as hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus) and beech (Fagus) in warm, dry locales, and is generally rare in Europe. In the United Kingdom, it is listed as a [...] "priority species"—a threatened species requiring conservation action under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Similarly, {{it is on the}} list of protected species of macrofungi in Montenegro. [...] It appears to be relatively common in Hungary. It is found under Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos) in the Bar'am forest in Upper Galilee. Fruitings typically occur from July to September in calcareous (<b>chalky)</b> <b>soil,</b> with fruit bodies appearing either singly or in small groups.|$|E
500|$|Tricholoma pardinum {{is found}} across Europe, {{where it is}} more common in the south. It is {{abundant}} in the Jura Mountains in eastern France. The species is found in Belgium and Germany, but has not been recorded from the Netherlands or the British Isles. A historical record from Estonia has been discarded because no herbarium specimens could be found. In Asia, it has been recorded from İzmir Province in southwestern Turkey, China, and Sado Island in Japan. It is found widely across temperate North America, where Santa Cruz County and Sierra Nevada in central California in the west of the continent, and the central Appalachians in the east form the southern limits of its distribution. T.pardinum is commonly associated with conifers in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, and with tanoak [...] (Lithocarpus densiflorus) and madrone (Arbutus spp.) in California. The mushroom can be abundant in some years, especially warmer years with higher rainfall, yet missing or rare for several years in between. In Europe, it is found on <b>chalky</b> <b>soil</b> in woodland with beech and fir in summer and autumn, where it prefers areas of some elevation. Although it may be found in groups or fairy rings, it most commonly occurs singly.|$|E
50|$|Widespread across Europe, Tricholoma orirubens is not common. It {{is rare in}} the Netherlands. Found singly or {{in small}} groups in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland in autumn, it prefers clayey or <b>chalky</b> <b>soils.</b> It is ectomycorrhizal.|$|R
50|$|These plants occur {{along the}} banks of canals, edges of ditches and fields, sides of roads, meadows, slopes and forests. They prefer <b>chalky</b> <b>soils</b> and moist, shady areas, at an {{altitude}} of 0 - 800 m above sea level.|$|R
50|$|H. hirsutum {{grows in}} poor {{grassland}} on well-drained clay, limy and <b>chalky</b> <b>soils.</b> It is often {{found at the}} edges of woodland, on river banks and roadside verges. It is found throughout Western Europe, and in the United Kingdom it flowers from July to August.|$|R
2500|$|... 3. Franconia or Franken - around {{portions}} of Main river, {{and the only}} wine region situated in Bavaria. Noted for growing many varieties on <b>chalky</b> <b>soil</b> and for producing powerful dry Silvaner wines. In Germany, only Franconia and certain small parts of the Baden region are allowed to use the distinctive flattened Bocksbeutel bottle shape.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{soil type}} is {{represented}} in Waipara, Canterbury. Here there are the Omihi Hills which {{are part of the}} Torlesse group of limestone deposits. Viticulturalists have planted Pinot noir here due to French experience of the affinity between the grape type and the <b>chalky</b> <b>soil</b> on the Côte-d'Or. [...] Even the greywacke alluvial soils in the Waipara valley floor has a higher calcium carbonate concentration as can be witnessed from the milky water that flows in the Waipara River.|$|E
2500|$|Rubroboletus satanas, {{commonly}} known as the Satan's bolete or Devil's boletus is a basidiomycete fungus of the bolete family. It was known scientifically as Boletus satanas until 2014. Found on <b>chalky</b> <b>soil</b> in mixed woodlands in the southern, warmer regions of Europe, it is generally regarded as a poisonous mushroom, with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea and violent vomiting occurring if eaten raw or fried. However, reports of poisoning are rare due to its odd appearance and at times putrid smell minimising casual experimentation. There are reports of its traditional consumption in the former Czechoslovakia and Italy after thorough cooking (frying does not remove the toxin).|$|E
50|$|C. lutea prefers {{calcareous}} (<b>chalky),</b> loamy <b>soils</b> in open, disturbed habitats.|$|R
50|$|Most cultivars of Daphne bholua {{will grow}} in {{alkaline}} or acidic <b>soils,</b> though shallow <b>chalky</b> <b>soils</b> and light sandy soils, which dry out in hot weather, are unsuitable: {{a steady supply}} of moisture is essential during the growing season. A position that is sheltered both from the full sun and from strong winds is preferred.|$|R
25|$|Silvaner {{is another}} fairly neutral, but quite old grape variety that was Germany's most planted until the 1960s {{and after that}} has {{continued}} to lose ground. It has however remained popular in Franconia and Rheinhessen, where it is grown on <b>chalky</b> <b>soils</b> to produce powerful dry wines with a slightly earthy and rustic but also food-friendly character.|$|R
2500|$|For {{discovering}} how {{to cultivate}} truffles, some sources now {{give priority to}} Pierre II Mauléon (1744–1831) of Loudun (in the Vienne department), who began to cultivate truffles around 1790. Mauléon saw an [...] "obvious symbiosis" [...] between the oak tree, the rocky soil and the truffle, and attempted to reproduce such an environment by taking acorns from trees known to have produced truffles, and sowing them in <b>chalky</b> <b>soil.</b> His experiment was successful, with truffles being found in the soil around the newly grown oak trees years later. In 1847, Auguste Rousseau of Carpentras (in Vaucluse) planted [...] of oak trees (again from acorns found on the soil around truffle-producing oak trees), and he subsequently obtained large harvests of truffles. He received a prize at the 1855 World's Fair in Paris.|$|E
6000|$|Arrived at the bottom, I {{discovered}} {{another sign}} of Man. Behold the first road I had seen yet--a rough wagon-road ploughed deep in the <b>chalky</b> <b>soil!</b> We crossed this, and turned a corner of a hill. More signs of human life. Two small boys started up out of a ditch--apparently posted as scouts to give notice of our approach. They yelled, and set off running before us, by some short cut, known only to themselves. We turned again, round another winding of the valley, and crossed a brook. I considered it my duty to make myself acquainted with the local names. What was the brook called? It was called [...] "The Cockshoot"! And the great hill, here, on my right? It was called [...] "The Overblow"! Five minutes more, and we saw our first house--lonely and little--built of mortar and flint from the hills. A name to this also? Certainly. Name of [...] "Browndown." [...] Another ten minutes of walking, involving us more and more deeply in the mysterious green windings of the valley--and the great event of the day happened at last. Finch's boy pointed before him with his whip, and said (even at this supreme moment, still in three monosyllabic words):-- ...|$|E
60|$|Among animals {{the same}} law prevails, though, owing to their {{constant}} movements {{and power of}} concealment, {{it is not so}} readily observed. As illustrations we may refer to the wolf, ranging over Europe and Northern Asia, while the jackal inhabits Southern Asia and Northern Africa; the tree-porcupines, of which there are two closely allied species, one inhabiting the eastern, the other the western half of North America; the common hare (Lepus timidus) in Central and Southern Europe, while all Northern Europe is inhabited by the variable hare (Lepus variabilis); the common jay (Garrulus glandarius) inhabiting all Europe, while another species (Garrulus Brandti) is found all across Asia from the Urals to Japan; and many species of birds in the Eastern United States are replaced by closely allied species in the west. Of course there are also numbers of closely related species in the same country, but it will almost always be found that they frequent different stations and have somewhat different habits, and so do not come into direct competition with each other; just as closely allied plants may inhabit the same districts, when one prefers meadows the other woods, one a <b>chalky</b> <b>soil</b> the other sand, one a damp situation the other a dry one. With plants, fixed as they are to the earth, we easily note these peculiarities of station; but with wild animals, which we see only on rare occasions, it requires close and long-continued observation to detect the peculiarities in their mode of life which may prevent all direct competition between closely allied species dwelling in the same area.|$|E
50|$|Lepidium nanum, {{the dwarf}} pepperweed, is a plant species {{native to the}} US states of Nevada and Utah. It is known from four {{counties}} in Nevada (Nye, Elko, White Pine and Eureka) but only one in Utah (Tooele County). It occurs in open, sunlit areas in the desert, often with gypsum, limestone, quartzite or <b>chalky</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Silvaner {{is another}} fairly neutral, but quite old grape variety that was Germany's most planted until the 1960s {{and after that}} has {{continued}} to lose ground.

5000|$|This {{species is}} {{mycorrhizal}} with oak (Quercus), and occasional, mainly being found in Southern England, although finds {{in other parts}} of the country have also been recorded. In mainland Europe it is found with oaks and hornbeams (Carpinus) on <b>chalky</b> <b>soils,</b> and has been found under pines (Pinus) [...] In England, it can appear in two or three flushes from June till September, depending on weather conditions.|$|R
60|$|A fresh {{surprise}} and pleasure awaited me when I explored the coast {{east of the}} village; it was bold and precipitous in places, and from {{the summit of the}} cliff a very fine view of the coast-line on either hand could be obtained. Best of all, the face of the cliff itself was the breeding-place of some hundreds of herring-gulls. The eggs at the period of my visit were not yet hatched, but highly incubated, and at that stage both parents are almost constantly at home, as if in a state of anxious suspense. I had seen a good many colonies of this gull before at various breeding stations on the coast--south, west, and east--but never in conditions so singularly favourable as at this spot. From the vale where the Branscombe pours its clear waters through rough masses of shingle into the sea the ground to the east rises steeply to a height of nearly five hundred feet; the cliff is thus not nearly so high as many another, but it has features of peculiar interest. Here, in some former time, there has been a landslip, {{a large portion of the}} cliff at its highest part falling below and forming a sloping mass a <b>chalky</b> <b>soil</b> mingled with huge fragments of rock, which lies like a buttress against the vertical precipice and seems to lend it support. The fall must have occurred a very long time back, as the vegetation that overspreads the rude slope--hawthorn, furze, and ivy--has an ancient look. Here are huge masses of rock standing isolated, that resemble in their forms ruined castles, towers, and churches, some of them completely overgrown with ivy. On this rough slope, under the shelter of the cliff, with the sea at its feet, the villagers have formed their cultivated patches. The patches, wildly irregular in form, some on such steeply sloping ground as to suggest the idea that they must have been cultivated on all fours, are divided from each other by ridges and by masses of rock, deep fissures in the earth, strips of bramble and thorn and furze bushes. Altogether the effect was very singular the huge rough mass of jumbled rock and soil, the ruin wrought by Nature in one of her Cromwellian moods, and, scattered irregularly about its surface, the plots or patches of cultivated smoothness--potato rows, green parallel lines ruled on a grey ground, and big, blue-green, equidistant cabbage-globes--each plot with its fringe of spike-like onion leaves, crinkled parsley, and other garden herbs. Here the villagers came by a narrow, steep, and difficult path they had made, to dig in their plots; while, overhead, the gulls, careless of their presence, pass and repass wholly occupied with their own affairs.|$|E

50|$|Tüllinger Mountain is {{situated}} predominantly in the Tüllinger softwater molasse. The molasse comprises vryenen marl {{and parts of}} the Alsace molasse. The mountain was created through a fracture zone. The soil on Tüllinger Mountain comprises loess, clay-saboulous, and <b>chalky</b> <b>soils,</b> which allows for the cultivation of grapes and other fruit. Closed vine-areas are located in the south between Baselweg, Lichsenweg, and the lower Wagenkehrweg in the direction of Alt-Weil.|$|R
5000|$|For many years, {{due to the}} [...] "light {{and easily}} tilled <b>chalky</b> <b>soils,</b> farmers have been {{attracted}} to the topography of Sutton". [...] "The Royal Commission on the Historic Monuments of England have identified crop marks, tracks and ditches dating here from the Iron Age to the Roman period". [...] "During the following centuries farmsteads developed across the parish, with many of these farmhouses still being in existence".|$|R
50|$|It is commonest in beech {{woods and}} <b>chalky</b> <b>soils,</b> but grows in other {{broad-leaved}} woodland as well. It mainly grows on leaf litter usually {{during the spring}} and summer seasons. It is found in southern Europe and has been recorded from eastern Anatolia in Turkey. In Israel, I. erubescens grows under Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos) and pines, with mushrooms still appearing in periods of little or no rain as they are mycorrhizal.|$|R
