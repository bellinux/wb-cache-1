40|$|Our {{previous}} {{study showed that}} systemic administration of the traditional Chinese medicine Epimedium extract promotes peripheral nerve regeneration. Here, we sought to explore the therapeutic effects of local administration of icariin, {{a major component of}} Epimedium extract, on peripheral nerve regeneration. A poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) biological <b>conduit</b> <b>sleeve</b> was used to bridge a 5 mm right sciatic nerve defect in rats, and physiological saline, nerve growth factor, icariin suspension, or nerve growth factor-releasing microsphere suspension was injected into the defect. Twelve weeks later, sciatic nerve conduction velocity and the number of myelinated fibers were notably greater in the rats treated with icariin suspension or nerve growth factor-releasing microspheres than those that had received nerve growth factor or physiological saline. The effects of icariin suspension were similar to those of nerve growth factor-releasing microspheres. These data suggest that icariin acts as a nerve growth factor-releasing agent, and indicate that local application of icariin after spinal injury can promote peripheral nerve regeneration. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the restorative effect of modified biodegradable chitin conduits {{in combination with}} bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation after right spinal cord hemisection injury. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that biological <b>conduit</b> <b>sleeve</b> bridging reduced glial scar formation and spinal muscular atrophy after spinal cord hemisection. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells survived and proliferated after transplantation in vivo, and differentiated into cells double-positive for S 100 (Schwann cell marker) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (glial cell marker) at 8 weeks. Retrograde tracing showed that more nerve fibers had grown through the injured spinal cord at 14 weeks after combination therapy than either treatment alone. Our findings indicate that a biological conduit combined with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation effectively prevented scar formation and provided a favorable local microenvironment for the proliferation, migration and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the spinal cord, thus promoting restoration following spinal cord hemisection injury...|$|E
40|$|A grasp assist system {{includes}} a glove and a flexible sleeve. The glove {{includes a}} digit {{such as a}} finger or thumb, a force sensor configured to measure a grasping force applied to an object by an operator wearing the glove, and adjustable phalange rings positioned {{with respect to the}} digit. A saddle is positioned with respect to the finger. A flexible tendon is looped at one end around the saddle. A conduit contains the tendon. A conduit anchor secured within a palm of the glove receives the <b>conduit.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> has pockets containing an actuator assembly connected to another end of the tendon and a controller. The controller is in communication with the force sensor, and calculates a tensile force in response to the measured grasping force. The controller commands the tensile force from the actuator assembly to tension the tendon and thereby move the finger...|$|R
50|$|The wires {{are first}} {{cut to the}} desired length, usually using a special wire-cutting machine. The wires may also be printed on by a special machine during the cutting process or on a {{separate}} machine. After this, {{the ends of the}} wires are stripped to expose the metal (or core) of the wires, which are fitted with any required terminals or connector housings. The cables are assembled and clamped together on a special workbench, or onto a pin board (assembly board), according to the design specification, to form the cable harness. After fitting any protective <b>sleeves,</b> <b>conduit,</b> or extruded yarn, the harness is either fitted directly in the vehicle or shipped.|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{effects of}} 2 -mm small gap sleeve bridging {{of the biological}} conduit to repair peripheral nerve injury are better than in the traditional epineurium suture, so {{it is possible to}} replace the epineurium suture in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury. This study sought to identify the regeneration law of nerve fibers in the biological conduit. A nerve regeneration chamber was constructed in models of sciatic nerve injury using 2 -mm small gap sleeve bridging of a biodegradable biological conduit. The results showed that the biological conduit had good histocompatibility. Tissue and cell apoptosis in the conduit apparently lessened, and regenerating nerve fibers were common. The degeneration regeneration law of Schwann cells and axons in the conduit was quite different from that in traditional epineurium suture. During the prime period for nerve fiber regeneration (2 - 8 weeks), the number of Schwann cells and nerve fibers was higher in both proximal and distal ends, and the effects of the small gap sleeve bridging method were better than those of the traditional epineurium suture. The above results provide an objective and reliable theoretical basis for the clinical application of the biological <b>conduit</b> small gap <b>sleeve</b> bridging method to repair peripheral nerve injury. ...|$|R
