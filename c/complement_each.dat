5|$|A Second Chance at Sarah {{received}} generally positive reviews. Praise {{was particularly}} directed at Wong's illustrations, {{as well as}} Druckmann's writing and character development, which were said to <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{the field}} of {{professional}} astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Australia, Edwards {{became the}} Australian Representative for Selection Trust. In 1966 his wife, Cherry, died; he married Dorothy Carew Berrick in 1972. The pair {{were said to}} <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other well, as Dorothy limped on her left leg after being knocked over by a car on a {{crosswalk}} in Sydney in 1970, while Edwards limped with his right after his flying accident in 1938. In 1974, Edwards relinquished his position as the Australian Representative for Selection Trust and was appointed Governor of Western Australia. He was sworn in on 7 January 1974, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) the following October.|$|E
50|$|During the STIC years, SNCV {{operated}} its own {{network of}} trams and buses in Charleroi (and {{the rest of}} Belgium). Both networks <b>complemented</b> <b>each</b> other, more than they competed.|$|R

50|$|All nine crews {{returned}} for a group performance in the season finale. The judges each picked three crews that <b>complemented</b> <b>each</b> other and their dance styles. Then, the winner was crowned.|$|R
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other because the peak operating times for each system occur {{at different times of}} the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation {{in a time of war}} would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other, and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E
50|$|Långhjelm's {{achievements}} {{were also}} noted by Wilhelm Wahlforss, General Manager of the shipbuilding and engineering company Wärtsilä. In 1951 he recruited Långhjelm to Deputy Director. Their characters were different, but <b>complemented</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|R
50|$|According to Zhuo Xinping (2011), Chinese patriarchal {{religion}} and Confucianism <b>complemented</b> <b>each</b> other in ancient China, as the Confucian religion traditionally lacked a social religious organisation while traditional patriarchal religion lacked an ideological doctrine.|$|R

5|$|Schubert {{composed}} {{his three}} last sonatas in close succession; furthermore, {{he intended to}} publish them together as a set, as evident by the sonatas' titles. In support of this view that the sonatas are a single unity, pianist and scholar Alfred Brendel has found profound musical links between the sonatas. He {{has argued that the}} sonatas <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other in their different characters, and demonstrated that the entire sonata trilogy is based on the same basic group of intervallic motifs. Moreover, each of the sonatas contains a complex network of inner harmonic and motivic connections linking together all movements, and passages from one movement often reappear, usually transformed, in later movements. Most of these connections are too subtle to be detected during casual listening. In some cases, however, Schubert quotes a theme or passage from an earlier movement with little alteration, inserting it in structurally significant locations, creating an immediately audible allusion. Such explicit connections are related to the cyclic form, one of the musical forms associated with the Romantic period in music.|$|E
25|$|The first {{strategy}} {{tries to}} bring wine together with dishes that <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other {{such as an}} earthy, Burgundian Pinot noir with an earthy, mushroom dish.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{annotation}} tools try {{to perform}} these steps in silico, {{as opposed to}} manual annotation (a.k.a. curation) which involves human expertise and potential experimental verification. Ideally, these approaches co-exist and <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other in the same annotation pipeline (also see below).|$|E
50|$|Executives' feedback: The Renuzit {{executives}} {{noted that}} James's and Stefani's team {{worked very well}} <b>complementing</b> <b>each</b> other's strength and weaknesses, while Frank took over while Nicole stayed behind the scenes. They did note that Frank was a very hard worker.|$|R

50|$|The {{eliminated}} crews {{returned and}} {{performed with the}} finalists for a collaboration. The judges each picked three crews that <b>complemented</b> <b>each</b> other and their dance styles.

25|$|That {{the meaning}} of law is such that its content cannot be {{determined}} except by reference to moral principles. These meanings can either oppose or <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other, although they share the common trait that they rely on inherence as opposed to design in finding just laws.|$|E
25|$|Livy and Cicero's {{version of}} the Dream of Scipio, which are rebuilt in the poem, <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other and are sources of the Africa. The dream shapes the context from which the poem is to be understood. Scipio's love for justice drove him to avenge his father's and uncle's death by the Carthaginians.|$|E
25|$|The ATLAS experiment, at {{the other}} side of the LHC ring is {{designed}} with similar goals in mind, and the two experiments are designed to <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other both to extend reach and to provide corroboration of findings.

50|$|Both {{brothers}} {{followed in}} their father’s footsteps in their tendencies and training. Cosmas Damian {{worked as a}} painter and sculptor; Egid Quirin, as architect, stucco-worker, and sculptor. As their specialties <b>complemented</b> <b>each</b> other well for architectural assignments, they worked together on nearly all their commissions.|$|R
50|$|The {{collaboration}} with Ericailcane had its best results from 2003 to 2006. The two personalities <b>complemented</b> <b>each</b> other; while Blu was painting his characteristic human figures Ericailcane made his typical animals. The two artists, friends in real life, {{continue to work}} together although less often.|$|R
25|$|The other {{variant of}} the LRSAM will be fielded by the Indian Air Force. Along with the Akash SAM, the LRSAM fills a longer range {{requirement}} and both types will <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other.

25|$|Two {{comprehensive}} biographical dictionaries {{have also}} added to these reference aids: Michael Loewe's 2000 Biographical Dictionary of Qin, Former Han, and Xin Periods, and Rafe de Crespigny's 2007 Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms, both published by Brill and intended to <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other. De Crespigny's translation of titles mainly follow Dubs with some alterations, whereas Loewe's {{tend to be}} his own original renderings.|$|E
25|$|Rehhagel's teams also {{regularly}} {{develop a}} lot of pressure on the wings, e.g. Mario Basler/Marco Bode (Bremen) or Andreas Buck/Marco Reich (FCK), who were dominant wingers when Rehhagel coached them. His teams also regularly employ at least one dominant header as the central striker (Rudi Völler, Karlheinz Riedle, Frank Neubarth, Olaf Marschall, Angelos Charisteas). The wing play and the header-strong striker obviously <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|E
50|$|Palmer and Bell {{shared a}} vision of {{building}} a corporate empire and formed a business partnership. Both were astute businessmen and <b>complemented</b> <b>each</b> other.

25|$|The castle ruins, whose {{structure}} {{is easy to}} reconstitute, includes a few peculiarities, such as small Traitors' Gate alongside the keep tower, and remnants of barbicans along the walls, in addition to examples of primitive cisterns in relative good state (although obstructed). The Castle of Ansiães and that of Vila Flor <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other: both implanted in a protected zone, on small plateaus between cordillera and three peaks.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideology}} of D66 {{is a highly}} contested subject within the party. The question {{is tied to the}} reason for its existence. There are two currents within the party: the radical democrats and the progressive liberals. These two currents, although sometimes antagonistic, currently <b>complement</b> <b>each</b> other, as both emphasize the self-realisation of the individual. The Radical League and the Free-thinking Democratic League, two early twentieth century parties are historic exponents of these two traditions.|$|E
25|$|The Hickman High School string {{orchestra}} {{is composed}} of the finest string players {{in the school and}} meets 1st hour.
