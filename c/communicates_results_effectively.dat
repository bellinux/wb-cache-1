In a The Huffington Post piece, president Adam Weinberg {{argued that the}} study of big data may not be unique for post-secondary education, but the marriage of liberal arts and data analytics is a unique concept. [...] "In short," [...] he writes. [...] "a liberal arts background gives data analytics its soul." [...] The interdisciplinary major combines courses in mathematics and computer science, electives from the social and natural sciences and four new courses in data analytics. These courses allow students to acquire a foundation, learn the technique, apply the technique across disciplines, and pull it all together. According to Weinberg, this foundation will help students frame questions appropriately, work in interdisciplinary teams, <b>communicate</b> <b>results</b> <b>effectively,</b> and make ethical decisions.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{observations from}} applying {{the principles of}} the case study method of teaching to a senior level applied engineering course. Its purpose is to provide an example application in a course that was composed strictly of a series of case studies. Students studied four different situations that are typical of projects done by a consulting or plant engineer in industry. Each case was presented during an initial information class meeting and the students worked on the analysis and design necessary to complete the assignment {{over a period of several}} weeks. Students were requested to write their results in the form of a report that mimics one that would be completed for a consulting firm’s client. A follow-up survey taken at the end of the semester indicated that they enjoyed the course more and felt a greater connection between the cases studied and real situations that they will encounter in a professional job. The students also recognized other lessons learned from the course structure helped them to be more efficient with their time, to <b>communicate</b> their <b>results</b> <b>effectively</b> in a professional style, and to recognize the need to avoid the pitfall of procrastination...|$|R
40|$|The revised Fourth Edition of {{this popular}} {{textbook}} is redesigned with Excel 2016 to encourage business {{students to develop}} competitive advantages for use in their future careers as decision makers. Students learn to build models using logic and experience, produce statistics using Excel 2016 with shortcuts, and translate results into implications for decision makers. The textbook features new examples and assignments on global markets, including cases featuring Chipotle and Costco. Exceptional managers {{know that they can}} create competitive advantages by basing decisions on performance response under alternative scenarios, and managers need to understand how to use statistics to create such advantages. Statistics, from basic to sophisticated models, are illustrated with examples using real data such as students will encounter in their roles as managers. A number of examples focus on business in emerging global markets with particular emphasis on emerging markets in Latin America, China, and India. Results are linked to implications for decision making with sensitivity analyses to illustrate how alternate scenarios can be compared. The author emphasizes <b>communicating</b> <b>results</b> <b>effectively</b> in plain English and with screenshots and compelling graphics in the form of memos and PowerPoints. Chapters include screenshots to make it easy to conduct analyses in Excel 2016. PivotTables and PivotCharts, used frequently in business, are introduced from the start. The Fourth Edition features Monte Carlo simulation in four chapters, as a tool to illustrate the range of possible outcomes from decision makers’ assumptions and underlying uncertainties. Model building with regression is presented as a process, adding levels of sophistication, with chapters on multicollinearity and remedies, forecasting and model validation, autocorrelation and remedies, indicator variables to represent segment differences, and seasonality, structural shifts or shocks in time series models. Special applications in market segmentation and portfolio analysis are offered, and an introduction to conjoint analysis is included.

40|$|A key {{requirement}} for effective coastal zone management is good knowledge and prediction of land erosion rates due to encroachment of the sea. However, {{in addition to}} demarcation of the hazard through modelling and mapping, a policy of risk mitigation necessitates significant attention should also be addressed to communicating the transient behaviour of the predictions and associated uncertainty. With climate change and sea level rise implying that historical rates of change {{may not be a}} reliable guide for the future, enhanced visualisation of the evolving coastline has the potential to improve awareness of this changing risk. This visual content is developed by linking scientific modelling with the transformation of digital elevation models, and then using GIS to integrate other spatiotemporal content. The resulting high-resolution visualisations may meet demands from decision-makers for tools to <b>communicate</b> scientific <b>results</b> more <b>effectively,</b> due to their realism and apparent authenticity. Nevertheless they can also produces a tension with the underlying scientific content because of the necessary extrapolation of extra detail, and the lack of established procedures to <b>communicate</b> the <b>resulting</b> uncertainty in the visualisation.

These issues are explored through analysis of future cliff erosion in Norfolk on the eastern coast of Great Britain...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{context and}} conduct of Arctic {{research}} are changing. In Nunavut, funding agencies, licensing bodies, and new regulatory agencies established under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement require researchers to engage and consult with Inuit communities during {{all phases of}} research, to provide local training and other benefits, and to <b>communicate</b> project <b>results</b> <b>effectively.</b> Researchers are also increasingly expected to incorporate traditional knowledge into their work and to design studies {{that are relevant to}} local interests and needs. In this paper, we explore the challenges that researchers and communities experience in meeting these requirements by reviewing case studies of three natural science projects in Nunavut. Together, these projects exemplify both success and failure in negotiating research relationships. The case studies highlight three principal sources of researcher-community conflict: 1) debate surrounding acceptable impacts of research and {{the nature and extent of}} local benefits that research projects can and should provide; 2) uncertainty over who has the power and authority to dictate terms and conditions under which projects should be licensed; and 3) the appropriate research methodology and design to balance local expectations and research needs. The Nunavut research licensing process under the Scientists Act is an important opportunity for communities, scientists, and regulatory agencies to negotiate power relationships. However, the standards and procedures used to evaluate research impact remain unclear, as does the role of communities in the decision-making process for research licensing. The case studies also demonstrate the critical role of trust and rapport, forged through early and frequent communication, efforts to provide local training, and opportunities for community members to observe, participate in, and derive employment from project activities...|$|R

Auditors should focus on the outcomes of a policy to obtain insightful results and recommendations for governing without interfering with the executive branches. Therefore, audit authorities can positively affect society by increasing the economic value of audited units. Because the main aim of a performance audit is to improve government performance, audit authorities should strive to develop collaborative partnerships with the executive and legislative branches in enhancing governance. Audit leaders should recognize that developing cooperative goals among team members is essential for reinforcing these values and ensuring the credibility. Our study has showed that the evaluation, performance, and value of outputs and outcomes have evidently relied on auditors’ self-efficacy. Auditors should maintain a strong and professional relationship with audited units, enabling them to appropriately <b>communicate</b> audit <b>results,</b> thereby <b>effectively</b> improving governing performance. According to the mission statement of the American Accounting Association, the auditing profession should “foster excellence in the teaching, research, and practice of auditing and assurance services.” Accordingly, the core competencies of auditors are as follows: (a) communication ability and leadership for inspiring people to achieve common goals; (b) the ability to conduct comprehensive financial analyses, provide insight, and offer constructive recommendations; and (c) an awareness of new technological trends and the ability to apply advanced technology to increase client and employee value. Audit authorities should operate on the basis of public governance perspectives and focus on regulatory and performance auditing to ensure that the executive branches utilizes the allocated funds legally, enabling it to economically and efficiently achieve the set goals.|$|R

Objectives: The objective {{of this study is}} to examine the relationship between life building skills and social adjustment of students with hearing impairment. Methods: The study employed descriptive survey research design. The samples consisted of 150 students with hearing impairment purposively selected from two inclusive schools in Lagos state, Nigeria. The samples comprised of 65 boys and 85 girls with age range between 15 and 18 years in the Senior Secondary School. The instruments used for data collection were Life building skills inventory (adapted) with reliability of 0. 80 and Social adjustment scale (Self developed). The instruments consisted of two sections namely: A&B. Section A of Life building skills contained bio- data of the respondents, while B contained 3 subscales: Self-efficacy inventory adapted from Schwarzer and Jerusalem 1995 with reliability of 0. 85, Decision-making inventory adapted from Rowe 1997 with reliability of 0. 75, Assertiveness inventory adapted from Aberti and Emmons 1995 with reliability of 0. 80. The self-constructed Social Adjustment scale contained 10 items probing questions with reliability of 0. 69. Data collected was analysed using Pearson Product Moment Correlation and Multiple Regression. Results: The results revealed relative contributions of some life building skills to social adjustment of students with hearing impairment. There were joint contributions of the independent variables to dependent variable, while decision-making contributed mostly. Conclusion: This study examined relationship between life building skills and social adjustment of students with hearing impairment with a bid to provide adequate counseling services.
