25|$|WHO has the {{broadest}} health mandate under the UN system, including setting priorities, coordinating global health surveillance, and emergency {{assistance in the}} event of disease outbreaks. Health experts give WHO credit for major successes, such as the eradication of smallpox, near eradication of polio, and substantial progress in controlling childhood diseases, and in expanding primary health care in developing countries. WHO defenders blame continued member state parsimony that has kept WHO's regular biennial budget to roughly $850 million for several years and forced it to rely more on voluntary <b>contributions</b> <b>that</b> often come with strings attached as the cause of its shortcomings.

25|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of the impact of}} political contributions on individual senators' support for the public insurance option conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the public option in the first place.

Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign <b>contributions</b> <b>that</b> he has received from the health care industry further reduces the probability of his supporting a public insurance option from 30.6% to 0.6%.|$|E
25|$|Blalock's {{approach}} {{to the issue of}} Thomas's race was complicated and contradictory throughout their 34-year partnership. On the one hand, he defended his choice of Thomas to his superiors at Vanderbilt and to Hopkins colleagues, and he insisted that Thomas accompany him in the operating room during the first series of tetralogy operations. On the other hand, there were limits to his tolerance, especially when it came to issues of pay, academic acknowledgment, and his social interaction outside of work. Tension with Blalock continued to build when he failed to recognize the <b>contributions</b> <b>that</b> Thomas had made in the world-famous blue baby procedure, which led to a rift in their relationship. Thomas was absent in official articles about the procedure, as well as in team pictures that included all of the doctors involved in the procedure.|$|E
