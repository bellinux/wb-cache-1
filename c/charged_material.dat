The level of ‘permeability’ in sinter-bed is depending upon the effectiveness of ‘charging chute’ in size-wise ‘segregation’ of <b>charge</b> <b>materials</b> across the depth in sinter-bed, achieved due to differences in the sliding velocities of particles during charging into the moving sinter-bed. The permeability achieved by the earlier conventional ‘charging chute’ was limited due to its design and positional constraints in sinter machine. Improving the productivity of sinter machine, through increased permeability of sinter bed is successfully achieved through implementation of an innovatively designed and developed, “Magnetic Charging Chute” at Sinter Plant no. 2 of Rourkela Steel Plant. The induced magnetic force on the <b>charged</b> <b>materials</b> while the <b>charge</b> <b>materials</b> dropping down through the charge chute has improved the permeability of sinter bed through an unique method of segregating the para-magnetic materials and the finer <b>materials</b> of the <b>charge</b> <b>materials</b> to top layer of sinter bed along with improved size-wise segregation of <b>charge</b> <b>materials.</b> This has increased the productivity of the sinter machine by 3 % and also reduced the solid fuel consumption i. e., coke breeze in input <b>charge</b> <b>materials</b> by 1 kg/t of sinter...|$|R

In addition, thermodynamic studies were performed (Task 3) to determine the suitability of ladle treatment {{for the production of}} ductile iron using scrap <b>charge</b> <b>materials</b> high in manganese and sulfur. Task 1 [...] In the first set of experiments, the <b>charge</b> <b>materials</b> investigated were thin steel scrap, thick steel scrap, cast iron scrap, and pig iron in the rusty and clean states. Melting atmospheres in this set of experiments were varied by melting with and without a furnace cover. In this study, it was found that neither covered melting nor melting clean (non-rusty) ferrous <b>charge</b> <b>materials</b> improved the metallic recovery over the recovery experienced with uncovered melting or rusty <b>charge</b> <b>materials.</b> However, the silicon and manganese recoveries were greater with covered melting and clean materials. Silicon and manganese in the molten iron react with oxygen dissolved in the iron from uncovered melting and oxidized iron (surface rust). Silica and manganese silicates are formed which float to the slag decreasing recoveries of silicon and manganese. Cast iron and pig iron had higher metallic recoveries than steel scrap. Carbon recovery was affected by the carbon content of the <b>charge</b> <b>materials,</b> and not by the melting conditions. Irons with higher silicon contents had higher silicon recovery than irons with lower silicon contents. Task 2 [...] In the second set of experiments, briquetted turnings and borings were used to evaluate the effects of briquette cleanliness, carbon additions, and melting atmosphere on metallic and alloy recovery. The melting atmosphere in this set of experiments was varied by melting in air and with an argon atmosphere using the SPAL process. In this set of experiments, carbon additions to the briquettes were found to have the greatest effect on metallic and alloy recovery. The use of an argon atmosphere was also found to increase recoveries, but to a lesser extent than with carbon additions to the briquettes. Task 3 [...] Finally, thermodynamic studies were carried out to evaluate the potential for removing manganese and sulfur from iron melts for the production of ferritic ductile iron. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that manganese and sulfur might be removed from iron melts by careful control of the temperature and slag. In laboratory tests however, it was shown that the removal of sulfur was much less successful than that indicated by the thermodynamic analyses...|$|R

50|$|There is a {{similarity}} between an electret and the dielectric layer used in capacitors; {{the difference is}} that dielectrics in capacitors have an induced polarization that is only transient, dependent on the potential applied on the dielectric, while dielectrics with electret properties exhibit quasi-permanent charge storage or dipole polarization in addition. Some materials also display ferroelectricity; i.e. they react to the external fields with a hysteresis of the polarization; ferroelectrics can retain the polarization permanently because they are in thermodynamic equilibrium, and are used in ferroelectric capacitors. Although electrets are only in a metastable state, those fashioned from very low leakage materials can retain excess charge or polarization for many years.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} two methods of control over hot blast supply into a blast furnace with constant pressure and constant amount (consumption). The analysis of these two methods was performed {{with the aim of}} determining their influence upon changes in gas pressure in the blast furnace top. The blast furnace was considered as a unity of vessels (furnace hearth, the top) and gas-dynamic resistance (a column of <b>charge</b> <b>materials).</b> A differential equation was obtained, with regard to the dynamic balance of gas flow at the inlet and outlet of the top; the equation relates the pressure and gas consumption at the top to the pressure and hot blast consumption at the inlet and outlet of the furnace and to the resistance of the column of <b>charge</b> <b>materials.</b> The column of <b>charge</b> <b>materials</b> is considered as n-th number of channels through which gas flow inside the furnace moves and which resist to the flow. By the analysis of this equation at steady state (automatic stabilization of gas pressure in the top), the conditions were obtained to be satisfied with the specified value of gas pressure in the top. This value is equal to a half of the sum of the value of hot blast pressure at the inlet into the furnace and the value of pressure inside the collector of blast furnace gas. This conclusion is verified by the operation practice of blast furnaces in Ukraine. While analyzing the second method of controlling the supply of blast supply-stabilization of consumption (amount) of hot blast supplied into the furnace {{it has been shown that}} the method could be realized in condition of stabilization of the amount of blast furnace gas, going out of the furnace. As the resistance of the column of <b>charge</b> <b>materials</b> constantly changes it is necessary to change the hot blast pressure in order to ensure the constant amount of blast, supplied into the furnace. It is often connected with possible substantial pressure fluctuations of hot blast at the inlet of the furnace, which may result in stoppages in the motion of the column of <b>charge</b> <b>materials.</b> Due to it the hot blast pressure stabilization at the inlet of the furnace and the pressure stabilization in the top seem to be the most rational way to control the blast suppl...|$|R

50|$|The {{stages of}} {{heating and cooling}} involve {{transfer}} of heat first from the hot medium to the polymer material and next from it to the cooling environment. In both cases, the process of heat transfer occurs in an unsteady regime; therefore, its kinetics attracts the greatest interest in considering these steps. In the heating stage, the heat taken from the hot gas is absorbed both by the mold and the polymer material. The rig for rotational molding usually has a relatively small wall thickness and is manufactured from metals with a high thermal conductivity (aluminum, steel). As a rule, the mold transfers much more heat than plastic can absorb; therefore, the mold temperature must vary linearly. The rotational velocity in rotational molding is rather low (4 to 20 rpm).
