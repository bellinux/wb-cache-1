This study is applied on the students of Eskisehir Osmangazi University and Karamanoglu Mehmetbey University and it is benefited from the convenience sampling in the study. The data of this study is collected via questionnaire and in a method of drop-and-collect. The results of the study shows that there is a positive meaningful relationship among <b>the</b> regret <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> life, <b>the</b> regret <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> process of purchasing and <b>the</b> regret <b>concerning</b> after <b>the</b> purchasing.

Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E

When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E
5|$|Another issue <b>concerned</b> <b>the</b> {{election}} of the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature.

Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries.

5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model <b>concerned</b> <b>the</b> city's economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
