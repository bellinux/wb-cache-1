40|$|Mites are {{involved}} in the decomposition of animal <b>carcases</b> <b>and</b> human corpses at every stage. From initial decay at the fresh stage until dry decomposition at the skeletal stage, a huge diversity of Acari, including members of the Mesostigmata, Prostigmata, Astigmata, Endeostigmata, Oribatida and Ixodida, {{are an integral part of}} the constantly changing food webs on, in and beneath the carrion. During the desiccation stage in wave 6 of M,gnin's system, mites can become the dominant fauna on the decomposing body. Under conditions unfavourable for the colonisation of insects, such as concealment, low temperature or mummification, mites might become the most important or even the only arthropods on a dead body. Some mite species will be represented by a few specimens, whereas others might build up in numbers to several million individuals. Astigmata are most prominent in numbers and Mesostigmata in diversity. More than 100 mite species and over 60 mite families were collected from animal <b>carcases,</b> <b>and</b> around 75 species and over 20 families from human corpses...|$|R

In 1949 the burial of waste at the site was halted, and the dump was covered with grass until 1956, when a concrete cover was installed to protect the landfill from rainwater.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to determine whether}} active immunization against gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) induced a long-term suppression of testicular function in bulls, and to ascertain the effects of immunization against GnRH on <b>carcase</b> <b>and</b> meat quality characteristics. In experiment 1, 6 -month-old Zebu bulls were assigned to: control (n = 25), no treatment: immunized (n = 31). immunized against GnRH at 0 and 4 months (anti-GnRH(2)). with a sub-set of bulls (n = 17) immunized again at 10 months (anti-GnRH(3)). After the second immunization, testicular growth ceased for 2 months in 14 / 31 (45 %) bulls and for at least 6 months in 17 / 31 (55 %) bulls. Among the latter bulls (anti-GnRH 3) the testes did not grow for > 1 year after the third immunization in 5 / 17 (30 %) bulls. In experiment 2, 22 -month-old Zebu bulls were assigned to: control (n = 14), no treatment; immunized (n = 17), immunized against GnRH at 0, 2 and 4 weeks. The testes decreased (P < 0. 05) in size for 2 months after immunization in 11 / 17 (65 %) bulls and then re-initiated growth, whilst in 6 / 17 (35 %) bulls the testes continued to decrease in size for 4 months and did not re-initiate growth for 1 year. At slaughter, the latter immunocastrated bulls had <b>carcase</b> <b>and</b> meat quality characteristics the same as contemporary bulls that had been castrated before puberty. The findings demonstrated that active immunization against GnRH can induce a long-term suppression of testicular function in a proportion of bulls. Also, when bulls are immunocastrated after puberty, <b>carcase</b> <b>and</b> meat quality traits change from those typical of entire bulls to traits that are characteristic of long-term castrated bulls.

40|$|Campylobacter {{species have}} been {{identified}} as the major cause of acute bacterial enteritis in the UK. However, the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis remains poorly understood.

The prevalence of Campylobacter obtained from faecal samples and swabs from fleeces <b>and</b> <b>carcases</b> was presented in a previous paper.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{distribution}} of the three known species of Onchocerca in Australian cattle is described.

Nodules of O. gibsoni were found in the brisket***, stifle and hip regions, while O. lienalis occurred along the gastrosplenic ligament and above the xiphisternum. O. gutturosa is potentially the most important species to the meat industry since it is widely distributed in the <b>carcase</b> <b>and</b> is easily missed during inspection.

40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} is to review the recent {{development}} of economic selection indices for beef cattle in Ireland, consisting of a beef production sub index (BPSI), beef and dairy calving sub indices (BPSI, DCSI), a maternal sub index (MSI), a weaned calf sub index (WCSI) and consequential total beef merit indices. The sub indices are designed to increase the profitability of different specific components of the beef industry. Secondly some initial results of a project that has begun, aiming to further optimize these developments, are presented. This project will focus on several issues including trait definition, modeling of breed effects in Irish data sets and determining appropriate fixed and random effects in a multibreed scenario. Initial heritabilities for carcase weight, <b>carcase</b> fat <b>and</b> <b>carcase</b> conformation as a function of age, using data gathered routinely in abattoirs, are presented. The data set was multibreed in nature. Fixed regressions on breed fractions were used to model breed effects. Carcase conformation for younger animals tended to have moderate to high heritabilities (0. 32 - 0. 50), while <b>carcase</b> fatness <b>and</b> <b>carcase</b> weight heritabilities for the same age range were slightly lower (0. 23 - 0. 39) ...|$|R
