40|$|Synopsis [...] The SCANNING ELECTRON MICRO•'COPE and its utility for {{studying}} HAIR SPRAY k-ILMS are described. The {{scanning electron microscope}} is an invaluable tool {{for studying}} the <b>COATABILITY</b> of hair spray films on individual or small groups of hair libors. <b>Coatability</b> can be improved by addition of certain SURFACTANTS to hair spray formulations and can be correlated qualitatively to hair spray properties such as luster, ap-I•earance, and flaking. <b>Coatability</b> does not correlate well with curl retention, another important property of hair sprays, {{which is much more}} dependent on the physical properties of the resin. Previ-ous methods for evaluating curl retention were inadequate; therefore, a STATISTICAL APPROACH was developed. The method described is reliable, conclusions can be validated {{with a high degree of}} confidence and with these benefits, formulations can be optimized...|$|E
40|$|Cellulose nanofibril (CNF) {{suspensions}} are {{not easily}} coatable because of their excessively high viscosity and yield stress, even at low solids concentrations. In addition, CNF suspensions vary widely in their properties depending on the production process used, which can affect their processability. This work reports roll-to-roll coating of three different types of CNF suspensions with a slot-die, {{and the influence of}} rheology and water retention on <b>coatability</b> is addressed. The impact of CMC addition on the high and low shear rate rheology, water retention, <b>coatability,</b> and final coating quality of these suspensions is reported. All three CNF suspensions were coated successfully using the slot-die coating process. CMC addition further improved the <b>coatability</b> by positively influencing both the low and high shear rate viscosity and water retention of the CNF suspensions. All CNF coatings significantly improved the air, heptane vapor, grease and oil barrier, while reducing the water vapor transmission rate to some extent. cited By 0 </p...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how {{roughness}} and <b>coatability</b> of {{sheet moulding}} compound (SMC) components can be improved by modifying the surface morphology of the compression tool. A modular tool was developed that allowed to mould SMC work pieces simultaneously with different tool surfaces. In this study, mainly the tool roughness was modified using various surface treatments. Three different SMC formulations were applied to mould 2 D components using the modular system. It {{was found that the}} demoulding was affected by both the tool morphology and the SMC formulations. Contamination of the tool by SMC material could be reduced by chromeplating. The morphology of the tool was transferred to the SMC work piece if the structures were larger than 5 ìm. The adhesion strength of a coating system differed for the three SMC formulations. While two of them showed generally good <b>coatability,</b> the coating adhesion on the third formulation decreased with increasing roughness of the tool used for moulding...|$|E
40|$|Alloy {{compositions}} were defined, {{heat treatments}} were developed for each alloy, and mechanical, {{physical and chemical}} material characteristics were established. In parallel, investigations were carried out on solidification, microcharacterisation, phase stability, recrystallisation patterns, workability, <b>coatability,</b> etc. The research project comprised four phases, i. e. e. three material development phases {{with a total of}} 4 years, followed by a one-year experimental phase.

40|$|For a {{comprehensive}} study of Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) surfaces, topographical data obtained by chromatic confocal imaging were submitted systematically {{for the development of}} a profile model to understand the formation of cavities on the surface. In order to qualify SMC surfaces and to predict their <b>coatability,</b> a characterization of cavities is applied. To quantify the effect of surface modification treatments, a new parameter (Surface Relative Smooth) is presented, applied and probed. The parameter proposed can be used for any surface modification of any solid material...|$|E
40|$|Epoxysilsesquioxane (SSQ) -based {{materials}} {{have been developed}} as patterning layers for large-area and high-resolution nanoimprinting. The SSQ polymers, poly(methyl-co- 3 -glycidoxypropyl) silsesquioxanes (TMeTEp), poly(phenyl-co- 3 -glycidoxypropyl) silsesquioxanes (TPhTEp), and poly(phenyl-co- 3 -glycidoxypropyl-co-perfluorooctyl) silsesquioxanes (TPhTEpTFluo), were precisely designed and synthesized by incorporating the necessary functional groups onto the SSQ backbone. The materials possess a variety of characteristics desirable for NIL, such as great <b>coatability,</b> high modulus, good mold release, and excellent dry etch resistance. In particular, the presence of epoxy functional groups allows the resists to be solidified within seconds under UV exposure at room temperature, {{and the presence of}} the fluoroalkyl groups in the SSQ resins greatly facilitate mold release after the imprint process. In addition, the absence of metal in the resins makes the materials highly compatible with applications involving Si CMOS integrated circuits fabrication.

40|$|Surface tension, contact angle, and {{substrate}} {{surface energy}} measurements can predict product <b>coatability</b> and aid {{in the design of}} adhesive formulations. These measurements can be used to compare similar formulations, to determine the effectiveness and optimal levels of additives, and to choose additives appropriate for specific substrates. Formulations that appear similar in a qualitative test, such as a laboratory drawdown, can be compared using quantifiable measurements of surface tension and contact angle. Additives can be compared to determine relative effectiveness at reducing surface tension and contact angle. Testing additives at incremental levels will determine the minimum effective level and whether a saturation point exists, beyond which further additions have little or no effect. Measuring surface energy of the substrate will aid in the selection of additives by indicating what surface tension is necessary to wet the surface...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to develop thermal spray coating {{solutions}} for flexible, targeted modification of the functionality of ceramic substrate surfaces. In principle, all ceramic substrates of sufficient strength can be coated. Substrate preparation can be omitted for porous ceramics (including presintered ceramics), with the porosity limits differing for the different spray processes (approximately 60 % porosity for APS and approximately 30 % for HVOF and S-HVOF coatings). Dense technical ceramics require substrate preparation. However, because sandblasting results in damage to the substrate and bonding defects, laser ablation is the best method for substrate preparation. Thick coatings with good substrate bonding can be achieved if the R z roughness values are about 40 µm. Manufacturing ceramic substrates with <b>coatability</b> in mind allows the substrate preparation step to be eliminated, thus providing completely new technological options such as coating of presintered ceramic parts followed by cofiring of the substrates and coatings...|$|E
40|$|YesThis {{experimental}} study of forward gravure coating considers the effects of operating variables on air entrainment, ribbing instabilities and {{the thickness of the}} film formed. The data show that this coating method can yield very thin films of thickness of order of 15 - 20 % at most of the equivalent cell depth of a gravure roller. Air free and non ribbed stable uniform films can however only be obtained in a narrow window of operating conditions at very low substrate capillary number (CaS ~ 0. 02) equivalent to substrate speeds typically less than 20 m/min. The paper draws a similarity with flow features observed with smooth forward roll coating and slide coating. It is shown that the onset of ribbing and the flux distribution between the gravure roller and the substrate at the exit of the nip obey approximately the same rules as in smooth forward roll coating, whereas the onset of air entrainment actually corresponds to a low-flow limit of <b>coatability</b> similar to that observed in slide coating...|$|E
40|$|Nickel-aluminides {{are used}} in thermal spray {{applications}} mostly as bond-coat materials, where their function is two-fold: to minimize the thermo-mechanical stresses at the substrate-coating interface arising out of thermal expansion mismatch of the metal substrate and ceramic top layer and secondly to promote coating adhesion. This paper describes the deposition of nickel aluminide coatings on mild steel substrates. A computational technique (ANN analysis) is used to predict the rate of coating deposition under various operational conditions. Prediction of deposition efficiency is significant as it gives an idea {{about the effectiveness of}} the spraying technique as well as about the <b>coatability</b> of the material under investigation. This technique involves database training to predict property parameter evolutions in process having large number of interdependent variables such {{as in the case of}} plasma spray coating deposition. This paper presents the database construction, implementation protocol and also the set of predicted results related to the deposition efficiency of nickel-aluminide coating. It is seen that the deposition rate depends largely on the plasma arc current, arc voltage etc. The neural network analysis gives an oversight on the parameter inter-dependencies and of the effect of the individual process variable on the efficiency of coating deposition...|$|E
40|$|A hybrid lacquer (HBL) paint {{prepared}} by combining a natural kurome lacquer (KL) paint and an amino silane reagent, for example, N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 3 -aminopropyl triethoxysilane (AATES), produced a polymerized film {{faster than the}} KL paint alone. However, the viscosity of the HBL paint was too viscous for easy handling. Addition of 10 [*]wt% of an epoxidized linseed oil, ELO- 6, with 6. 4 [*]mol% epoxidation as a reactive diluent to the HBL paint decreased the viscosity by 1 / 2 from 25476 [*]mPa·s to 12841 [*]mPa·s and improved the ease of <b>coatability.</b> The polymerization mechanism was elucidated by NMR measurements of extracts from the resulting polymerization films, suggesting that amino groups in the HBL paint reacted with epoxy groups of ELO- 6 in the lacquer matrix, and then the complex reacted with double bonds of the urushiol side-chain by autooxidation and cross-linking reactions to give a hard polymerized film with a high quality of color and gloss. These {{results indicate that the}} addition of ELO- 6 improved the polymerizability of both KL and HBL paints without decreasing the quality of the resulting films...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Plasma spray {{technology}} utilizes {{the exotic}} {{properties of the}} plasma medium to affect physical, chemical or metallurgical reactions to produce new materials or impart new functional properties to conventional materials. It {{is in fact a}} process that includes melting, rapid solidification and quenching taking place simultaneously. As for the coating materials, it is well understood that for a number of unique application, spherical particles are preferred over irregular ones due to low surface area to volume ratio, high density, free flowing ability and close sizing etc. In view of this, the present paper reports on the preparation of glass microspheres coatings on mild steel substrate using plasma spray technology. An 80 kW atmospheric plasma spray set up is used for spraying purpose. Solid glass micro-spheres of an average size of 100 microns are used as the coating materials which are deposited at four different power levels on mild steel substrate. The coatings are characterized in terms of their thickness, hardness, density and porosity. The <b>coatability</b> of glass micro-spheres on mild steel is assessed by evaluating the coating deposition efficiency. Different phases present in the coating are ascertained using X-ray diffractography...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{advanced}} {{high strength}} steels for automotive applications {{were designed to}} achieve a carbide- free bainitic microstructure after conventional thermo-mechanical processing and a continuous annealing treatment. The microstructure obtained consists of ferrite laths interwoven with thin films of untransformed retained austenite. The sufficiently tough matrix and {{the control of the}} heterogeneity in the microstructure allowed an optimum combination of strength, ductility, and formability to be achieved. However, this work probed that even using a devoted theoretical alloying, carbide-free bainitic steels are hardly compatible with a conventional hot dip galvanizing annealing process, without any consideration about Zn <b>coatability</b> and adherence. The hardenability of the designed alloys was insufficient in some cases and the amount of austenite retained in the microstructure was too low or/and mechanically too unstable for high ductility. As a consequence, the obtained mechanical properties were comparable to those in high-Si dual phase steels without a beneficial transformation induced plasticity effectsupport of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (contract RFSR-CT- 2008 - 00021) and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (contracts MAT 2010 - 15330 and IPT- 2012 - 0320 - 420000) for funding this researchPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Second Generation {{advanced}} {{high strength}} steel is the material of choice for modern automotive structural parts because of its outstanding maximal elongation and tensile strength. Nonetheless {{there is still a}} lack of corrosion protection for this material {{due to the fact that}} cost efficient hot dip galvanizing can not be applied. The reason for the insufficient <b>coatability</b> with zinc is found in the segregation of manganese to the surface during annealing and the formation of manganese oxides prior coating. This work analyses the structure and chemical composition of the surface oxides on so called nano-TWIP (twinning induced plasticity) steel on the nanoscopic scale after hot dip galvanizing in a simulator with employed analytical methods comprising scanning Auger electron spectroscopy (SAES), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and focused ion beam (FIB) for cross section preparation. By the combination of these methods it was possible to obtain detailed chemical images serving a better understanding which processes exactly occur on the surface of this novel kind of steel and how to promote in the future for this material system galvanic protection.

30|$|As stated previously, the {{addition}} of metal/or metal oxide nanoparticles to a liquid coolant {{is one of the}} notable examples proffered to increase the mixture’s thermal conductivity and possibly increase the heat transfer. Although several investigators [10, 11] have proven this concept, quite a few results show an opposite trend [12 - 14] due to nanoparticle deposition on the surface impeding heat transfer performance. In addition, inconsistency in the heat transfer performance by nanofluids with spray cooling can also be found [9, 15]. Based on the findings above, it may be concluded that the heat transfer coefficient increase/or decrease from {{the addition}} of nanoparticles depends on either the base fluid used or the target surface temperatures and the spray duration time on the surface/or the nanofluid impact velocity. Although the results are inconsistent with respect to boiling enhancement, both results may be true in their respective particle concentration range, because these two ranges may be dominated by different phenomena which result in different heat transfer characteristics. Moreover, it has been shown [4] that the CHF is enhanced for the pool boiling because the deposition of nanoparticles on the heated surface results in a change in the surface properties including capillarity and <b>coatability.</b> The contact angle, therefore, decreases for a nucleate boiling in nanofluids.|$|E
40|$|Today, lasers {{are used}} in almost all {{important}} sectors of industry, such as automotive, aerospace, metal-working industries, {{as well as in}} research laboratories. Examples are given of the enabling use of lasers as research tools, and as add-on manufacturing tools in thermal-mechanical processing of light metals and steels. The use of lasers as a research tool is demonstrated by studies of the refinement of microstructures of magnesium and aluminium alloys. Grain refinement in these light alloys is usually achieved by additions of potent nuclei. Here, refinement of ZE 41 and 55 Al- 45 Zn alloys is achieved by thermal means, using a laser to perform rapid surface remelting and resolidification. The resulting microstructures displayed improved properties (e. g. <b>coatability</b> or corrosion resistance). Laser assisted self-pierce riveting (LSPR) of magnesium {{is an example of a}} recent innovative development in laser assisted manufacturing that could unlock opportunities for applications of magnesium in the automotive industry. In the LSPR process, the laser is used to thermally assist the deformation of magnesium and prevent cracking during self-pierce riveting (SPR), especially when magnesium is placed on the bottom in the design of the joint. Laser assisted SPR is one critical technology to achieve economically viable next generation light weight body structures. Another example deals with laser assisted machining (LAM) of titanium. A laser is used to soften the surface of the work piece locally in front of the cutting tool and reduce the cutting pressure, thereby increasing tool life. LAM is one critical competitive technology to achieve high speed machining of titanium alloys to increase productivity and reduce manufacturing cost of titanium components...|$|E
40|$|Coating {{deposition}} by {{plasma spraying}} involves {{a number of}} process variables, which contribute in a large way {{to the quality of}} the coating. During spraying, various operating parameters are determined mostly based on past experience. It therefore does not provide the optimal set of parameters for a particular objective. In order to obtain the best result with regard to any specific coating quality characteristic, accurate identification of significant control parameters is essential. Deposition efficiency of any coating is a characteristic which not only rates the effectiveness of the spraying method but also is a measure of the <b>coatability</b> of the material under study. This work is devoted to analyze the experimentally obtained results on the deposition efficiency of alumina-titania coatings made at different operational conditions. For this purpose, a statistical technique called Taguchi experimental design methd is used. Factors are identified according to their influence on the coating deposition. The most significant parameter is found. A prediction model using artificial neural network (ANN) is presented considering the significant factors. Inspired by the biological nervous system, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is a fascinating computational tool, which can be used to simulate a wide variety of complex engineering problems such as deposition of ceramic coatings on metal substrates by plasma spraying. Prediction of deposition rate helps in selecting the optimum combination of process parameters and hence is essential in a plasma spray coating activity. This research shows that the use of a neural network model to simulate experiments with parametric design strategy is quite effective for prediction of wear response of materials within and beyond the experimental domain...|$|E

Such coatings are desirable in electrical insulation and anti-wear applications; viz. as protective coatings for sleeve shafts, thermo-couples jackets, pump shafts e. t. c. Plasma spraying is gaining acceptance as a development of quality coatings of various materials {{on a wide}} range of substrates. Coatings made with plasma route exhibit excellent wear, corossion resistance and high thermal shock resistance etc. Alumina pre-mixed with Titania powder (Al 2 O 3 - 13 %TiO 2) is deposited on mild steel and copper substrates by atmospheric plasma spraying at various operating power level ranging from 11 to 21 kW. The properties of the coatings depend on the materials used, operating condition and the process parameters. The plasma spraying process is controlled by the parameter interdependencies, co-relations and individual effect on coating characteristics. The particle sizes of the raw materials used for coating are characterized using Laser particle size analyzer of Malvern Instruments make. To characterize the coating, Coating interface bond strength is measured using coating pull out method with Instron 1195 confirming to ASTM C- 633 standard. Micro-hardness measurement is done on the polished cross section of the samples on the optically distinguishable phases Using Leitz Micro-Hardness Tester. To ascertain the phases present and phase changes / transformation taking place during plasma spraying, X-ray diffractograms is taken on the raw material and on coatings. The coating quality and behaviour depends on coating morphology and inter-particle bonding of the sprayed powders. The surface and interface morphology of the coatings is observed by Scanning Electron Microscope. Measurement of porosity is made using the image analysis technique.

40|$|The present work {{reports the}} {{performance}} of a new class of glass micro-sphere based coatings and glass micro-sphere filled polymer composites with emphasis on the general trends observed in their properties and erosion wear behavior. A wealth of property data has been generated by conducting various tests under controlled laboratory conditions and the analysis of the test results is presented in the thesis. The quality of coating in terms of mechanical, micro-structural and functional characteristics depends on a large number of variables that include both materials as well as operational parameters. While the composition of coating material and the substrate {{play an important role in}} determining the coating quality, the influence of plasma torch input power is also equally important; this is reflected in the research findings of the present investigation. This work suggests that glass micro-spheres are coatable and deposition of such coatings on metallic substrates using plasma spraying route is possible. The variations of different coating characteristics such as coating adhesion strength,deposition efficiency, coating thickness and micro-hardness with the plasma torch input power are evident in the illustrations presented in this thesis. These coatings possess desirable characteristics such as good adhesion strength, hardness etc. Pre-mixing of micro-sized Al 2 O 3 or TiO 2 particles improves the <b>coatability</b> of glass micro-spheres. Such coatings also exhibit improved interfacial adhesion strength. The strength is greatly affected by the plasma torch input power. Glass micro-sphere possesses ample reinforcing potential to be used as a functional filler in both thermoset and thermoplastic polymers. Successful fabrication of epoxy composites reinforced with glass micro-spheres is possible by simple hand-lay-up technique. Similarly, glass micro-sphere filled polypropylene composites can be fabricated by injection/compression molding routes.

40|$|Economic, environmental, and {{engineering}} benefits have motivated {{the implementation of}} warm mix asphalt (WMA) in the United States. While asphalt foaming {{has become the most}} popular method for producing WMA, concerns remain about the performance of foamed asphalt mixtures due to the use of water in the foaming process. Along with the advent of WMA, recent changes in asphalt mixture components and production parameters have raised the need to review the current design practices and evaluation methods for asphalt mixtures, including the effects of aging. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to evaluate the aging characteristics of asphalt mixtures and to explore asphalt foaming technology for WMA applications. Aging of asphalt mixtures occurs during production and construction and continues throughout the service life of pavements. In this study, laboratory short-term aging protocols were evaluated in terms of simulating the asphalt aging and aggregate absorption that occurs during plant production and pavement construction. In addition, the concepts of cumulative degree-days and mixture property ratios were proposed to quantify field aging and to explore its correlation with laboratory long-term aging protocols in terms of mixture properties. Furthermore, the effects of various mixture components and production parameters on the aging characteristics of asphalt mixtures were investigated. Finally, post-construction cores obtained from several field projects were measured to explore mixture stiffness and binder property gradients in order to characterize the non-uniform field aging of asphalt pavements with depth. Asphalt foaming technology was also explored in this study via a comprehensive laboratory experiment. A non-contact test method consisting of a laser device and a digital camera was developed to measure the asphalt foaming process in terms of volume expansion and collapse and evolution of asphalt foam bubbles. In addition, novel test methods were proposed to evaluate the workability and <b>coatability</b> for foamed asphalt mixtures. The proposed test methods were then utilized to investigate the effects of foaming water content and laboratory foamer type on asphalt foaming characteristics and foamed mixture properties. Finally, a mix design procedure for foamed asphalt mixtures was proposed and validated with field and laboratory data...|$|E
