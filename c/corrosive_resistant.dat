Both were of similar dimensions and slightly curved to sit comfortably on the hip. As a result, the M1956 canteen cover was not fundamentally different from the earlier models {{with the exception of the}} use of two slide keepers in lieu of a wire hanger and metal snaps for closure instead of lift-the-dot fasteners. Constructed of heavy canvas with cloth-taped edges the M-1956 canteen cover had a synthetic wool felt lining for insulation, and was slightly oversized to accommodate both a canteen and the metal canteen cup in which it nested. Covers produced after 1966 have nylon-taped edges. Typically canteen covers also demonstrate the most visible signs of age, fading easily due to continuous wetting and drying. Originally a single canteen and cover was issued and worn either on the belt between the Small Arms Ammunition Case at the front and the Field Pack (see below) at the rear, or mounted on the side of the Field Pack. Troops in Vietnam generally wore two or more canteens, and this practice largely continued after the war, as, with {{the adoption}} of larger complementary rucksacks (see Complementary Equipment below), Entrenching Tools (see below) often migrated to attachment points on the rucksack, freeing space on the pistol belt for another canteen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} works, where Inconel 718, a highly <b>corrosive</b> <b>resistant,</b> nickel-based super alloy, was finish-turning under high speed conditions. The machining processes were carried out at three different cutting conditions (DRY, MQL 50 ml/h and MQL 100 ml/h), three levels of cutting speed (Vc= 90, 120 and 150 m/min), two levels of feed rate (f= 0. 10 and 0. 15 mm/rev) and two levels of cutting depth (d= 0. 30 and 0. 50 mm). The tool wear and flank wear progression were monitored, measured and recorded progressively at various time intervals. The experiments indicated that MQL condition performs better than dry condition in term of tool life. Most of the tool failures during machining were due to gradual failure where abrasive and notching wear on the flank face was the dominant followed by, fracture on the flank edge and nose radius.

40|$|Due to low cost, {{light weight}} and {{corrosion}} resistant features, polymer heat exchangers have been extensively studied by researchers {{with the aim}} to replace metallic heat exchangers {{in a wide range}} of applications. Although the thermal conductivity of polymer material is generally lower than the metallic counterparts, the large specific surface area provided by the polymer hollow fibre heat exchanger (PHFHE) offers the same or even better heat transfer performance with smaller volume and lighter weight compared with the metallic shell-and-tube heat exchangers. This paper presents the construction and experimental investigations of polypropylene based polymer hollow fibre heat exchangers in the form of shell-and-tube. The measured overall heat transfer coefficients of such PHFHEs are in the range of 258 – 1675 W/m 2 K for water to water application. The effects of various parameters on the overall heat transfer coefficient including flow rates and numbers of fibres, the effectiveness of heat exchanger, the number of heat transfer unit (NTU), and the height of transfer unit (HTU) are also discussed in this paper.

This superior thermal performance together with its low cost, <b>corrosive</b> <b>resistant</b> and light weight features make PHFHEs potentially very good substitutes for metallic heat recovery system for building application...|$|E
30|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} commercial SOFCs {{are based}} on a combination of cermet anodes (e.g. Ni-YSZ) and ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte, most often yttria-stabilized zirconia (8 YSZ). They operate at temperatures within the region of 800 – 1000  °C, which allows utilization of the waste heat leading to higher fuel efficiency. Such operating temperatures require use of expensive <b>corrosive</b> <b>resistant</b> interconnects and are detrimental to the durability of the cell due to functional materials degradation. Consequently, the main barriers for the commercialization of SOFCs have been the high cost of production and their operational durability. Thus, the success of SOFC commercialization is critically dependent on the reduction of the operation temperature. However, lowering the operational temperatures leads to a significant drop in SOFC performance due to the increased polarization losses in the electrodes and the decreased ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. The strategies used to compensate for this effect, apart from lowering the electrolyte resistance by using thinner electrolytes, include a reduction of the polarization losses via electrodes nanoengineering [5]. Wet infiltration {{has been shown to be}} one of the most effective approaches in enhancing of the electrochemical activity of the anodes and cathodes. Nanodecoration of the electrode surface with particles of a mixed conducting oxide and metal promoters (e.g. gadolinium doped ceria, Ni, Pt, Pd, Cu) has been shown to be a successful method for lowering the operational temperatures and improving the long term stability of SOFCs [6, 7, 8]. The concept is based on the infiltration of precursor solutions into the porous electrode scaffold after the high temperature electrolyte sintering step. The formation of the nanoparticles is performed at relatively low temperatures with a simple heat treatment in air. The nanoparticles decoration effectively increases the triple phase boundary (TPB) length and catalyses the electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, the presence of oxide nanoparticles was shown to prevent scaffold particles coarsening and increase the resistance to poisoning from non-pure fuel gases.|$|E
40|$|Fire {{has been}} always {{a major concern}} for {{designers}} of steel and concrete structures. Designing fire-resistant structural elements {{is not an easy}} task due to several limitations such as the lack of fire-resistant construction materials. Concrete reinforcement cover and external insulation are the most commonly adopted systems to protect concrete and steel from overheating, while spalling of concrete is minimised by using HPFRC instead of standard concrete. Although these methodologies work very well for low rise concrete structures, {{this is not the case}} for high-rise and inaccessible buildings where fire loading is much longer. Fire can permanently damage structures that cost a lot of money. This is unsafe and can lead to loss of life. In this research, the author proposes a new type of main reinforcement for concrete structures which can provide better fire-resistance than steel or FRP re-bars. This consists of continuous braided fibre rope, generally made from fire-resistant materials such as carbon or glass fibre. These fibres have excellent tensile strengths, sometimes in excess of ten times greater than steel. In addition to fire-resistance, these ropes can produce lighter and <b>corrosive</b> <b>resistant</b> structures. Avoiding the use of expensive resin binders, fibres are easily bound together using braiding techniques, ensuring that tensile stress is evenly distributed throughout the reinforcement. In order to consider braided ropes as a form of reinforcement it is first necessary to establish the mechanical performance at room temperature and investigate the pull-out resistance for both unribbed and ribbed ropes. Ribbing of ropes was achieved by braiding the rope over a series of glass beads. Adhesion between the rope and concrete was drastically improved due to ribbing, and further improved by pre-stressing ropes and reducing the slacked fibres. Two types of material have been considered for the ropes: carbon and aramid. An implicit finite element approach is proposed to model braided fibres using Total Lagrangian formulation, based on the theory of small strains and large rotations. Modelling tows and strands as elastic transversely isotropic materials was a good assumption when stiff and brittle fibres such as carbon and glass fibres are considered. The rope-to-concrete and strand-to-strand bond interaction/adhesion was numerically simulated using newly proposed hierarchical higher order interface elements. Elastic and linear damage cohesive models were used effectively to simulate non-penetrative 'free' sliding interaction between strands, and the adhesion between ropes and concrete respectively. Numerical simulation showed similar de-bonding features when compared with experimental pull-out results of braided ribbed rope reinforced concrete...|$|E

Our project is directed with the help of Dr. Widmann and Dr. Taylor of the Mechanical Engineering and Kinesiology Departments respectively, at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Three students from the Mechanical Department and one student from the Kinesiology department have been tasked with the design of this unique mobility walker to assist a local 8 -year old Special Olympian. The walker makes use of lightweight materials, specialized balloon beach tires, and a very rigid frame to ensure safety, longevity and overall aesthetic appeal. This report details the idea generation, concept selection, calculations and design of a mobility walker for traversing the beach environment. The design that the team implemented is a direct influence from Sean’s current beach walker, his general purpose walker and other existing designs that were researched. Our final design was fabricated at a total cost of approximately $ 850, which was significantly reduced due to generous donations from multiple suppliers. Despite the success of our final product, a few minor improvements could be made to the design. The pipe fittings used to connect the various components of the frame are slightly too big and result in a loose fit with the tube. A new clamp could be selected to help eliminate any clearance that may affect the overall function and strength of the walker. In addition, the weight could be reduced through the use of thinner wall aluminum tube and the caster could be fabricated by bending thicker aluminum as opposed to the welded design we produced. A final recommendation for improvement is making the foam padding more secure by fastening it directly to the frame to eliminate chances of slipping while Sean is in the water. The primary features of the final design include: 1. High surface area, low pressure, polyurethane balloon tires that are specialized for beach environment are used to allow easy traverse across sand and other comparable terrain. In addition, they provide significant stability and buoyancy while in the water. 2. The handlebars can be adjusted to accommodate Sean’s growth. 3. The frame is powder coated and fastened using <b>corrosive</b> <b>resistant</b> hardware to prevent rust from developing, increasing the life and overall functionality of the walker. 4.

30|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) have been object of {{continuous}} research efforts for decades {{due to their}} highly efficient direct conversion of chemical energy into electricity, fuel flexibility and environmental benefits. The SOFC cover wide range of applications including stationary (MW) and auxiliary (kW) power units, {{combined heat and power}} installations and decentralised off-grid applications. Depending on the design SOFCs can operate at temperatures within the region of 600 – 1000  °C [1, 2]. The state-of-the-art commercial SOFCs are based on a combination of cermet anodes (e.g. Ni–YSZ) and ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte materials, most often yttria-stabilized zirconia (8 YSZ) or doped ceria (Gd:CeO 2). Both materials offer the required chemical and thermal stability in oxidizing and reducing atmospheres and good oxygen ionic conductivity over a wide range of conditions [3, 4]. The commonly used anode-supported SOFC design is based on porous cermets providing mechanical support and permeation path for the fuel and the reaction products. Ni–YSZ anodes are preferred due to their sufficient electrical conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as minimal chemical interaction with the electrolyte [5]. However, such supports having thicknesses of ~ 0.5 – 1.0  mm thickness can contribute significant cost due to the high-volume fraction of rare earth containing materials. In addition, the cermet electrodes are mechanically fragile and do not sustain thermal shock stresses. The operating temperatures of SOFCs at levels of 800 – 1000  °C introduce further limitations in SOFCs fabrication and operation. Such temperatures require utilization of expensive <b>corrosive</b> <b>resistant</b> interconnects and are detrimental to the durability of the cell causing functional materials degradation. As a consequence, the main barriers for SOFCs commercialization have been recognized as the high cost of production and the operational durability. Currently a shift towards intermediate temperatures (< 800  °C) is considered essential for the commercialization of SOFCs technology. The advantages of reduced-temperature operation also include systems design compactness and wider choice of materials [6]. The strategies for compensating the incurred drop in ionic conductivity include lowering the electrolyte resistance either by implementing thinner electrolyte or using higher ionic conductive materials as well as reduction of the potential interfacial polarization losses and enhancement of the electrochemical activity of the electrodes [7]. Lowering the operational temperature permits utilization of less expensive stainless steel as support and interconnector materials. Porous metal substrates with thicknesses of few hundreds of micrometers are advantageous for SOFCs since they provide good electrical conduction, high mechanical strength, favourable thermal distribution due to the high thermal conduction and as a consequence rapid start-up times [8, 9, 10]. Metal supported SOFCs can also enable conventional metal joining techniques in the stack assembly. Ferritic stainless steels offer well-matched thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) with commonly used ceramics (TEC 8 YSZ ∼  10.4 – 11.0  ppmK− 1, TECGDC ∼  12.7  ppmK− 1, TECNiO/YSZ ~  12.3  ppmK− 1 for an NiO/YSZ composite with 53 vol %NiO and TEC 430 L ∼  11.4  ppmK− 1) which is beneficial for withstanding repeated thermal stresses caused by rapid thermal cycling [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].|$|E
