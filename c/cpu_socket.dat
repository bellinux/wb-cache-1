25|$|The CPU can be {{upgraded}} to a Motorola 68010 directly or to a 68020, 68030 or 68040 via the side expansion slot or a <b>CPU</b> <b>socket</b> adapter board.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{not being}} {{multiplier}} locked, XP-Ms curiously were not disabled from multi processor operation. Thus {{they could be}} used in place of the more expensive Athlon MP in dual socket A motherboards. Since those boards generally lacked multiplier and voltage adjustment, and normally only supported 133MHz FSB, adjustments would still be needed for full speed operation. One method of modification known as wire-modding involves connecting the appropriate CPU pins on the <b>CPU</b> <b>socket</b> with small lengths of wire to select the appropriate multiplier. A typical overclock of a mobile 2500+ CPU to 2.26GHz with 17x multiplier would result in being faster than highest official 2800+ MP CPU running at 2.13GHz.|$|E

50|$|HyperTransport-connected devices can be {{installed}} in HTX slots or in Opteron <b>CPU</b> <b>sockets.</b> HTX slots are placed to allow access to external cabling {{and so are the}} natural location for network devices, such as the Qlogic Infinipath network adapter. As an alternative installation location, AMD <b>CPU</b> <b>sockets</b> provide access to the motherboard DRAM channels and support a larger power budget with room for the corresponding heat sink. In some system configurations, the <b>CPU</b> <b>sockets</b> provide access to multiple HyperTransport links that support higher frequencies than single 16-bit (per direction) 800 MHz link supported by the HTX slot.|$|R

2500|$|Sempron {{has been}} the {{marketing}} name used by AMD for several different budget desktop CPUs, using several different technologies and <b>CPU</b> <b>socket</b> formats. The Sempron replaced the AMD Duron processor and competes against Intel's Celeron series of processors. AMD coined the name from the Latin , which means [...] "always", to suggest the Sempron is suitable for [...] "daily use, practical, and part of everyday life".|$|E
2500|$|The Amiga 500 also sports {{an unusual}} feature for a budget machine, {{socketed}} chips, which allow easy replacement of defective chips. The CPU {{can be directly}} upgraded on the motherboard to a 68010; or to a 68020, 68030, or 68040 via the side expansion slot; or by removing the CPU and plugging a CPU expansion card into the <b>CPU</b> <b>socket</b> (though this will require opening the computer and voiding any remaining warranty). [...] In fact, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the Amiga Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) versions.|$|E

50|$|<b>CPU</b> <b>sockets</b> {{are used}} on the {{motherboard}} in desktop and server computers. As they allow easy swapping of components, they are also used for prototyping new circuits.

50|$|A <b>CPU</b> <b>socket</b> (central {{processing}} unit) or slot is {{an electrical}} component that attaches to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) {{and is designed}} to house a CPU (also called a microprocessor). It is a special type of integrated circuit socket designed for very high pin counts. A <b>CPU</b> <b>socket</b> provides many functions, including a physical structure to support the CPU, support for a heat sink, facilitating replacement (as well as reducing cost), and most importantly, forming an electrical interface both with the CPU and the PCB. CPU sockets on the motherboard can most often be found in most desktop and server computers (laptops typically use surface mount CPUs), particularly those based on the Intel x86 architecture. A <b>CPU</b> <b>socket</b> type and motherboard chipset must support the CPU series and speed.|$|E
