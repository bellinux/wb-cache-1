5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E

Fuel cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery-powered forklifts as they <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen and can be refueled in 3 minutes. Fuel cell-powered forklifts {{can be used in}} refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The FC units are often designed as drop-in replacements.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the books}} Ellis wrote after inventing REBT had a strong autobiographical element. He used anecdotes from his {{personal}} life {{to explain how the}} insights of REBT occurred to him and how they helped him cope with personal problems such as shyness, anger and chronic illness. He also used anecdotes from client sessions to illustrate how his therapy worked. Two of Ellis last books were explicitly autobiographical. Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me -- It <b>Can</b> <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> You (Prometheus Books, 2004) recounts his early life and crises in an unusually candid way. It illustrates the way he handled his problems, at first through philosophy, and later through the application of his emerging therapeutic skills and insights. All Out!: An Autobiography (Prometheus Books, 2009) —published after his death—is a more traditional narrative of his life and work (though it also meant to be an inspirational story of the use of rational thinking in self-help).|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{holistic}} planned grazing {{began in}} the 1960s when Allan Savory, a wildlife biologist in his native Southern Rhodesia, set out to understand desertification. This {{can be seen in}} the context of the larger environmental movement. Heavily influenced by the work of André Voisin and the ineffectiveness of mainstream rangeland science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human impoverishment that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural herds of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds. Livestock could be substituted to provide important ecosystem services like nutrient cycling when mimicking those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers. But managers had found that while rotational grazing systems <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of the experiential with the experimental, as well as the social with the biophysical, to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems. None of these sources of knowledge could be understood except in the context of the whole. Holistic management was developed to meet that need.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have also}} derided that the film's [...] "bad" [...] {{characters}} {{appear to be}} exaggerated in appearance, overweight, drawn with dark skin, large noses and damaged teeth, while Jasmine's skin tone remains lighter in comparison. Slim in stature, Jasmine also lacks obvious character flaws in both her personality and speech Jasmine. Uprooting Racism: How White People <b>Can</b> <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> Racial Justice Ð 3rd Edition author Paul Kivel dubbed this [...] "racial coding", a practice also {{believed to have been}} used to differentiate the good from bad characters in Disney's The Lion King (1994). According to Debating Disney: Pedagogical Perspectives on Commercial Cinema author Douglas Brode, Aladdin [...] "perpetuates the same racial pyramid" [...] present in most of Disney's films, observing that Jasmine, Aladdin and the Sultan – characters at high up on the social hierarchy – appear to be the film's [...] "whitest" [...] characters, while the villainous Jafar speaks with a thick accent and exhibits far more Arabian features. Brode accused Jasmine of [...] "perpetuat damaging stereotypes." [...] Observing that [...] "underneath their multicultural skin [...] all conform to the white, middle-class, thin, feminine ideal of beauty", Gary Burns, author of A Companion to Popular Culture, accused Jasmine of being [...] "an American-accented girl... who battles the traditions of older, heavily accented, traditional Arabs." [...] Despite Disney's attempt to accurately portray the culture of the time period during which the film is set such as a lack of women in powerful positions, Isabel Santaolalla, author of [...] "New" [...] Exoticisms: Changing Patterns in the Construction of Otherness, agreed that Jasmine remains [...] "a vehicle for contemporary gender politics in America" [...] despite her Middle Eastern appearance, explaining, [...] "the film's PC credibility is reserved for Jasmine, but this feistiness probably reflects developments in America more than the realities of 1990s Basrah or Baghdad." [...] Critics also did not appreciate the scene in which Jasmine nearly gets her hand cut off by a merchant as punishment for unintentionally stealing an apple.|$|E

2500|$|Managed {{intensive}} {{rotational grazing}} paints a wide brush over many different managed grazing systems. Managers {{have found that}} rotational grazing systems <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> diverse management purposes, but scientific experiments have demonstrated that rotational grazing systems do not always necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. [...] This controversy stems from two main categorical differences in rotational grazing, prescribed management and adaptive management. [...] The performance of rangeland grazing strategies are similarly constrained by several ecological variables establishing that differences among them are dependent {{on the effectiveness of}} those management models. Depending on the management model, plant production {{has been shown to be}} equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 87% of the experiments.|$|E
