500|$|Pauline Kael was {{a fairly}} vocal critic of Moore's, dismissing him as an [...] "iceberg" [...] in The Man with the Golden Gun. In {{reviewing}} For Your Eyes Only, she wrote [...] "Roger Moore is Bond again, and his idea of Bond's imperturbable cool {{is the same as}} playing dead". Reviewing Moonraker, she wrote [...] "Roger Moore is dutiful and passive as Bond; his clothes are neatly pressed and he shows up for work, like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension". Only in The Spy Who Loved Me, one of Kael's favourite Bond films, did she praise him describing him as self-effacing: [...] "Moore gets the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> scaredan emotion that suits him and makes him more likable".|$|E
500|$|Despite Volition's {{interest}} {{and desire to}} develop add-ons and expansions for FreeSpace 2, Interplay told them to stop. Volition was then acquired by THQ in 2000. As Interplay owns {{the rights to the}} FreeSpace series (as well as the Descent series) and Volition's owners, THQ, is only interested in pursuing development on what they own, Volition was unable to continue developing the FreeSpace franchise. Faced with source code which became practically useless to them, Volition released the source code for only game engines to the public under a noncommercial license on April 25, 2002. Mike Kulas, the President of Volition, said this was to give those outside the game industry a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the code of a commercial software product, a desire he and Matt Toschlog had when they were not yet in the industry. In the years since, no sequels to FreeSpace 2 have been made and Interplay has only published a limited re-release of it on February 2, 2004, to commemorate the company's 20th anniversary. [...] Interplay, by that time, was in financial trouble, failing to pay rent and wages to its workers. [...] Seeking investors to inject it with funds, Interplay changed business strategies: instead of developing and publishing single-player games, it sold licenses to those games and looked towards developing massive multi-player online games. Derek Smart, creator of Battlecruiser 3000AD, had casually mentioned his interest in the Freespace license, but nothing significant came out of this. In 2013, Interplay acquired the remaining rights to the FreeSpace franchise for $7,500 after THQ went to bankruptcy court.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2016, {{brothers}} David (Takaya Honda) and Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano) {{appeared in}} three webisodes {{ahead of their}} introduction to the main show. The series focuses on the brothers' road trip {{on the way to}} Erinsborough, where they were joined by Leo's friend and love interest Milly (Eliza Charley). The webisodes also give viewers a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at David and Leo's [...] "brotherly dynamic".|$|E
60|$|Stephen hesitated, {{uncertain}} whether to laugh, until he <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Virginia. She had pursed her lips.|$|R

It's bleak because I can't — many of us can't hear her sweet voice — but it's great because she did live, and she was ours. I mean African-Americans and white Americans and Asians, Spanish-speaking — she belonged to us and that's a great thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who knows {{but what}} I {{may go to}} work to-morrow, and then I won't get much <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> around," [...] he {{reasoned}} to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we've got {{half a dozen}} good rowboats, as well {{as several}} racing shells," [...] {{answered}} Spouter. [...] "You'll probably get a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> them over later." ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{had moved}} {{to the rear of the}} cottage, under a wide-spreading tree, when Dick <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> toward the roadway and uttered an exclamation: ...|$|R

60|$|Snap {{was within}} {{a hundred yards}} of {{the man with the}} sled when the latter <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> around. At once the youth yelled at him.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't dare go {{over there}} except {{very early in the}} morning before Farmer Brown's folks are awake," [...] said he, [...] "so I haven't had much <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for it." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{the lights}} were turned on the cadets had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> around the showhouse. They thought that {{possibly}} {{some of the girls}} from Clearwater Hall might be present, but they were disappointed.|$|E
60|$|As {{we came to}} this verse, I <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up from my book {{towards the}} swarm of black-coated pensioners: and amongst them--amongst them--sate Thomas Newcome.|$|R
60|$|He {{was drawing}} {{his hand from}} his breast; the {{prisoner}} <b>chancing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something.|$|R
6000|$|They {{walked on}} more slowly, {{and at the}} {{entrance}} to a lane came to another halt. Then, <b>chancing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into the lane, Dave uttered a short cry: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the best}} part of it--to me. I hate to stay in one place all the while. Besides"--Matt lowered his voice--"it will give me a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for my father, if he is still alive." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Put {{down that}} gun. I {{want to ask}} you some questions. I haven’t had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> around yet. What place is this? How is the Ghost lying? How did you get wet? Where’s Maud?—I beg your pardon, Miss Brewster—or should I say, ‘Mrs. Van Weyden’?” ...|$|E
60|$|When there, she <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{towards the}} promontory. Instantly {{she opened her}} eyes and mouth and uttered a squeal that brought her friends running to her side.|$|R

60|$|He {{was going}} on, in his enthusiasm, when, <b>chancing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at his companion, {{he saw that}} he had covered his face with his hands, and that tears were {{stealing}} out between his fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Crow didn't {{give me any}} <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{around after}} he saw me eyeing Jimmy, for he called me up {{to the foot of}} the tree, and all hands crowded near, as if I were the fellow who was having a trial, instead of being only a witness.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, I’ve {{not done}} {{anything}} about that yet, though perhaps it won’t be very long before I find a wife. I {{am not going to}} apply to go on service again for a time, so I’ll have a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> round, though I really have one in my mind’s eye.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, none," [...] {{she said}} at once; {{and when he was}} sure of it, but never until he was sure, he would give his mind a little holiday; and then, perhaps, those candid eyes would rest searchingly upon him, but always with a brave smile ready should he <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up.|$|E
60|$|Presently, <b>chancing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in the {{direction}} of the automobile house, Dave saw somebody skulking along a hedge. The person was visible only a second, so the youth could not make out who it was.|$|R
60|$|All waited, {{and while}} doing so, Dave and Todd took the {{opportunity}} to reload. They were just finishing when Phil, <b>chancing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> behind them, uttered a yell that would have done credit to an Apache Indian.|$|R

60|$|Before leaving Manila Larry had {{purchased}} {{a number of}} newspapers printed in that city in English.

60|$|They did pull, {{and soon}} came {{closer to the}} craft ahead. Then the negro <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back and saw them. He was evidently chagrined, and with out delay turned in toward shore, close to where the trees grew thick.|$|R
