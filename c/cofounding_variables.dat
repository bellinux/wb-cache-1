40|$|International audienceGSTM 1 and GSTT 1 polymorphisms {{have been}} {{proposed}} in relationship with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). We investigated the association between these polymorphisms and COPD (as well as its subtypes emphysema and chronic bronchitis) in 234 COPD patients and 182 healthy controls in the Tunisian population. Genotyping was performed using multiplex PCR. GSTM 1 -null genotype frequency was significantly higher in COPD patients than in controls (P = 0. 02); however, multivariate analysis of <b>cofounding</b> <b>variables</b> showed no independent association with this genotype (P = 0. 073). In contrast, the association of the GSTM 1 -null genotype with emphysema was significant, even after adjustment for risk factors (P = 0. 011). There {{were no significant differences in}} GSTT 1 genotypes between patients and controls. The GSTM 1 null allele is likely not an independent risk factor for COPD but is related to emphysema, whereas the GSTT 1 gene is not associated with the disease...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: While early-onset {{neonatal}} GBS sepsis {{is positively}} associated with premature birth and prolonged rupture of membranes, there is debate in the literature as to whether maternal GBS colonization is a predictor of adverse obstetric outcome. This is a critical issue to resolve for appropriate management (expectant vs. interventional management) of the patient presenting with premature rupture of membranes, who has no overt signs of sepsis, but who is colonized with GBS. Methods: Since 1981 it has been hospital policy to screen all public patients antenatally for genital carriage of GBS by collection of a low vaginal swab at 28 - 32 weeks. All patients colonized with GBS antenatally are given penicillin as intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. Review of all GBScolonized antenatal patients for a 12 -month period (580 of 4, 495 patients) and a randomized (every fourth consecutive antenatal patient) number of noncolonized patients (958) was made. Lower vaginal GBS colonization and other risk factors for preterm delivery were assessed using univariate and multivariate generalized linear modeling. Results: In the study group, the maternal GBS colonization rate was 12. 9 %. When <b>cofounding</b> <b>variables</b> were controlled in a multivariate analysis, the association between antepartum GBS colonization and preterm labor and preterm rupture of membranes was not significant. Conclusion: Maternal antenatal carriage of GBS does not predict preterm labor. Therefore it is appropriate that expectant management occur for a GBS-colonized woman who ruptures her membranes, is not in labor, and has no evidence of sepsis. Infect. Dis. Obstet.

40|$|Background: Admission {{hyperglycemia}} {{is associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality in trauma patients. However, admission hyperglycemia is not only associated with stress-induced hyperglycemia (SIH) but also with diabetic hyperglycemia (DH); furthermore, patients with normoglycemia may not only have non-diabetic normoglycemia (NDN) but also have a possibility of diabetic normoglycemia (DN), with the diabetes under control. This study aimed to assess the effects of SIH and DH on the mortality outcomes of traumatic femoral fracture patients with NDN and DN. Methods: Admission hyperglycemia was diagnosed as a serum glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL upon arrival at the emergency department. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was determined by patient history and/or admission HbA 1 c ≥ 6. 5 %. DH and SIH were diagnosed by admission hyperglycemia in patients with and without DM. DN and NDN were determined by absence of admission hyperglycemia in patients with and without DM. These patients were allocated into four groups: SIH (n = 75), DH (n = 280), DN (n = 309), and NDN (n = 1326), with detailed information retracted from the Trauma Registry System at a level I trauma center between 1 January 2009, and 31 December 2016. Patients with incomplete registered data were excluded. The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality were estimated through a stepwise model selection of a multiple regression model that was adjusted by controlling the <b>cofounding</b> <b>variables</b> such age, sex, co-morbidities, and Injury Severity Score. Results: Compared to NDN, a 9. 8 -fold (95 % CI 1. 54 – 62. 05; p = 0. 016) and a 5. 8 -fold (95 % CI 1. 46 – 22. 67; p = 0. 012) increase in the adjusted mortality odds ratio of patients with SIH and DH, respectively, were found in this study. In addition, the adjusted odds of mortality between SIH (AOR = 0. 3; 95 % CI 0. 03 – 2. 99; p = 0. 302) as well as DH patients (AOR = 0. 6; 95 % CI 0. 20 – 1. 89; p = 0. 394) and DN patients had no significant difference. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that SIH and DH patients with traumatic femoral fractures had higher mortality when compared with NDN patients, but not when compared with DN patients, with or without adjustment {{of the differences in}} patient’s age, sex, co-morbidities, and injury severity...|$|E
30|$|Trainees and novice {{drivers were}} {{distinguished}} in two clusters, as trainees constitute the main driver cohort {{that is being}} addressed in driving skills evaluation field. Experienced drivers, on the other hand, are those that most frequently selected to participate in research regarding the evaluation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in comparison to novice drivers who, being {{more familiar with the}} new technologies, tend to be overconfident and trust excessively in it. Elderly drivers were not selected in the cluster of the experienced drivers, {{due to the fact that}} they require higher fidelity driving simulators in comparison to young or middle aged drivers (field of view of 120 – 180 ° is required), whereas above 50  years old, their susceptibility to simulator sickness is significantly increasing [29]. Also, in the biggest age range, age is linearly correlated to driving experience [30], whereas differentiations that are solely related to age begin after the age of 60 – 65  years old [30 – 34]. Therefore, and since it was difficult to recruit elderly inexperienced drivers, age of the drivers was not selected to be a separate <b>cofounding</b> <b>variable</b> for this experiment.|$|R
