50|$|LeSEA {{president}} Peter Sumrall (the son of late founder Dr. Lester Sumrall) appointed veteran {{television and}} <b>cable</b> <b>manager</b> Dean Powery to become WHNO's general manager in May 2007. Under Powery, the station increased its staff and upgraded its programming from its post-Katrina low {{to turn it}} into a more competitive station in the New Orleans market; Powery also reconnected with local ministries, added newer syndicated programming and local college football games to WHNO's schedule and expanded the station's production capabilities. In 2011, LeSEA Broadcasting acquired the locally based independent sports website SportsNOLA.com from NewOrleans.com.|$|E
5000|$|While {{helping his}} {{students}} apply for jobs with local media companies, {{he got to}} know the <b>cable</b> TV <b>managers</b> in the surrounding communities. He also noticed that, at that time, unlike cable companies in the larger markets, such as Sacramento and Fresno, local cable networks were not carrying local advertising.|$|R

5000|$|Aunty Jack {{was created}} for a {{proposed}} ABC Radio children's radio series, [...] "The Aunty Jack Show", commissioned by Paddy Conroy (former head of ABC TV and now <b>cable</b> channel <b>manager).</b> It was intended to replace the long-running children's radio series The Argonauts Club, which {{was about to be}} cancelled. The new series never went to air because ABC executives felt that the Aunty Jack character and some of Grahame's songs were [...] "inappropriate" [...] for young listeners.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} BAT House, Lyons Cottage {{was built by}} Harold Edward George Snell in 1925 as {{accommodation}} for staff of the “Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company,” better known as British Australia Telegraph, who operated the underwater cable connecting Australia to Britain. Its construction followed {{the completion of the}} Overland Telegraph Line in 1872 which linked Adelaide to Darwin and then onto London via an underwater cable to Java. This ended Australia’s isolation from the outside world, and a letter that once physically took three months to travel from London to Sydney via ship, could be telegraphed in less than seven hours using the Overland Telegraph Line. A number of <b>cable</b> company <b>managers,</b> engineers and their families occupied the cottage.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2009, Pfizer {{decided to}} settle its legal {{case with the}} 200 plaintiffs. An {{out-of-court}} settlement was reached and will be put in writing at a meeting scheduled {{to take place in}} Rome, Italy in March 2009. The settlement followed months of negotiations between Pfizer and the Kano state government which represented the plaintiffs.

5000|$|Between 2002 and 2005 {{the victims}} of the Trovan tests in Nigeria filed a series of {{unsuccessful}} lawsuits in the United States. However, in January 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the Nigerian victims and their families were entitled to bring suit against Pfizer in the United States under the Alien Tort Statute. A US$75 million settlement with the State of Kano was reached on July 30, 2009. Additionally two lawsuits also remain pending in New York, United States.

40|$|Early spring 2010 we {{conducted}} a web survey and an interactive workshop among the current user community of the large scale topographic reference database (GRB) in Flanders, Belgium. The aim was {{to find out more}} about the needs and expectations of this community for 3 D-data and 3 D-capabilities. Several subgroups were addressed including administrators at regional, provincial and municipal level, <b>cable</b> and pipeline <b>managers,</b> contractors and road designers, surveyors and urban planners, representatives of the software industry and of education and research. The results reveal that 3 D-visualisation is high on the list of all subgroups while more specific requirements are subgroup-specific. It is acknowledged that in order to address this variety of expectations, 3 D-data model, data acquisition and database implementation must be developed in an iterative and progressive approach leading to flexible and extensible solutions. 1...|$|R
2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other <b>cable</b> channels. Former <b>manager</b> Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong {{when you go to the}} closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|R
