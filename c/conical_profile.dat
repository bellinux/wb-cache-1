Mount Bandai is formed of several {{overlapping}} stratovolcanoes, the largest of which is O-Bandai forming a complex volcano. O-Bandai volcano was constructed within a horseshoe-shaped caldera that formed about 40,000 years when an earlier volcano collapsed, forming the Okinajima debris avalanche, which traveled to the southwest and was accompanied by a plinian eruption. Four major phreatic eruptions have occurred during the past 5,000 years, two of them in historical time, in 806 and 1888. Seen from the south, Bandai presents a <b>conical</b> <b>profile,</b> but much of {{the north side of the}} volcano is missing as a result of the collapse of Ko-Bandai volcano during the 1888 eruption, in which a debris avalanche buried several villages and formed several large lakes.|$|E

First, they recognized a fissure eruption phase of Plinian-subPlinian fissure eruptions that deposited more than [...] of pyroclastic rocks and a few basaltic lava flows. These volcanic rocks were erupted from approximately north northwest–south southeast-trending extensional faults and fissures prior to the development of Mount Ararat. Second, a cone-building phase began when the volcanic activity became localized at a point along a fissure. During this phase, the eruption of successive flows of lava up to [...] thick and pyroclastic flows of andesite and dacite composition and later eruption of basaltic lava flows, formed the Greater Ararat cone with a low <b>conical</b> <b>profile.</b> Third, during a climatic phase, copious flows of andesitic and basaltic lavas were erupted. During this phase, the current cones of Greater and Lesser Ararat were formed as eruptions along subsidiary fissures and cracks and flank occurred. Finally, the volcanic eruptions at Mount Ararat transitioned into a flank eruption phase during which a major north–south-trending fault offset the two cones developed along with a number of subsidiary fissures and cracks on the volcano's flanks. Along this fault and the subsidiary fissures and cracks, a number of parasitic cones and domes were built by minor eruptions. One subsidiary cone erupted voluminous basalt and andesite lava flows. They flowed across the Doğubeyazıt plain and along the southerly flowing Sarısu River. These lava flows formed black ʻaʻā and pāhoehoe lava flows that contain well preserved lava tubes. The radiometric dating of these lava flows yielded radiometric ages of 0.4, 0.48 and 0.81 Ma. Overall, radiometric ages obtained from the volcanic rocks erupted by Mount Ararat range from 1.5 to 0.02 Ma.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{simulations}} of solar convection in spherical shells {{are used to}} evaluate the differential rotation that results as thermal boundary conditions are varied. In some simulations a latitudinal entropy variation is imposed at the lower boundary in order {{to take into account the}} coupling between the convective envelope and the radiative interior through thermal wind balance in the tachocline. The issue is whether the baroclinic forcing arising from tachocline-induced entropy variations can break the tendency for numerical {{simulations of}} convection to yield cylindrical rotation <b>profiles,</b> unlike the <b>conical</b> <b>profiles</b> deduced from helioseismology. As the amplitude of the imposed variation is increased, cylindrical rotation profiles do give way to more <b>conical</b> <b>profiles</b> that exhibit nearly radial angular velocity contours at midlatitudes. <b>Conical</b> rotation <b>profiles</b> are maintained primarily by the resolved convective heat flux, which transmits entropy variations from the lower boundary into the convective envelope, giving rise to baroclinic forcing.

30|$|A {{differential}} transform {{method to}} analyze stationary heat conduction through homogeneous extended surfaces with negligible heat loss {{from the tip}} has been presented. The major conclusion of this work is that for stationary heat conduction through extended surfaces, the DTM solution can be obtained in a closed series solution which does not necessitate an iterative method such as the Newton–Raphson methods for {{the determination of the}} initial value of temperature transform function. The proposed method is shown to converge with a few Taylor series for both low and high values of the thermal length characteristic parameter. Application of the present DTM solution to longitudinal fins of rectangular and triangular profiles and pins of cylindrical and <b>conical</b> <b>profiles</b> show an excellent agreement with exact results. For all cases studied, the magnitude of temperature decreases with increasing thermal length characteristic parameter. This indicates that the loss of heat from extended surfaces is more significant for low convection coefficient of the cooling fluid than that for extended surfaces with high thickness and conduction coefficient.|$|R

40|$|The {{instability}} {{caused by}} the <b>conical</b> (or <b>profiled)</b> shape of a solid-axle railway wheelset can be overcome by proper design of the vehicle's primary suspension system but is generally difficult {{as some of the}} wheelset parameters, namely the conicity and creep coefficients, are time-varying. To maintain the wheelset stability at high speeds and satisfactory curving performance simultaneously over the whole range of the parameters' variations, the self-tuning linear-quadratic regulator (S-T LQR) for the primary suspension system of a high-speed two-axle railway vehicle has been developed. The objective of the controller was to minimize the lateral displacement of the wheelset relative to track centerline and its yaw angle, on straight and curved tracks. The Continuous-time Least-Absolute Error with Variable Forgetting Factor (C-T LAE+VFF) estimation algorithm has been used to estimate the wheelset parameters before being used in the calculation of the linear quadratic feedback control gain matrix. The simulation results show that the S-T LQR performed better than the fixed-gain LQR for both the <b>conical</b> and <b>profiled</b> wheelset, suggesting that the ability to estimate the time-varying wheelset parameters and use them in the feedback controller design is necessary to produce better primary suspension control performance...|$|R

30|$|The {{literature}} presents several quasi-analytical {{methods for}} analyzing heat transfer problems in extended surfaces. The different quasi-analytical methods, which used an iterative method {{such as the}} Newton–Raphson {{for the evaluation of}} an undetermined parameter, are applied mostly for nonlinear problems. On the other hand, the solution of linear problems is generally obtained as a particular case of nonlinear problems. The contribution of the present work is to present close-form series solution of the homogeneous extended surface heat diffusion equation using the differential transform method. This can be a useful strategy in developing an analytical solution when designing practical extended surfaces with suitable geometry for temperature response. The proposed differential transform solution uses a set of mathematical operations to transform the heat conduction equation together with the fin profile in order to yield a close-form series of homogeneous extended surface heat diffusion equation which avoid using an iterative method. The homogeneous extended surfaces in the forms of longitudinal fins of rectangular and triangular profiles and pins of cylindrical and <b>conical</b> <b>profiles</b> are attached to a primary surface at constant temperature heat losses by convection to the surrounding medium and where the heat loss from the tip of the extended surfaces is assumed to be negligible.

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} {{influence}} of the variation {{in the shape of the}} pits for the two-dimensional optical storage (TwoDOS) paradigm vis-à-vis the readback signal and decoding performance. The algorithm used for decoding is a message-passing based joint equalization and decoding algorithm proposed by Singla and O’Sullivan (Intl. Symp. Info. Theory, Sept. 2005). The performance dependence of the algorithm on pit shape is studied by comparing the noise-tolerance thresholds for the algorithm. The TwoDOS model under consideration also includes two forms of media noise: pit-position noise, arising due to the deviation in the location of the pits from their intended positions and pit-size noise, arising due to variations in the radii of the pits. It is shown that as the shape of the pit changes from the ideal cylindrical shape towards a conical shape there is a sharp decrease in the range of the signal intensity. This decrease in the range leads to increased signal folding which is detrimental for the decoding algorithm. However, we show that when the ratio of the area of the pit to the area of the hexagonal bit cell is large (∼ 1) then the extent of signal folding for a <b>conical</b> <b>profile</b> is actually less than that of a cylindrical profile. Then, in this case, the performance of the decoder for a <b>conical</b> <b>profile</b> is better than for a cylindrical profile. I...|$|E
