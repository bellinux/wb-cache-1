40|$|Inverted base {{pavements}} {{involve a}} well-compacted granular aggregate base built between a thin asphalt concrete layer and a <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base.</b> Inverted base pavements {{can be constructed}} using conventional equipment and procedures but require proper quality control. This study reviews the extensive South African experience and case histories in the USA. Accumulating evidence suggests that inverted base pavements are a viable alternative and can outperform conventional pavements at a lower cost. Inverted base pavements rely on the complementary interaction between layers. The <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base</b> provides a stiff foundation for efficient compaction and constrains the deformation of the stress-sensitive granular aggregate base. The thin asphalt surface layer deforms as a membrane and develops low tensile stress. Additional large-scale field tests should be conducted to assess the performance of inverted base pavement designs {{in a wide range}} of conditions relevant to the USA...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that the {{strength}} of cement-treated soil increases {{over the course of several}} years. In general, the long-term increase in strength is attributed to the pozzolanic reaction between the cement paste and the soil. The carbonation of cementitious material can also increase its strength. In this study, the effect of carbonation of cement-treated sand on its strength was investigated. Specimens of cement-treated Toyoura silica sand were cured under three conditions: sealed, natural, and accelerated carbonation. The CO 2 concentrations under the three curing conditions were 0 %, 0. 03 %, and 5 %, respectively. The measured strengths of the specimens cured under sealed conditions were almost constant after 28 days, whereas those of the specimens cured under the natural and accelerated conditions increased beyond 28 days because of carbonation. These results indicate that carbonation is one of the main reasons for the long-term increase in the strength of <b>cement-treated</b> sand. <b>Based</b> on thermal analysis, the effect of the CO 2 concentration on the strength and elastic modulus can be explained by the formation of CaCO 3...|$|R
40|$|The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) {{recently}} completed a study to evaluate the performance of edge drain systems placed along portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. To date, a variety of edge drain designs, backfill materials, and placement methods have been used and have resulted in {{varying degrees of success}} when measured against overall pavement performance. This study investigated several different types of edge drain systems that have been used by Caltrans. Their performance was evaluated, and it was observed that more than 70 percent of the surveyed edge drains were not performing efficiently or as designed. This poor overall result can be attributed to design flaws, improper construction practices, and lack of maintenance. Generally, the performance of originally constructed edge drains was better than retrofit projects, since originally constructed edge drains are generally equipped with larger diameter drain pipes, deeper trenches, and treated permeable bases. Edge drain trenches in retrofit projects are generally not deep enough to effectively collect all infiltrated water from the PCC and base layers. The geotextile filter fabric materials found in excavated projects are not soil-specific, which can cause clogging and eventually reduce the ability of these edge drains to allow free flow of water. Improper construction practices, such as high percentages of cement in <b>cement-treated</b> permeable <b>base</b> backfill material and improper placement of geo-fabric material were observed in a few of the surveyed edge drain projects. Among surveyed projects, more than 50 percent of the edge drain outlet pipes were either buried or clogged, which can be attributed to lack of maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 1991 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 19 - 20, 1991, Athens, Georgia. Water {{resources}} {{management in}} Georgia {{has taken on}} new importance {{over the last few}} years because of a series of years where below-normal rainfall has occurred. Georgia on the average receives approximately 49 inches of rainfall a year (NOAA, 1988). Thus the problem is not one of quantity but of collection and storage. Man-made reservoirs are an important source for water supply but are becoming more difficult to site because of environmental regulations. Today's planners and designers must be innovative in their approach with designing dams and the operation of the reservoirs. During the last decade a relatively new technology has been adapted for use in new gravity dam construction and for the rehabilitation of existing dams and spillways. This technology, called roller compacted concrete (RCC), although still in its infancy, is growing rapidly. Because RCC is a relatively new technique in dam construction, its technology is currently being developed and tested by various private and government organizations. RCC is defined as a no-slump consistency concrete that is placed in thin horizontal lifts and compacted by vibratory rollers. RCC should not be confused with soil cement or <b>cement-treated</b> graded aggregate <b>base.</b> Although similar, RCC, as used in dam construction, must have engineering properties that are very similar to cast-in-place concrete after it has set and cured. Major differences still exist among designers as to the best methods for placing the material, treatment of cold joints, mix consistency and proportions. Efforts are underway to develop standards, particularly test procedures, for determining mix density and consistency. As of the date of this paper, each designer of an RCC dam project develops his own technique, drawing from the successful experiences of previous projects. Sponsored by U. S.

40|$|A mechanistic-empirical {{pavement}} design method is developed characterising <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base</b> layers for {{pavement design}} in Nigeria or other similar tropical and subtropical countries. Asphalt Concrete surface, Subbase and Aggregate base were characterised based on back calculation data from Claros et al (1986) while <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base</b> layer {{was based on}} modulus tests that had been conducted by past researchers. Failure criteria for the Asphalt Concrete fatigue failure and the subgrade rutting failure were based on those by Claros and Ijeh (1987) for Nigerian pavements. Cracking criterion used for the cement-treated layer was that developed by Otee et al. (1982). The comparison between the Soil-Cement and Aggregate base showed that at a low Equivalent Single Axle Load (ESAL) (0. 5 million repetitions was considered), the use of Aggregate base was better than Soil-Cement base. That for Aggregate base and Cement-Treated Gravel Base showed that the Cement-Treated Gravel Base {{was better than the}} Aggregate base at high ESAL (2. 5 million repetitions was considered) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reflective crack {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{technical}} problems in highway with semi-rigid base, studying its formatting mechanism is of great significance. By means of a numerical analysis method named RFPA, formatting process of reflective crack such as initiation and expansion was studied in asphalt pavement with semi-rigid base. Two-dimensional model of asphalt pavement with <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base</b> was established based on mechanical parameters, thickness and homogeneity of commonly used structural layer in china, symmetrical and non-symmetrical load were both considered, and crack of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base</b> was set before loaded. First, reasons for crack initiation were studied below the bottom layer subjected to different types of loads. The conclusion showed crack under symmetrical load mainly due to pull destruction while crack under non-symmetrical load mainly due to shear failure. Then, crack expansion in asphalt layer subjected to different load numbers with different homogeneity material was studied. The result showed that with the increase of the load numbers, the deformation in the same level deformation grows continuously. Different homogeneity level of layer material has an important influence on crack expansion; higher homogeneity has better regularity...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of the road network in Sweden consists of flexible pavements. Only a small fraction is rigid pavements {{and the most recent}} concrete structure was built ten years ago. This creates a problem as the national experience and knowledge in terms of design and maintenance of rigid pavements is not maintained. It is therefore important to gather and adequately document the performance of existing concrete structures. One such structure is along the motorway E 6 close to Falkenberg on the southwest coast of Sweden built in 1993 - 1996. The structure is a 28 km long Jointed Plain Concrete Pavement (JPCP) resting on a <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base.</b> The climate in the area consists of a typical coastal climate with high precipitation and short, relatively warm summers and relatively cold winters with a high number of zero degree changes. Studded tire wear, normally contributing to a large extent to the total rut on the Swedish road network, is only 5 mm after these 20 years. However, the structure is suffering from longitudinal cracking along the outer wheel track that is thought to have been caused by the combined effects of erosion within the <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base,</b> resulting in cavities under the concrete slabs {{and the fact that the}} dowel bars are placed too low and thus reducing the load transfer mechanism between the slabs and acting as crack inducers...|$|E
40|$|For the {{rehabilitation}} of asphalt pavements the upper distressed layers are usually milled before overlaying to eliminate reflection cracking-related problems and to preserve the pavement geometry. This maintenance technique generates {{a large amount of}} reclaimed asphalt (RA) as a product of the milling operation. The recycling of RA in <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base</b> and subbase courses represents a valuable solution in terms of technical, economic and environmental benefits. However, the influence of RA on the mechanical properties of cement-treated materials (CTMs) is still not completely understood. As a consequence, CTMs using a high content of RA have not yet been widely applied. The present paper shows the findings of an experimental analysis on CTMs including 50 % and 80 % RA in comparison with the reference CTM consisting of 100 % mineral aggregates. In particular, indirect tensile tests and unconfined compressive tests were conducted to evaluate the resistance characteristics of the CTMs. In addition, complex modulus tests at and ultrasonic pulse velocity tests were performed to investigate the stiffness properties of CTMs. The investigation shows promising results as regards the use of high percentages of RA in CTMs and offers a substantial contribution for the understanding of the mechanical behaviour of CTM...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Because of {{the high}} {{strength}} and sound stability, the cement stabilized base has been widely used in high grade pavement in China. But shrinkage cracking are easy {{to occur in the}} cement stabilized base. Under the repeating action of traffic loads and temperature loads, this kind of cracks are easy to propagate towards the asphalt surface, being called “reflective crack”. Shrinkage cracks are not normally avertable in the cement stabilized base, in contrast with a few wide cracks of broad spacing, numerous thin cracks of narrow spacing contribute little to the severe reflection cracking. On the basis of this thinking, the pre-cracking technique as a promising approach is brought forward. Several vibratory roller passes to the <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base</b> at a short curing stage, typically 1 to 3 days after placement, to create a fine network of cracks, which avoids the wide and/or long cracks and creates the ideal crack model. Comparing to wide cracking, the degree of the stress concentration resulting from thin cracking is by far mitigated. The Finite Element Method is used to predict the ideal crack model, and then the mechanical responses of the semi-rigid pavement of single wide cracking and net hairline cracking under vehicle loading are numerically simulated, simultaneously compared and analyzed. The simulation analyses indicate that the pre-cracking technique is a very useful tool to mitigate the reflective cracks...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the details on}} the construction and preliminary load tests on an experimental pavement comprised of ten pre-cast slabs of the pavement known as the Super-Slab® System, installed {{at the intersection of}} I- 15 and SR 210, in San Bernardino County in southern California. The construction of the test section consisted of: (a) Construction of a <b>cement-treated</b> <b>base</b> (CTB), (b) Preparation of a sand bedding layer, (c) Placement of the pre-cast slabs, (d) Application of grout materials for the bedding and for the dowel/tie bars, (e) Diamond grinding the test pads, (f) Filling the joints, and (g) Construction of an asphalt concrete shoulder. Subgrade evaluation was carried out with a dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) and indicated a strong granular subgrade, with CBR (California Bearing Ratio) between 45 and 80. Average backcalculated elastic modulus for the CTB was about 2, 200 MPa (tested on the pre-cast panels) and presented great variation. Subgrade modulus was 70 MPa (tested on CTB, consistent with results of testing on pre-cast panels). FWD testing showed deflections of 0. 3 to 0. 6 mm on the slabs, which after grouting were reduced to approximately 0. 2 mm. The backcalculated elastic modulus of the concrete was found to be between 19, 000 and 23, 500 MPa (after grouting, averaging morning, and afternoon FWD data). Load Transfer Efficiency (LTE) values in the range of 5 % to 40 % were observed before grouting, and consistently near 100 % after grouting, revealing that the grouting process mobilized the dowel bars so that they provided effective LTE. The materials used for the dowel grout and for the bedding grout showed flexural strengths at 28 -days of 5. 1 and 1. 7 MPa, respectively. The slabs were instrumented with displacement sensors (vertical and horizontal) and with thermocouples. Thermal deformations were collected, and revealed that the slab curl reduced from a range of ± 1. 5 mm before grouting to ± 0. 5 mm after grouting. The responses to traffic load also improved greatly after grouting. The wheel-induced deflections at the transverse joint decreased to one-quarter of the initial value at the standard load of 60 kN (from about 1. 0 mm to 0. 25 mm). Rocking of the slabs, present before grouting, was also eliminated by grouting. Two HVS tests were performed on the ungrouted slabs and indicated that the Super-Slab® System is able to withstand at least 86, 500 ESALS in the ungrouted condition. This test was intended to simulate placement of the slabs without grouting during one nighttime closure, and then grouting the slabs during the next nighttime closure 24 hours later...|$|E
