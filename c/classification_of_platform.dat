40|$|AbstractThe {{state of}} mobile {{technology}} and its widespread use has evolved drastically {{within the past}} several years. Cell phones with small monochrome displays – designed solely for phone calls and text messaging – have turned into miniaturized computers with dual-core processors. Combined with 3 G standards such as UMTS, mobile devices nowadays offer almost the same freedom in exploring the Internet as desktop PCs do. Apple's iPhone, Google's Android, {{and the availability of}} mobile broadband Internet have changed the mobile landscape, and therefore the way in which mobile services are delivered to their users. Thus, we focus in this paper on the theory and implementation of four distinct platform models for mobile service delivery. Furthermore, we perform a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> agility features, business and technology oriented, along with a comparative analysis of their effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give a {{comprehensive}} understanding of the role and importance of e-catalogs in today’s e-commerce strategies. The main contribution of our work is a systematic approach towards the <b>classification</b> and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> and tools used for building e-Catalogs. Further we define e-catalogs in a broad sense and we examine the benefits introduced by their use. We attempt to make a general <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> e-catalog solutions, differentiating them in to three general models. These approaches represent the most common <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> e-catalogs in everyday use. After a short description of each model, a representative tool for each category is reviewed.

40|$|This {{document}} {{characterizes the}} structuring of interactive groupware applications according to {{various aspects of}} group activity and group orientation. The overall framework is used to systematize the relationship between groupware application needs and underlying distribution and communication support. The reviewing criteria, such as group dynamics, scaling and robustness requirements, are discussed {{within the context of}} each type of application. Furthermore, a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> groupware <b>platforms</b> is proposed based on a combination of general characteristics, the type of underlying support and the level at which it is provided. A selection of existing generic groupware platforms is presented illustrating the variety of design approaches and proposed features. Finally, this study is used to extract a number of issues which are considered to be important to enable further development of collaborative applications. Future directions of research are discussed highlighting the potential benefits of group-oriented systems for supporting the construction of collaborative applications...|$|R
40|$|Product {{placement}} {{has received}} considerable interest given {{the rise in}} new communications tools in recent times. This paper makes a primary contribution in that it posits a classificatory structure that incorporates both new and old-style media formats of product placement. An initial operational model is developed that will be tested through further qualitative and quantitative research phases. An experimental design identifying four <b>classifications</b> <b>of</b> media <b>platforms</b> is proposed {{as a means to}} address the research questions. This classification aims to highlight the distinctions between different media platforms based on a differing purpose of use {{and the manner in which}} consumers engage with each respective media platform. It is believed that by attaining a better understanding of these aspects of consumer behaviour a more thorough analysis of the brand image and meaning transfer process can be tested. Overall, this paper is explicitly presented to seek feedback regarding the classificatory framework developed and the preliminary operational model to be tested...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited: The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to investigate the effects of sensing capability on ground platform survivability during ground force maneuver operations. Sensor <b>classification</b> probability <b>of</b> ground <b>platforms</b> and speed <b>of</b> unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are the factors being studied, and the Map Aware Non-Uniform Automata (MANA) agent-based simulation software was {{used to create a}} hypothetical Ground Force Maneuver Operation Scenario for this exploration. A tailored Waterfall systems engineering process model guided the study in identifying alternatives which, other than increasing armor thickness, can improve platform survivability during ground force maneuver operations. The Nearly Orthogonal Latin Hypercube was the Design of Experiment methodology used to determine the number of design points to be simulated, and the results generated from the multiple simulation runs were analyzed using regression analysis and partition tree analysis.

40|$|Biological images often contain {{branching}} structures, {{especially those}} obtained from neural tissue. Neurons {{are known to}} fall into several types, but distinguishing these types is a continuing problem. Automatic <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> neuron type relies upon suitable measurements or features. Recently fractal dimension has been suggested as a useful feature. The fractal dimension {{is a measure of}} the complexity and selfsimilarity of an image, and is becoming accepted as a feature for automated <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> images having branching structures. Fractop is a web-based program designed to assist in the analysis of such images, but is applicable to any image.

40|$|Since {{the time}} when concept of e-maintenance was introduced, most of the works insisted on the {{relevance}} of the underlying Information and Communication Technologies infrastructure. Through a review of current e-maintenance conceptual approaches and realizations, this paper aims to reconsider the predominance of ICT within e-maintenance projects and literature. The review brings to light the importance of intelligence as a fundamental dimension of e-maintenance that is to be led in a holistic predefined manner rather than isolated efforts within ICT driven approaches. As a contribution towards an intelligence based e-maintenance conceptual framework, a proposal is outlined in this paper to model e-maintenance system as an intelligent system. The proposed frame is based on CogAff architecture for intelligent agents. Within the proposed frame, more importance was reserved to the environment that the system is to be continuously aware of: Plant Environment, Internal and External Enterprise Environment and Human Environment. In addition to the abilities required for internal coherent behavior of the system, requirements for maintenance activities support are also mapped within the same frame according to corresponding levels of management. A case study was detailed in this paper sustaining the applicability of the proposal in relation to the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> existing e-maintenance <b>platforms.</b> However, more work is needed to enhance exhaustiveness of the frame to serve as a comparison tool of existing e-maintenance systems. At the conceptual level, our future work is to use the proposed frame in an e-maintenance project. Comment: 16 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} role <b>of</b> digital <b>platforms</b> in the {{involvement}} of citizens in disaster response, relying on an analysis of metadata and of the structure <b>of</b> <b>classification.</b> It adopts the analytical apparatus of Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (Vygotsky, Leontiev, Engeström) {{and the notion of}} governmentality (Foucault) in order to conduct a critical comparative analysis <b>of</b> how crowdsourcing <b>platforms</b> construct the relationship between citizens and disasters. The article identifies three regimes <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> (informing, alerting and engagement) and explores the structures <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> for mobilization <b>of</b> citizens’ resources.
