5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a <b>commutator,</b> thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
25|$|Without a <b>commutator</b> to wear out, {{the life}} of a BLDC motor can be {{significantly}} longer compared to a DC motor using brushes and a <b>commutator.</b> Commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and RF noise; without a <b>commutator</b> or brushes, a BLDC motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{limitations}} of the classic <b>commutator</b> DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the <b>commutator.</b> This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between <b>commutator</b> sections. Depending on the <b>commutator</b> design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the <b>commutator.</b> The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the <b>commutator</b> itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The <b>commutator</b> assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the <b>commutator</b> is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.|$|E
