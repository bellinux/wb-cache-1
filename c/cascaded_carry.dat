In the first part, we present {{two types of}} full adders consisting of five gates, and show their minimality. We also prove {{that one of the}} full adders can be tested by only three test patterns for single stuck-at faults. We also present two types of 4 -bit carry look-ahead adders and their minimum tests. In the second part, we consider the tests for the cascaded adders, an n-bit ripple carry adder and a 4 m-bit <b>cascaded</b> <b>carry</b> look-ahead adders. These tests are considerably smaller than previously published ones. In this paper, we consider two types of n-bit adders with minimum tests for stuck-at fault models: Ripple carry adders and <b>cascaded</b> <b>carry</b> look-ahead adders. First, we show the minimality of full adders shown in Fig. 1. They contain the minimum number of gates among adders consisting of only 2 -input gates.

40|$|The {{continuum}} gamma-ray spectrum following neutron emission in a (HI, xngamma) reaction {{consists of}} two parts: a high-energy component whose intensity decreases exponentially with gamma-energy, the initial statistical cascade; and a low-energy bump which usually contains most of the intensity and consists predominantly of stretched E 2 transitions, the yrast cascade. The latter <b>cascade</b> <b>carries</b> away most of the angular momentum of the product nucleus, {{and so there is}} a good correlation between the average angular momentum of the initial compound nucleus leading to a particular product and the average gamma-ray multiplicity in that reaction. The measured values of the gamma-ray multiplicity show a variation of a factor of ten and have dependencies on the projectile mass and energy which can be explained with simple considerations.

40|$|Online {{social network}} (OSN) based {{applications}} often rely on user interactions to propagate {{information or to}} recruit more users, producing a sequence of user actions called adoption process or cascades. This paper presents the first attempt to quantitatively study the adoption process or cascade of such OSN-based applications by analyzing detailed user activity data from a popular Facebook gifting application. In particular, due {{to the challenge of}} monitoring user interactions over all possible channels on OSN platforms, we focus on characterizing the adoption process that relies only on user-based invitation (which is applicable to most gifting applications). We characterize the adoptions by tracking the invitations sent by the existing users to their friends through the Facebook gifting application and the events when their friends install the application for the first time.

Part of the machinery is quite well-known.

Enantiomerically enriched building blocks are iteratively assembled onto a purification handle using reliable coupling reactions.

Chapter 1 introduces the concept of diversity-oriented synthesis, with particular emphasis on strategies used to introduce skeletal diversity. The conceptual idea behind the project is explained, and placed into context using leading examples as the benchmark for success in diversity-oriented synthesis. Chapter 2 {{describes the}} synthesis of a range of building blocks, many of which are enantiomerically enriched, on multigram scale.

40|$|The use {{of larger}} more {{flexible}} blades in turbomachines requires detailed knowledge about flutter phenomena especially for compressor cascades in transonic flow where vibrating shocks may drastically change the aerodynamic behaviour. In order {{to investigate the}} aerodynamic behaviour, basic experiments were performed to measure unsteady pressure distributions for subsonic and transonic flow conditions. Experimental investigations on a two-dimensional section of a compressor <b>cascade</b> were <b>carried</b> out at EPF Lausanne in the annular wind tunnel for non-rotating cascades. In this wind tunnel real flow conditions are simulated by using a spiral flow. The twenty blades of the cascade were mounted on elastic spring supensions which allowed for torsional motion about the midchord. For the measurement of the unsteady pressure distributions, the blades were excited to harmonic torsional vibrations in all possible twenty travelling wave modes of the cascade. In order to ensure precise aerodynamic stability investigations, {{it is essential to}} know the complete unsteady pressure distribution around the profile. In this cascade piezoelectric pressure transducers were mounted close together around the blades in order to resolve pressure variations caused by a vibrating shock. These measured pressure distributions enable the evaluation of local stability/instability contributions using the local work coefficient and furthermore allow an integration into reliable global stability parameters such as the out-of-phase component of the unsteady moment coefficients.

Unlike suction used conventionally, distributed suction requires lower mass flow rates and is achieved by suction through holes of very small diameter distributed over the surface. A set of 5 NACA - 65 (18) 10 blades {{were used in the}} experiments that were carried out at a Reynolds number of 1. 6 x 10 (5). Detailed measurement of surface static pressure, total pressure loss {{in the wake of the}} blades and boundary layer thicknesses were taken at incidence angles in the range - 10 to + 6 degrees.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that the efficiency of a mixed-flow compressor stage will increase by introducing a tandem cascade design in the stator row. A reduction of the total pressure losses in the stator, which is subject to very high aerodynamic loads, {{would lead to a}} rise in the pressure ratio of the stage and, hence, to a gain in efficiency. Moreover, it is hoped to achieve a better matching between impeller and stator. The design and the optimization of the tandem <b>cascade</b> is <b>carried</b> out by means of a quasi- 3 D-method, which is usually applied in the development of cascades in axial compressors. According to the analytic results and with reservation to the accuracy of the assumptions that had to be made in order to carry out the design process one can expect a rise of 5, 4 % in static-to-total stage pressure ratio at the design point. This corresponds to an increase of 3, 9 % in total-to-total isentropic efficiency. With regard to the combustion chamber, however, the current design leads to comparatively high Mach numbers (M= 0, 28) at the stator exit and to an increase of the axial length of the compressor stage.

40|$|Dense water {{overflow}} off continental shelves (cascading) {{is one of}} the contributing {{processes of}} shelf-deep ocean exchange, and of topical interest to climate studies and nutrient fluxes. Dense water originating from cooling, evaporation, freezing and salinization on a shallow shelf spills over the shelf edge and may develop as near-bottom gravity current or an intermediate-depth intrusion. It is difficult to observe in nature due to its intermittent character. This paper provides an extensive inventory of observed cases of water cascades around the World Ocean, summarises their locations and individual properties, and provides statistics of the identified cases. The search for <b>cascading</b> was <b>carried</b> out using oceanographic databases and a literature review. This study identified 61 confirmed cases world-wide, including 25 cases in the Arctic seas, 12 at mid-latitudes, seven in sub-tropical and tropical regions, and 17 off the Antarctic shelves. Eighteen cascades had not been reported before. We analyze a set of numerical parameters of dense water cascades, allowing us to quantify, compare and contrast the properties of water cascades. The overall average density contrast between the confirmed cascades and ambient water is 0. 37 (kg/m 3); it can be as much as 2 (kg/m 3) on some Arctic shelves. Frequently initiated by strong cooling at the surface, cascades often remain colder through the descent, thus supplying the deep ocean with colder and fresher water. In non-dimensional variables, the data from all climate zones fit well to a unique curve, which represents a relationship between a cascade’s internal structure and the parameters describing its forcing.

The analysis of the results shows the correlation between the mean flow features and the turbulent quantities and the relationship between the energy loss production and the blade loading variation. The presented data are also suitable for assessing the behaviour of turbulence models in complex 3 D flows, on design and off -design conditions...|$|R
