5000|$|Kelly first {{surfaced}} on comedy {{stages in}} Austin, Texas with HBO's Aspen Comedy Festival auditions {{in the fall}} of 1999, followed by winning Capital City Comedy Club's annual [...] "Funniest Person in Austin" [...] contest in April 2000. [...] Kelly was the winner of Comedy Central's 2002 Laugh Riots national comedy competition {{and was one of the}} New Faces in the Just for Laughs comedy festival that same year. [...] After many years of performing stand-up, Kelly made her acting debut in January 2016 after long-time friend Zach Galifianakis asked her to co-star in his FX comedy series Baskets. She co-stars as Martha, an insurance adjuster and friend of <b>Chip</b> <b>Baskets</b> (played by Galifianakis).|$|R
50|$|Baskets is an American black comedy {{television}} series that premiered on January 21, 2016 on FX. The series was co-created by Louis C.K., Zach Galifianakis and Jonathan Krisel, {{who is also}} the showrunner. Galifianakis stars in the dual lead role as <b>Chip</b> <b>Baskets,</b> a failed professional clown in Paris, who instead becomes a local rodeo clown in Bakersfield, California and his twin brother Dale Baskets. Galifianakis, C.K., M. Blair Breard, Dave Becky, Marc Gurvitz and Andrea Pett-Joseph serve as executive producers, with FX Productions and Pig Newton as production companies. On February 23, 2016, FX renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on January 19, 2017. On March 9, 2017, FX renewed the show for a third season.|$|R

40|$|The present work maps a {{specific}} set of the traditional subsistence techniques by way of example of the abandoned village named Nová Ves u Klikova (1792 - 1953). In the 18 th century occure changes in methods of forest exploitation in Central Europe in general. The increased demand for fuelwood and building wood gave rise to the "rationalization" of the forest management. Another source of energy for the developing industry was peat at that time. Nová Ves u Klikova was an example of the so called peat colonization. Small farmsteads were founded on the infertile peaty soil that was not able to ensure sufficient means of subsistence. As a consequence it was developed an important centre of production of straw <b>baskets</b> and <b>chip</b> <b>baskets</b> {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century. The existing ethnological literature pursued the local production of baskets, whereas the topic of the cutting of peat and its further treating in relation to folk culture is still untreated. In view of that fact this text lays stress on the "cultural history of peat"...|$|R
25|$|In Woody Allen's film Blue Jasmine (2013), C.K. {{played the}} romantic {{interest}} of Sally Hawkins' character. Also that year, David O. Russell's black comedy crime film American Hustle, released in December 2013, featured C.K. as FBI supervisor Stoddard Thorsen, {{the boss of}} Bradley Cooper's character. C.K.'s production company, Pig Newton, where he works with producer Blair Breard, signed a contract to develop and executive produce pilots for FX Networks in 2013. In January 2014, an announcement said C.K. would produce and co-write a Zach Galifianakis-created comedy pilot for FX Networks. The 10-episode single-camera comedy, titled Baskets, premiered on January 21, 2016. It features Galifianakis as the main character, a struggling clown named <b>Chip</b> <b>Baskets</b> in a pilot episode written by Galifianakis, Louis C.K. and Jonathan Krisel. C.K. released his sixth one hour special Live at The Comedy Store to his website in January 2015, which, unlike his past few specials, was recorded at a club, The Comedy Store in West Hollywood. C.K. said he intended the material as an exercise in creating an act that hearkened back to his early days in comedy clubs. The special premiered exclusively on FX on May 28, 2015.|$|R
40|$|Vacuum frying is a {{promising}} method for preserving the desired color, texture, and flavor of products with high sugar content. Since most {{vegetables and fruits}} degrade when processed with traditional frying, vacuum frying is an excellent alternative to high temperature processing. However, in vacuum frying the product should be pre-treated before frying to obtain a better texture. The kinetics of oil absorption and oil distribution in sweet potato chips (total, internal, and surface oil content) was studied so that effectiveness of the de-oiling system could be established. An analysis of product quality attributes (PQA) such as moisture content, oil content, microstructure, diameter shrinkage, and thickness expansion, as well as, color, texture, bulk density, true density, and porosity of chips fried at different temperatures (120, 130, and 140 ?C) was performed to evaluate the effect of process temperature on the product. The final oil content of the sweet potato chips was 0. 178 ? 0. 007, 0. 178 ? 0. 011, and 0. 172 ? 0. 002 g/g solid for frying temperatures of 120, 130, and 140 ?C, respectively. These values were lower (~ 60 % less) than those found in traditionally fried sweet potato chip, which indicates that the de-oiling mechanism is crucial in vacuum frying processing. It {{was found that the}} rate of change in PQAs is greatly affected by temperature; however, the final values of bulk density, true density, porosity, diameter shrinkage, and thickness expansion were not affected by temperature. The texture of the samples was affected by temperature, with the chips fried at 140 degrees C being crispier. In terms of color, the L* and color b* values decreased as temperature increased. While color a* was not affected by temperature. In this study, a two-stage frying process was also evaluated to improve the flavor and texture of sweet potato <b>chips.</b> First, a <b>basket</b> filled with the sweet potato slices was submerged into the oil under atmospheric conditions. As soon as the potato slices were partially cooked (1 min), the pressure was lowered to 1. 33 kPa (vacuum frying stage) and the product fried for 2 more min. The products were fried at 130 degrees C for different interval of times. Starch gelatinization, texture, moisture content, and oil content were evaluated at each time interval. Sensory analysis was accomplished by using a consumer panel with 50 members. The samples were compared with the on-stage frying and atmospheric frying processes. The two-stage fried chips had better appearance and texture compared to the ones that were only fried under vacuum or atmospheric conditions. The samples were lighter and more yellow than the chips fried under the single-stage process. In vacuum frying, the temperature of the chips does not reach the gelatinization temperature until most of the water is evaporated. Therefore, there is not sufficient moisture content in the product for gelatinization to occur completely. As a result, the product has a glassy texture. In the two stage frying, the atmospheric frying prior to vacuum frying helps the starch to gelatinize thus producing a better product in terms of texture, oil content, and flavor. The atmospheric fried samples were darker in color and had a scorch taste. The degree of starch gelatinization was 21 % higher for the two-stage fried samples than the single-stage fried ones. The application of the dual stage enhances the quality of sweet potato chips, improves consumer satisfaction, and reduces the need for space, cost, and any other needs of blanching pre-treatment to the sweet potato manufacturers...|$|R
