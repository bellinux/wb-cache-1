She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when I <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{costs of}} filming Titanic {{eventually}} began to mount and finally reached $200million. Fox executives panicked and suggested {{an hour of}} specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics {{are more likely to}} help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, [...] "You want to <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!" [...] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.|$|E
500|$|Night at the Blood Beast was {{distributed}} by American International Pictures. It was test-screened for audiences in unadvertised sneak previews, in which audiences attending a different film were surprised with {{a screening of}} Blood Beast instead. Coincidentally, Martin Varno attended one of these sneak previews without any advance knowledge of what it was. The screening was also attended by Roger and Gene Corman, who were not pleased by Varno's presence. It {{was the first time}} the screenwriter had seen the completed film, which he did not enjoy, and he said of watching it: [...] "On my left side was sitting Forry Ackerman, and on my right side was sitting Jerry Bixby. And their main job was to keep my hands held down so I wouldn't <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> throat."

We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other.

500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] was {{recorded}} mostly while Gaga was on tour in Europe, but the mixing {{was done by}} Gene Grimaldi at Oasis Mastering in [...] Burbank, California. It is a Hi-NRG song and begins with Gaga singing the line [...] "Whenever I dress cool, my parents put up a fight/ And if I'm a hot shot, Mom will <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> hair at night/ And in the morning I'm short of my identity/ I scream, 'Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I want to be?" [...] As the music grows louder, Gaga sings the sing along chorus of the song, gradually moving towards the breakdown—which is inspired by retro music—talking about the different hairstyles she has had. Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the track as a [...] "fist-pumping, defiant disco track all about having a good time." [...] Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone called it a mixture of yearning romantic melodrama of [...] "We Belong" [...] with the hard industrial metal edge of Broken-era Nine Inch Nails. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that Gaga's vocals are Auto-Tuned throughout the song. The lyrics of [...] "Hair" [...] talk about embracing one's hairstyle as the ultimate expression of their identity, hence it ends with Gaga triumphantly declaring [...] "I am my hair!"

[...] After several months, the two returned to Paris, supporting themselves with photojournalism and occasional portraits. [...] Namuth and Reisner were sent to cover the Workers' Olympiad in July 1936 by French magazine Vu, which put them in Barcelona during the opening stages of the Spanish Civil War.

[...] After increased tension and hostilities between France and Germany, Namuth and his fellow German expatriates were interned, though Namuth joined the French Foreign Legion to avoid his confinement. [...] After being discharged in 1940, Namuth fled to Marseilles and escaped to the United States with the help of journalist Varian Fry and his Emergency Rescue Committee. [...] He arrived in New York City in 1941 and planned to join the Office of Strategic Services in 1943 out of a desire [...] "to do something about everything". [...] However, he {{had fallen in love with}} French-born Guatemalan Carmen Herrera and delayed his enlistment until he was drafted for World War II in December 1943. [...] After completing basic training, Namuth joined the intelligence services and worked as an interrogator and interpreter in England, France, and Czechoslovakia. [...] Upon returning to Germany in 1945 to gather war criminals, Namuth realized, [...] "I really had <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> navel cord completely and totally, not just with my home and family but with the country as such.
