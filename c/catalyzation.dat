50|$|PIP2 {{functions}} {{as an intermediate}} in the pathway, which is initiated by ligands binding to G protein-coupled receptors activating the Gq alpha subunit. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is a substrate for hydrolysis by phospholipase C (PLC), a membrane-bound enzyme activated through protein receptors such as α1 adrenergic receptors. PtdIns(4,5)P2 regulates the function of many membrane proteins and ion channels, such as the M-channel. The products of the PLC <b>catalyzation</b> of PtdIns(4,5)P2 are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3; IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), both of which function as second messengers. In this cascade, DAG remains on the cell membrane and activates the signal cascade by activating protein kinase C (PKC). PKC in turn activates other cytosolic proteins by phosphorylating them. The effect of PKC could be reversed by phosphatases. IP3 enters the cytoplasm and activates IP3 receptors on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which opens calcium channels on the smooth ER, allowing mobilization of calcium ions through specific Ca2+ channels into the cytosol. Calcium participates in the cascade by activating other proteins.|$|E

In clouds and wet aerosols, water-soluble organic products of gas-phase photochemistry dissolve into the aqueous phase where they can react further (e. g. with OH radicals) to form low volatility products that are largely retained in the particle phase. Organic acids, oligomers and other products form via radical- and non-radical reactions, including hemiacetal formation during droplet evaporation, acid/base <b>catalyzation,</b> and reaction of organics with other constituents (e. g.

At least for aqueous reactions of glyoxal with OH radicals, chemical modeling can reproduce experiments conducted at cloud-relevant concentrations without including radical–radical reactions, whereas radical–radical reactions become dramatically more important at higher concentrations.

Since ionic and electronic contact are necessary components of catalyst utilization in gas-diffusion electrodes, the electrochemical <b>catalyzation</b> technique reduces the amount of platinum required for PEMFC. We present data for oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation with gas-dif-fusion electrodes containing 0. 05 mg Pt/cm 2. A major impediment to the commercialization of PEMFC technology is the high content of the unsupported platinum electrocatalyst,- 4 mg Pt/cm 2, corresponding to a platinum cost of-$ 400 /kW at 500 mA/cm 2. The platinum content could be lowered by increasing the platinum utilization in the gas-diffusion electrode. The two major contributions to the low utilization of the unsupported platinum electrocatalyst are: (i) the large platinum particle size (120 A), and (ii) inaccessibility of the reactants to the platinum. For spherical particles of 120 A, the fraction of surface atoms is less than 10 %; consequently, the maximum platinum utilization is less than 10 %.

40|$|Abstract: Brain insults are {{characterized}} by a multitude of complex processes, of which glutamate release plays a major role. Deleterious excess of glutamate in the brain’s extracellular fluids stimulates glutamate receptors, which in turn lead to cell swelling, apoptosis, and neuronal death.

Alternatively, eliminating excess glutamate from brain interstitial fluids by making use of the naturally occurring brain-to-blood glutamate efflux {{has been shown to}} be effective in various animal studies. This is facilitated by gradient driven transport across brain capillary endothelial glutamate transporters. Blood glutamate scavengers enhance this naturally occurring mechanism by reducing the blood glutamate concentration, thus increasing the rate at which excess glutamate is cleared. Blood glutamate scavenging is achieved by several mechanisms including: <b>catalyzation</b> of the enzymatic process involved in glutamate metabolism, redistribution of glutamate into tissue, and acute stress response.

Spray atomization phenomena of Newtonian fluids have received significant academic and industrial research attention, however, {{the effect of}} non-Newtonian rheologies on spray formation and downstream droplet behavior {{has not been as}} heavily investigated. The aim of this work is to elucidate the effect of non-Newtonian and viscoelastic rheological effects on droplet behavior in the context of secondary atomization and droplet collisions. This study utilizes finite volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to recreate droplet fluid physics in a numerical setting to a high accuracy. Droplet collision systems comprised of Newtonian, viscoelastic and shear-thinning rheologies are simulated using a Lagrangian moving-mesh interface tracking method (MMIT). This interface tracking approach provides increased surface curvature accuracy on relatively coarse meshes compared to many Eulerian multiphase methods. Modeling assumptions and interface mesh treatments are validated using existing analytical and experimental comparisons showing good agreement. Interpolation error due to cell deformation is minimized with local topological mesh adaptation and a global element quality optimization algorithm. The fully three dimensional computational study investigates the effect of these non-Newtonian and viscoelastic rheologies on a droplet collision. Here, simulated fluid ligaments exhibit increased stability with greater relative elasticity. By applying the similar simulation techniques to collisions of shear thinning droplets, a simple reduced order viscosity model has been produced, valid within a certain range of Weber number values. Another important atomization phenomenon, secondary breakup, is simulated using a volume of fluids (VOF) based interface capturing method applied to a centroid tracking moving mesh. Here, an axisymmetric CFD study of the wind induced break up of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian droplets is presented with comparisons with experimentally observed results. The numerical implementation is further verified by displaying accurate recreation of rapid micro-scale bubble collapse processes and subsequent jet ejection observed in controlled laboratory settings. The presented simulation results show capability in prediction of both the transient deformation morphology and the time scales in which droplet disintegration occurs...|$|E
40|$|Succinic acid {{has drawn}} much {{interest}} as a precursor of many industrially important chemicals. Using {{a variety of}} feedstocks for the bio-production of succinic acid would be economically beneficial to future industrial processes. Escherichia coli SBS 550 MG is able to grow on both glucose and fructose, but not on sucrose. Therefore, we derived a SBS 550 MG strain bearing both the pHL 413 plasmid, which contains Lactococcus lactis pycA gene, and the pUR 400 plasmid, which contains the scrK, Y, A, B, and R genes for sucrose uptake and <b>catalyzation.</b> Succinic acid production by this modified strain and the SBS 550 pHL 413 strain was tested on fructose, sucrose, a mixture of glucose and fructose, a mixture of glucose, fructose and sucrose, and sucrose hydrolysis solution. The modified strain can produce succinic acid efficiently from all combinations of different carbon sources tested with minimal byproduct formation and with high molar succinate yields close {{to that of the}} maximum theoretic values. The molar succinic acid yield from fructose was the highest among the carbon sources tested. Using the mixture of glucose and fructose as the carbon source resulted in slightly lower yields and much higher productivity than using fructose alone. Fermenting sucrose mixed with fructose and glucose gave a 1. 76 -fold higher productivity than that when sucrose was used as the sole carbon source. Using sucrose pretreated with sulfuric acid as carbon source resulted in a similar succinic acid yield and productivity as that when using the mixture of sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The results of the effect of agitation rate in aerobic phase on succinate production showed that supplying large amount of oxygen in aerobic phase resulted in higher productions of formate and acetate, and therefore lower succinate yield. This study suggests that fructose, sucrose, mixture of glucose and fructose, mixture of glucose, fructose and sucrose, or sucrose hydrolysis solution could be used for the economical and efficient production of succinic acid by our metabolic engineered E. coli strain.

40|$|In undressing and {{redressing}} the Harlequin from an Australian designer’s perspective, {{the question}} is why has the Harlequin costume endured for over 500 years and in locations far away from its country of origin? Why do we associate its lozenge pattern with energetic joyous mischief? What are the Harlequin costume codes and how have they been manifested in Australia? The thesis components are divided as follows: The Designer’s Notebook is a pictorial and historical review of the iconic costume, which is made up of a complex patchwork of triangles where colour placements form a diamond pattern called a lozenge. The Harlequin, a stock character from commedia dell’arte, who emerged in Italy and France during the 1500 s, wears the lozenge costume. The notebook traces possible connections and reasons for the emergence of both the costume and the Harlequin figure prior to his <b>catalyzation</b> as a character in commedia dell’arte. Having arrived at the manifestation of Harlequin and his lozenge costume, the focus moves to the forms of expression in which he has participated and the mutations which have occurred in the costume. Harlequin High Jinks Down Under is concerned with the manifestation of both the harlequinesque figure and its associated costume codes in circus and the harlequinades in Australia from the 1850 s, when a kind of Australian larrikinism began to develop as the national identity. From this unique environment a century later sprang the satirist, Dame Edna Everage and the social and political comic, Joel Salom, associated with Circus OZ. On the international front, these Australian performers have joined comic book characters in keeping the harlequinesque costume codes alive, but something deeper is happening with the Harlequin and his lozenge attire. For instance, some philosophers have come to accept Harlequin as a visual code for the union of multi-nationalities. The Research additionally explores the enduring contribution of the lozenge code not only through the historical tracing of harlequinesque imagery but also through the designing of a 2 square meter art–piece created at an international residency in Vietnam to reflect the energetic universality of the lozenge form. Here Harlequin’s liminality is explored. Finally two new costume designs have been created for the Australian performers, Everage and Salom, to further the design of the harlequinesque into an imagined future...|$|E
40|$|Citokines are {{proteins}} {{produced by}} several cell types and secreted {{in response to}} various stimuli. These molecules are able to modify the behaviour of other cells inducing activities like growth, differentiation and apoptosis. In the last years, veterinary scientists have investigated {{the role played by}} these factors; in fact, cytokines can act as intercellular communicative signals in immune response, cell damage repair and hematopoiesis. Up to date, various cytokines have been identified and in depth comprehension of their effects in physiology, pathology and therapy is an interesting field of research. This thesis aims to understand the role played by these mediators during natural or experimentally induced pathologies. In particular, it has been evaluated the genic and protein expressions {{of a large number of}} cytokines during several diseases and starting from different matrix. Considering the heterogeneity of materials used in experimentations, multiple methods and protocols of nucleic acids and proteins extractions have been standardized. Results on cytokines expression obtained from various in vitro and in vivo experimental studies have shown how important these mediators are in regulation and modulation of the host immune response also in veterinary medicine. In particular, the analysis of inflammatory and septic markers, like cytokines, has allowed a better understanding in the pathogenesis during horse Recurrent Airway Obstruction, foal sepsis, Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus infection and dog Parvovirus infection and the effects of these agents on the host immune system. As experimentations with mice have shown, some pathologies of the respiratory and nervous system can be reduced or even erased by blocking cytokines inflammatory production. The in vitro cytokines expression evaluation in cells which are in vivo involved in the response to exogenous (like pathogens) or endogenous (as it happens during autoimmune diseases) inflammatory stimuli could represent a model for studying citokines effects during the host immune response. This has been analyzed using lymphocytes cultured with several St. aureus strains isolated from bovine mastitic milk and different colostrum products. In the first experiment different cytokines were expressed depending on enterotoxins produced, justifying a different behaviour of the microrganism in the mammal gland. In the second one, bone marrow cells derived incubated with murine lymphocytes with colostrum products have shown various cluster of differentiation expression, different proliferation and a modified cytokines profile. A better understanding of cytokine expression mechanisms will increase the know-how on immune response activated by several pathogen agents. In particular, blocking the cytokine production, the inhibition or <b>catalyzation</b> of the receptor binding mechanism and the modulation of signal transduction mechanism will represent a novel therapeutic strategy in veterinary medicine...|$|E
40|$|Polyurethane {{is one of}} {{the most}} diversified macropolymers with {{versatile}} properties for many applications including construction, transportation, personal wear, household appliance, etc. The research of this PhD study covers many aspects of polyurethane, including modelling on urethanisation and foaming mechanism, cell microstructure and packing polyhedrons, macroscopic properties and performance, and functional carbon materials developed from carbonisation of polyisocyanurate (PIR) foams. The work contains both theoretical modelling and experimental measurements. Urethanisation Kinetics The catalysed polyisocyanurate reaction kinetic model was developed based on generalized copolymerization scheme. PIR/PUR ratio was derived from mathematical manipulation on rate equations. The structural unit effects of isocyanurate, urethane and urea were evaluated based on Mayo-Lewise tercopolymerization scheme. Two reaction scenarios – bifunctional and macropolyol – were taken into consideration. Two ratios of isocyanate/polyol and urethane/urea rather than isocyanurate concentration were found to have impact on isocyanate conversion. Cell Growth and Foaming Process The cell microstructural configuration model was developed based on FOAMAT reactivity profiling (FOAMAT is a foam qualification system to measure the formation by curing and foaming parameters). The cell constructions were well understood by characterization of interstitial border area between cells. The cell anisotropic degree was calculated based on 2 D cell shapes deformation comparison between free rising and stress stretching. The foaming process of continuous line panel production was further modelled based on cell anisotropic stretching. Plateau Borders The geometric Plateau border model for closed cell polyurethane foam was developed based on volume integrations of approximated 3 D four-cusp hypocycloid structure. The tetrahedral structure of convex struts was orthogonally projected into 2 D three-cusp deltoid with three central cylinders. The idealized single unit strut was modeled by superposition. The volume of each component was calculated by geometric analyses. The strut solid fraction f_s and foam porosity coefficient δ were calculated from developed strut model based on representative elementary volume (REV) of Kelvin and Weaire-Phelan structures. The specific surface area Sv derived from packing polyhedra model and deltoid approximation model respectively were put into contrast against strut dimensional ratio ε. The characteristic parameters modeled from this semi-empirical method were further employed to predict foam thermal conductivity. The correlation results show good agreement with actual measurement. The deviation gap can be caused by disorderedness and irregularity of actual cells. The periodical numerical method still has limit in predicting foam mechanics. Foam Defect Microstructure Streak and blister cell defects pose extensive surface problems for rigid polyurethane foams. In this study, these morphological anomalies were visually inspected using 2 D optical techniques, and the cell microstructural coefficients including degree of anisotropy, cell circumdiameter, and the volumetric isoperimetric quotient were calculated from the observations. A geometric regular polyhedron approximation method was developed based on relative density equations, in order to characterize the packing structures of both normal and anomalous cells. The calculated cell volume constant, C_c, from polyhedron geometric voxels was compared with the empirical polyhedron cell volume value, C_h. The geometric relationship between actual cells and approximated polyhedrons was characterized by the defined volumetric isoperimetric quotient. Binary packing structures were derived from deviation comparisons between the two cell volume constants and the assumed partial relative density ratios of the two individual packing polyhedrons. The modelling results show that normal cells have a similar packing to the Weaire-Phelan model, while anomalous cells have a dodecahedron/icosidodecahedron binary packing. Insulation Performance Polyurethane (PU) is a commonly used insulation material for cold storage warehouses. The insulation performance of PU sandwich panels made from blended blowing agents were re-assessed by k-factor measurements and the insulation thickness was calculated based on cold warehouse design standard. The purposes of this study is test the impact of thermal conductivity value from experimental measurements on insulation barrier thickness calculation, and try to identity the gap between experimental data and empirical data in real practice and its impact on insulation design. The building design standard of cold warehouse can be a good benchmark to showcase this difference in aggressive cooling environment. The results have confirmed significant positive impact of blowing agents for energy saving. Post-curing Stability Problem The foam post-curing stability was evaluated by mathematic manipulation. The developed 3 D paraboloid model based on gridding measurements has provided a scientific solution to foam panel shrinkage problem. Cell microstructure characterisation and post-growth angle coefficients calculation were further performed in this study. The results show the cell microstructure undergoes severe contraction during cooling and some cell destruction has happened on foam defects. Meanwhile, the cell anisotropic degree is getting more uniformed and this phenomenon is considerably prominent in central position. Thermal Degradation The thermal degradation of polyisocyanurate foam samples were studied by TG/DTA, FTIR, and SEM. All samples with different isocyanate index (NCO/OH = 100, 200, 300) were pre-treated by H 2 SO 4, K 2 CO 3, and NaOH before heating. The measurements of DTG and DTA presented corresponding variability for different acidic and alkaline treatments. The activation energy of thermal decomposition was calculated based on kinetic reaction evaluation. The pronounced polyol and isocyanate regenerations were observed over degradation. Further FTIR measurements at elevated temperatures suggested the possibility of acidic hydrogen bonding <b>catalyzation</b> and alkaline reversible amide regeneration during degradation by chemical treatments. The morphology study by SEM show localized corrosion is severe for high temperature carbonisation by acidic treatment (H 2 SO 4) and microcrystallization occurs for alkalic treatments (K 2 CO 3 and NaOH). The microcrystals vary by geometric shape. Carbonization The isocyanate index (NCO/OH) of diisocyanate and macropolyol can dictate the carbonisation of polyisocyanurate (PIR) foams. The carbon amorphousness was characterized by DSC which suggests the disorderedness can be aggravated by acidic pre-treatment. XRD investigation on crystallography suggests intercalation layered structure was created during carbonisation. Synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of all carbonaceous residues reveal that N-doping carbonisation has been realized by isocyanate dipolar cycloaddition. The N-doping structures with pyridinic (N- 6) and pyrrolic (N- 5) nitrogen atoms were found in carboncyclic rings, but no graphitic (N-Q) structure was identified. Higher isocyanate index (NCO/OH) can increase the opportunity for N-doping by creating more pyrrolic (N- 5) nitrogen structure. The acidic treatment by H 2 SO 4 can promote pyridinic (N- 6) structure formation by cyanic acid trimerization. The derived carbons from higher isocyanate index (NCO/OH) were further found from electrochemical tests to possess improved capacitance but with negative resistivity which is attributed to more capacitive but amorphous N-doping carbon structure...|$|E
