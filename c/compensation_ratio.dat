However, the bias cut dress has problem of satisfying the intended garment size spec. This problem occurs from various sources. The main {{reason is that the}} bias-cut fabric tends to stretch on longitudinal direction and to shrink horizontal direction when it was hung on the body. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop a bias-cut dress pattern making method satisfying the intended garment size spec. The researchers developed the geometrical method of measuring dimensional change by calculating the <b>compensation</b> <b>ratio</b> of the fabric in true bias direction. The <b>compensation</b> <b>ratio</b> was calculated by applying draping ratio of the fabric. Three types of fabrics were used in the experiment. The warp and weft crossing angle of fabric was ranged from 78 ° to 82 °. The fabrics stretched longitudinally 6. 9 ～ 9. 9 % and shrank horizontally 7. 2 ～ 11. 0 %. The <b>compensation</b> <b>ratio</b> of the bias-cut pattern for sample dress was calculated for each fabric type. Two types of experimental bias-cut dress patterns were developed for each fabric.

These two classes of stock had the same voting, cash flow, and all other legal rights except that non-tradable shares cannot be transferred at the open markets. From 2005, China implemented the reform to convert all non-tradable shares into tradable.

Here we report a systematic study of (GaZn-VZn) - acceptor complex defect via zinc self-diffusion in Ga-doped ZnO isotopic heterostructures, which were conceived and prepared with delicately controlled growth conditions. The secondary ion mass spectrometry and temperature-dependent Hall-effect measurements reveal that a high density of controllable (GaZn-VZn) - is the predominant compensating defect in Ga-doped ZnO. The binding energy of this complex defect obtained from zinc self-diffusion experiments (~ 0. 78 eV) well matches the electrical activation energy derived from the temperature-dependent electrical measurements (~ 0. 82 eV). The <b>compensation</b> <b>ratios</b> were quantitatively calculated by energetic analysis and scattering process to further validate the compensation effect of (GaZn-VZn) - complex in Ga-doped ZnO.

Due to the resulting compensation effects, resistivity measurements {{on a single}} wafer alone are not sufficient to describe the electrical transport characteristics of the material, and existing standard models are not applicable.

40|$|This {{research}} links together disparate {{literature on}} family and nonfamily firms, {{large and small}} firms, and risk for small firms. The literature is not coherent in one theme: whether family firms operate with greater risk relative to nonfamily firms. Yet the literature finds performance advantage to family firms without an explanation of why family firms on average generate better accounting returns and values relative to nonfamily firms other than for reduced agency costs translated into value. The first essay examines two measures of risk [...] debt ratio and idiosyncratic risk [...] of small publicly held family firms relative to nonfamily firms to investigate differences in financial risk between them. Using a unique hand-collected data set of small family and nonfamily firms, I analyze certain firm characteristics (family ownership, family member on the board, size, and dual class status) and find that family and nonfamily firms do not differ in their book-based debt ratios but do differ in their market-based debt ratios. Specifically, I find that family firms that tightly control voting rights through dual class status have higher debt ratios and hence have higher risk than nonfamily firms. Furthermore, I find a positive relation between idiosyncratic risk and family ownership, and I find {{as the percentage of}} family ownership increases idiosyncratic risk increases. The second essay utilizes the likelihood of incentive compensation presence and incentive <b>compensation</b> <b>ratio</b> of small publicly held family firms relative to nonfamily firms to investigate differences in CEO dividends and incentive compensation. The tools available for boards of directors to incentivize CEOs to act in accordance with diverse shareholder wishes, including risk-taking, investment selection, and the on-the-job consumption of resources, are stock options, stock grants, and cash bonuses. I argue that agency theory in practice is imperfect in incentive contracting. Specifically, CEO dividends and family ownership reduce the likelihood of the existence of an incentive compensation plan. I find in the presence of CEO dividends that family and nonfamily firms differ in their incentive compensation ratios and the likelihood of incentive compensation. In my sample, I find a significant negative relation between the CEO dividend income ratio and the incentive <b>compensation</b> <b>ratio</b> and between family ownership percentage and the incentive <b>compensation</b> <b>ratio.</b> Lastly, consistent with current literature, I find that growth opportunities positively influence both family and nonfamily firms 2 ̆ 7 incentive compensation ratios...|$|E
