50|$|One {{method to}} improve the {{resolution}} of the converter is to artificially increase the range of the integrating amplifier during the run-up phase. As mentioned above, the purpose of the run-up phase is to add an unknown amount of <b>charge</b> to the <b>integrator</b> to be later measured during the run-down phase. Having the ability to add larger quantities of charge allows for more higher-resolution measurements. For example, assume that we are capable of measuring the <b>charge</b> on the <b>integrator</b> during the run-down phase to a granularity of 1 coulomb. If our integrator amplifier limits us to being able to add only up to 16 coulombs of <b>charge</b> to the <b>integrator</b> during the run-up phase, our total measurement will be limited to 4 bits (16 possible values). If we can increase the range of the integrator to allow us to add up to 32 coulombs, our measurement resolution is increased to 5 bits.|$|R

40|$|The first {{wearable}} multi-wavelength {{technology for}} functional near-infrared spectroscopy has been developed, {{based on a}} custom-built 8 -wavelength light emitting diode (LED) source. A lightweight fibreless probe is designed to monitor changes in the concentrations of multiple absorbers (chromophores) in biological tissue, the most dominant of which at near-infrared wavelengths are oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. The use of multiple wavelengths enables signals due to the less dominant chromophores to be more easily distinguished from those due to hemoglobin and thus provides more complete and accurate information about tissue oxygenation, hemodynamics, and metabolism. The spectroscopic probe employs four photodiode detectors coupled to a four-channel charge-to-digital converter which includes a charge integration amplifier and an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC). Use of two parallel <b>charge</b> <b>integrators</b> per detector enables one to accumulate charge while the other is being read out by the ADC, thus facilitating continuous operation without dead time. The detector system has a dynamic range of about 80 dB. The customized source consists of eight LED dies attached to a 2 mm × 2 mm substrate and encapsulated in UV-cured epoxy resin. Switching between dies is performed every 20 ms, synchronized to the detector integration period to within 100 ns.

40|$|UWB has {{the huge}} {{potential}} to impact the present communication systems {{due to its}} enormous available bandwidth, range/data rate trade-off, and potential for very low cost operation. According to FCC, Ultra Wideband (UWB) radio signal defined as a signal that occupies a bandwidth of 500 MHz or fractional bandwidth larger than 20 % with strict limits on its power spectral density to - 41. 3 dBm/MHz in the range 3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz. Decades {{of research in the}} area of wide-band systems have lead us to new possibilities in the design of low power, low complexity radios, comparing with existing narrowband radio systems. In particular, impulse radio based ultra wideband (IR-UWB) is a promising solution for short-range radio communications such as low power radio-frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network's and wireless personal area network (WPAN) etc. Since a simple circuit, architecture adopted in the IR-UWB system, the non-idealities of receiver front end may lead to degrade the overall performance. Therefore, it is important to study these effects in order to create robust and efficient UWB system. However, majorities of recent studies are formed on the channel analysis, rather than the receiver system. The main objectives of this thesis work are, (a) System level modeling of non-coherent IR-UWB receiver, (b) Performance analysis of IR-UWB receiver with the help of bit error rate (BER) estimation, (c) A study on the impact of receiver front end non-idealities over BER, (d) Analysis of <b>charge</b> leakage in <b>integrator</b> and its effect on overall performance of UWB receiver.

The results show that non idealities and leakage degrade the performance as expected. In order to achieve a specific BER of 10 - 2 with the integrator leakage of 25 %, the SNR should be increased by 2. 1 dB compared to the SNR with no leakage at a data rate of 200 Mbps.

The software also provides data correction due to non-ferroelectric-switching contributions to obtain reliable remanent polarization (Pr) and coercive field (Ec) values. It also displays the loops both in polarization-field (P-E) and current density-field (J-E) modes.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 68 - 70) A typical {{signal processing}} scheme for spectroscopy measurements with radiation detectors {{consists of an}} analog <b>integrator</b> (<b>charge</b> sensitive preamplifier) followed by a band pass filter and pulse height analysis of individual pulses. Whenever an analog integrator is used {{there has to be}} a mechanism for reset, when it approaches saturation. In conventional systems this is done through a continuous injection of current (most often by a resistor), or through a large current pulse applied for a short period of time. The first approach (among many other problems) introduces a slow exponential decay component that complicates signal processing and can still lead to saturation at high rate of radiation events. The second reset strategy is discontinuous and abrupt, leading to time variance, dead time due to ???blinding??? of subsequent electronics, and other problems. This work describes the development of a Multichannel Analyzer (MCA) system based on simple analog and digital architecture that takes advantage of a novel idea for resetting a charge integrating preamplifier. We have developed a so called Free Running Integrator, which is an integrator that allows resets to be transparent to signal processing, without loss of signal charge due to abrupt current pulse injection. Dead time and signal processing complications due to resets are eliminated. The response of the Free Running Integrator to a current impulse is a step function with no exponential decay, which makes possible the use of simplified signal processing. A prototype is described whose signal processing consists of an ADC working at a very low sampling rate followed by simple digital processing algorithm. This implementation lends itself to applications where low power consumption, low cost, and simplicity are needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{particles}} accelerated in CERN accelerator chain reach high energies, {{topped by}} the particle energy at collision in the LHC, 7 GeV. During the operation, {{an amount of}} particles is inevitably lost from the beam. Depending {{on the extent of}} the losses, physical damage to machine components may be caused and the shower of secondary emission particles deposits energy in the surrounding equipment constituting the accelerator. The hadronic cascade also activates their materials, representing a hazard to the workers at CERN. In the LHC, the superconducting magnets that constitute the synchrotron lattice are kept at an operating temperature of 1 : 9 K through a cryogenic facility employing superliquid helium, the increase in their temperature potentially initiates a quench. In the SPS, the damage due to a lost beam is also visible. The Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system has been developed to reliably protect the machines composing CERN’s accelerator chain and additionally provide information about the beam status: the system provides observations about local aperture restrictions, orbit distortion, beam oscillations and particle diffusion, allowing the operators to tune the machines, measure and maximize the efficiency of the chain. To achieve this, two types of particles detectors are distributed along the machines in the positions where the most intense losses are expected, typically where aperture limitations are present – for exa mple where the collimators are located. The main type of detector in use is the ionization chamber, albeit where a very high dose rate is expected Secondary Emission Monitor (SEM) are employed instead. Both types of detectors are sensitive to the hardronic showers initiated by high energy particles and they are characterized by high linearity and accuracy with respect to the energy lost by the particles, a fast responses and good radiation tolerance. Where timely machine protection is in place, for every detector location the fraction of particles from the hardronic showers has been linked to the energy distribution within the coil through simulation-based analysis and maximum allowable energy value has been established. The signal from the detector is acquired by the front-end electronics and, where applicable, the measurement is compared with the threshold relevant for the considered ring location. As the dimensions of the accelerators varies greatly, the signal might be acquired, digitized in the accelerator tunnel and then sent to the surface electronics to be processed – as it happens in the LHC – or the complete processing may occur in a shielded facility closely located. In the former case, radiation tolerant electronics is required. In the LHC, when a threshold is exceeded, the beam permit signal is revoked and the circulating particles are directed towards the dump line. In machines employing warm magnets – such as the PS Booster – the beam parameters are tuned before the next injection, to increase the quality of the beam. A discrete components design of a current digitizer based on the current-to-frequency converter (CFC) principle has been studied in this work. The design targets at rather high input current compared to similar acquisition systems, with a maximum equal to 100 mA and a minimum of 1 nA, as required by the ionization chamber that will be employed in the Proton Synchrotron and Booster accelerators {{as well as in the}} LINAC 4.
