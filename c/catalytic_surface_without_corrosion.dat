40|$|The {{quantification}} of mass loss, surface topography, {{depth of}} pitting, and localized corrosion for steels subject to marine corrosion requires {{the removal of}} rusts, preferably without causing additional mass loss, pitting, or other damage. Conventional procedures using inhibited hydrochloric acid or Clarke's solution are shown to remove short-term marine rusts but also to cause new corrosion including pitting and related rust products. Both increase with longer exposure to the cleaning solutions. Water washing with soft water left calcareous materials on the metal surface. Ultrasonic removal did not cause additional corrosion but was effective only for very light rusts.

In the present work, LTC techniques such as industrial and plasma-assisted treatments were applied to stainless steel and compared for their resistance to corrosion. The micro-chemical composition of hardened layer before and after corrosion treatments was studied on both the samples by surface-sensitive XPS and AES techniques. The results of plasma-assisted LTC treatment showed similar behavior of corrosion resistance as industrial LTC treatment. Hence, the plasma-assisted LTC treatment can be a suitable replacement for the industrial LTC treatment of stainless steel...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhen surface-supported {{chemical}} reactions are performed in microsystems, high production rate cannot be obtained {{due to the}} intrinsically low surface area. Increasing the active surface area of silicon microsystems is a challenge that is addressed in this paper using two original approaches: (i) modifying the structure of silicon by creating nanostructures (black silicon) using conventional etching processes of silicon micromachining or (ii) depositing a layer of porous _-alumina by washcoating a colloidal suspension of boehmite onto the silicon <b>surface.</b> The <b>catalytic</b> oxidation of carbon monoxide on platinum was chosen as a first test reaction {{in the domain of}} heterogeneous catalysis. In order to perform this reaction, platinum was either deposited by sputtering on silicon devices with black silicon nanostructuration, or impregnated inside the porosity of an alumina layer previously deposited on a silicon device. For specific biological applications, such as proteins analysis, some biological reactions could be advantageously achieved in microsystems using surface-supported species. As an example, an enzymatic reaction was carried out usingsilicon devices modified with black silicon nanostructuration and further functionalized with trypsin as a model enzyme. The catalytic activity was compared between silicon devices with the same two types of catalysts, comprising or not an enhancement of the surface activity. A minimum 10 - fold increase in catalytic activity was estimated from kinetic measurements and represents the augmentation of the active surface really available for reactions. It was also shown how these catalytic materials were integrated in a microreactor increasing its <b>catalytic</b> active <b>surface</b> <b>without</b> modifying its global size...|$|R
40|$|Development of new {{membrane}} {{materials for}} direct methanol fuel cells Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) can convert the chemical {{energy of a}} fuel directly into electrical energy with high efficiency and low emission of pollutants. DMFCs {{can be used as}} the power sources to portable electronic devices like laptop computers, cellular phones and, to a less degree, vehicular applications. In order to compete with Li-ion batteries for portable applications higher power densities must be achieved. For that reason DMFCs should be operated at high methanol concentrations. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key component of the DMFC. Currently Perfluorosulfonated ionomer (PFSI) membranes, like DuPont’s Nafion® and Asahi Chemical’s Aciplex®, are used as a PEM in DMFCs due to their excellent proton conductivity, mechanical strength and thermal and chemical stability. However, their high methanol cross over, especially at high methanol concentrations and, high cost (US 700 /m 2) due to the expensive fluorination step, severely limit their commercialization in fuel cells. Therefore there is a strong need to develop new polymeric membranes. To achieve this, various strategies were employed: •	Impregnation of conductive polymer into a porous support to obtain composite membranes with low methanol crossover and long term stability •	Incorporation of inorganic fillers into the bulk phase of conductive polymer to increase the proton conductivity {{and at the same time}} decrease the methanol cross-over •	Surface micro-structuring of the conductive polymer by hot embossing to increase the effective <b>catalytic</b> <b>surface</b> area <b>without</b> increasing the geometric one.

30|$|In {{order to}} get more {{information}} about the type of adsorption and the effectiveness of the studied inhibitor, potentiodynamic polarization measurements were performed at different temperatures (25 – 55  °C) for Pb and alloy I (as representative alloy) in 1  M HCl solution without and with selected concentrations of phytic acid. The corrosion parameters showed that increasing of the solution temperature leads to an increase in the Icorr, and Ecorr shifts to more positive direction. These results reflect the enhancement of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction as well as anodic dissolution of Pb and its alloys with the increase of temperature [34, 35]. Similar results were obtained by Hassan [36] for corrosion inhibition of mild steel by triazole derivatives in HCl solution. Therefore, the increase of corrosion is pronounced with increasing temperature [37]. On the other hand, the slopes of βc and βa Tafel lines remain almost unchanged with increasing temperature. This indicates that the temperature only activates the <b>surface</b> for <b>corrosion</b> <b>without</b> affecting the mechanism.|$|R

The relationship between a rate of hydrogen recombination and temperature of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>surface</b> has been revealed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the soil composition on the corrosion resistance of buried metallic structures {{and the nature of}} the corrosion products formed are of great importance in many industrial applications, as well as in archaeological studies of metallic finds. Modifications in the soils characteristics can result from agricultural activity, such as fertilization, chemicals accidentally spilled into the soil (acids or strong bases), acid rains, etc. Gerwin and Braumhauer [1] concluded that corrosion of buried iron objects often decreases in loamy soils because of oxygen deficiency. On the other hand, a sandy soil results in comparatively good drainage and aeration. The corrosion of copper in two Portuguese soils was studied. The original soils were characterized, and modifications were produced by adding chlorides in various amounts covering ranges of chlorides typical of the seawater. The aggressiveness degree of the various soil samples was determined. The morphology of the corroded copper <b>surfaces,</b> with and <b>without</b> <b>corrosion</b> products, was analysed by visual observation, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

40|$|The {{development}} of Direct Ethanol Fuel Cells (DEFCs) {{is important for}} obtaining alternative energy converters. Within this objective, there is an interesting topic that is considered fundamental to the {{development of}} these devices: the ethanol reaction mechanism in the anode of the DEFCs. Some groups have investigated this process, but still there are many difficulties to achieve a complete understanding of the ethanol reaction mechanism. Using experimentation procedures is difficult to identify the reaction intermediates and the reaction paths, whereas the theoretical investigations are still in development. These facts encourage both experimental and theoretical investigations to understand completely the ethanol reaction process in the DEFCs. Currently, the most commonly investigated <b>catalytic</b> <b>surfaces</b> are Pt-Ru, Pt-Sn, and Pt-Ru-Sn mixtures and some catalytic mixtures that contain nickel, Pt-Ru-Ni and Pt-Sn-Ni. Nevertheless the experimental studies cannot elucidate entirely the reaction intermediates and reaction paths. So to date there are not known satisfactory explanations of the catalytic processes existent in the ethanol adsorption and decomposition processes on different <b>catalytic</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Because of this, the theoretical investigation could help to elucidate the complex reaction mechanism involved in the ethanol reaction in the DEFCs. Considering this, it is carried out in this work the study of the initial steps of the ethanol reaction mechanism on a Pt-Sn <b>catalytic</b> <b>surface.</b> Specifically the potential energy surface (PES) of the adsorption and dehydrogenation steps of ethanol decomposition on a specific <b>catalytic</b> <b>surface</b> (Pt 3 Sn 1 in atomic ratio) is investigated in this work, using self-consistent periodic slab calculations based on density functional theory. This research reveals that ethanol does not have an unique mode of adsorption on this <b>catalytic</b> <b>surface,</b> as well as the dehydrogenation pathway does not only proceed via the ethoxy species formation, but also via the 2 -hydroxyethyl species formation. Additionally it is showed that acetaldehyde desorbs in the process of dehydrogenation of ethanol. These results allow to understand in detail the first steps of the ethanol oxidation on a specific <b>catalytic</b> <b>surface,</b> which constitutes a contribution to clarify the problem of selectivity in catalysts for DEFCs. ...|$|R

This investigation addresses the biological function of EndoII, its mode of interaction with its substrate and roles of individual residues in catalysis, sequence recognition and binding. It is shown here that EndoII increases the frequency of non-homologous recombination in phage-infected cells, showing that EndoII indeed can induce recombinational events. Although single-stranded nicks are frequent in in vitro reactions with purified protein, the enzyme is found to produce mostly double-stranded breaks in vivo, since nicks are repaired. Mutations of residues positioned on the putative <b>catalytic</b> <b>surface</b> result in severely reduced catalytic activity, while residues in the N-terminal region and a middle region (MR) appear to mainly contribute to substrate binding. Mutation of the putatively magnesium-binding residue E 118 renders the enzyme catalytically inactive.
