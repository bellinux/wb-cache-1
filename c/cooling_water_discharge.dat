A key aspect of this study involved properly incorporating the submerged cooling water buoyant jet into the 3 D model. To overcome the scale and interface barriers between the near-field and far-field zones of the buoyant jet, a sub-grid scheme was applied, and the coupled system of equations of motion, heat conservation and state are solved with a single modeling procedure over the complete field. Special care was taken with the diffusion and jet entrainment by using a second order turbulence closure model for vertical diffusion and the Smagorinsky formula for horizontal diffusion as well as jet entrainment. The model was calibrated and validated in terms of buoyant jet trajectory, centerline dilution, and temperature and velocity profiles. Extensive modeling experiments without and with the Burrard Generating Station in operation were then carried out to investigate the receiving water circulations and thermal processes {{under the influence of the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharge.</b> The model results reveal that under the influence of the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharge,</b> peak ebb currents are stronger than peak flood currents in the near-surface layer, and the reverse is true in the near-bottom layer.

Climate change {{is expected to}} directly impact electricity supply, {{in terms of both}} water availability for hydropower generation and cooling water usage for thermoelectric power. Improved understanding of how climate change may impact the availability and temperature of water resources is therefore of major importance. Here we use a multi-model ensemble to show the potential impacts of climate change on global hydropower and <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> potential. For the first time, combined projections of streamflow and water temperature were produced with three global hydrological models (GHMs) to account for uncertainties in the structure and parametrization of these GHMs in both water availability and water temperature. The GHMs were forced with bias-corrected output of five general circulation models (GCMs) for both the lowest and highest representative concentration pathways (RCP 2. 6 and RCP 8. 5). The ensemble projections of streamflow and water temperature were then used to quantify impacts on gross hydropower potential and <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> capacity of rivers worldwide. We show that global gross hydropower potential is expected to increase between + 2. 4 % (GCM-GHM ensemble mean for RCP 2. 6) and + 6. 3 % (RCP 8. 5) for the 2080 s compared to 1971 – 2000.

Global mean <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> capacity is projected to decrease by 4. 5 - 15 % (2080 s).

A survey of 55 aquaria belonging to 43 hobbyists revealed 27 apple snails, with one owner having 22 snails. Assessment of environmental tolerances and impacts of P. diffusa, based largely on studies of the closely related and commonly confused congener P. bridgesii, suggests that direct habitat impacts by this species are likely to be minor. However, there could be indirect influences on native biodiversity through predation on eggs or competition for food supplies with other detritivorous species if densities were to become high.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the numerical modelling of discharges where density differences {{play an important}} role, in particular positive buoyant <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharges.</b> Two regions, in which the hydrodynamics {{are influenced by the}} discharge, can be distinguished; the near-field and the far-field. In the former region the initial jet characteristics of momentum flux, buoyancy flux and outfall geometry influence the jet trajectory and mixing. In the far-field the discharge characteristics become less important and ambient conditions will control trajectory and dilution through buoyant spreading and diffusion due to ambient turbulence. Density differences between the discharged and the ambient water are even smaller than in case of salt and fresh-water problems when <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> problems are considered. Gravitational forces are therefore less dominant and turbulence {{plays an important role in}} heat transport. Laboratory experiments are used to verify the results from the 3 -D shallow water model TRISULA, which computes the far-field hydrodynamics and mass transport. The turbulence model used, a common isotropic k-e model which takes stratification into account, seems not appropriate to simulate the (low Reynolds number) laboratory experiments. Vertical mixing is overestimated and the front lags behind and is very steep. The consequences of assuming hydrostatic pressure for the front shape are investigated, by developing a 2 -DV model in which a non-hydrostatic pressure correction term, is incorporated. A significant improvement is gained as far as the shape of the front and the flow pattern is concerned. This is especially true for thermals.

Field experiments were conducted over a six-year period {{in the vicinity of}} the power plant, with six control sites, five at influent areas, one at reference site, and three experimental sites at effluent areas. In general, among the monitoring sites, polychaetes and bryozoans were the most abundant organisms, and their recruitment on settlement plates was always higher in influent than in effluent areas. Partially as a result of a 5 -week accidental shutdown of the power plant in the early spring of 2001, a higher recruitment of both polychaetes and bryozoans, comparable to that in influent areas, was observed in the spring and summer of 2001, but only at site Efflu, one of the three effluent areas. Albeit right nearby, site Efflu 2 intriguingly showed no such increase in recruitment, MPT as well.
