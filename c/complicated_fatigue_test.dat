A helium inlet is used for letting liquid helium into the PF- 1 coil conductor. A full-scale helium inlet sample for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> and the respective tooling were designed and manufactured. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> of the full-scale helium inlet sample were conducted in accordance with ITER requirements testing parameters in order to check the fatigue strength of the structure. Before the <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> thermo-cycling of the helium inlet in the temperature range of 77  to 293  K was conducted. Before and after the <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> the leak tightness of the full-scale helium inlet sample was validated by the vacuum chamber method. A low ohm electrical joint is used to connect two NbTi «CICC» conductors of PF- 1 coil into a single electrical loop. To qualify the design and technology of manufacturing of the electrical joint, a full-scale dummy joint sample was developed for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> at 77  K. The main design feature of the full-scale dummy joint sample for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> is a symmetrical model of two dummy joint samples with simultaneous loading to compensate the bending moment. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> of the full-scale helium inlet sample at 77  K have been successfully conducted in 2013. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> of the full-scale dummy joint sample will be conducted in 2014.

40|$|Viscoelastic Continuum Damage Model. (Under the {{direction}} of Dr. Y. Richard Kim.) Fatigue performance modeling is one the major topics in asphalt concrete modeling work. Currently the only standard <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> available for asphalt concrete mixtures is the flexural bending <b>fatigue</b> <b>test,</b> AASHTO T- 321. There are several issues associated with flexural <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing,</b> {{the most important of}} which are the stress state is not uniform but varies over the depth of the specimen and equipment for fabricating beam specimens is not widely available. Viscoelastic continuum damage (VECD) <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> is a promising alternative to flexural <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing.</b> Different researchers have successfully applied the VECD model to asphalt concrete mixtures using constant crosshead rate direct tension test. However, due to the load level limitation of the new coming Asphalt Mixture Performance Tester (AMPT) testing equipment, there is an immediate need to develop a model that can characterize fatigue performance quickly using cyclic test data. In this study, a simplified viscoelastic continuum damage model developed at NCSU is applied to various North Carolina mixtures, which are used in the NCDOT HWY- 2007 - 7 MEPDG local calibration project. It is shown that the simplified VECD model can predict <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> fairly accurately under various temperature conditions and strain levels. It is also shown that the model can be further utilized to simulate both the strain controlled direct tension <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> and the traditional beam <b>fatigue</b> <b>test.</b> In this thesis, simulation results are presented.
