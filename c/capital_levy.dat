Unstamped banknotes were worth a quarter of their nominal value after this campaign. Later the 100,000 pengő note was issued again in different colors – this banknote and higher denominations did not fall under the <b>capital</b> <b>levy.</b>|$|E

There were several attempts to break down inflation, such as a 75% <b>capital</b> <b>levy</b> in December 1945. However, this did not stop the hyperinflation, and prices continued spiraling out of control, with ever-higher denominations introduced. The denominations milpengő (one million pengő) and b.-pengő (pronunciation: bilpengő, one trillion pengő) were used to alleviate calculations, cut down the number of zeros and enable the reuse of banknote designs with only the colour and denomination name changed.|$|E
500|$|Before the war, the {{government}} spent 13 percent of GNP; in 1918 it spent 59 percent of GNP. The war was financed by borrowing large sums {{at home and}} abroad, by new taxes, and by inflation. It was implicitly financed by postponing maintenance and repair, and canceling unneeded projects. The government avoided indirect taxes because they raised the cost of living, and caused discontent among the working class. In 1913-14, indirect taxes on tobacco and alcohol yielded £75 million, while direct taxes yielded £88 million, including an income tax of £44 million and estate duties of £22 million. That is, 54 percent of revenue came from direct taxes; by 1918, direct taxes were 80 percent of revenue. [...] There was {{a strong emphasis on}} being [...] "fair" [...] and being [...] "scientific." [...] The public generally supported the heavy new taxes, with minimal complaints. The Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff <b>capital</b> <b>levy,</b> which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917. [...] Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax. The main increase in revenue came from income tax, which in 1915 went up to 3s. 6d in the pound (17.5%), and individual exemptions were lowered. The income tax rate grew to [...] 5s (25%) in 1916, and 6s (30%) in 1918. Altogether, taxes provided at most 30 percent of national expenditures, with the rest from borrowing. The national debt soared from £625 million to £7,800 million. Government bonds typically paid five percent. Inflation escalated so that the pound in 1919 purchased only a third of the basket it had purchased it 1914. Wages were laggard, and the poor and retired were especially hard hit.|$|E

[...] The present method of raising funds is denounced; and it is pointed out that only one quarter of the colossal expenditure made necessary by the war has been raised by taxation, and that the three quarters borrowed at onerous rates is sure to be a burden on the nation's future. The capital needed, when peace comes, to ensure a happy and contented democracy must be procured without encroaching on the minimum standard of life, and without hampering production. Indirect taxation must therefore be concentrated on those luxuries of which it is desirable that the consumption be discouraged. The steadily rising unearned increment of urban and mineral land ought, by appropriate direct taxation, to be brought into the public exchequer; [...] "the definite teachings of economic science are no longer to be disregarded." [...] Hence incomes are to be taxed above the necessary cost of family maintenance, private fortunes during life and at death; while a special <b>capital</b> <b>levy</b> must be made to pay off {{a substantial portion of the}} national debt.|$|E

The conventional wisdom is that an annual net wealth tax would score highly on equity grounds but poorly on the criteria of efficiency and administrative feasibility. This paper sorts out some of the models of the allocative and efficiency effects of wealth taxation and concludes that strong positions on the effects of wealth taxation are untenable. ...|$|R

The relevance of these features, which in varying degrees is underdeveloped or underappreciated in pertinent literatures, is elaborated and then considered with regard to the problem of transition to a consumption tax. Other transition issues are distinguished, and specific attention is devoted to rate changes under a consumption tax and whether owners of preexisting capital are effectively compensated through higher net-of-tax returns due to repeal of the income tax. The analysis is also related to literature that examines dynamic models of taxation, particularly work simulating consumption tax transitions and assessing the optimality of capital taxation in the long run. ...|$|R
60|$|The final {{consideration}} influencing the reader's attitude to this proposal must, however, depend on his {{view as to}} the future place in the world's progress of the vast paper entanglements which are our legacy from war finance {{both at home and}} abroad. The war has ended with every one owing every one else immense sums of money. Germany owes a large sum to the Allies, the Allies owe a large sum to Great Britain, and Great Britain owes a large sum to the United States. The holders of war loan in every country are owed a large sum by the State, and the State in its turn is owed a large sum by these and other taxpayers. The whole position is in the highest degree artificial, misleading, and vexatious. We shall never be able to move again, unless we can free our limbs from these paper shackles. A general bonfire is so great a necessity that unless we can make of it an orderly and good-tempered affair in which no serious injustice is done to any one, it will, when it comes at last, grow into a conflagration that may destroy much else as well. As regards internal debt, I am one of those who believe that a <b>capital</b> <b>levy</b> for the extinction of debt is an absolute prerequisite of sound finance in everyone of the European belligerent countries. But the continuance on a huge scale of indebtedness between Governments has special dangers of its own.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} existing college scholarship rules on the incentive to save. The analysis shows that families that are eligible for college scholarships face "education tax rates" on capital income of between 22 percent and 47 percent in addition to regular slate and federal income taxes. The scholarship rules also impose an annual tax on previously accumulated assets. Through {{the combination of the}} implied tax on capital income and the associated tax on previously accumulated assets, the scholarship rules that apply to a middle-income family reduce the value of an extra dollar of accumulated assets by 30 cents in four years. A similar family with two children who attend college in succession will see an initial dollar of assets reduced to 50 cents. Such <b>capital</b> <b>levies</b> of 30 to 50 percent are a strong incentive not to save for college expenses but to rely instead on financial assistance and even on regular market borrowing, Moreover, since any foods saved for retirement are also SUbject to these education <b>capital</b> <b>levies.</b> the scholarship rules discourage retirement saving as well as saving for education. The empirical analysis developed here, based on the 1986 Survey of Consumer Finances, implies that these incentives do have a powerful effect on the actual accumulation of financial assets. More specifically, the estimated parameter values imply that the scholarship rules induce a typical household with a head aged 45 years old, with two precollege children, and with income of $ 40, 000 a year to reduce accumulated financial assets by $ 23. 124. approximately 50 percent of what would have been accumulated without the adverse effect of the scholarship rules. ...|$|R

5000|$|Some economists {{argue that}} <b>capital</b> <b>levies</b> are a {{disincentive}} to savings and investment, but {{others argue that}} in theory this need not be the case. The latter view has gained some acceptance {{as more and more}} heavily indebted nations struggle to raise revenues; in October 2013, the International Monetary Fund released a report stating, [...] "The sharp deterioration of the public finances in many countries has revived interest in a 'capital levy' - a one-off tax on private wealth - as an exceptional measure to restore debt sustainability. The appeal is that such a tax, if it is implemented before avoidance is possible and there is a belief that it will never be repeated, does not distort behavior." [...] The next year the Bundesbank proposed that Eurozone countries should attempt a one-off levy of bank deposits to avoid bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|A <b>capital</b> <b>levy</b> {{is a tax}} {{on capital}} rather than income, {{collected}} once rather than annually. For example, a <b>capital</b> <b>levy</b> of 30% will see an individual or business with a net worth of $100,000 pay $30,000 in tax, regardless of income. It is considered difficult for a government to implement, as the confiscatory nature of taxation is more apparent than with income tax. Thus, once such a levy is enacted, capital flight is likely to ensue.|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{financial}} and economic crisis of 2008 / 2009, public debt in almost all OECD countries has increased significantly. The European debt crisis has further intensified {{over the past few}} weeks. Private households with high levels of wealth and income could be enlisted to help with refinancing and reducing this public debt through forced loans and one-off <b>capital</b> <b>levies,</b> without a risk of slowdown in consumer demand. This would also counteract the increased inequality in the distribution of wealth. Imposing such levies is not easy, however, since it involves valuation of assets and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. It is difficult to estimate the revenue effects of such a levy for the countries in crisis due to the current lack of sufficient data. For Germany, simulations by DIW Berlin based on a personal allowance of 250 000 euros (500 000 euros for married couples) give a tax base of 92 percent of the GDP. A forced loan or a levy of, for example, ten percent of this tax base could thus mobilize just over nine percent of the GDP-around 230 billion euros. This would affect the richest eight percent of the adult population. It would presumably also be possible to generate considerable revenue in the European crisis countries in the same way. This would be an important step towards consolidation of public finances, and would facilitate reforms to promote growth...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{trade-off}} between equity and {{growth in the}} context of tax-financed investment in public capital. Taking into account stylized facts on wealth accumulation, we model agent heterogeneity through differences in saving behavior, income source and time preference. In contrast to the results of studies that introduce heterogeneity through different initial endowments only, we find that under our heterogeneity assumptions an equity-efficiency trade-off does not necessarily occur. We show that a consumption tax or a <b>capital</b> tax, <b>levied</b> to finance public capital, does not increase inequality. In our model capital tax-financed public investment has even an inequality-reducing effect - thus allowing for Pareto-improving public investment that decreases inequality. Additionally we find that agents differ in their preferred tax rates. These results are valid for both, the case of endogenous growth and the case of steady state convergence and do not require the assumption of an identical rate of pure time preference across all households...|$|R
