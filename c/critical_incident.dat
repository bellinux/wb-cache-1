The study shows that those incidents that refer to the individual's own life and safety {{as well as those}} interventions that regard one's relatives and acquaintances is most relevant. Also, we identified a strong correlation between age and relevant <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> as well as significant differences in the way employees rank the <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> in strict relation with the type of interventions they take part in...|$|R
40|$|The {{maritime}} {{operations are}} growing {{more complex and}} increasingly dependent on Dynamic Positioning. <b>Critical</b> <b>incidents</b> in DP have a potential for economic loss and disastrous consequences for human life and the natural environment. DP operators make time-critical decisions in order to rapidly and effectively handle unexpected critical situations. A large number of incidents do not lead to accidents because the operators manage to recover to normal operation mode. It is interesting to understand the characteristics of human operators handling of <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> and {{to see how they}} are able to recover. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify characteristics of <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> in DP and characteristics of decision-making. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 experienced DP operators, sampled purposively from shipping companies, drilling companies and a DP training centre among others. The interviews provided 24 incident recollections that were transcribed and thematically analyzed. The main findings were four characteristics themes of <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> in DP. The themes were Situation Awareness, Experience, Human and Automation and Decision Strategy. This study contributes to understanding characteristics of <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> in DP.

40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} reviewed existing data on {{the impact}} of work-related <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> in hospital-based health care professionals. Work-related <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> may induce post-traumatic stress symptoms or even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression and may negatively affect health care practitioners' behaviors toward patients. Nurses and doctors often cope by working part time or switching jobs. Hospital administrators and health care practitioners themselves may underestimate the effects of work-related <b>critical</b> <b>incidents.</b> Relevant online databases were searched for original research published from inception to 2009 and manual searches of the Journal of Traumatic Stress, reference lists, and the European Traumatic Stress Research Database were conducted. Two researchers independently decided on inclusion and study quality. Effect sizes were estimated using standardized mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals. Consistency was evaluated, using the I 2 -statistic. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. Eleven studies, which included 3866 participants, evaluated the relationship between work-related <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Six of these studies, which included 1695 participants, also reported on the relationship between work-related <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Heterogeneity among studies was high and could not be accounted for by study quality, character of the incident, or timing of data collection. Pooled effect sizes for the impact of work-related <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> on post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression were small to medium. Remarkably, the effect was more pronounced in the longer than in the shorter term. In conclusion, this meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that work-related <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> are positively related to post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression in hospital-based health care professionals. Health care workers and their supervisors {{should be aware of the}} harmful effects of <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> and take preventive measures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is the {{evaluation}} of material for a new intercultural training instrument. More specifically, we examine the validity of 21 <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> used in the training. The training programme is targeted at natives in Western immigrant countries dealing - mostly professionally - with cultural diversity in their own country. The study yields support for the cross-cultural applicability of 14 <b>critical</b> <b>incidents.</b> Experts from Australia, Germany and the Netherlands largely agree in their judgements about to what extent reactions to the <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> are interculturally effective. The validity of the <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> is examined by relating personal competences and self-reported intercultural behaviour of lay respondents to their performance on the <b>critical</b> <b>incidents.</b> Results show that, in Australia and the Netherlands, intercultural effectiveness is related to measures of competences, in particular to open-mindedness and cultural empathy. The study yields some support for a relationship between self-reported intercultural behaviour and intercultural effectiveness. Moreover, speaking a foreign language shows a moderate relation with intercultural effectiveness. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Satisfaction {{is assumed}} to be an {{important}} cause of attitude change by mediating between preexposure and postexposure attitudes. A number of factors account for whether one is satisfied or not with a specific product or service. One factor is expectations, another performance of the product or service, and a third disconfirmation of expectation. Another possible factor that influences satisfaction is the affective reaction to product/service performance. The present thesis aimed at investigating satisfaction with public transport services. More specifically, the role of <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> in satisfaction was examined. In Studies I and IV the characteristics of <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> in public transport services were analyzed. Three different methods were in Study I applied to explore perceptual/cognitive experiences of negative <b>critical</b> <b>incidents.</b> The results suggested that employee behavior, reliability, simplicity, and design constitute perceived quality attributes in public transport services. Study IV investigated how individuals respond affectively to and evaluate satisfaction after such encounters. The results showed as expected that the <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> varied in both valence (positive-negative feelings) and activation (arousal). Study II confirmed the quality attributes found in Study I by means of further analyses of the covariances of rated frequencies of remembered negative <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> as well as of ratings of attributes-specific satisfaction. Some explanations of how frequencies of remembered negative <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> are coded in memory were tested in Studies II and III. The results showed that frequency of negative <b>critical</b> <b>incidents,</b> defined as disconfirmation of expectations, negatively affected overall satisfaction with public transport. The relationship was however not direct but mediated by attribute-specific satisfaction. Furthermore, the results obtained in Study IV showed that difference in satisfaction caused by different types of <b>critical</b> <b>incidents</b> were related to the affective reactions to the incidents.
