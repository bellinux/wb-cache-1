From April until May 2007, the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Court</b> reviewed 101 laws and decrees; they were deemed to be constitutional.

In a social systems theory {{perspective}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>courts</b> are autopoietic organisations which {{are capable of}} generating sufficient cognitive complexity in order to regulate themselves.

This situation occurred after the death of Franjo Tuđman on 10 December 1999, when Vlatko Pavletić became the acting president.

40|$|In recent years, legal {{scholars}} have paid {{a great deal}} of attention to the emergence of <b>constitutional</b> <b>courts</b> and judicial review in democracies worldwide, yet an intriguing parallel development in democratic constitutionalism has gone largely unnoticed: the establishment of independent bodies which, like <b>constitutional</b> <b>courts,</b> are concerned with foundational commitments of liberal democracy, but which advance these commitments mainly through investigations and advice-giving. Lacking de jure authority to block the implementation of unconstitutional laws and policies, the new advice givers instead make their contributions ex ante, identifying problems that warrant legislative attention and helping to craft laws and regulations that respond to foundational aspirations.

40|$|Organisation et {{direction}} du panel 155 International audienceConstitutional Courts play {{an increasing}} role in contemporary politics {{in every part}} of the world. In spite of this fact, research about Courts is under-developed beyond the US case. Research on European <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Courts</b> focused on the Judicialization hypothesis and especially the effects of the abstract review procedure on legislative behaviour (Landfried 1984, Stone 1992. 1999). Only a few articles questioned this position and claimed that Judicialization may at least be regulated by some variables, such as court position or public opinion (e. g. Vanberg 1998, 2001). Main countries under investigation were France and Germany. Additionally, we rarely (Ginsburg 2003) find substantial comparative analyses of <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Courts</b> and their institutional settings even though courts {{play an important role in}} most concepts of comparative politics (e. g. Lijphart 1999, Tsebelis 2002). Thus, Scholars are divided about the precise impact of <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Courts</b> as counter-majoritarian institutions or as veto players and the variables controlling it. To understand the role of <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Courts</b> in different political systems accurately, we need to base our knowledge on an explicit comparison between Courts. In order to do so, data, methodologies and theories should be truly and rigorously comparative. The aim of this panel is to focus on data, methods and theories that will stimulate comparative studies on <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Courts.</b> We expect papers focusing on one of these aspects or using the comparative approach to investigate a substantial issue concerning either intra-court decision-making or the role of courts in political systems.

40|$|The {{object of}} {{research}} is a relationship between ECHR and <b>constitutional</b> <b>courts</b> in various jurisdictions. The main aim {{of this article is}} to research the conflict between opinions of ECHR and national <b>Constitutional</b> <b>courts,</b> and also to find the root of this conflict. The methodology of this research consists of universal methods (such as analysis, synthesis, comparison) and jurisprudence-specific methods. In the course of research, the author used various theoretical sources, ECHR case-law and decisions of various national <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Courts.</b> Results. At this point of time, there are many theories that try to explain the relationship between international and national law. But their functioning can be observed only in practice. Many jurisdictions adhere to the concept of Dualism. National <b>Constitutional</b> <b>courts</b> may perceive legal opinions in two different ways: adhere to the legal opinion of ECHR or reach a different conclusion, different to that of ECHR. Because national <b>Constitutional</b> <b>courts</b> and ECHR employ different systems for establishing whether rights of the claimant were violated or not, courts may give more weight to the different factors. In the article, the author focuses attention on such reason of the conflict as justification for limitation of one's rights. Conclusions. Conflict of legal opinions of ECHR and national <b>Constitutional</b> <b>courts</b> is of axiological nature. Conflict per se does not imply that a given national government decided to breach its international obligations. Because of subsidiary nature of ECHR protection, conflicts is rather an exception that could be dealt with than a rule. </p...|$|R
