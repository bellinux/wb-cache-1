40|$|The {{hereditary}} anaemias {{present a}} major genetic health problem that contributes considerably to childhood mortality and morbidity {{in many developing}} countries. This article summarizes recent scientific and technical advances in knowledge concerning the genes involved and their interaction to produce major haemoglobinopathies, the clinical pictures of these conditions, and their diagnostic criteria. Though there is no definitive cure, supportive treatment for the haemoglobinopathies has improved significantly, offering {{better quality of life}} and improved survival, and should be attempted for all such patients. For sickle cell disease, this comprises a simple set of rules that should be incorporated into existing medical care, whereas for thalassaemia, a regimen of intensive blood transfusion and regular subcutaneous infusion of deferoxamine is recommended. This treatment is stressful and probably too expensive to be applied in many developing countries until the birth rate of patients needing it can be sufficiently reduced by <b>community</b> <b>control</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although {{a disease}} of great antiquity, {{scientific}} studies of schistosomiasis began only 150 years ago. The complete life-cycle was not described until just before the First World War, making it possible at last to plan proper <b>community</b> <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> Inadequate tools prevented their effective imple-mentation until well after the Second World War when new tools became available, thanks to the newly formed World Health Organization. Molluscicides spearheaded <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> until the late 1970 s but were then replaced by the newly developed, safe drugs still used today. Whatever the method used, the initial goal of eradication was, {{in the light of}} experience and cost, gradually replaced by less ambitious targets; first to stop transmission and then to reduce morbidity. The most successful programmes combined several methods to minimise reinfection after chemotherapy. Comparisons be-tween different programmes are difficult without using appropriate, standardised diagnostic tech-niques and the correct epidemiological measurements. Some examples will be presented, mainly from our studies on Schistosoma mansoni in Kenya. Drug resistance on a scale comparable with malaria has not occurred in schistosomiasis but the likely withdrawal of all drugs except praziquantel leaves its control extremely vulnerable to this potential problem. An effective, affordable vaccine for use in endemic countries is unlikely to be read...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{primary and secondary}} hypertension was determined in {{a random sample of}} 7455 Swedish men aged 47 to 54 years. Three hundred and sizty-one men were undergoing treatment for hypertension. Seven hundred and ninety-eight men who had blood pressures above 175 / 115 mm Hg at preliminary screening were recalled for further blood pressure measurements. Those on treatment and all the untreated men whose blood pressures were still over 175 / 115 mm Hg then underwent extensive investigation for secondary hypertension. Renal parenchymal hypertension was found in 25 (3 - 6 %) patients, renovascular hypertension in four (0 - 6 %), and other forms of secondary hypertension in 11 (1 - 6 %). The investigation led to surgical treatment in only two cases (0 - 3 %). The low {{prevalence of}} secondary hypertension, especially surgically curable forms of hypertension, makes routine screening for these cases unnecessary, at least when patients with hypertension have been found at screening. These data {{must be taken into account}} in planning <b>community</b> <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> in hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Effective <b>community</b> based malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> {{require an}} {{understanding}} of current perceptions of malaria as a disease and its severe manifestations. Quantitative and qualitative surveys of mothers on the Kenyan Coast suggest that fever is conceptualised in biomedical terms whereas the aetiology of severe malaria {{is perceived to be}} of more complex cultural origin. This is reflected in the treatments sought for convulsions. The results are discussed in the context of ethnographic factors. To be effective, future health information programmes must take cultural beliefs into account...|$|R
40|$|Cystic {{echinococcosis}} is {{a highly}} endemic parasitic zoonosis that {{is present in the}} Southern Cone countries of America. For several decades, various prevention and <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> have been implemented in different countries and regions, with varying results. In Uruguay, a new <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> was implemented in 2006 that employed new strategies for canine diagnosis and treatment, dog population control, diagnosis in humans, epidemiological surveillance, and health education, including <b>community</b> participation. The <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> in Uruguay addresses the control and surveillance of the disease from a holistic perspective based on Primary Health Care, which has strengthened the community&# 8217;s participation in developing and coordinating activities in an interdisciplinary manner. Similarly, the <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> that is currently implemented is based on a risk-focused approach. The surveillance and control measures were focused on small villages and extremely poor urban areas. In this study, the strategies used and the results obtained from 2008 - 2013 are analysed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Human scabies, {{caused by}} skin {{infestation}} with the arthropod mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, typically {{results in a}} papular, intensely pruritic eruption involving the interdigital spaces, and flexure creases. Recent research {{has led to a}} reassessment of the morbidity attributable to this parasite in endemic communities, particularly resulting from secondary skin sepsis and postinfective complications including glomerulonephritis. This has led to studies of the benefits of <b>community</b> based <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> and to concerns regarding the emergence of drug resistance when such strategies are employed. The renewed research interest into the biology of this infection has resulted in the application of molecular tools. This has established that canine and human scabies populations are genetically distinct, a finding with major implications for the formulation of public health control policies. Further research is needed to increase understanding of drug resistance, and to identify new drug targets and potential vaccine candidates...|$|R
40|$|Research question: Can {{alternate}} algorithms be used {{in place}} of conventional algorithm for epidemiological studies of HIV infection with less expenses? Objective: To compare the results of HIV sero- prevalence as determined by test algorithms combining three kits with conventional test algorithm. Study design: Cross &#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;" sectional. Participants: 282 truck drivers. Statistical analysis: Sensitivity and specificity analysis and predictive values. Results: Three different algorithms that do not include Western Blot (WB) were compared with the conventional algorithm, in a truck driver population with 5. 6 &#x 0025; prevalence of HIV &#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;"I infection. Algorithms with one EIA (Genetic Systems or Biotest) and a rapid test (immunocomb) or with two EIAs showed 100 &#x 0025; positive predictive value {{in relation to the}} conventional algorithm. Using an algorithm with EIA as screening test and a rapid test as a confirmatory test was 50 to 70 &#x 0025; less expensive than the conventional algorithm per positive scrum sample. These algorithms obviate the interpretation of indeterminate results and also give differential diagnosis of HIV- 2 infection. Alternate algorithms are ideally suited for <b>community</b> based <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> in developing countries. Application of these algorithms in population with low prevalence should also be studied in order to evaluate universal applicability...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{has been}} a challenge in all countries. The {{aim of this study}} is to ascertain the risk factors that predispose patients to infections with extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) -producing gram-negative bacteria and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Patients who were treated in the secondary care hospital due to infections in 2009 and their isolates were evaluated retrospectively. In total, 174 patients and their 189 isolates, which contained 36 ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria, 112 non-ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria, and 41 gram-positive bacteria were evaluated retrospectively. Hospitalisation in the previous 3 months, comorbidity, and usage of amoxicillin-clavulanate in the previous 3 months were determined to be the risk factors associated with infections by the ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria. Hospitalisation was found to be a risk factor for infection with MRSA. Hospitalisation and underlying conditions increase the colonisation with resistant bacteria and resistance rates in the patients, hospitals and <b>communities.</b> An infection <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> should be contemplated not only for hospitals, but also for the greater community...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} 411 {{household}} heads was undertaken in Gokwe district, Zimbabwe, to assess villagers' knowledge, practices and perceptions about malaria and their implications for malaria control. Our {{results show that}} although the government has sustained an annual indoor insecticide spraying programme for over four decades, about 50 % of respondents did not adequately understand its purpose, with 26 % believing that the programme was intended to kill domestic pests, not including mosquitos. During the 1991 - 92 spraying cycle, 72 % of the villagers had their homes sprayed. However, 21 % of such villagers refused to have some rooms in their homes sprayed. Householders' understanding of {{the function of the}} spraying programme was significantly related to their compliance with it (P < 0. 05). A total of 82 % of respondents reported not taking any measures to protect themselves from malaria. Taking preventive measures was significantly related to knowledge of the causes of malaria (P < 0. 05). The study shows the importance of involving <b>communities</b> in a <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> intended to be to their benefit and of informing them about available options for protection against malaria...|$|R
40|$|The {{trends in}} {{mortality}} from {{coronary heart disease}} in the 1970 s and the differences in trends between counties within Finland were calculated from official mortality statistics among the population aged 35 to 64 years. During this period coronary mortality declined by a mean of 1. 1 % for men and 2. 3 % for women annually {{in the whole of}} Finland. A <b>community</b> based cardiovascular <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> was started in 1972 in North Karelia, a county in the east of Finland. The decline in coronary mortality in this county between 1969 and 1979 was 24 % in men and 51 % in women. The decline in the rest of Finland over the same period was 12 % in men and 24 % in women. The decline in North Karelia was greater than that in other counties of Finland {{for both men and women}} and that difference exceeded random variation, with over 95 % likelihood for both sexes. Even with adjustment for rates before 1974 with cross-county multiple regression analyses the difference persisted. Although further studies are needed, the changes in coronary mortality in North Karelia suggest that the preventive programme has been effective...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of data from two successive tuberculosis prevalence surveys (conducted at an interval of 18 months) in {{a random sample of}} villages in Bangalore District, South India, has shown that the term " a case of pulmonary tuberculosis " does not represent a single uniform entity, but rather embraces cases of several types, differing considerably in their mortality experience, tuberculin sensitivity, results of X-ray and sputum examinations, and in the reliability of their diagnosis. The status at the first survey of the cases found at the resurvey and that at resurvey of those found at the initial survey give an indication of changes with time. Such changes show considerable differences for the various types of cases and provide another dimension to study the differences among them. The authors consider that, in spite of the great need and importance of a single straightforward definition of a case, no such definition is suitable for all situations; there is no other option but to continue to use more than one definition. Although, theoretically, finding a single bacillus in the sputum should be adequate proof of pulmonary tuberculosis, it is shown that finding, of a few bacilli, 3 or less, is probably far too, often due to artefacts and should not be the basis for a diagnosis. The findings also well bear out the notion that positive radiological findings, in the absence of bacteriological confirmation, indicate not pulmonary tuberculosis, but only a high risk of the disease. Direct microscopy appears to be a consistent index of disease but, in community surveys, has the, limitations of missing a substantial proportion of cases and of adding some false cases. The extent of these limitations, so far as symptomatic patients in a <b>community</b> tuberculosis <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> are concerned, remains to be investigated...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many {{regional}} and country-wide <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> for Johne's disease (JD) were developed due to associated economic losses, {{or because of}} a possible association with Crohn's disease. These <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> were often not successful, partly because management protocols were not followed, including the introduction of infected replacement cattle, because tests to identify infected animals were unreliable, and uptake by farmers was not high enough because of a perceived low return on investment. In {{the absence of a}} cure or effective commercial vaccines, control of JD is currently primarily based on herd management strategies to avoid infection of cattle and restrict within-farm and farm-to-farm transmission. Although JD <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> have been implemented in most developed countries, lessons learned from JD prevention and <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are underreported. Also, JD <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are typically evaluated in a limited number of herds and the duration of the study is less than 5 year, making it difficult to adequately assess the efficacy of <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> In this manuscript, we identify the most important gaps in knowledge hampering JD prevention and <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> including vaccination and diagnostics. Secondly, we discuss directions that research should take to address those knowledge gap...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether indigenous peoples’ {{right to}} reproductive autonomy {{can be established}} from the right to self-determination and to health under international human rights law, {{and the extent to}} which their reproductive health rights can be effectively protected against government-sponsored population policies. Historically there have been instances of government population policies targeting specifically or primarily indigenous peoples. This includes the US sterilisation programmes in the 1970 s and Australia’s removal of Aboriginal children to live with foster white families (1900 - 1969), as well as in more recent years Peru’s family planning programme (1996 - 2000). The past decade has seen some important developments in this field, in particular the Australian Government’s symbolically important ‘apology’ to the ‘Stolen Generation’ in 2008, and the proposal for a state Stolen Generations (Compensation) Bill 2014, which, if adopted, could provide a measure of reparation for past policies. At the global level a number of important initiatives on population policies have developed, the most recent being the second international conference on population and development in Cairo in 2014. This paper argues that the right to self-determination, to health and to prior and informed consent, which includes the right to self-government and autonomy, must also include the indigenous right to reject government policies that subject <b>communities</b> to birth <b>control</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
