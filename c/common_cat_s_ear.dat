40|$|Expression of {{cathepsin}} (<b>cat)</b> <b>S,</b> a lysosomal cysteine protease, {{has recently}} been shown to cause an increase in production of amyloid beta-peptides in transfected human cells. In this study, we examined the presence and localization of <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> by immunocytochemistry in 21 control, 24 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 10 Down syndrome (DS) postmortem brains. An antiserum to a human <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> fusion protein was affinity purified and its specificity confirmed by abolition of immunoreactivity after adsorption with <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> but not <b>cat</b> L fusion protein. A small minority of control cases showed light, focal staining of scattered cortical neurons. Many control cases, {{as well as most}} AD and DS cases, showed prominent staining of vascular smooth muscle cells, particularly in leptomeningeal vessels. Both AD and DS brain tissue showed increased immunoreactivity in a subset of neocortical and hippocampal neurons and glia. <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> immunoreactivity occurred in a granular, cytoplasmic pattern in some neurons or in a more dense staining pattern in certain neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons. Cat S-positive neurons were also present in amygdala and basal forebrain in AD brains. A subset of astrocytes were immunoreactive with the <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> antibody in AD and DS but not in control brains. In rare AD cases, <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> immunostaining was observed in astrocytes in the periphery of amyloid-beta-containing plaques. These results suggest that <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> is up-regulated in AD and DS brain. The association of <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> immunoreactivity with tangle-bearing neurons, astrocytes, and rare senile plaques implies a role for altered <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> activity in the pathogenesis of AD...|$|R
40|$|Smooth {{muscle cell}} (SMC) {{migration}} from the tunica media to the intima, a key event in neointimal formation, requires proteolytic degradation of elastin-rich extracellular matrix barriers. Although cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S)</b> is overexpressed in atherosclerotic and neointimal lesions, its exact role in SMC behavior remains primarily unresolved. We examined {{the involvement of}} <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> on SMC migration through an extracellular matrix barrier and its localization in SMCs. A selective <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> inhibitor and the endogenous inhibitor cystatin C significantly attenuated SMC invasion across elastin gel. Western blotting and cell surface biotinylation analysis demonstrated localization of the 28 -kd active form of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> on the SMC surface, consistent with {{its role in the}} proteolysis of subcellular matrices. Treatment with interferon-γ or interleukin-β 1 significantly augmented the ability of SMC membranes to degrade elastin along with {{a significant increase in the}} level of active <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> compared with controls. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy showed a punctuated pattern of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> clusters at the periphery of SMCs; further studies demonstrated partial co-localization of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> and integrin ανβ 3 at the cell surfaces.

A difference in <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> level was found between tumour and adjacent control tissue cytosols of 60 lung cancer patients (median 4. 3 vs. 2. 8  ng mg− 1 protein). In lymph nodes obtained from 24 patients of the same group, the level of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> {{was significantly higher than}} in tumours or lung parenchyma (P< 0. 001). Additionally, significantly higher levels were found in non-infiltrated than in infiltrated lymph nodes (median 16. 6 vs 7. 5  ng mg− 1 protein). Patients with low levels of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> in tumours and lung parenchyma exhibited a significantly higher risk of death than those with high levels of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> (P= 0. 025 – tumours;P= 0. 02 – parenchyma).

40|$|Nitrated {{fatty acids}} (NFAs), {{endogenous}} products of nonenzymatic reactions of NO-derived reactive nitrogen species with unsaturated fatty acids, exhibit substantial anti-inflammatory activities. They are both reversible electrophiles and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists, but the physiological implications of their electrophilic activity are poorly understood. We tested {{their effects on}} inflammatory and emphysema-related biomarkers in alveolar macrophages (AMs) of smoke-exposed mice. NFA (10 -nitro-oleic acid or 12 -nitrolinoleic acid) treatment downregulated expression and activity of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB while upregulating those of PPARγ. It also downregulated production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and of the protease cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S),</b> a key mediator of emphysematous septal destruction. <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> downregulation was accompanied by decreased AM elastolytic activity, a major mechanism of septal destruction. NFAs downregulated both <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> expression and activity in AMs of wild-type mice, but only inhibited its activity in AMs of PPARγ knockout mice, pointing to a PPARγ-independent mechanism of enzyme inhibition. We hypothesized that this mechanism was electrophilic S-alkylation of target <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> cysteines, and found that NFAs bind directly to <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> following treatment of intact AMs and, as suggested by in silico modeling and calculation of relevant parameters, elicit S-alkylation of Cys 25 when incubated with purified <b>Cat</b> <b>S.</b> These results demonstrate that NFAs' electrophilic activity, {{in addition to their}} role as PPARγ agonists, underlies their protective effects in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and support their therapeutic potential in this disease...|$|R

40|$|By {{regulating}} invariant (Ii) chain {{processing and}} MHC class II peptide loading, the endosomal protease cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S)</b> has a potential role in autoimmune susceptibility. Indeed, <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> null mice {{are resistant to}} I-Ab-restricted experimental myasthenia gravis due to inadequate peptide presentation. To explore the role of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> in a Graves' disease model, I-Ad-restricted wild-type (WT) and Cat S–/– mice were immunized with adenovirus encoding the A subunit of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). TSHR adenovirus immunized mice develop Th 1 T cells, TSHR antibodies, and a proportion become overtly hyperthyroid. Although TSHR presentation in vitro was initially impaired in Cat S–/– mice, subsequent TSHR presentation in vitro and disease development were similar in both groups but with higher antibody responses in <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> null mice. WT and Cat S–/– mice recognized similar T cell epitopes from a panel of overlapping TSHR peptides. TSHR responses {{were found to be}} I-Ad-restricted and Cat S–/– I-Ad B cells had marked defects in Ii processing. These data imply that loading of TSHR peptides critical to TSHR antibody responses becomes Ii-independent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S)</b> is overexpressed {{in human}} {{atherosclerotic}} and aneurysmal tissues and may contributes to degradation of extracellular matrix, especially elastin, in inflammatory diseases. We aimed {{to define the}} role of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> in cardiac inflammation and fibrosis induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cat S-knockout (Cat S(-/-)) and littermate wild-type (WT) C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were infused continuously with Ang II (750 ng/kg/min) or saline for 7 days. Cat S(-/-) mice showed severe cardiac fibrosis, including elevated expression of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), as compared with WT mice. Moreover, macrophage infiltration and expression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor β and interleukin 1 β) were significantly greater in Cat S(-/-) than WT hearts. These Ang II-induced effects in Cat S(-/-) mouse hearts was associated with abnormal accumulation of autophagosomes and reduced clearance of damaged mitochondria, which led to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in macrophages. CONCLUSION: <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> in lysosomes is essential for mitophagy processing in macrophages, deficiency in <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> can increase damaged mitochondria and elevate ROS levels and NF-κB activity in hypertensive mice, so it regulates cardiac inflammation and fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|Human {{atherosclerotic}} lesions overexpress the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S),</b> one of {{the most}} potent mammalian elastases known. In contrast, atheromata have low levels of the endogenous <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> inhibitor cystatin C compared with normal arteries, suggesting involvement of this protease in atherogenesis. The present study tested this hypothesis directly by crossing Cat S–deficient (CatS–/–) mice with LDL receptor–deficient (LDLR–/–) mice that develop atherosclerosis on a high-cholesterol diet. Compared with LDLR–/– mice, double-knockout mice (CatS–/–LDLR–/–) developed significantly less atherosclerosis, as indicated by plaque size (plaque area and intimal thickening) and stage of development. These mice also had markedly reduced content of intimal macrophages, lipids, smooth muscle cells, collagen, CD 4 + T lymphocytes, and levels of IFN-γ. CatS–/–LDLR–/– monocytes showed impaired subendothelial basement membrane transmigration, and aortas from CatS–/–LDLR–/– mice had preserved elastic laminae. These findings establish a pivotal role for <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> in atherogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the presence and}} role of a recently cloned cysteine protease (cathepsin S) in the digestion of rod outer segments (ROS) by cultured retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Methods. RPE cell cultures were established from eye bank donor eyes. Total RNA was extracted from freshly harvested cultures, and after reverse transcription, the cDNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S)</b> mRNA translation was inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides, {{and the effect of}} inhibition on the accumulation of fluorescent debris was examined. The activity of cysteine and aspartic proteases in ROS-challenged RPE cell cultures was inhibited by leupeptin and pepstatin, respectively.

The presence of phagosomes in antisense DNA-inhibited and control cultures was demonstrated by electron microscopy. Results. The expression of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> in RPE cells was demonstrated by RNA-PCR.

40|$|This review {{describes}} {{mean and}} turbulent flow and mass transport {{in the presence}} of aquatic vegetation. Within emergent canopies, the turbulent length scales are set by the stem diameter and spacing, and the mean flow is determined by the distribution of the canopy frontal area. Near sparse submerged canopies, the bed roughness and near-bed turbulence are enhanced, but the velocity profile remains logarithmic. For dense submerged canopies, the drag discontinuity {{at the top of the}} canopy generates a shear layer, which contains canopy-scale vortices that control the exchange of mass and momentum between the canopy and the overflow. The canopy-scale vortices penetrate a finite distance into the canopy, δe, set by the canopy drag. This length scale segregates the canopy into two regions: The upper canopy experiences energetic turbulent transport, controlled by canopy-scale vortices, whereas the lower canopy experiences diminished transport, associated with the smaller stem-scale turbulence. The canopy-scale vortices induce a waving motion in flexible blades, called a monami.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{some recent}} trends in vegetation hydrodynamics, focusing on conditions within channels and spanning spatial scales from individual blades, to canopies or vegetation patches, to the channel reach. At the blade scale, the boundary layer formed {{on the plant}} surface {{plays a role in}} controlling nutrient uptake. Flow resistance and light availability are also influenced by the reconfiguration of flexible blades. At the canopy scale, there are two flow regimes. For sparse canopies, the flow resembles a rough boundary layer. For dense canopies, the flow resembles a mixing layer. At the reach scale, flow resistance is more closely connected to the patch-scale vegetation distribution, described by the blockage factor, than to the geometry of individual plants. The impact of vegetation distribution on sediment movement is discussed, with attention being paid to methods for estimating bed stress within regions of vegetation. The key research challenges of the hydrodynamics of vegetated channels are highlighted.
