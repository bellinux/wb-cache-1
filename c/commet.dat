We use random matrix theory and free probability to show that the distance between two independent random channels converges to a constant value as the dimension of the system grows larger.

In the case of a flat Hilbert-Schmidt distribution on quantum channels, we obtain that the distance converges to $\frac 12 + \frac{ 2 }{\pi}$, giving also an estimate for the maximum success probability for distinguishing the channels.

40|$|International audienceComparative {{metagenomics}} aims {{to provide}} high-level information based on DNA material sequenced from different environments. The purpose is mainly to estimate proximity between {{two or more}} environmental sites at the genomic level. One way to estimate similarity is to {{count the number of}} similar DNA fragments. From a computational point of view, the problem is thus to calculate the intersections between datasets of reads. Resorting to traditional methods such as all-versus-all sequence alignment is not possible on current metagenomic projects. For instance, the Tara Oceans project involves hundreds of datasets of more than 100 M reads each. Maillet et al. defined the following heuristic in their method called Commet[1]. Two reads are considered similar if they share t non-overlapping kmers (words of length k). This method is currently the fastest but still does not scale on Tara Oceans samples. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new similarity function between two datasets, called Simka, based on their amount of shared kmers. To scale on large metagenomic projects, we use a new technique which is able to count the kmers of N datasets simultaneously. This method also offers new possibilities such as filtering low frequency kmers which potentially contain sequencing errors. Simka was tested and compared to <b>Commet</b> on 21 Tara Oceans samples. This shows that our kmer-based similarity function is very close to the read-based one of <b>Commet.</b> Regarding sample proximity, both methods identify the same clusters of datasets. <b>Commet</b> required a few weeks to compute all the intersections whereas Simka took only 4 hours...|$|E

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper how the single-photon wave {{function}} for transversal photons (with the direct sum of ordinary unitary representations of helicity 1 and - 1 acting on it) is subsumed within the formalism of Gupta-Bleuler for the quantized free electromagnetic field in the Krein space (i. e. in the ordinary Hilbert space endowed with the Gupta-Bleuler operator η). Rigorous Gupta-Bleuler quantization of the free electromagnetic field {{is based on a}} generalization of ours (published formerly) of the Mackey theory of induced representations which includes representations preserving the indefinite Krein inner-product given by the Gupta-Bleuler operator and acting in the Krein space. The free electromagnetic field is constructed by application of the Segal's second quantization functor to the specific Krein-isometric representation. A closed subspace H_tr of the single-photon Krein space on which the indefinite Krein-inner-product is strictly positive is constructed such that the Krein-isometric single-photon representation generates modulo unphysical states precisely the action of a representation which preserves the positive inner product on H_tr induced by the Krein inner product, and is equal to the direct sum of ordinary unitary representations of helicity 1 and - 1 respectively. Two states of single photon Krein space are physically equivalent whenever differ by a state of Krein norm zero and whose projection on H_tr, {{in the sense of the}} Krein-inner-product, vanishes. In particulart it follows that the results of Białynicki-Birula on the single-photon wave function may be reconciled with the micro-local perturbative approach to QED initiated by Stückelberg and Bogoliubov.

40|$|Comfort is, in essence, {{satisfaction}} with the environment, and {{with respect to the}} indoor environment it is primarily {{satisfaction with}} the thermal conditions and air quality. Improving comfort has social, health and economic benefits, and is more financially significant than any other building cost. Despite this, comfort is not strictly managed throughout the building lifecycle. This is mainly {{due to the lack of}} an appropriate system to adequately manage comfort knowledge through the construction process into operation. Previous proposals to improve knowledge management have not been successfully adopted by the construction industry. To address this, the BabySteps approach was devised. BabySteps is an approach, proposed by this research, which states that for an innovation to be adopted into the industry it must be implementable through a number of small changes. This research proposes that improving the management of comfort knowledge will improve comfort. <b>ComMet</b> is a new methodology proposed by this research that manages comfort knowledge. It enables comfort knowledge to be captured, stored and accessed throughout the building life-cycle and so allowing it to be re-used in future stages of the building project and in future projects. It does this using the following: Comfort Performances – These are simplified numerical representations of the comfort of the indoor environment. Comfort Performances quantify the comfort at each stage of the building life-cycle using standard comfort metrics. Comfort Ratings - These are a means of classifying the comfort conditions of the indoor environment according to an appropriate standard. Comfort Ratings are generated by comparing different Comfort Performances. Comfort Ratings provide additional information relating to the comfort conditions of the indoor environment, which is not readily determined from the individual Comfort Performances. Comfort History – This is a continuous descriptive record of the comfort throughout the project, with a focus on documenting the items and activities, proposed and implemented, which could potentially affect comfort. Each aspect of the Comfort History is linked to the relevant comfort entity it references. These three components create a comprehensive record of the comfort throughout the building lifecycle. They are then stored and made available in a common format in a central location which allows them to be re-used ad infinitum. The LCMS System was developed to implement the <b>ComMet</b> methodology. It uses current and emerging technologies to capture, store and allow easy access to comfort knowledge as specified by <b>ComMet.</b> LCMS is an IT system that is a combination of the following six components: Building Standards; Modelling & Simulation; Physical Measurement through the specially developed Egg-Whisk (Wireless Sensor) Network; Data Manipulation; Information Recording; Knowledge Storage and Access. Results from a test case application of the LCMS system - an existing office room at a research facility - highlighted that while some aspects of comfort were being maintained, the building’s environment was not in compliance with the acceptable levels as stipulated by the relevant building standards.

The present investigation aimed at exploring the potential anticancer therapy of methylglyoxal loaded polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer with different terminal groups (PAMAM/MG). Uniform PAMAM-NH 2 /MG with an average particle size of 55 ± 5 nm and high encapsulation efficiencies (EE) of 82 ± 2 % have been characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and spectroscopic techniques. Compared to the free MG, a slow release of MG from dendrimer complex was  85 ± 2 % after 24 hours, suggesting the potential of dendrimer as a sustained drug delivery system. PAMAM-NH 2 /MG possesses biocompatibility with no hemolytic activity and highly effective in growth inhibition of mice carcinoma and sarcoma cells. PAMAM-NH 2 /MG selectively reduced cell viability of Hela cells with IC 50 value of 0. 4 ± 0. 15 μg/mL while more than 90 % normal fibroblast cells {{have been found to}} be viable at similar dose. Interestingly, even a lower dose of MG ( 250 times) in PAMAM-NH 2 /MG can effectively target Hela cells in comparison to free MG. TEM images demonstrated the ultra structural changes of Hela cells after treated with PAMAM-NH 2 /MG and also confirmed cellular uptake. DNA damage as measured by <b>commet</b> assay was found to be dose dependent for mice carcinoma and sarcoma cells but no such genotoxic response was observed in human lymphocytes, after treatment with PAMAM-NH 2 /MG. Thus, dendrimer encapsulated MG might be an effective strategy to target the cancer cells and further improvements of surface functionality of dendrimer can be used as a valuable tool for the development of novel therapeutics in nano-oncology. status: accepte...|$|E
