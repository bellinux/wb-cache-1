5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>theory</b> to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an {{extraneous}} cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E

25|$|Each {{behavioural}} change theory or model focuses on different factors {{in attempting to}} explain behaviour change. Of the many that exist, the most prevalent are learning theories, social <b>cognitive</b> <b>theory,</b> theories of reasoned action and planned behaviour, transtheoretical model of behavior change, the health action process approach and the BJ Fogg model of behavior change. Research has also been conducted regarding specific elements of these theories, especially elements like self-efficacy that are common to several of the theories.|$|E

25|$|Bandura's Social <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Theory</b> {{is another}} {{cognitive}} process theory that offers the important concept of self-efficacy for explaining employee's level of motivation relative to workplace tasks or goals. Self-efficacy is an individual's belief {{in his or}} her ability to achieve results in a given scenario. Empirically, studies have shown a strong correlation between self-efficacy and performance. The concept has been extended to group efficacy, which is a group's belief that it can achieve success with a given task or project.|$|E
25|$|Piaget {{proposed}} a developmental theory of moral reasoning {{in which children}} progress from a naïve understanding of morality based on behavior and outcomes to a more advanced understanding based on intentions. Piaget's views of moral development were elaborated by Kohlberg into a stage theory of moral development. There {{is evidence that the}} moral reasoning described in stage theories is not sufficient to account for moral behavior. For example, other factors such as modeling (as described by the social <b>cognitive</b> <b>theory</b> of morality) are required to explain bullying.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the social}} {{learning}} theory (more recently expanded as social <b>cognitive</b> <b>theory),</b> behavioural change is determined by environmental, personal, and behavioural elements. Each factor affects each of the others. For example, in congruence {{with the principles of}} self-efficacy, an individual's thoughts affect their behaviour and an individual's characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment. Likewise, an individual's environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the person's behavior, and an individual's behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels. Social learning theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{neuroscience}} is {{the branch}} of neuroscience that studies the neural mechanisms underpinning cognition and develops theories explaining them. Within cognitive neuroscience, computational neuroscience focuses on modeling behavior, using theories expressed as computer programs. Up to now, computational theories have been formulated by neuroscientists. In this paper, we present {{a new approach to}} theory development in neuroscience: the automatic generation and testing of <b>cognitive</b> <b>theories</b> using genetic programming. Our approach evolves from experimental data <b>cognitive</b> <b>theories</b> that explain “the mental program” that subjects use to solve a specific task. As an example, we have focused on a typical neuroscience experiment, the delayed-match-to-sample (DMTS) task. The main goal of our approach is to develop a tool that neuroscientists can use to develop better <b>cognitive</b> <b>theories...</b>|$|R
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy has}} been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression. The American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of major depressive disorder. One etiological theory of depression is Aaron T. Beck's <b>cognitive</b> <b>theory</b> of depression. His theory states that depressed people think {{the way they do}} because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative schema of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.|$|E
25|$|MILESTONES program {{objective}} is to facilitate a transformation in the juvenile offender’s behavior from delinquent and addictive to pro-social and healthy. The program staff and treatment team develop individual and community strategies to help eliminate and/or manage undesirable behaviors and reinforce those that are socially acceptable with positive outcomes. The JCC–L program model incorporates mentoring, cognitive restructuring, social learning, and cause and effect reinforcement. JCC-L recognizes that most juvenile offenders, including those who are lower functioning, still possess a level of reasoning, response, {{and the ability to}} identify simple patterns. These juvenile offenders also possess the necessary tools to facilitate self-change. Consistent with <b>cognitive</b> <b>theory,</b> the expressed thoughts and beliefs of the juvenile offenders are tracked over time to establish patterns of thinking. Cognitive interventions target both beliefs and thoughts, identify those with positive and negative ultimate outcomes, and subsequently facilitate a change in behavior. In addition to providing alternative coping skills and competencies, the Milestone program also reduces risk levels. Any idea, belief, or circumstance which causes a juvenile to gravitate to inappropriate/illegal behavior is a risk factor.|$|E
25|$|Psychoanalysis, a psychotherapeutic {{approach}} to behavior change developed by Sigmund Freud and modified by his followers, has also offered {{an explanation of}} substance abuse. This orientation suggests {{the main cause of}} the addiction syndrome is the unconscious need to entertain and to enact various kinds of homosexual and perverse fantasies, {{and at the same time}} to avoid taking responsibility for this. It is hypothesised specific drugs facilitate specific fantasies and using drugs is considered to be a displacement from, and a concomitant of, the compulsion to masturbate while entertaining homosexual and perverse fantasies. The addiction syndrome is also hypothesised to be associated with life trajectories that have occurred within the context of traumatogenic processes, the phases of which include social, cultural and political factors, encapsulation, traumatophilia, and masturbation as a form of self-soothing. Such an approach lies in stark contrast to the approaches of social <b>cognitive</b> <b>theory</b> to addiction—and indeed, to behavior in general—which holds human beings regulate and control their own environmental and cognitive environments, and are not merely driven by internal, driving impulses. Additionally, homosexual content is not implicated as a necessary feature in addiction.|$|E

40|$|Objective Synthesizing {{research}} on social <b>cognitive</b> <b>theories</b> applied to health behavior {{is an important}} step in the development of an evidence base of psychological factors as targets for effective behavioral interventions. However, few meta-analyses of {{research on}} social <b>cognitive</b> <b>theories</b> in health contexts have conducted simultaneous tests of theoretically-stipulated pattern effects using path analysis. We argue that conducting path analyses of meta-analytic effects among constructs from social <b>cognitive</b> <b>theories</b> is important to test nomological validity, account for mediation effects, and evaluate unique effects of theory constructs independent of past behavior. We illustrate our points by conducting new analyses of two meta-analyses of a popular theory applied to health behaviors, the theory of planned behavior. Method We conducted meta-analytic path analyses of the theory in two behavioral contexts (alcohol and dietary behaviors) using data from the primary studies included in the original meta-analyses augmented to include intercorrelations among constructs and relations with past behavior missing from the original analysis. Results Findings supported the nomological validity of the theory and its hypotheses for both behaviors, confirmed important model processes through mediation analysis, demonstrated the attenuating effect of past behavior on theory relations, and provided estimates of the unique effects of theory constructs independent of past behavior. Conclusions Our analysis illustrates the importance of conducting a simultaneous test of theory-stipulated effects in meta-analyses of social <b>cognitive</b> <b>theories</b> applied to health behavior. We recommend researchers adopt this analytic procedure when synthesizing evidence across primary tests of social <b>cognitive</b> <b>theories</b> in health...|$|R
