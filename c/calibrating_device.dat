The computer intelligent wavelength-calibrating program used in this sequential ICP-IWC spectrometer is discussed. The analytical results of eight elemental components of a basic slag standard after spectral interference correction using this instrument are in good agreement with the certified values and those by the line-profile method. The system does not require 8 - 10 h pre-heating as needed with a local thermostat or profiles for every analytical line as in the line-profile method, which indicates that the sequential ICP-IWC spectrometer can avoid and correct the spectral interferences effectively by choosing the analytical lines properly and finding the peaks of the analytical lines precisely. The flexibility of choosing spectral lines is a common merit of all kinds of modern sequential ICPs, but the high accuracy of finding out the peaks of spectral lines without the need of a local thermostat or the line-profile method is the unique merit of the sequential ICP-IWC. It has been proven possible to use the intelligent wavelength <b>calibrating</b> <b>device</b> in the sequential ICP spectrometer instead of a traditional local thermostat or the line-profile method.

The diffusion of RGB-D sensors seems to provide an effective solution to such a problem. Nevertheless, the interaction with stereoscopic 3 D environments, in particular in peripersonal space, requires a higher degree of precision. To this end, a reliable calibration of such sensors and an accurate estimation of the relative pose of different RGB-D and visualization devices are crucial.

Two following stages equipped with low-noise transistors provide a high overall gain (800 × for extracellular and 35 × for intracellular recordings), sufficient for driving any low-gain C-R oscilloscope without additional amplification.

The use of pulsed, artificial light sources is spread worldwide but these solar simulators have the disadvantage of producing light beams with a spectral content rather different from the Air Mass 1. 5 global (AM 1. 5 g) standard spectrum, thus requiring a careful correction of the spectral mismatch between actual and standard spectral conditions.
