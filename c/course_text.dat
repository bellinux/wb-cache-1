Recognizing that startups are not simply smaller versions of large companies, he observed that entrepreneurs {{need to have a}} systemized approach to guide their search for “repeatable and scalable business models.” The revelation led to his first book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, which served as the <b>course</b> <b>text</b> for his first class and heralded the birth of Customer Development, which in turn spawned the Lean Startup movement.

Sweeny, an art {{educator}} at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, questioned surveillance {{technologies and}} the role that visual arts plays with those technologies. He then {{raised the question of}} how one would handle acknowledging surveillance technologies in the classroom. He is a firm believer that [...] "Those involved with the visual arts might learn much from studies regarding current surveillance technologies, going beyond the boundaries of traditional research methodologies, informing practices that interrogate the dynamics of power and vision in art educational settings." [...] While teaching at The Pennsylvania State University, Sweeny used one project in particular to encourage his students to reveal [...] "the power of the gaze" [...] by exploring how surveillance brings about other ways of [...] "seeing:"These students chose the museum as a space that is based in looking and the ‘male gaze’, influenced by our readings of the <b>course</b> <b>text,</b> Ways of Seeing (Berger, 1972). Doubling the gaze of the surveillance camera through hand held video, then recording the individual recording the camera, they created a layered experience that lead to confusion. Through a tight editing process, they constantly reminded the viewer of the position of the camera operator (and the apparent laxness of the security guard) through the rapidly shifting camera shots. The images begin to break up as filmed image was filmed, layered with music that approached noise, only to return to a calm denouement, backing out of the doors that introduced the walking protagonist into a panoptic hall of mirrors.|$|E

This paper presents a framework for adaptive link structures. By enabling links when a student is ready to read the pages these links lead to, and disabling links to pages that are no longer needed the student can rest assured that links always lead to interesting new information she is ready to read. This framework is illustrated by means of courseware for an on-line course on "Hypermedia structures and systems", developed at the Eindhoven University of Technology, and currently offered at six different universities in the Netherlands and Belgium. 1.
