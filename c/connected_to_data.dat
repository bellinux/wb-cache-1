40|$|The {{development}} of living standards in Java {{has long been}} a subject of scholarly interest. A number of scholars have suggested that between 1600 and 1900 Southeast Asian living standards declined significantly. The present article contributes to these issues by calculating long-term real wages for Java between 1680 and 1914, following Allen's subsistence basket methodology. New data on wages and prices were collected from the Dutch East India Company (VOC) archives and <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>data</b> on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

40|$|By {{integrating}} {{an ensemble}} of ocean states forward in time from {{a set of}} perturbed initial conditions one can examine the predictability of a dynamical system. The initial perturbations should of course represent the error statistics of the best estimate of initial conditions. Introducing {{the fact that the}} ocean models are not perfect, one should also include model errors, thus the members of the ensemble of ocean states should be integrated forward in time using stochastic differential equations. An application of predicted error statistics is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>data</b> assimilation. Advanced sequential data assimilation methods have traditionally been based on the Kalman filter or extensions of if for nonlinear models. However, it has been shown that, for realistic applications, the extended Kalman filter is subject to closure problems and the numerical load becomes overwhelming.
