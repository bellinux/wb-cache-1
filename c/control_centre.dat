5|$|The {{station was}} granted the Freedom of the London Borough of Hillingdon on 19 March 1960, an honour {{allowing}} the station's personnel to march throughout the borough in uniform. On 1 November that year, the Queen's Colour Squadron of the RAF Regiment moved to Uxbridge and the Southern Region Air Traffic Services headquarters moved into Hillingdon House. After the war, {{the station was}} already home to the London Area <b>Control</b> <b>Centre,</b> renamed the London Air Traffic <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> in 1948 and the Uxbridge Air Traffic <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> in 1957. This eventually transferred to RAF West Drayton but remained under the parentage of RAF Uxbridge.|$|E

5|$|No. 11 Group was {{relocated}} to RAF Martlesham Heath in 1958, when control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to RAF Technical Training Command {{and the entire}} site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November. Southern Region Air Traffic Services HQ and the Royal Observer Corps' South East Communications Centre moved into the house in 1960. On 1 November, the Southern Region Air Traffic Services headquarters moved into Hillingdon House. The station had been home {{since the end of}} the war to the London Area <b>Control</b> <b>Centre,</b> renamed the London Air Traffic <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> in 1948 and the Uxbridge Air Traffic <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> in 1957. This eventually transferred to RAF West Drayton, which operated as a satellite station of RAF Uxbridge. HQ Military Air Traffic Operations (HQ MATO) moved into Hillingdon House in January 1965.|$|E

40|$|Detecting {{medication}} errors needs {{collaboration between}} various organizations, such as patient safety institutions, pharmacovigilance <b>centres,</b> and poison <b>control</b> <b>centres.</b> In order {{to evaluate the}} input of pharmacovigilance <b>centres</b> and poison <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> in detecting and evaluating medication errors a pilot project was initiated by the World Alliance for Patient Safety {{in collaboration with the}} Uppsala Monitoring Centre; the Moroccan pharmacovigilance centre acted as project coordinator. As part of this project, a questionnaire on detecting medication errors was circulated to pharmacovigilance <b>centres</b> and poison <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> around the world, in order to assess their ability to detect and analyse medication errors. The results showed that through their databases pharmacovigilance centres can detect, identify, analyse, and classify medication errors and carry out root cause analysis, which is an important tool in preventing medication errors. The duties of pharmacovigilance centres in preventing medication errors include informing health-care professionals about the importance of reporting such errors and creating a culture of patient safety. Pharmacovigilance centres aim to prevent medication errors in collaboration with poison <b>control</b> <b>centres.</b> Such collaboration allows improved detection and improved preventive strategies. In addition, collaboration with regulatory authorities is important in finalizing decisions. Collaboration between pharmacovigilance <b>centres</b> and poison <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> should be strengthened and bridges need to be built linking pharmacovigilance <b>centres,</b> poison <b>control</b> <b>centres,</b> and organizations dedicated to patient safety, in order to avoid duplication of workload...|$|R

5|$|Portishead has a {{long history}} as a fishing port. As a Royal Manor it {{expanded}} rapidly during the early 19thcentury around the docks, with supporting transport infrastructure. A power station and chemical works were added in the 20th century, but the dock and industrial facilities have since closed and been redeveloped into a marina and residential areas. Portishead was also the telephone <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> used by British Telecom (BT) for non-direct dialled calls to maritime vessels, a service known as Portishead Radio.|$|E

5|$|Early {{freight traffic}} {{consisted}} of agricultural products, including carrots, celery, clover, peas, potatoes, sugar beet and swedes, together with {{large volumes of}} peat from Swinefleet Works near Reedness Junction and from Hatfield Works on the Hatfield Moor Branch. Traffic into the area included manure. In the 1920s, stations notified the <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> at Goole {{of the number of}} wagons they would need for consignments of peas and potatoes, and could also request additional trains. 4,000 tons of green peas were despatched during the 1926 growing season, and in the following year, 7,000 bundles of celery left Epworth station in a three-day period. Traffic started to decline in the 1930s, as motor lorries began {{to take some of the}} trade. By 1937, there were only three workings each day, and those were run if required. The peat works at Hatfield was still supplying an average of six wagon-loads per day.|$|E

5|$|Natalya accompanies Bond to the Caribbean. Surveying the Cuban jungle aerially, {{their light}} {{aircraft}} is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground {{search of the}} area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. He then follows the fleeing Trevelyan {{through a series of}} flooded caverns, eventually arriving at the antenna of the control centre's radio telescope. Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the GoldenEye, but Bond ultimately destroys machinery vital to controlling the antenna and defeats Trevelyan in a gunfight on a platform above the dish.|$|E
