Despite the new technologies and process, the use of magnesia <b>carbon</b> <b>refractory</b> remains constant. Namely the magnesia <b>carbon</b> <b>refractory</b> is widely used due low-priced cost, high refractivity, excellent corrosion resistance, thermal shock resistance, low thermal expansion, high slag penetration resistance and low wettability. The main disadvantages of use magnesia carbon refractories are the high carbon oxidation susceptibility and the formation CO and CO 2 gases. As a result, tonne of CO and CO 2 are expelled to the atmosphere.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a new homogenization-based {{finite element}} model to compute masonry {{structures}} with compressible joints is proposed. It {{is an extension of}} the model proposed by De Felice et al. (Int. J. Numer. Anal. Meth. Geomech. 2010; 34 (3) : 221 - 247) for dry block structures where strain hardening was neglected. The proposed strain hardening incremental elasto-plastic model is obtained by means of a new step-by-step homogenization method for a running bond masonry structure made of elastic bricks jointed by an elasto-plastic ram. The numerical implicit integration of the model is carried out following an iterative implicit procedure in which the elastic trial stress state is corrected through a return mapping algorithm. The procedure has been implemented in the ABAQUS finite element software and applied to the computation of thermal stresses for the hearths made of small <b>carbon</b> <b>refractory</b> bricks surrounded by very compressible joints.

40|$|The {{by-products}} of coke dissolution in iron {{are primarily}} calcium aluminate minerals known as coke ash. These minerals are unreactive with the iron bath and can therefore deposit onto the blast furnace hearth refractories when they form below the iron-slag interface. This study {{was focused on}} understanding the interactions between these coke ash minerals and blast furnace hearth refractories. Improved understanding of these interactions may have implications for the campaign life of the blast furnace hearth refractory materials. It {{was found that the}} aluminosilicate refractory followed the linear rate law and the alumina <b>carbon</b> <b>refractory</b> corresponded to the logarithmic rate law. Thermodynamic modelling was conducted and compared with the spot analysis results and micrographs to determine the phases likely to have formed. It was found that the formation of gehlenite (Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7) and anorthite (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8) were more likely in the reactions with the aluminosilicate refractory due to the higher silicon content in the refractory. This corresponds with the observation of this refractory following the linear rate law which is typical of a material which forms a non-protective reaction layer with high porosity or forms liquid phase reaction products. The rates of reaction were found to follow an Arrhenius relationship, demonstrating temperature dependence for the reactions between both hearth refractories and the calcium aluminates. The reaction rate was also observed to increase with the calcium content as predicted by Fick’s 1 st law of Diffusion. The Kirkendall effect was demonstrated via an inert wire test indicating net mass transport of material into the refractory materials from the calcium aluminates. This suggests that the active species responsible for most the reactions observed was the calcium ion. Detailed analysis using thermodynamic data was carried out to determine the possible reactions between the calcium aluminates and the refractory minerals. The formation of low liquidus temperature phases (anorthite and gehlenite) and the possible formation of liquid oxide phase were determined to increase the rate of refractory wear and limit the ability of the refractories to form a protective reaction layer. The formation of grossite (CaAl 4 O 7) and hibonite (CaAl 2 O 19) was found to make the refractory more susceptible to structural and thermal spalling due to the increased stress in the reaction layer cause by the volume change and variation in thermal expansion coefficients of the reaction products...|$|E

Observations of black carbon (BC) particles (by-products of fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning) in the atmosphere, ice, rivers, soils and marine sediments suggest that this material is ubiquitous, yet the contribution of BC to the ocean s DOM pool remains unknown. Analysis of high-molecular-weight DOM isolated from surface waters of two estuaries in the northwest Atlantic Ocean finds that BC is a significant component of DOM, suggesting that river-estuary systems are important exporters of BC to the ocean through DOM. We show that BC comprises 4 - 7 % of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at coastal ocean sites, which supports the hypothesis that the DOC pool is the intermediate reservoir in which BC ages prior to sedimentary deposition. Flux calculations suggest that BC could be as important as vascular plant-derived lignin in terms of carbon inputs to the ocean.

40|$|The Earth {{and other}} rocky {{bodies in the}} inner solar system contain {{significantly}} less carbon than the primordial materials that seeded their formation. These carbon-poor objects include the parent bodies of primitive meteorites, suggesting that at least one process responsible for solid-phase carbon depletion was active prior to the early stages of planet formation. Potential mechanisms include the erosion of carbonaceous materials by photons or atomic oxygen in the surface layers of the protoplanetary disk. Under photochemically generated favorable conditions, these reactions can deplete the near-surface abundance of carbon grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by several orders of magnitude on short timescales relative to the lifetime of the disk out to radii of ~ 20 - 100 + au from the central star depending on the form of <b>refractory</b> <b>carbon</b> present. Due to the reliance of destruction mechanisms on a high influx of photons, the extent of <b>refractory</b> <b>carbon</b> depletion is quite sensitive to the disk's internal radiation field. Dust transport within the disk is required to affect the composition of the midplane.

The recalcitrant nature of seagrass tissues, or the resistance to degradation back into carbon dioxide, is one aspect thought to influence sediment carbon stocks. In this study, a global survey investigated how the macromolecular chemistry of seagrass leaves, sheaths/stems, rhizomes and roots varied across 23 species from 16 countries. The goal was to understand how this seagrass chemistry might influence the capacity of seagrasses to contribute to sediment carbon stocks. Three non-destructive analytical chemical analyses were used to investigate seagrass chemistry: thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and solid state 13 C-NMR and infrared spectroscopy. A strong latitudinal influence on carbon quality was found, whereby temperate seagrasses contained 5 % relatively more labile carbon, and tropical seagrasses contained 3 % relatively more <b>refractory</b> <b>carbon.</b> Sheath/stem tissues significantly varied across taxa, with larger morphologies typically containing more <b>refractory</b> <b>carbon</b> than smaller morphologies. Rhizomes were characterized by a higher proportion of labile carbon (16 % of total organic matter compared to 8 – 10 % in other tissues); however, high rhizome biomass production and slower remineralization in anoxic sediments will likely enhance these below-ground tissues' contributions to long-term carbon stocks.

An increasingly common solution to protect coastal areas lying below sea level is intentional flooding by "managed coastal realignment".

We conducted a 1 -year mesocosm experiment to investigate microbial carbon degradation processes in soils flooded with seawater. Agricultural soils were sampled on the northern coast of the island Fyn (Denmark) at Gyldensteen Strand, an area that was subsequently flooded in a coastal realignment project. We found rapid carbon degradation to TCO 2 1  day after experimental flooding and onwards and microbial sulfate reduction established quickly as an important mineralization pathway.

40|$|Deconvolving the {{relationship}} between meteorological and oceanographic phenomena and associated impacts to coastal systems is critical to understanding the future of coastal systems worldwide. North Carolina's barrier islands, {{commonly known as the}} Outer Banks, and the associated Albemarle-Pamlico estuarine system {{is an example of a}} coastal ecosystem that will be affected in the future by such phenomena. Based on sedimentological and micropaleontological proxies, past research suggests that intense storm activity may have caused extensive segmentation of the Outer Banks during the Holocene. To gain a better understanding of meteorological and oceanographic factors affecting the evolution of North Carolina's coastal system, organic geochemical techniques were applied to sediments from two cores collected within Pamlico Sound. Specifically, down-core trends in total organic <b>carbon</b> (TOC), <b>refractory</b> black <b>carbon</b> (BC), <b>refractory</b> soot <b>carbon,</b> labile organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), and their stable isotopic signatures ([delta]¹³C and [delta]¹⁵N) were analyzed in order to assess the varying inputs of marine and terrestrial organic matter into Pamlico Sound. In Chapter 1, TOC, BC/TOC, soot/TOC, TOC/TN, and [delta]¹³C[subscript]TOC were compared to a paleoclimatological proxy of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and interpretations of stages of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) throughout the mid-to-late Holocene. These phenomena have been suggested to influence southeast U. S. temperature, precipitation, and Atlantic hurricanes, all of which ultimately affect barrier island and estuarine evolution, as recorded in Pamlico Sound sediments. In general, there has been little consideration of carbon sequestered in coastal systems throughout the Holocene, a period that shows anthropogenic changes in the carbon cycle. This is an important omission, as most of the sediments exported by the world's major rivers are currently deposited on continental shelves (e. g., deltas and estuaries). Chapter 2 examines how the degree of barrier island segmentation affects abundance and source of carbon sequestered in Pamlico Sound throughout the mid-to-late Holocene. Total organic carbon sequestered in Pamlico Sound was calculated over the past 3500 years. Since the ultimate fate of TOC depends on its composition (e. g., whether it is labile or refractory), both OC and BC in sediments were quantified down-core. Results show that greater continuity of a barrier island chain significantly increased the amount of carbon sequestered in sediments. To our knowledge, this chapter provides the first quantitative estimate of the amount of carbon sequestered as a function of its composition since the mid-Holocene in any coastal system. The results of both chapters suggest that ENSO, NAO, eastern North Carolina temperature and precipitation, Atlantic storm activity, Outer Banks barrier island evolution, and coastal carbon sequestration were linked throughout the mid-to-late Holocene.

The bacteria and their phages, being the most abundant constituents of the aquatic environment, represent an ideal model for studing carbon regulation in the aquatic system. The <b>refractory</b> dissolved organic <b>carbon</b> (DOC), a recently coined terminology from the microbe-driven conversion of bioavailable organic <b>carbon</b> into difficult-to-digest <b>refractory</b> DOC by microbial carbon pump (MCP), is suggested to {{have the potential to}} revolutionize our view of carbon sequestration. It is estimated that about 95 % of organic carbon {{is in the form of}} refractory DOC, which is the largest pool of organic matter in the ocean. The refractory DOC is supposed to be the major factor in the global carbon cycle whose source is not yet well understood. A key element of the carbon cycle is the microbial conversion of dissolved organic carbon into inedible forms. The time studies of phage-host interaction under control conditions reveal their impact on the total carbon content of the source and their interconversion among organic, inorganic and other forms of carbon with respect to control source. The TOC- analysis statistics stipulate an increase in inorganic carbon content by 15 - 25 percent in the sample with phage as compared to the sample without phage. The results signify a 60 - 70 fold increase in inorganic carbon content in sample with phage, whereas, 50 - 55 fold in the case of sample without phages as compared with control. This increase in inorganic carbon content may be due to lysis of the host cell releasing its cellular constituents and utilization of carbon constituent for phage assembly and development. It also proves the role of phages in regulating the carbon flow in aquatic systems like oceans, where their concentration outnumbered other species...|$|R

Apesar disso, investir no desenvolvimento desses materiais continua a ser necessário, sobretudo devido à crescente pressão para que o setor siderúrgico torne seus processos mais seguros e sustentáveis, objetivos esses que dependem diretamente do desempenho dos refratários utilizados ao longo da cadeia produtiva do ferro e do aço. Assim, com o intuito de indicar oportunidades de desenvolvimento ainda não exploradas, bem como de examinar as linhas de pesquisa que têm obtido êxito em aumentar a eficiência dos refratários contendo carbono, este trabalho faz uma ampla revisão dos possíveis constituintes destes materiais, tais como ligantes, fontes de carbono e aditivos diversos. Das inovações recentemente divulgadas, analisa-se o uso de adições combinadas de agentes antioxidantes e TiO 2 para promover o desenvolvimento de fases com morfologias especiais (como whiskers), e a descoberta de aditivos que possibilitam a grafitização do carbono produzido pelas resinas termofixas. Este último avanço é particularmente significativo, pois proporciona às resinas uma capacidade antes exclusiva do piche de alcatrão, ligante que vem sendo evitado pelas condições insalubres que causa tanto no ambiente da indústria siderúrgica como refratarista. Já entre as possibilidades de inovação cogitadas, destaca-se a adição de agentes de acoplagem aos refratários resinados com o objetivo de otimizar, sobretudo, a sua processabilidade. Tal avanço seria especialmente desejável para os concretos refratários resinados, materiais que atualmente possuem aplicações limitadas, mas que atraem grande interesse por suas diversas vantagens em relação aos produtos pré-conformados, o que os leva a ser um importante foco para novos desenvolvimentos. Due {{to their}} {{unique set of}} properties and characteristics, <b>carbon</b> containing <b>refractories</b> have been a key issue in order that the steelmaking industry could attain its current productivity levels. However, further development of these materials is still necessary, especially due to the increasing pressure on the steelmaking sector to make its processes safer and more sustainable, goals which directly depend {{on the performance of}} the refractories used for the iron and steel production chain. Thus, in order to identify opportunities not yet explored, as well as to examine the research lines that have been successful in increasing the <b>carbon</b> containing <b>refractory</b> performance, this paper presents an extensive review regarding likely components of these materials, such as binders, carbon sources and additives. Based on the innovations recently disclosed, it is pointed out the use of combined additions of antioxidants agents and TiO 2 to promote the development of phases with special morphologies (such as whiskers), and novel additives that enable the graphitization of the carbon from the thermosetting resins. This latter advance is particularly significant, because it provides to the resins a capacity before exclusive of the coal tar pitch, binder which has been avoided due to the unhealthy conditions that it brings to the steelmaking industry workplaces, {{as well as to the}} refractories industry. Among the possibilities of innovation pointed out, it is highlighted the addition of coupling agents to the resin bonded refractories in order to optimize its processability. Such improvement would be particularly important for resin bonded castables, materials that currently have limited applications, but are attracting great interest due to their many advantages over preformed products, which make them an important target for new developments...|$|R
40|$|In high {{temperature}} {{processes in the}} basic industry, e. g. steel mining, refractories are applied. To achieve a sufficient thermal shock resistance <b>carbon</b> containing <b>refractories</b> are used in steel mining, {{despite the fact that}} the utilization of carbon leads to higher heat losses and carbon pickup. To reduce the heat loss, to govern the carbon pickup and to enable innovative process routines for the clean steel technology novel carbon-reduced and carbon-free refractories are being developed. To assess the application potential and to support the ongoing improvement of selected carbon-reduced and carbon-free refractories the thermal shock performance is investigated focusing on the understanding of the microstructural mechanisms of crack propagation. The thermomechanical investigations concentrate on controlled crack propagation experiments and thermal shock tests. Controlled isothermal crack propagation experiments with macroscopic and microscopic observation are based on wedge splitting and compact tension test. To determine the resistance against crack propagation as an estimation of the potential thermal shock damage analytical relations have been applied. The thermal shock experiments focused on upard mode thermal shocks via electron beam tests facilities. Due to the very fast (ms) upward mode thermal shock in vacuum in contrast to conventional thermal shocks in air or water effects related to chemical interactions can be excluded. Due to a dependency on the sample size only carbon-free, alumina-based refractories were investigated. The influence due to the addition of zirconia and titania is shown. Thermal shock experiments with electron beam were mainly performed on carbon-containing refractories, since carbon-free refractories tended to electrical charging. For the investigated carbon-containing refractories the thermal shock damage is shown in dependence of different parameters (duration, number) ...|$|R

40|$|Carbon-containing {{refractory}} materials have received great attention {{over the last}} years due to their importance in the steelmaking process. The oxidation of <b>carbon</b> present in <b>refractory</b> materials at temperatures above 500 degrees C is usually accompanied by the decrease of their mechanical strength and chemical resistance. Aiming to improve the oxidation resistance of carbon-oxide refractories, the use of materials known as antioxidants has been extensively studied. In this work we evaluated the performance of MgB 2 and B 4 C antioxidants when incorporated into MgO-C bricks. We observed that the co-addition of metallic antioxidants and B 4 C or MgB 2 leads to refractory bricks with enhanced hot modulus of rupture and resistance against oxidation and slag corrosion. However, the excessive addition of these antioxidants could impair the performance of the obtained bricks. Thus, when determining the optimum concentration of MgB 2 and B 4 C to be added into MgO-C refractories, one must take into consideration this behavior.

40|$|To {{overcome}} {{the difficulty of}} incorporation of hydrophobic <b>carbon</b> materials into <b>refractory</b> castables, TiC and SiC coatings with much better water-wettability were prepared on carbon particles from metallic powders (Ti or Si) by using a novel low temperature molten salt synthesis technique. The preparation conditions were optimized by varying processing parameters including synthesis temperature, holding time, salt assembly and metal/carbon molar ratios. Homogeneous TiC coatings were prepared on carbon black (CB) particles by firing them with Ti powders in KCl or KCl-LiCl at 750 - 850 C for 4 hours. Alternatively, TiC coatings could be prepared {{at a lower cost}} by firing the mixture of TiO 2 and Ti (in molar ratio of 1 / 3) with CB in KCl at 950 C for 4 hours. High quality SiC coatings were prepared on CB spheres after firing them with Si powders in a binary NaCl-NaF salt for 6 hours at as low as 1100 C. NaF was proven to be essential in the molten salt synthesis of SiC and its optimal amount was 2. 5 - 5 wt...|$|R
