5000|$|Illite {{crystallinity}} is {{a technique}} used to classify low-grade metamorphic activity in pelitic rocks. Determining the [...] "illite crystallinity index" [...] allows geologists to designate what metamorphic facies and metamorphic zone the rock was formed in and to infer what temperature the rock was formed. Several crystallinity indices have been proposed in recent years, but currently the Kübler index is being used due to its reproducibility and simplicity. The Kübler index is experimentally determined by measuring the full width at half maximum for the X-ray diffraction reflection peak along the (001) <b>crystallographic</b> <b>axis</b> of the rock sample. This value is an indirect measurement of the thickness of illite/muscovite packets which denote a change in metamorphic grade.

In the original Weiss theory the mean field was proportional to the bulk magnetization M, so that ...|$|E
50|$|The Ge-detector {{determines the}} pulse-shape of the γ-ray which {{contains}} {{the information about}} the three-dimensional position of each individual interaction within the detector with the released energy in the interactions. The efficiency of the tracking array depends on these data. We must be able to compare the pulse-shapes to the respective shapes produced by charges each point to extract the position of the interaction. This is done experimentally using tightly collimated γ-ray sources with an external collimated detector for the Compton scattered coincidence. The conductivity of the Ge-detector influences the magnitude of the drift velocities and the angle between the electric field vector and the drift velocity. As a result the shape of the signal is directly influence because the Ge crystal is anisotropic with respect to the <b>crystallographic</b> <b>axis</b> direction. To determine the position of the interaction of the γ-ray one needs to consider the shapes of the induced real and mirror signals. The electrodes of the segment in which an interaction takes place are used to measure the real signals while mirror signals are measured on the neighboring segments where no interaction takes place.|$|E
