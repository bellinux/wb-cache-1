5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative <b>cladistic</b> techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply <b>cladistic</b> methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E
5|$|Grimaldi and Engel, {{reviewing}} the phylogeny in 2005, commented that many <b>cladistic</b> studies {{had been made}} with no stability in Ephemeroptera suborders and infraorders; the traditional division into Schistonota and Pannota was wrong because Pannota {{is derived from the}} Schistonota.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists today {{agree on}} the overall {{structure}} of the ceratopsian family tree, although there are differences on individual taxa. There have been several <b>cladistic</b> studies performed on basal ceratopsians since 2000. None have used every taxon listed above {{and many of the}} differences between the studies are still unresolved.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing <b>cladistic</b> analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi in a clade corresponding closely with B.ser. Tetragonae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cladistic</b> {{analysis}} done by Selles and Galobart in 2015 recovered Cairanoolithus as {{a sister}} taxon to the clade of ornithopod eggs Guegoolithus, Spheroolithus, and Ovaloolithus. Therefore, they considered {{it likely that}} Cairanoolithus belongs to a non-ornithopod ornithischian dinosaur.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cladistic</b> method (or cladism) {{has emerged}} since the 1960s. In 1958, Julian Huxley {{used the term}} clade. Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison {{introduced}} the term <b>cladistic.</b> The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical evolutionary tree, ignoring ranks. A taxon is called monophyletic, if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form. Groups that have descendant groups removed from them (e.g. dinosaurs, with birds as offspring group) are termed paraphyletic, while groups representing more than one branch from {{the tree of life}} are called polyphyletic. The International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature or PhyloCode is intended to regulate the formal naming of clades. Linnaean ranks will be optional under the PhyloCode, which is intended to coexist with the current, rank-based codes.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>cladistic</b> {{analysis}} {{to encompass the}} interrelationships of Hadrosauridae was conducted by Weishampel and Horner (1990). They found Saurolophinae synonymous with Hadrosaurinae, but only separated the subfamily into two groups. The first group included Gryposaurus, Aralosaurus, Maiasaura, and Brachylophosaurus. The other contained Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus, Prosaurolophus, Lophorhothon, and Shantungosaurus.|$|E
5|$|A <b>cladistic</b> {{study of}} the {{skeletal}} and bone morphology of the classical Pelecaniformes and relatives found that the frigatebirds formed a clade with Limnofregata. Birds of the two genera have 15 cervical vertebrae, unlike almost all other Ciconiiformes, Suliformes and Pelecaniformes, which have 17. The age of Limnofregata indicates that these lineages had separated by the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|According to the parataxonomic {{system used}} to {{classify}} fossil eggs, Gobioolithus is {{classified in the}} oofamily Gobioolithidae, which, in turn, is classified in the prismatic morphotype (also called the neognath morphotype) of the ornithoid basic type. A <b>cladistic</b> analysis performed by Varricchio and Barta (2015) (pictured below) found Gobioolithus to be a sister taxon to Styloolithus. However, they considered Styloolithus different enough from Gobioolithus to warrant its excluslion from Gobioolithidae.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia has {{traditionally}} been described as lying within series Spicigerae of Banksia, together with Banksia spinulosa and various western Hairpin-like Banksias such as B.seminuda and B.brownii. This series is placed in Banksia sect. Oncostylis according to Alex George's taxonomy of Banksia, but directly into Banksia subg. Banksia in Thiele's arrangement based on <b>cladistic</b> analysis. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a subseries Ericifoliae, {{but this was not}} supported by George.|$|E
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through <b>cladistic</b> analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cladistic</b> {{studies have}} {{consistently}} {{found that the}} closest relatives of the kitefin shark are the cookiecutter sharks (Isistius), with which they share several dentitional, skeletal, and muscular similarities. Dalatias and Isistius {{are believed to have}} evolutionarily diverged shortly after the transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods (65.5 Ma), {{as part of a larger}} adaptive radiation of dogfish sharks from the deep sea into relatively shallower habitats.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Swiss {{zoologist}} Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major {{suggested the}} inclusion of O. johnstoni in the extinct giraffid subfamily Palaeotraginae. However, the species was placed in its own subfamily Okapiinae, by Swedish palaeontologist Birger Bohlin in 1926, mainly {{due to the lack}} of a cingulum, a major feature of the palaeotragids. In 1986, Okapia was finally established as a sister genus of Giraffa on the basis of <b>cladistic</b> analysis. The two genera together with Palaeotragus constitute the tribe Giraffini.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after <b>cladistic</b> analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.brownii in series Spicigerae, placing it in B.subser. Occidentales along with B.occidentalis (red swamp banksia), B.seminuda (river banksia), B.verticillata (granite banksia) and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after <b>cladistic</b> analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.menziesii in series Banksia, placing it in B.subser. Cratistylis along with nine other species. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} {{the results of}} a <b>cladistic</b> analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B.ser. Tetragonae was found to be monophyletic, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale <b>cladistic</b> analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the group (tribe) to which hammondi {{and the related}} species mentioned above belong. He used both morphological and molecular characters, but had only morphological data for Oryzomys hammondi. The placement of the species in his results was unstable; some trees placed it close to the tree rice rats, Oecomys, within clade B and others placed it as an isolated lineage, basal to all other Oryzomyini.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{relationships}} {{based on}} shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently. Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation {{similar to those}} of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The <b>cladistic</b> method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of <b>cladistic</b> analyses are expressed as cladograms: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.|$|E
5|$|Many abelisaurid skull {{features}} are shared with carcharodontosaurids. These shared features, {{along with the}} fact that abelisaurids seem to have replaced carcharodontosaurids in South America, have led to suggestions that the two groups were related. However, no <b>cladistic</b> analysis has ever found such a relationship and, aside from the skull, abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids are very different, more similar to ceratosaurs and allosauroids, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Sampson felt, in 1995, {{that there}} was not enough {{evidence}} to conclude that Achelousaurus was a direct descendant of Einiosaurus. Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a <b>cladistic</b> analysis to establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein Achelousaurus split off between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing <b>cladistic</b> analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements. With respect to B.epica, however, Mast's results accord closely with the arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges, placing it in a polytomous clade corresponding exactly with Thiele and Ladiges' B.ser. Cyrtostylis.|$|E
5|$|They used a <b>cladistic</b> {{analysis}} to examine its relationships within Oryzomyini, also including {{two species of}} Holochilus, Lundomys, and five other oryzomyines. They found that Noronhomys appeared closest to Holochilus, with Lundomys more distantly related. Eighteen shared characters (synapomorphies) supported the grouping of Noronhomys with Holochilus. Another form described as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus primigenus, may also be related, but is likely to fall outside the Holochilus–Noronhomys clade.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} still ongoing; at this time, Scelidosaurus is {{considered}} to be either more closely related to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur, or basal to the ankylosaur-stegosaur split. The stegosaur classification has fallen out of favor, but is seen in older dinosaur books. <b>Cladistic</b> analyses have invariably recovered a basal position for Scelidosaurus, outside of the Eurypoda.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several <b>cladistic</b> {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae {{for a variety of}} large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to Allosaurus included Indosaurus, Piatnitzkysaurus, Piveteausaurus, Yangchuanosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Chilantaisaurus, Compsosuchus, Stokesosaurus, and Szechuanosaurus. Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of <b>cladistic</b> study of evolutionary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like Acrocanthosaurus and Yangchuanosaurus, are members of closely related families.|$|E
5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published an}} arrangement informed by a <b>cladistic</b> analysis of morphological characteristics. They retained George's subgenera {{and many of}} his series, but discarded his sections. Banksia ser. Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. Banksia sphaerocarpa appeared in the second of these, initially called the ' grossa clade' for its most basal member. As with George's classification, B.grossa and B.micrantha emerged as close relatives of B.sphaerocarpa.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Sanford Myron Zeller {{circumscribed}} the {{new family}} Mycenastraceae, containing both Mycenastrum as the type genus, and Bovista. A 2001 molecular study supported {{the inclusion of}} Mycenastrum corium in the Lycoperdales, where it was traditionally placed. In a more recent (2008) <b>cladistic</b> analysis, Mycenastrum was {{shown to be a}} sister group to the Lycoperdaceae; authors Larsson and Jeppson agreed with Zeller (1949) and Pilat's (1958) decision to regard Mycenastrium as a monotypic genus in the separate family Mycenastraceae. Despite this, several taxonomic authorities prefer to fold Mycenastraceae into the Agaricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Reig {{believed}} Herrerasaurus was {{an early}} example of a carnosaur, {{but this was the}} subject of much debate over the next 30 years, and the genus was variously classified during that time. In 1970, Steel classified Herrerasaurus as a prosauropod. In 1972, Peter Galton classified the genus as not diagnosable beyond Saurischia. Later, using <b>cladistic</b> analysis, some researchers put Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus {{at the base of the}} dinosaur tree before the separation between ornithischians and saurischians. Several researchers classified the remains as non-dinosaurian.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing <b>cladistic</b> analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. B.oligantha resolves as sister taxon (that is, next closest relative) to B.ilicifolia, and B.cuneata resolves as sister to these two. This suggests a monophyletic B. subg. Isostylis; yet the clade appears fairly derived (that it, it evolved relatively recently), implying that B.subgenus Isostylis may not merit subgeneric rank.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing <b>cladistic</b> analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia attenuata resolves as a basal member of and next closest relative, or 'sister', to a clade containing B.elegans and, within that, a monophyletic B.subg. Isostylis. An Eocene fossil cone named Banksia archaeocarpa, around 50 million years old, resembles that of B.attenuata.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing <b>cladistic</b> analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi in a clade corresponding closely with B.ser. Tetragonae. A 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results found that B.aculeata was sister to B.lemanniana and that B.caleyi was the next closest relative.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, an American botanist, Austin Mast, {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing <b>cladistic</b> analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and somewhat different from Thiele and Ladiges'. With respect to B.violacea, Mast's results agree with its placement near B.laricina and B.incana, placing it in a clade with these two species and B.sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla (treated at species rank as B.dolichostyla). However, Thiele's B. subseries Longistyles appears to be polyphyletic, as do both definitions of B.ser. Abietinae—that is, none form a natural grouping.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent discoveries and {{analyses}} upheld Sternberg's {{view on the}} position of Triceratops, with Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing Triceratops as ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) {{on the basis of}} several morphological features. In fact, it fits well into the ceratopsine subfamily, apart from its one feature of a shortened frill. Further research by Peter Dodson, including a 1990 <b>cladistic</b> analysis and a 1993 study using RFTRA (resistant-fit theta-rho analysis), a morphometric technique which systematically measures similarities in skull shape, reinforces Triceratops placement in the ceratopsine subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.oblongifolia is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological <b>cladistic</b> analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along with B.plagiocarpa, B.robur and B.dentata within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of molecular phylogenetics, <b>cladistic</b> theory and phylogenetic methods in the 1990s {{resulted in a}} dismemberment of the Liliaceae and its subsequent redistribution across three lilioid orders (Liliales, Asparagales and Dioscoreales). Subsequent work has shown that two other more recently recognized orders, Petrosaviales and Pandanales also segregate with this group, resulting in the modern concept of five constituent orders within the lilioid monocot assemblage. This has resulted in treating monocots as three informal groups, alismatid, lilioid and commelinid monocots. The lilioids are paraphyletic {{in the sense that}} commelinids form a sister group to Asparagales.|$|E
