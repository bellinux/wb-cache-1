Her first lead role was in the 2003 film Love Don't <b>Cost</b> <b>a</b> Thing, and she subsequently had lead roles in Be Cool and the 2006 horror film Pulse. Milian had a minor role in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, and starred as the lead role in the straight-to-DVD film , training with former Cleveland Cavaliers dancer Kelly Wilson. Milian has since been cast in the 2010 ABC Family Original Movie Christmas Cupid, alongside Ashley Benson and Chad Michael Murray.|$|E

5|$|Iridium's modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium.

Despite these limitations and iridium's high <b>cost,</b> <b>a</b> number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E

5|$|The final {{consideration}} is cost: {{how much will}} a particular defensive strategy <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> plant in energy and materials? This is particularly important, as energy spent on defense cannot be used for other functions, such as reproduction and growth.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Charles Ritz in 1976, the hotel went into a period of slow decline. As it lost its luster, its {{clientele}} diminished, {{and for the first}} time in its existence it began to lose money. It was rescued, however, in 1979 by an Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who purchased the hotel for $20million and installed a new managing director, Frank Klein. Klein in turn put Guy Legay, the former chef of the three-star Ledoyen, in charge of the kitchen. Al-Fayed renovated it completely over several years without stopping its operation; this was achieved by annexing two town houses, joined by an arcade with many of Paris's leading boutiques. The renovation of the hotel was headed by the architect Bernard Gaucherel from 1980 to 1987. The entire ten-year renovation <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> total of $250million. The restaurants were given a new look, and a swimming pool, health club, and spas were created in the basement. The Little Bar was renamed the Hemingway Bar. In 1988 the Ritz-Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in honour of Auguste Escoffier.|$|E
