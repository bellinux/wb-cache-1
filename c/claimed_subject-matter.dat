5000|$|A {{disclaimer}} defines, in a <b>claim,</b> <b>subject-matter</b> {{which is}} not claimed. By extension, a disclaimer may also mean the action of introduction a negative limitation in a claim, i.e. [...] "an amendment to a claim resulting in the incorporation therein of a [...] "negative" [...] technical feature, typically excluding from a general feature specific embodiments or areas". The allowability of disclaimers is subject to particular conditions.|$|R
5000|$|In patent law, a {{disclaimer}} identifies, in a <b>claim,</b> <b>subject-matter</b> {{that is not}} claimed. By extension, {{a disclaimer}} may also mean the action of introduction a negative limitation in a claim, i.e. [...] "an amendment to a claim resulting in the incorporation therein of a [...] "negative" [...] technical feature, typically excluding from a general feature specific embodiments or areas".

5000|$|The Board {{therefore}} {{accepted the}} practice of the EPO [...] "that amendments to a divisional application are objected to and refused when the amended divisional application <b>claims</b> the same <b>subject-matter</b> as a pending parent application or a granted parent patent." ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{there are}} four {{requirements}} to be fulfilled for some <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> to be patented: [...] "(1) {{it should be an}} [...] "invention", and this invention must be (2) new, (3) inventive, and (4) industrially applicable", that ...|$|E
5000|$|... the [...] "verification that <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> is an {{invention}} within {{the meaning of}} Article 52(1) EPC" [...] must be done before performing the three other tests, i.e. the novelty, the inventive step and the industrial applicability tests.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{question}} [...] "Is there an invention?" [...] is equivalent to: [...] "Is the <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> {{as a whole}} {{within the realm of}} patentable subject-matter?" [...] The invention question or patentable subject-matter question precedes the three further questions, which cannot, and need not, be assessed if there is no invention.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of German patent law, the Formstein defence is a {{well-known}} defense against an alleged infringement by equivalents, wherein the alleged infringer claims that the embodiment alleged to be equivalent (to the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>claimed</b> in the patent) is not patentable and therefore the doctrine of equivalents does not apply. It {{is similar to the}} UKs Gillette defense and the U.S. Wilson case. The name [...] "Formstein" [...] means [...] "molded kerbstone" [...] and comes from a landmark decision of the Federal Court of Justice of Germany (Bundesgerichtshof) issued in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|Before the search, {{communications}} between the search division and the applicant were not foreseen, before April 1, 2010. However, under new Rules 62a and 63 EPC, {{if there are}} more than one independent claim per claim category (and if the provisions of [...] are considered not to be met) or if the search division considers {{that it is impossible to}} carry out a meaningful search based on the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>claimed,</b> {{communications between}} the search division and the applicant are possible. Under [...] however, no amendments to the application can be made before the search [...] "unless otherwise provided".|$|R
5000|$|In patent law, a {{cross-licensing}} {{agreement is}} an agreement {{according to which}} two or more parties grant a license {{to each other for}} the exploitation of the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>claimed</b> in {{one or more of the}} patents each owns. Usually, this type of agreement happens between two parties in order to avoid litigation or to settle an infringement dispute. Very often, the patents that each party owns covers different essential aspects of a given commercial product. Thus by cross licensing, each party maintains their freedom to bring the commercial product to market. The term [...] "cross licensing" [...] implies that neither party pays monetary royalties to the other party, although this may be the case.|$|R
5000|$|For instance, two {{differences}} may be identified between the <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> and a document {{considered to be}} the closest prior art, whereas these two differences solve two different objective problems which are independent from each other. The two objective problems may then be treated [...] "as separate partial problems for the purposes of assessing inventive step." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{approach}} {{confirmed that}} the Boards of Appeal of the EPO have abandoned the [...] "contribution approach", which consisted in deciding whether a <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> is an invention by deciding whether it brought forward {{a contribution to the}} art in a field non excluded from patentability, and therefore by inherently taking into account prior art during this first step.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the case}} law of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, the {{question}} [...] "Is there an invention?" [...] also implicitly implies the further question: [...] "Does the <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> have a technical character?" [...] "Having technical character is an implicit requirement of the EPC to be met by an invention to be an invention {{within the meaning of}} [...] ".|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of Article 83 EPC, a European patent application must contain sufficient information to allow a person skilled in the art, using his common general knowledge, to perceive the technical teaching inherent in the claimed invention and to put it into effect accordingly. In other words, the disclosure of the invention must be reproducible without undue burden, and this must be true over the whole scope of the claim. This requirement must be complied with as from the date of filing because a deficiency in a European patent application as filed, consisting in an insufficient identification of the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>claimed,</b> cannot subsequently be cured without offending against Article 123(2) EPC which provides that the subject-matter content of a European patent application as filed may not be extended.|$|R
5000|$|If no {{technical}} {{problem can}} be derived from the application, then an invention within the meaning of [...] does not exist, and the <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> is not patentable. Where a feature in the claim cannot be considered as contributing to the solution of any technical problem by providing a technical effect it has no significance for the purpose of assessing inventive step.|$|E
50|$|Instead {{of first}} filing a {{counterclaim}} in the Delaware state court system, Exxon Mobil and its subsidiaries chose to sue SABIC in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. There, they alleged that SABIC had overcharged the subsidiaries for the sublicenses. Exxon Mobil <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> jurisdiction {{in federal court}} under , which gives the United States district courts jurisdiction over foreign states.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{ten years}} before 2006, a shift occurs in the case law. The [...] "contribution approach" [...] or [...] "technical effect approach", used to assess what was {{regarded}} as an invention {{within the meaning of}} Art. 52(1) and (2), was abandoned. According to the [...] "contribution approach" [...] (see for instance T 52/85), the <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> did not concern an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC when no contribution was made in a field not excluded from patentability. The [...] "contribution approach" [...] was a disguised inventive step assessment.|$|E
5000|$|In Germany, in {{the case}} Logikverifikation (13 December 1999), the German Federal Court (German: Bundesgerichtshof or BGH) ruled on a case {{involving}} a national patent application claiming a computer-implemented invention, namely a [...] "method for hierarchical logic verification of highly-integrated circuits". Going against the run of previous case law, it overruled the German Federal Patent Court (German: Bundespatentgericht or BPatG), {{and came to the}} conclusion that the <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> did properly meet the 'technical' requirement, can not be excluded from patentability for that reason and that the court has to go into substantial examination. The question about the exclusion of [...] "computer programs as such"(sic) was mentioned the first time, but set aside as the court did not see the need to determine that question.|$|E
50|$|The {{second step}} is to {{determine}} the objective technical problem, i.e., determining, {{in the light of the}} closest prior art, the technical problem, or task (Aufgabe), which the claimed invention addresses and successfully solves. This implies determining the feature(s) distinguishing the <b>claimed</b> <b>subject-matter</b> from the closest prior art, determining the technical effect(s) of the distinguishing feature(s), and finally the objective technical problem, or task, is how to adapt or modify the closest prior art to obtain the identified technical effect. The objective technical problem has to be formulated in such a manner that it does not contain pointers to the solution. In other words, the technical problem has to be formulated without including therein a part of a solution provided by the invention. Otherwise, this would result in an ex post facto assessment of inventive step, i.e. an assessment made with hindsight.|$|E
