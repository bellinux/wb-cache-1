500|$|Many {{of these}} fast expresses {{included}} special coaches {{that could be}} detached as they passed through stations without stopping, a guard riding in the coach to uncouple it from the main train {{and bring it to}} a stop at the correct position. The first such [...] "slip coach" [...] was detached from the Flying Dutchman at [...] in 1869. The company's first sleeping cars were operated between Paddington and Plymouth in 1877. Then on 1 October 1892 its first <b>corridor</b> <b>train</b> ran from Paddington to Birkenhead, and the following year saw the first trains heated by steam that was passed through the train in a pipe from the locomotive. May 1896 saw the introduction of first-class restaurant cars and the service was extended to all classes in 1903. Sleeping cars for third-class passengers were available from 1928.|$|E
2500|$|The northeastern {{terminus}} of Amtrak's Northeast <b>Corridor</b> <b>train</b> service, including Acela Express {{high-speed rail}} service and Northeast Regional local trains. [...] There {{is also a}} daily Amtrak train, the Lake Shore Limited, to Albany, New York and Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
60|$|When one travels {{beyond a}} certain speed, {{there is nothing}} but fatigue in looking out of a window, and this <b>corridor</b> <b>train,</b> twice the width of its poor {{terrestrial}} brother, will have no need of that distraction. The simple device of abandoning any but a few windows, and those set high, gives the wall space of the long corridors to books; the middle part of the train is indeed a comfortable library with abundant armchairs and couches, each with its green-shaded light, and soft carpets upon the soundproof floor. Further on will be a news-room, with a noiseless but busy tape at one corner, printing off messages from the wires by the wayside, and further still, rooms for gossip and smoking, a billiard room, and the dining car. Behind we shall come to bedrooms, bathrooms, the hairdresser, and so forth.|$|E
5000|$|The Empire Connection allows Amtrak's {{passenger}} trains traveling on the Empire Corridor from Albany in upstate New York, and beyond, to enter Penn Station. Before its construction, Empire <b>Corridor</b> <b>trains</b> came into Grand Central Terminal, requiring passengers bound for Northeast <b>Corridor</b> <b>trains</b> {{to transfer to}} Penn Station via shuttle bus, taxicab or subway.|$|R
50|$|The Capitol Corridor is a 168-mile (275 km) {{passenger}} train route operated by Amtrak in California. Capitol <b>Corridor</b> <b>trains</b> operate between San Jose and Sacramento, roughly parallel to Interstate 880 and Interstate 80. One train a day continues through the eastern Sacramento suburbs to Auburn, {{in the foothills}} of the Sierra Nevada. Capitol <b>Corridor</b> <b>trains</b> started in 1991.|$|R

60|$|Yet, {{while the}} men's talk {{was so good}} and new, their written word seemed to be cast in conventional, not to say old-fashioned, moulds. A {{quarter of a century}} ago a sub-editor, opening his mail, could {{identify}} the Melbourne Argus, the Sydney Morning Herald, or the Cape Times {{as far as he could}} see them. Even unheaded clippings from them declared their origin as a piece of hide betrays the beast that wore it. But he noticed then that Canadian journals left neither spoor nor scent--might have blown in from anywhere between thirty degrees of latitude--and had to be carefully identified by hand. To-day, the spacing, the headlines, the advertising of Canadian papers, the chessboard-like look of the open page which should be a daily beautiful study in black and white, the brittle pulp-paper, the machine-set type, are all as standardised as the railway cars of the Continent. Indeed, looking through a mass of Canadian journals is like trying to find one's own sleeper in a <b>corridor</b> <b>train.</b> Newspaper offices are among the most conservative organisations in the world; but surely after twenty-five years some changes might be permitted to creep in; some original convention of expression or assembly might be developed.|$|E

Amtrak service to Santa Clara began on May 21, 1993.|$|R

50|$|An {{express service}} had existed under Great Eastern Railway (GER) {{operation}} {{prior to the}} amalgamation of the railway companies, and the GER had in 1904 produced its first <b>corridor</b> <b>train</b> set of 13 coaches specifically for the service. This {{was also the first}} GER train to be steam heated throughout and Claud Hamilton 4-4-0 steam locomotives were equipped to supply it with steam.|$|E

By spring 1998, all three Seattle-Portland/Eugene trains were using leased Talgo equipment, while the Vancouver train used conventional equipment. Amtrak introduced a temporary Pacific Northwest brand {{for all four}} trains, dropping individual names, {{in preparation for the}} introduction of new Talgo equipment built in the United States and owned by the state of Washington.|$|E
50|$|In 1904 Stratford {{produced}} a complete <b>corridor</b> <b>train</b> (this means {{a person can}} walk from the first to the last carriage whilst the train is moving). Despite the trend to bogied stock, Stratford still included three 6-wheeler carriages and a 4-wheeled luggage van in this formation. The other vehicles were all bogied stock and included a kitchen car. This train was also fitted for steam heating throughout and was employed on Liverpool Street - Parkeston Quay services.|$|E
