2500|$|In the Borealis region, craters are mapped {{according}} to the fivefold classification proposed by McCauley and others (1981), which determines Mercurian crater ages {{on the basis of}} <b>crater</b> <b>diameter</b> and morphologic degradation. Craters less than about [...] in diameter are not mapped. All basins between [...] and [...] in diameter (including those that have central peaks and peak rings) are mapped as craters. Criteria used to determine impact structures are morphologic crater components such as rays, secondary rays, hummocky rims, various facies of crater ejecta, crater geometry and structure, or a combination of these.|$|E
50|$|Gore is a lunar {{impact crater}} {{located on the}} lunar near side near the {{northern}} pole.
