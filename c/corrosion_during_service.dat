50|$|Delayed failure, the {{fracture}} of a component under stress after an elapsed time, is a characteristic feature of hydrogen embrittlement (2). Hydrogen {{entry into the}} material may be affected during melting, casting, welding, and service life. <b>Corrosion</b> <b>during</b> <b>service</b> in moist environments generates hydrogen, part of which may enter the metal and cause embrittlement. Presence of a tensile stress, either inherent or externally applied, is necessary for metals to be damaged. As {{in the case of}} stress corrosion cracking, hydrogen embrittlement may also lead to a decrease in the threshold stress intensity factor for crack propagation or an increase in the sub critical crack growth velocity of the material. The most visible effect of hydrogen in materials is a drastic reduction in ductility during tensile tests. It may increase, decrease or leave unaffected the yield strength of the material. Hydrogen may cause serrated yielding in certain metals such as niobium, nickel and some steels (3).|$|E

40|$|A novel laser surface {{modification}} approach to suppress sensitization in AISI 304 (UNS S 30400) {{austenitic stainless steel}} is described. Surface modification of austenitic stainless steel was carried out with a 10 -kW carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser in both continuous wave and pulse-modulated modes. After laser {{surface modification}}, the material was subjected to a sensitization heat treatment at 923 K for 9 h. The degree of sitization was determined by electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation test while the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion was determined using the ASTM A 262, practice B test. The {{results of the study}} demonstrated that the laser-melted surface exhibited significantly higher resistance against sensitization and intergranular corrosion than the base metal. The laser-melted surface, even after being subjected to severe sensitization heat treatment, developed comparable or even a lower degree of sensitization than the base metal in the asreceived condition. Enhanced immunity against sensitization of the laser-treated surface is attributed to its duplex microstructure and higher fraction of low-angle grain boundaries. The highlight of the investigation was that a laser surface melting treatment of unstabilized austenitic stainless steel brings about significant reduction in its Susceptibility to sensitization during subsequent exposure to a susceptible temperature region and to intergranular <b>corrosion</b> <b>during</b> <b>service...</b>|$|E

Effect of the ratios of salt mixtures of Na 2 SO 4 /NaCl and the coating amounts of salt mixtures on the microstructure and the high temperature stress-rupture properties of a corrosion resistant directionally solidified superalloy at 850 ℃/ 500 MPa were investigated.

40|$|Nanocomposite {{materials}} {{consisting of}} platinum deposited on carbon nanotubes are emerging electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in PEM fuel cells. However, these materials albeit showing promising electrocatalytic activities suffer from unacceptable rates of <b>corrosion</b> <b>during</b> <b>service.</b> This study demonstrates an effective strategy for creating highly corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts utilizing metal oxide coated carbon nanotubes as a support for Pt. The electrode geometry {{consisted of a}} three-dimensional array of multi-walled carbon nanotubes grown directly on Inconel and conformally covered by a bilayer of Pt/niobium oxide. The activities of these hybrid carbon-metal oxide materials are on par with commercially available carbon-supported Pt catalysts. We show that a sub-nanometre interlayer of NbO 2 provides effective protection from electrode corrosion. After 10, 000 cyclic voltammetry cycles from 0. 5 V to 1. 4 V, the loss of electrochemical surface area, reduction of the half-wave potential, {{and the loss of}} specific activity of the NbO 2 supported Pt were 10. 8 %, 8 mV and 10. 3 %, respectively. Under the same conditions, the catalytic layers with Pt directly deposited onto carbon nanotubes had a loss of electrochemical area, reduction of half-wave potential and loss of specific activity of 47. 3 %, 65 mV and 65. 8 %, respectively. The improved corrosion resistance is supported by microstructural observations of both electrodes in their post-cycled state. First principles calculations at the density functional theory level were performed to gain further insight into changes in wetting properties, stability and electronic structure introduced by the insertion of the thin NbO 2 film.

30|$|Concrete is {{the most}} widely used {{construction}} materials in the world due to its low cost and easy availability of its ingredients. It also exhibits excellent strength properties in compression. However, it easily cracks in tension, flexure and shear as well as due to various environmental factors such as thermal cracking, shrinkage cracking, freeze–thaw, etc., during its service life. The formation of cracks adversely affect its durability properties with most significant effect on the de-passivation of reinforcing steel in reinforced concrete (RC), resulting in corrosion of steel. The presence of cracks shorten the corrosion initiation time of steel and also accelerates the propagation of <b>corrosion</b> <b>during</b> <b>service</b> life resulting in significant corrosion induced damage and loss of sectional and load carrying capacity of RC structures. The formation of cracks in RC is unavoidable due to its low tensile strength. The cracks thus form in concrete varies in widths, numbers, geometry, depths, etc. (Mehta and Gerwick 1982). These factors affect the initiation and propagation of corrosion of steel in RC. Considerable number of publications reported the research results on the corrosion of steel in cracked concrete. Most of them studied the corrosion of steel in concrete with different crack widths, while others, in few numbers, studied the effects of number of cracks and their depths on the corrosion of steel in concrete. Conflicting results on the relationship between the crack widths and corrosion of steel in concrete are also reported. In most of the above studies, the corrosion of steel was considered due to penetration of chloride ions. However, carbonation also induces corrosion of steel in concrete and especially in cracked concrete. Very few studies, so far, are reported on this aspect. While many results on the effect of cracks on corrosion of steel in concrete are reported, hardly any paper exists that provides a comprehensive summary and review of existing available results on steel corrosion in cracked concrete, the relationship between crack widths and corrosion, effects of other parameters of crack on corrosion of steel in concrete in a single report. Therefore, this paper is prepared to fill this gap in the state of knowledge on the effects of cracks on corrosion of steel in concrete.|$|E
40|$|Pipelines {{are one of}} {{the safest}} forms of {{transportation}} for oil and gas. However, pipelines may experience some defects, such as cracks, corrosion and cracks in <b>corrosion,</b> <b>during</b> <b>service</b> period. In this thesis, the current defect assessment methods for crack, corrosion and crack in corrosion defects are reviewed. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the crack in corrosion defects on the failure pressure of natural gas transmission pipelines. Consequently, a series of burst tests with varying defect depths were undertaken on end-capped, seam-welded API 5 L Grade X 60 (433 MPa yield stress) pipeline steel of external diameter 508 mm (20 inch), 5. 7 mm wall thickness. Defects were created by pre-fatiguing the pipe to create a crack. The number of cycles required to create a fatigue crack were varied between 75000 to 150000 cycles based on the desired final defect depth. For the (CIC) defects, the pipe was pre-fatigued to create a sharp crack, and the artificial corrosion defect was simulated by machining a rectangular groove over the fatigue crack. The rupture tests were conducted by pressurizing the pipe until failure occurred. Results were analyzed using various assessment methods. For the artificial corrosion defects, the predicted failure pressures based on RSTRENG were more reliable than those based on Modified B 31 G. This study revealed that CorLAS provided the least conservative prediction for crack defects, whereas the other methods provided more conservative estimates of failure pressure. Moreover, the predicted failure pressure of the level 3 FAD for API 579 cylinder equations had better agreement with experimental results in comparison with the other methods, i. e. BS 7910 and NG- 18. The failure pressure for CIC defects for pipes tested fell between corrosion defects (lower bound) and crack defects (upper bound). The transition to crack defect behavior only occurs when the crack defect depth is significant or vice versa. It should be noted that the crack to corrosion ratio is not the only parameter to evaluate a CIC defect. There are other parameters such as total defect depth and defect profile, which affect the failure behavior of a CIC defect...|$|E

Due to low visibility and lack of proper information regarding the condition of underground pipes, assessment and maintenance are frequently neglected until a disastrous failure occurs.

40|$|Concrete {{structures}} {{are exposed to}} carbonation that may cause rapid decay, shortening their service life and raising maintenance and repair costs. Carbonation lowers the alkalinity of the concrete depassivating the steel reinforcement. Two limit states can be identified with regard to service life. The first limit state ends when the steel is depassivated. The second limit state is based on cracking of the concrete cover due to oxides generated <b>during</b> <b>corrosion.</b> The <b>service</b> life includes a certain propagation period of <b>corrosion</b> <b>during</b> which the cross-sectional area of steel is progressively decreased, the bond between steel and concrete is reduced and the effective cross-sectional area of concrete is diminished due to spalling of the cover. Surface treatment is commonly used to improve the resistance of concrete to carbonation. A barrier is formed retarding the carbonation reactions {{in the interior of}} the concrete. In this study surface protected concretes were compared with non-protected concretes. The used surface protected concretes presented generally lower carbonation diffusion coefficients than the non-protected concretes. The use of epoxy resin showed better protection than the use of acrylic and siloxane resins. The composition of the concretes is an important factor affecting the diffusion of carbonation. The influence of the water–cement ratio was very important. The carbonation diffusion coefficients increased with the water–cement ratio. The prescriptive methodology is not a guarantee to obtain the desired service lives of 50 or 100 years. The desired services lives were only obtained with the use of surface protection treatments...|$|R

A large section of underground pipelines in the UK are classified as structurally deficient and functionally obsolete. Due to low visibility, condition assessment and rehabilitation of underground pipelines are frequently neglected until a catastrophic failure occurs. Providing an acceptable level of service and overcoming the practical difficulties, the concerned industry has to plan how to operate, maintain and renew (repair or replace) the pipeline systems under the budget constraints. This research is focused on estimating pipe reliability and deciding when and how interventions are needed to prevent unexpected failures of flexible underground metal pipelines subject to externally applied loadings and pipe material <b>corrosion</b> <b>during</b> the whole <b>service</b> life at the optimal cost. The time-dependent reliability due to corrosion induced excessive deflection, buckling, wall thrust and bending has been estimated.

40|$|Risers in {{offshore}} operations {{are subjected to}} <b>corrosion</b> <b>during</b> their <b>service</b> life cycle. The use of relatively inexpensive, high strength to weight ratio fibre reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) as a load bearing pipe repair sleeve is an emerging technology that is becoming common for offshore applications. Risers experience complex loading profiles and experimental investigations often incur substantial time, complicated instrumentation and setup costs. The main aim {{of this research is}} to develop a design tool for the repair of offshore riser that suffers from external corrosion damage on its surface using FRPC material. The simplest configuration of a fixed platform riser {{in the form of a}} vertical single-wall pipe is being considered. Characterization of the stress-strain behaviour of the FRPC laminate in the composite repair system subjected to various load profiles of a common riser is performed. The means of composite repair takes into account the ease of automated installation. The final repair method considers the use of unidirectional pre-impregnated (prepreg) FRPC that is assumed to be helically wounded around the riser. Finite element models of the composite repair system were developed via ABAQUS. Global analysis of the entire length of the riser was omitted as external corrosions usually occurs in a localised manner on the surface of the riser. Instead, local analyses were conducted where boundary conditions were applied to mimic an infinitely long cylindrical structure such as the riser. The local analyses FEA models were made to capture the stress-strain behaviour of the FRPC laminate subjected to different load profiles including static loadings such as internal pressure, tensile load and bending load. The design loads were calculated based on a limit analysis known as Double-Elastic Curve method developed by Alexander (2008). Proper element selection and mesh convergence were carried out to determine the FE model that can minimize the time and CPU memory needed for the simulation without compromising the accuracy of the results. The second part of this research integrated experimental tests to validate the FE model developed using the ABAQUS general purpose code. Due to constraints on cost and supply of materials and equipment, small-scale tests were conducted. Similitude relations were used to determine the scale properties between the model and the prototype. The final results showed that the FE model can represent the real-life tests of corroded riser repaired with off-axis FRPC laminate with great accuracy of more than 85...|$|R
