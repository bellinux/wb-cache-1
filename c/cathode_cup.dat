50|$|As lithium in used but non working (i.e. {{extended}} storage) {{button cells}} is still {{likely to be}} in the <b>cathode</b> <b>cup,</b> it is possible to extract commercially useful quantities of the metal from such cells as well as the manganese dioxide and specialist plastics. From experiment the usual failure mode is that they will read 3.2V or above but be unable to generate useful current (<5mA versus >40mA for a good new cell)Some also alloy the lithium with magnesium (Mg) to cut costs and these are particularly prone to the mentioned failure mode.|$|E
50|$|One of the <b>cathodes</b> is a <b>cup</b> made of soft iron, {{enclosing}} most of {{the discharge}} space. The bottom of the cup has a hole through which {{most of the}} generated ions are ejected by the magnetic field into the acceleration space. The soft iron shields the acceleration space from the magnetic field, to prevent a breakdown.|$|R
