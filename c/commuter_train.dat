5|$|The {{restructuring}} {{also called}} for the reduction of four services on the Meråker Line and two services to Oppdal, terminating all <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> services on the lines. For the service to Oppdal, NSB had an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million and 21,000 passengers in 1998. The Meråker Line had about {{twice the number of}} passengers. The National Rail Administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate the routes without subsidies, they were free to do so. As compensation, travelers between Trondheim and Rennebu and Oppdal with month passes were allowed to not pay for seat reservations on the intercity services. Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality applied to the ministry to take over responsibility and purchase the <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> services, so they could continue the service to Oppdal, but this was rejected by the ministry.|$|E
5|$|Eidsvoll Verk {{was built}} {{along with the}} rest of the Gardermoen Line for the opening of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen in 1998. The station was {{designed}} by Arkitektskap, with construction starting in 1997. The station opened on 27 September 1998, but the <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> service along the line did not start until 1999, when the Romerike Tunnel opened. In 2008, the parking lot was expanded with an additional 36 parking spaces.|$|E
5|$|NSB Gjøvikbanen has a {{staff of}} five in administration, 36 {{engineers}} and 32 conductors. Their offices are located at Jaren Station and OsloS. This results in the Gjøvik Line being served by the same pool of train drivers and conductors, unlike the other <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> services around Oslo, who use stock and staff interchangeably. In 2007, the company had a revenue of , and a net profit of NOK 7 million.|$|E
50|$|<b>Commuter</b> <b>trains</b> {{serve the}} busiest {{portions}} of the railways, ferrying commuters within Colombo and its suburbs. Most <b>commuter</b> <b>trains</b> are operated with diesel-multiple units, and lack the three-class configuration seen in the inter-city services. <b>Commuter</b> <b>trains</b> help alleviate rush hour congestion on city roads, but can be very crowded.|$|R

5|$|The GO Transit {{authority}} has two major <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> lines running through Scarborough, and operates seven GO train stations. The Lakeshore East line runs {{across the south}} end of the city, while the Stouffville line runs in a more north-south fashion in the centre of Scarborough. GO Transit also has a few bus stations and stops in Scarborough.|$|E
5|$|The <b>{{commuter}}</b> <b>train</b> serves suburbs {{further away}} from Oslo, {{though some of the}} commuter rail services remind of a rapid transit service, in particular line L1 and line L2, to Lillestrøm, Asker and Ski, with higher service frequency through the continual populated area of Oslo. Transfer to railway services is available at Jernbanetorget (to Oslo S) and Nationaltheatret, the latter with a considerably shorter walk.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{transport}} was of two types; trains that {{corresponded with}} the ferries and connected with trains at Tinnoset, and commuter trains transporting workers to the plants at Rjukan. The commuter trains were initiated in 1913, and Norsk Hydro started building housing at Ingolfsland and Tveito, and both Ingolfsland and Miland got their own stops, and from 1919 stations. The two kilometers (one mile) <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> from Rjukan to Ingofsland took five minutes; a month pass cost NOK 2.50 for employees and their families. There were seventeen departures {{in each direction}} per week, timed to fit with the working times at the plant. This increased to 58 in 1916, when a new stop at Tveito was opened.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s the BRB {{moved to}} a sectoral model based on {{business}} activity - InterCity for long-distance passenger trains, Network SouthEast for <b>commuter</b> <b>trains</b> in London, and Regional Railways for short-distance and <b>commuter</b> <b>trains</b> outside the Network SouthEast area. Railfreight was organised separately.|$|R

5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a <b>commuter</b> <b>train.</b> The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s {{a series}} of cost {{reductions}} were introduced on the line, after major reorganizations between 1965 and 1970; the last <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> for the workers to the plants went on 25 May 1968, while on 31 May 1970 the last passenger train {{in connection with the}} ferries went on Rjukan Line, being replaced with bus. In 1972 Norsk Transport applied to terminate passenger transport with the railway ferry, since they were operating trips with only passengers and no cargo. The application was declined by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, but in 1978 they permitted that the Saturday afternoon and Sunday departures be terminated—these were not used to transport freight trains. By the mid eighties passenger numbers had fallen dramatically, and in 1985 the department gave in and permitted the termination of passenger services with Storegut and Ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Should a new tunnel be built, {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} run next to the Oslo Tunnel. One proposal from the National Rail Administration calls for a separate <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> station to be built underground, {{at the location of}} Oslo Bus Terminal, within walking distance of OsloS. This proposal involves the line connecting to the existing route before reaching Nationaltheatret. The lobby organisation Norsk Bane have called for a line to run further north, and serve Majorstuen, where there is a major metro and tramway hub. Norsk Bane also call for the tunnel to be built for higher speeds, and state {{that it is necessary to}} build high-speed rail to Bergen and Stavanger. Combined with a new line from Drammen to the tunnel, it would allow travel time from Drammen and Oslo to be reduced to 18 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} {{services}} are offered: <b>Commuter</b> <b>Trains</b> and Express Trains. While both trains travel the same route, Express Trains stop at fewer stations and are specially provided for airport passengers. <b>Commuter</b> <b>Trains,</b> which stop at every station, operate from Taipei to Zhongli in 70 minutes, while Express Trains run from Taipei directly to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in 38 minutes. During the initial stage of operation, services run with a 10-minute headway for Express and <b>Commuter</b> <b>Trains</b> (or 5 minutes per train), with a target interval of 3.75 minutes between trains.|$|R

5|$|The 1996 Maryland train {{collision}} {{occurred on}} February 16, 1996, when a MARC <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> collided with Amtrak's Capitol Limited passenger train in Silver Spring, Maryland. An {{investigation by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that {{the crew of the}} MARC train had forgotten the indication of an approach signal which they had passed before a station stop, and as a consequence could not slow down in time after encountering a stop signal. The collision killed three crew and eight passengers on the MARC train; a further eleven passengers on the MARC train and fifteen passengers and crew on the Capitol Limited were injured. Total damage was estimated at $7.5 million. The crash {{led to the creation of}} comprehensive federal rules for passenger car design, the first in the history of passenger service in the United States, as well as changes to operating rules.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, NSB {{started using}} Class 93 diesel {{multiple}} units on intercity trains, retiring the Di3. In March 2000, NSB announced {{the closing of}} several stations for the <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> service. Fifty percent of the stations were responsible for only {{two percent of the}} traffic, and NSB instead wanted buses to transport people to the closest railway station, which would reduce overall transport time for most passengers. From 7 January 2001, a fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim. Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg were closed, but HiNT Røstad opened. From June 2001, NSB introduced additional rush-hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer, giving a half-hour headway. The Nordland Line had not received NSB's first generation of train radio, Scanet, so was among the first lines to receive GSM-R from 1 December 2004. In 2010, CargoNet started using Vossloh Euro locomotives. Sykehuset Levanger Station was closed on 11 December 2010. Despite generating some 90,000 annual patrons and being one of the busiest stations on the line, it was located too close to Levanger Station to meet safety requirements.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 2008, {{the state}} government, which {{was accused of}} {{reluctance}} to take immediate action, ultimately arrested Raj Thackeray and Abu Asim Azmi (a local SP leader) on charges of instigation of violence and causing communal disturbance. Although released that same day, a gag order was imposed on both leaders {{to prevent them from}} making further inflammatory remarks. Meanwhile, tensions in Maharashtra rose as the news of Raj's possible arrest, and his subsequent actual arrest, angered his supporters. Incidences of violence against North Indians and their property by MNS workers were reported in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Beed, Nashik, Amravati, Jalna, and Latur. Nearly 25,000 North Indian workers fled Pune, and another 15,000 fled Nashik {{in the wake of the}} attacks. The exodus of workers caused an acute labour shortage, affecting local industries. Analysts estimated financial losses of –. Although the violence receded after the arrests of the two leaders, sporadic attacks were reported until May 2008. After months of lull, on 19 October 2008, MNS activists beat up North Indian candidates appearing for the all-India Railway Recruitment Board entrance exam in Mumbai. The incident led to Raj's arrest and fresh violence. Later on 28 October 2008 a labourer from Uttar Pradesh was lynched in a Mumbai <b>commuter</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E

5|$|The railway past Værnes {{opened on}} 27 October 1902 as the Hell–Sunnan Line—today {{part of the}} Nordland Line. The plans for a railway station in the {{terminal}} of Værnes were launched in 1990, along with the {{plans to build a}} second terminal at the airport. Construction of the new terminal started on 1 October 1992. On 15 March 1993, NSB announced that they would start a <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> service between Steinkjer and Melhus, south of Trondheim. The service would give a half-hour headway during peak hours between Stjørdal and Melhus, and a one-hour headway onwards to Steinkjer. NSB stated that the concept was based on the success of the Jæren Commuter Rail and that they hoped to have a 70% increase in ridership, in part due to the opening of the airport station. The concept would also take advantage of expansion of Trondheim Central Station that would co-locate the main coach- and train terminals in Trondheim. The service would also give direct services along the Dovre Line to Oppdal and the Røros Line to Tynset. Estimates were that the railway would capture a 10% ground transport market share. The commuter rail service started on 1 September 1993.|$|E
5|$|Like {{with many}} large {{cities in the}} United States, Denver’s CBD and the {{adjacent}} neighborhoods were blighted {{with the presence of}} many open parking lots in the 1970s and 80’s. Recent focus to redevelop these open lots and increase density/activity in the city’s core have been hugely successful as many of these lots are today being turned into large residential, retail and commercial developments. This is especially true around the newly redeveloped and highly popular Union Station area in Denver’s LoDo (Lower Downtown) neighborhood. What used to be open land, parking lots, warehouses and rail yards as recently as {{the turn of the century}} is now several city blocks of new residential and commercial buildings as well as a new RTD underground bus terminal, rail platforms/pavilions and a park. There are also improved pedestrian friendly connections to the RiNo (River North), Five Points, Auraria and Highland neighborhoods from the new development. Historic Union Station itself has been fully renovated and turned back into a travel and activity hub. It now includes the Denver Amtrak station, a new boutique hotel and several restaurants, bars & shops all centered on the large Great Hall inside and a public plaza outside along Wynkoop Street. Starting in April 2016 the University of Colorado A-Line <b>commuter</b> <b>train</b> began service directly connecting Union Station and downtown Denver to Denver International Airport and the airport's new 500+ room Westin Hotel & conference center.|$|E
5|$|The {{high winds}} knocked down trees and power lines across Long Island, New York, leaving roughly 170,000residents without electricity. Power crews from Pennsylvania {{were called in}} to assist in {{restoring}} electricity. Damage across the island reached $8million, of which $3million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach. One person was killed in New York when a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds and fell on her. An estimated 36,000residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost power. President Ford later declared Nassau, Suffolk, and Rensselaer counties major disaster areas. Effects were similar in Connecticut where approximately 247,000people lost electricity. <b>Commuter</b> <b>train</b> service along Conrail's New York–New Haven line was canceled due to power outages. A portion of the Merritt Parkway was closed due to downed trees. High winds in Bridgeport toppled many trees and power lines, shattered windows, and sparked two house fires. Five boats in the city's harbor sustained damage. Flooding in and around Danbury prompted evacuations of an apartment complex and motel. One fatality took place in Barkhamsted due to slippery roads. Overall damage in Connecticut was far less than expected, according to state police, with losses reaching $7.1million and mostly stemming from Fairfield and New Haven counties. Power companies brought in additional personnel to expedite the restoration process, though many remained in the dark days after the storm. A couple and their two dogs in Vernon died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator on August14.|$|E
