40|$|New {{telephone}} {{features and}} their increasingly complex interactions {{with one another}} requires better performance from Telecommunication Switching systems. Since <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> is the most computationally expensive task in a switch, multi-processor systems are being considered for the <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> cores of many commercial switch architectures. In this thesis, the design criteria for such a <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> system have been generated and analyzed. A new approach, the heterogeneous linear pipelined array is proposed and compared with a common load sharing architecture. The linear pipelined array has been simulated using a detailed Verilog Hardware Description Language model, to further verify its suitability for <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> applications. Several fixed assignment schemes and three simple heuristic assignment schemes have been simulated and the resulting throughput and processor utilizations has been studied. A semi-static approach has been tested, where an optimal schedule is determined based on the relative quantities of calls in specific states. The performance of the array for the <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> task is shown, {{for a variety of}} cases, to be dependent on the degree of load balancing which can be achieved in the array {{and the extent to which}} processing bottlenecks can be avoided. The results for the semi-static schedules are significantly better than for the fixed schemes. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|Scheduling {{of staff}} between {{answering}} incoming <b>calls</b> and <b>processing</b> paper-work {{has been a}} continual problem in telephone company Business Offices. A staff scheduling system has been developed and implemented in Bell Canada on a trial basis. Incoming call load data are recorded automatically and are entered daily into a time share computer terminal. The next day's forecast, by half hour, is made by a cyclic exponential smoothing routine {{and the number of}} servers required to take calls is calculated using a queueing model of the Business Office. A schedule of call answering periods for the available staff to match the requirements is made using a heuristic algorithm. Managers are able to choose their objective on the accessibility of the office to incoming <b>customer</b> <b>calls</b> and the staff can organize their work day without unplanned interruptions. ...|$|R

40|$|Many telco {{analytics}} require maintaining call profiles {{based on}} recent <b>customer</b> <b>call</b> patterns. Such call profiles are typically organized as aggregations computed at different time scales over the recent <b>customer</b> interactions. <b>Customer</b> <b>call</b> profiles are key inputs for analytics targeted at improving operations, marketing, {{and sales of}} telco providers. Many of these analytics require clustering <b>customer</b> <b>call</b> profiles, so that <b>customers</b> with similar <b>calling</b> patterns can be modeled as a group. Example applications include optimizing tariffs, customer segmentation, and usage forecasting. In this demo, we present our system for scalable aggregate profile clustering in a streaming setting. We focus on managing anonymized segments of customers for tariff optimization. Due to {{the large number of}} customers, maintaining profile clusters have high processing and memory resource requirements. In order to tackle this problem, we apply distributed stream processing. However, in the presence of distributed state, it is a major challenge to partition the profiles over machines (nodes) such that memory and computation balance is maintained, while keeping the clustering accuracy high. Furthermore, to adapt to potentially changing <b>customer</b> <b>calling</b> patterns, the partitioning of profiles to machines should be continuously revised, yet one should minimize the migration of profiles so as not to disturb the online processing of updates. We provide a re-partitioning technique that achieves all these goals. We keep micro-cluster summaries at each node, collect these summaries at a centralize node, and use a greedy algorithm with novel affinity heuristics to revise the partitioning. We present a demo that showcases our Storm and Hbase based implementation of the proposed solution {{in the context of a}} customer segmentation application. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Effective {{management}} of large-scale cellular data networks {{is critical to}} meet customer demands and expectations. <b>Customer</b> <b>calls</b> for technical support provide direct indication as to the problems customers encounter. In this paper, we study the customer tickets –free-textrecordingsandclassificationsby customer support agents – collected at a large cellular network provider, with two inter-related goals: i) to characterize and understand the major factors which lead to <b>customers</b> to <b>call</b> and seek support; and ii) to utilize such customer tickets to help identify potential network problems. For this purpose, we develop a novel statistical approach to model <b>customer</b> <b>call</b> rates which account for customer-side factors (e. g., user tenure and handset types) and geo-locations. We show that most calls are due to customer-side factors and can be well captured by the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that location-specific deviations from the model provide a good indicator of potential network-side issues. I...|$|R
