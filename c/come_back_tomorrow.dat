After he leaves, Jill goes to the {{bathroom}} to look at the mess that Max made, and he suddenly appears behind her. He claims that the door was unlocked and that he was just bringing in her groceries, since he had noticed they were in a heavy box. This basic pattern of Max's odd, slightly ominous behavior recurs and expands throughout the film. He keeps finding excuses to visit the apartment, and his work in the bathroom only makes a bigger mess each time. Because Brian never sees Max, he dismisses Jill's concerns out of hand. In one shot, Max patiently waits in his car for Brian to leave before heading up to the apartment.|$|E
50|$|Recording on “Ventilator Blues” {{began in}} late 1971. The Stones chose {{to record the}} {{majority}} of the song deep in the poorly ventilated basement of Richards’ home in the south of France, Villa Nellcôte. A well-known feature of the songs recorded in that basement for Exile was the tendency of the heat to distort the guitar's strings and the close atmosphere lending the songs a distinct, albeit undefined, sound. Richards said, “On ‘Ventilator Blues’ we got some weird sound of something that had gone wrong - some valve or tube that had gone. If something was wrong you just forgot about it. You'd leave it alone and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>tomorrow</b> and hope it had fixed itself. Or give it a good kick.” Recording concluded in the early months of 1972 at Los Angeles' Sunset Sound Studios.|$|E

With the story concluded, Grandpa reveals that he has completely forgotten everything he has just related because of his senility. Ferb closes the episode saying that [...] "platypus monsters are the only monsters to lay eggs." ...|$|E
