40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a large {{ceramics}} structure composed by <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> used for rolls in molten zinc. The ceramics roll may provide a longer life and reduce the cost for the maintenance because of large heat resistance and large wear resistance. However, the small toughness of ceramics may cause fracture {{because of the large}} thermal stress when the roll is dipping into the molten zinc. Moreover, since the shaft and the sleeve are connected by <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting,</b> they may separate each other under high temperature when dipping into the molten metal. In this paper, therefore, the thermal stress as well as separation is considered when the ceramics roll is composed by <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> by the application of the finite volume method (FVM) and finite element method (FEM).

In this study therefore the finite element analysis is applied to simulate this behavior. Then, the coming out behavior during rotation can be realized by the simulation where the rotation of the roller is replaced by the shift of the load at an interval of the rotation angle.

40|$|The {{ceramics}} roller can {{to be used}} in {{the heating}} furnace because of high temperature resistance. The roller consists of ceramics sleeve and steel shaft connected by <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting.</b> Since ceramics is brittle, it should be noted that only low <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> ratio can be applied for the connection. Therefore, coming out of the shaft from the sleeve during rotation should be investigated in this study. In this study, the finite element analysis is applied to simulate this phenomenon. In the previous study, mechanism of coming out has been considered by using 3 -D model. However, since 3 -D model analysis needs large computational time, only small number of cycle can be considered, and therefore, the coming out phenomenon cannot be predicted easily. In this research, the 2 -D plate model approach is proposed in order to reduce computational time, considering the upper and lower alternate load, repeatedly. Then, the effects of the magnitude of the load and <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> ratio are investigated systematically.

40|$|Many {{different}} {{hub assembly}} procedures have been utilized {{over the years}} in bascule bridge construction. The first assembly procedure (AP 1) involves <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> a trunnion component into a hub, followed by the <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> of the entire trunnion-hub (TH) assembly into the girder of the bridge. The second assembly procedure (AP 2) involves <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> the hub component first into the girder, then <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> the trunnion component into the hub-girder (HG) assembly. The final assembly procedure uses a warm <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> process whereby induction coils are placed on the girder of the bridge and heat is applied until sufficient thermal expansion of the girder hole allows for insertion of the hub component. All three assembly procedures use a cooling method at some stage of the assembly procedure to contract components to allow the insertion of one part into the next Occasionally, during these cooling and heating procedures, cracks can develop in the material due to the large thermal shock and subsequent thermal stresses. Previous works conducted a formal design of experiments analysis on AP 1 to determine the overall effect of various factors on the critical design parameters, overall minimum stress ratio (OMSR) and overall minimum critical crack length (OMCCL). This work focuses on conducting a formal design of experiments analysis on AP 1, AP 2 and AP 3 using the same cooling methods and parameters as in previous studies with the addition of the bridge size as a factor in the experiment. The use of the medium bridge size in AP 1 yields the largest OMCCL values of any bridge and the second largest OMSR values. The large bridge size has the largest OMSR values versus all factors for AP 1. The OMCCL and OMSR increases for every bridge size with an increase in the alpha ratio for AP 1. The smallest bridge showed the largest OMCCL and OMSR values for every cooling method and every alpha ratio for AP 2 and AP 3. The OMCCL and OMSR decrease for every bridge size with an increase in the alpha ratio for AP 2 and AP 3...|$|R

However, under larger <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> ratio the shaft does not come out although care should be taken for the risk of sleeve fracture due to the larger thermal expansion of steel shaft.

A common method used in industry is the use of induction <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> which refers to the use of induction heating technology to pre-heat metal components between 150˚C and 300˚C thereby causing them to expand and allow for the insertion or removal of another component.

40|$|Ceramic rollers {{can be used}} in {{the heating}} furnace {{conveniently}} because of its high temperature resistance. The new roller consists of ceramic sleeve and steel shaft connected only under a small <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> ratio because of the brittleness. In the previous study, simulation of coming out of the shaft from the sleeve was performed, but only small number of loading cycle can be considered because of large computational time. To analyze the coming out problem more efficiently, in this paper, the two-dimensional shrink fitted structures are considered. Then, the effects of the magnitude of load and <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> ratio are investigated under large number of loading cycle. Finally, the coming out mechanism is discussed for larger number of cycles by focusing on the shear stress and displacement at the joint end.

Cast {{iron and}} steel {{conveying}} rollers used in hot rolling mills must be changed very frequently because conveyed strips with high temperature induces wear on the roller surface in short periods.

This work presents a 2 -D FE-analysis of the mechanical stresses due to <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting,</b> centrifugal forces and the magnetic forces in a 4 -pole, 3 -phase synchronous reluctance machine at rated frequency of 50 Hz. The stresses due to <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> and centrifugal forces were computed by solid mechanics method, while the stresses due to magnetic forces were computed using both magnetic field method and solid mechanics method. The total mechanical stress distributions from all stress sources were obtained using a weakly coupled approach.

The centrifugal forces also contribute to the total tensile stress of the rotor core. The magnetic forces have the least effect on the total stress distribution of the machine. The combined stresses obtained are mostly tensile at the rotor core and compressive at most part of the stator yoke, while the stator teeth were under low tensile stress due to the magnetic forces. The presence of flux barriers between flux paths at the rotor core causes large stresses to distribute at the bridge between flux barriers near the fit interface.

Steel {{conveying}} rollers used in {{hot rolling}} mills must be exchanged very frequently at great cost because hot conveyed strips induce wear {{on the surface}} of roller in short periods. In this study, new roller structure is considered which has a ceramics sleeve connected with two short steel shafts at both ends by <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting.</b> Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide longer life and reduces the cost for the maintenance.

In this paper, finite element method analysis is applied to the structure and thermal stress has been calculated with the varying dimensions of the structure. Also several effects on thermal stress have been investigated, such as the effect of <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> ratio, outside diameter, the fitted length, thickness of shaft, materials an so on.

5000|$|The final panel {{fabrication}} process, after {{achieving the}} correct surface contour, {{is some kind}} of edge treatment, such as flanging (sheet metal) or wire edging. This finishes and strengthens the edge. Typically, there is {{too much or too little}} metal in the flange, which pulls the panel out of shape after the flange is turned—so it must be stretched or shrunk to correct the surface shape. This is most easily done using Eckold shrinking and stretching, but can be done using heat <b>shrinking</b> or <b>cold</b> <b>shrinking,</b> by tucking and beating the tucked metal into itself, or by using a <b>cold</b> <b>shrinking</b> hammer and dolly. Stretching or shrinking the flange requires a correct profile hammer and dolly. The hammer and dolly must match the desired flange shape at the point of contact through the flange, (known as ringing the dolly) with the hammer. A lot of shrinking or stretching work hardens the flange and can cause cracks and tears. While these can be welded, it is much better to anneal the metal before this happens to restore its workability.|$|R

50|$|Induction <b>shrink</b> <b>fitting</b> {{refers to}} the use of {{induction}} heater technology to pre-heat metal components between 150 C and 300 C thereby causing them to expand and allow for the insertion or removal of another component. Typically the lower temperature range is used on metals such as aluminium and higher temperatures are used on metals such as low/medium carbon steels. The process avoids the changing of mechanical properties whilst allowing components to be worked. Metals typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed as a coefficient of thermal expansion.|$|R
