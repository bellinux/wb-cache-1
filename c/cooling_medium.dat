This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a <b>cooling</b> <b>medium,</b> whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E
25|$|The common medium {{used for}} heat {{distribution}} is water or pressurized hot water, but steam is also used. The advantage of steam {{is that in}} addition to heating purposes it can be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature. The disadvantage of steam is a higher heat loss due to the high temperature. Also, the thermal efficiency of cogeneration plants is significantly lower if the <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> is high-temperature steam, reducing electric power generation. Heat transfer oils are generally not used for district heating, although they have higher heat capacities than water, as they are expensive and have environmental issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalyst}} protonates the Alkenes (Propene, Butene) {{to produce}} reactive carbocations, which Alkylate Isobutane. The reaction {{is carried out}} at mild temperatures (0 and 30nbsp&°C) in a two-phase reaction. Because the reaction is exothermic, cooling is needed: SAAU plants require lower temperatures so the <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> needs to be chilled, for HFAU normal refinery cooling water will suffice. It {{is important to keep}} a high ratio of Isobutane to Alkene at the point of reaction to prevent side reactions which produces a lower octane product, so the plants have a high recycle of Isobutane back to feed. The phases separate spontaneously, so the acid phase is vigorously mixed with the hydrocarbon phase to create sufficient contact surface.|$|E

40|$|With the {{worldwide}} development {{of nuclear power}} plant and requirement of saving energy and resource, high thermal efficiency and economical competitiveness are achieved by using supercritical COR 2 R with spe-cial thermal properties and better flow and heat transfer characters. In this paper, heat transfer of supercritical COR 2 R has been investigated in square and triangle array tube-bundle of cooled system in reactor using com-putational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT, and the basic knowledge of heat transfer of supercritical COR 2 R and first experience of CFD simulation are obtained. The effect of mesh structures, turbulence models, as well as flow channel size is analyzed. The choice of turbulence model adopted in simulating supercritical COR 2 R is recommended.

40|$|AbstractIn this work, an {{experimental}} investigation through mathematical modeling {{was carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} different <b>cooling</b> <b>mediums</b> and cutting parameters on surface roughness during turning of hardened AISI 52100 steel (60 - 62 HRC). Experiments were performed using PVD-coated nanolaminated TiSiN-TiAlN carbide tool under dry, with water-based and coconut oil-based cutting fluids. Experimental observations indicate that hard turning under dry condition produced lower values of surface roughness. However, at higher cutting speeds hard turning using coconut oil showed lower values of surface roughness. The coconut oil also found to be more effective in lowering surface roughness at higher values of feed and depth of cut. It has been observed that the surface roughness gets affected mostly by feed and increased when cutting speed exceeds 150 - 160 m/min irrespective of the <b>cooling</b> <b>mediums</b> used. However, this effect can be seen as more prominent when turning under dry cutting conditions...|$|R
25|$|By-products {{of thermal}} power plant {{operation}} {{must be considered in}} their design and operation. Waste heat energy, which remains due to the finite efficiency of the Carnot, Rankine, or Diesel power cycle, is released directly to the atmosphere or river/lake water, or indirectly to the atmosphere using a cooling tower with river or lake water used as a <b>cooling</b> <b>medium.</b> The flue gas from combustion of the fossil fuels is discharged to the air. This gas contains carbon dioxide and water vapor, as well as other substances such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), mercury, traces of other metals, and, for coal-fired plants, fly ash. Solid waste ash from coal-fired boilers must also be removed. Some coal ash can be recycled for building materials.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat sink}} is {{designed}} to maximize its surface area {{in contact with the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or thermal grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium is used in applications where weight is a big concern.|$|E
25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to milk quality is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates to remove heat from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk milk cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E

2500|$|The river also {{provides}} cooling {{water for the}} coal/natural gas fired thermal power station at Huntly. The power station uses river water as a <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> for the old steam units, which means that large quantities of warm water is returned to the river.
