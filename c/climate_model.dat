25|$|In the 1960s, Mikhail Budyko, a Russian climatologist, {{developed}} a simple energy-balance <b>climate</b> <b>model</b> {{to investigate the}} effect of ice cover on global climate. Using this model, Budyko found that if ice sheets advanced far enough out of the polar regions, a feedback loop ensued where the increased reflectiveness (albedo) of the ice led to further cooling {{and the formation of}} more ice, until the entire Earth was covered in ice and stabilized in a new ice-covered equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to climate}} change for the past millennium, even the {{smallest}} exchange modeled would plunge the planet into temperatures colder than the Little Ice Age (the period of history between approximately A.D. 1600 and A.D. 1850). This would take effect instantly, and agriculture would be severely threatened. Larger amounts of smoke would produce larger climate changes, and for the 150 teragrams (Tg) producing a true nuclear winter (1 Tg is 1012 grams), making agriculture impossible for years. In both cases, new <b>climate</b> <b>model</b> simulations show that the effects would last {{for more than a}} decade.|$|E
25|$|For example, when <b>climate</b> <b>model</b> {{simulations}} {{of the last}} century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. When human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years (see graph, opposite). The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.|$|E

25|$|A minor {{nuclear war}} with each country using 50 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs as air-bursts on urban areas could produce climate change {{unprecedented}} in recorded human history.

The climatic effects of the smoke from burning cities and industrial areas would last for several years, much longer than previously thought.

25|$|For over a decade, {{one aspect}} of the climate change story seemed to show a {{significant}} difference between models and observations. In the tropics, all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. Observations from weather balloons, satellites, and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). This issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. It is now largely resolved. Research showed that there were large uncertainties in the satellite and weather balloon data. When uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with <b>climate</b> <b>model</b> results.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} {{numerical}} weather prediction began in the 1920s {{through the efforts of}} Lewis Fry Richardson, who used procedures originally developed by Vilhelm Bjerknes to produce by hand a six-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. [...] It was not until the advent of the computer and computer simulations that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself. The ENIAC was used to create the first weather forecasts via computer in 1950, based on a highly simplified approximation to the atmospheric governing equations. In 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby's group at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used the same model to produce the first operational forecast (i.e., a routine prediction for practical use). Operational {{numerical weather prediction}} in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. [...] In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere; this became the first successful <b>climate</b> <b>model.</b> Following Phillips' work, several groups began working to create general circulation models. [...] The first general circulation <b>climate</b> <b>model</b> that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.|$|E

40|$|We {{quantify}} the agreement between permafrost distributions from PMIP 2 (Paleoclimate <b>Modeling</b> Intercomparison Project) <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> and permafrost data. We evaluate {{the ability of}} several <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> to represent permafrost and assess the inter-variability between them. Studying an heterogeneous variable such as permafrost implies to conduct analysis at a smaller spatial scale compared with <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> resolution. Our approach consists in applying statistical downscaling methods (SDMs) on large- or regional-scale atmospheric variables provided by <b>climate</b> <b>models,</b> leading to local permafrost modelling. Among the SDMs, we first choose a transfer function approach based on Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to produce high-resolution climatology of surface air temperature (SAT). Then, we define permafrost distribution over Eurasia by SAT conditions. In a first validation step on present climate (CTRL period), GAM shows some limitations with non-systemic improvements {{in comparison with the}} large-scale fields. So, we develop an alternative method of statistical downscaling based on a stochastic generator approach through a Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), which directly models the probabilities of local permafrost indices. The obtained permafrost distributions appear in a better agreement with data. In both cases, the provided local information reduces the inter-variability between <b>climate</b> <b>models.</b> Nevertheless, this also proves that a simple relationship between permafrost and the SAT only is not always sufficient to represent local permafrost. Finally, we apply each method on a very different climate, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) time period, in order to {{quantify the}} ability of <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> to represent LGM permafrost. Our SDMs do not significantly improve permafrost distribution and do not reduce the inter-variability between <b>climate</b> <b>models,</b> at this period. We show that LGM permafrost distribution from <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> strongly depends on large-scale SAT. The differences with LGM data, larger than in the CTRL period, reduce the contribution of downscaling and depend on several factors deserving further studies...|$|R
