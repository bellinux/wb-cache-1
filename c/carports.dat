25|$|In March 2008, GM {{announced}} a recall on all 1997–2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) {{due to a}} problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM {{sent a letter to}} the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or <b>carports</b> until the problem was resolved. The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) valve cover gasket, as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.|$|E

MSU also owns 44 non-campus properties, totaling [...] in 28 different counties.In early 2017, construction of a $22.5 million solar project began at five parking lots on campus. <b>Carports</b> with solar arrays will be built, generating about 5 percent of the electricity used on campus annually.|$|E
500|$|The older {{neighborhoods of}} the early 20th century, such as West Central, East Central, Logan, Hillyard, {{and much of the}} lower South Hill, feature a large {{concentration}} of American Craftsman style bungalows. In Hillyard, the most architecturally intact neighborhood in Spokane, 85 percent of these buildings are historic. As the city expanded mainly to the north {{in the middle of the}} 20th century, the bungalows in the [...] "minimal traditional" [...] style commonplace from the 1930s to the 1950s tend to predominate in the Northwest, North Hill, and Bemiss neighborhoods. This architectural style occupies the neighborhoods where the integrity of Spokane's street grid pattern is largely intact (especially the areas north of downtown and south of Francis Ave.), and the houses have backyard alleys for <b>carports,</b> deliveries, and refuse collection. Contemporary suburbs and architecture are prevalent at the north and south edges of Spokane as well as in the new Kendall Yards neighborhood north of downtown.|$|E

Despite effects in adjacent counties, there was minimal damage in Charlotte County. In Lee County, tropical storm force winds damaged roofs, awnings, and lanais at nine homes; winds also toppled several large trees and branches, and downed power lines across Cape Coral and Fort Myers. A tornado rated F1 on the Fujita scale touched down near Sanibel. It caused extensive damage to two condominium complexes, and 24nearby homes. Further along its path, the tornado damaged a few other homes and <b>carports,</b> while also toppling or spanning palm trees. Gordon also spawned two tornadoes that touched down as it made landfall. One tornado touched down near Cape Coral, Florida, damaging three homes, while an F0 tornado touched down near Ponce Inlet in Volusia County, Florida, causing minimal damage, mainly to trees and roofs.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2007 {{the site}} has {{featured}} a series of solar panels covering the rooftops of eight buildings and two solar <b>carports,</b> and capable of producing 1.6 megawatts of electricity.

2500|$|The new genre, simply called [...] "underground", had {{explicit}} lyrics about drugs, violence, poverty, friendship, {{love and}} sex. These themes, depicting {{the troubles of}} inner-city life, can still be found in reggaeton. [...] "Underground" [...] music was recorded in marquesinas (Puerto Rican <b>carports)</b> and distributed in the streets on cassettes. The marquesinas were crucial {{to the development of}} Puerto Rico's underground scene because of the state's [...] "fear of losing the ability to manipulate 'taste. Marquesinas were often in public [...] "housing complexes such as Villa Kennedy and Jurutungo". Despite being recorded in housing projects, most of the marquesinas were good quality (which helped increase their popularity among Puerto Rican youth of all social classes). The availability and quality of the cassettes led to reggaeton's popularity, which crossed socioeconomic barriers in the Puerto Rican music scene. The most popular cassettes in the early 1990s were DJ Negro's The Noise I and II and DJ Playero's 37 and 38. Gerardo Cruet (who created the recordings) spread the genre from the marginalized residential areas into other sectors of society, particularly private schools.|$|E

50|$|Modern <b>carports</b> are {{typically}} made of metal (steel, tin, or aluminum) and are modular in {{style in the}} USA, while remaining flat-roofed permanent structures {{in much of the}} rest of the world. The carport is considered to be an economical method of protecting cars from the weather and sun damage. The metal <b>carports</b> in USA can be divided into Regular, Boxed-Eave, and Vertical roof styles. They differ in the sturdiness and how the roof panels are oriented.|$|E
50|$|The lodgings were {{originally}} constructed as a 14-room cabin court, an early motel-like accommodation {{in which each}} pair of rooms stood as a free-standing building with <b>carports</b> in the middle. Much as cabins and motor courts replaced the campgrounds that had served Depression-era motorists, motels with multiple rooms in one building would replace individual cabins in the 1950s. Space initially allocated to individual <b>carports</b> or open ground between cabins would soon be filled with additional rooms.|$|E
5000|$|Quoting {{from the}} Carport Integrity Policy for the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office:As early as 1909, <b>carports</b> {{were used by}} the Prairie School {{architect}} Walter Burley Griffin in his design for the Sloane House in Elmhurst, Illinois (Gebhard, 1991: 110). By 1913, <b>carports</b> were also being employed by other Prairie School architects such as the Minneapolis firm of Purcell, Feick & Elmslie in their design for a residence at Lockwood Lake, Wisconsin. In this instance, the carport was termed an [...] "Auto Space" [...] (Gebhard, 1991: 110). The late architectural historian David Gebhard suggested that the term [...] "carport" [...] originated from the feature’s use in 1930s Streamline Moderne residences (Gebhard, 1991: 107). This term, which entered popular jargon in 1939, stemmed from the visual connection between these streamlined residences and nautical imagery. In the 1930s through the 1950s, <b>carports</b> were also being used by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Usonian Houses; an idea that he probably got from Griffin, a former associate.|$|E
