40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} transparency report (TR) disclosure and determinants of TR delay, using Croatian listed companies and audit firms who audited Croatian listed companies in 2015. TR disclosure is measured using the TR index whereas the TR delay is measured as the number of days between the financial year-end and the publication date of the TR by an audit firms. We first analyzed the position and difference between audit firm indicators and types of audit firm using the following: number of <b>certified</b> <b>auditors,</b> number of employees, average net salary, total revenue, net profit, net working capital, total assets, total capital and financial ratio. Second, we used the TR index to determine the existence of TR elements and whether the audit firm made a disclosure. Finally, we used multiple regressions for modelling the TR delay as a function of the following variables: number of <b>certified</b> <b>auditors,</b> number of audits per year, return on assets and the TR index. Our results indicate that based on the TR index only 32 % audit firms are transparent. Furthermore, the TR delay is shorter when audit firms have a greater number of <b>certified</b> <b>auditors</b> and a higher TR index, i. e. when audit firms incorporate more elements into the TR...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{relation of the}} auditor choice and cost of debt financing for private SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises). In particular, it examines whether choice of a <b>certified</b> <b>auditor</b> or reputable international audit firm provides economic value to private SMEs as a factor lowering firms’information problems and cost of debt financing in the capital markets. Using timeseries crosssectional data of 832 Finnish private and limited SMEs, {{results indicate that the}} choice of an international brand name audit firm is negatively related to estimated cost of debt finance for SMEs. Results are shown to be robust to effects of relevant firmspecific characteristics, and to possible selfselection bias related to firm’s auditor choice. The reported relation between the choice of a <b>certified</b> <b>auditor</b> and cost of debt financing is negative as expected, but lacks statistical significance. 1...|$|R
30|$|Prior {{research}} already {{reveals that}} companies consciously decide to appoint their audit firm for tax services (Lassila et al. 2010; McGuire et al. 2012). Accordingly, the research design chosen may also suffer from different observable and unobservable {{factors that could}} affect the association found between tax <b>certified</b> individual <b>auditors</b> and effective tax rates. To address this issue, I regard {{at least three of}} multiple potential layers of selection biases that are likely to be related with choices of and for tax certified individual auditors: First, it is common in Germany for candidates for the state examination for <b>certified</b> <b>auditors</b> to have already qualified as chartered tax consultants. This is their individual choice and may be due to a certain kind of risk aversion in order to reduce their extent of exams in the state examination for auditors resulting in a lower risk of failure or other personal characteristics or circumstances. Therefore, being an auditor who is also tax certified may be accompanied by specific personal values of auditors like the tendency to be risk averse for instance that could lead to the revealed association instead of the individual auditor’s tax certification. Second, companies may consciously appoint their individual auditors to be tax or non-tax certified depending on the company’s operational complexity, tax strategy, or monitoring strength since some prior studies already reveal that these aspects are related to firms retaining their auditors to provide tax services (Lassila et al. 2010; McGuire et al. 2012). Companies could be aware of the auditor’s professional responsibility and concern about his/her reputation leading to corporations having higher effective tax rates. Companies could consciously choose tax <b>certified</b> individual <b>auditors</b> in attempts to create more perceived auditor independence and to deal with the risk of being detected by tax authorities. And finally, also specific audit firms may hire tax <b>certified</b> <b>auditors</b> more likely or tax <b>certified</b> <b>auditors</b> may select into specific audit firms that are bigger or more specialized than others.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{identify}} and analyze the perceptions of college and university auditors concerning the importance of selected factors associated with operational auditing. The secondary purpose was to determine whether the perceptions of <b>certified</b> <b>auditors</b> differ significantly from those of noncertified auditors. Selected factors associated with operational auditing for colleges and universities were categorized in three attribute groups—organizational, personal, and environmental. The identification of organizational and personal attributes was based mainly on concepts set forth in the Standard for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing published by the Institute of Internal Auditors (1978). Identification of environmental attributes was based on a review of the relevant literature, as well as on discussions with selected college and university auditors. Each attribute, whether categorized as organizational, personal, or environmental, was used as a basis for the identification of detailed factors associated with operational auditing. The findings of this study reveal that factors dealing with organizational attributes were perceived as considerably more favorable than were factors dealing with personal or environmental attributes. With regard to the secondary purpose of this research, a total of 14 hypotheses were developed and subjected to t-tests to determine whether the perceptions of <b>certified</b> <b>auditors</b> differed significantly from those of noncertified auditors. Of the 14 hypotheses tested, there were no significant differences between perceptions of the two groups concerning the importance of independence, audit plan, audit program, audit supervision, continuing education, training, audit follow-up, objectivity, technical competence, experience, and interpersonal skills. <b>Certified</b> <b>auditors</b> perceived attributes that deal with audit report and professional certification to be more important to operational auditing than did their noncertified counterparts. With regard to the importance of a knowledge and understanding of the higher education environment (i. e., knowledge of characteristics uniquely identifiable with institutions of higher education) to operational auditing, <b>certified</b> <b>auditors</b> perceived this attribute less favorably than did noncertified auditors...|$|R
40|$|The {{accounting}} and auditing {{business has been}} {{claimed to be a}} gendered industry.

Earlier research has indicated that this selection process starts early on the career ladder. In this paper we investigate the gendered character of the early phase of qualification to become <b>certified</b> <b>auditor.</b> We offer a set of hypotheses that predict certification time, with special emphasis on the gendered character of the factors. We test the hypotheses on the population of newly <b>certified</b> <b>auditors</b> in Sweden. The results indicate that there are differences between the sexes, but that the factor even out each other, implying no important difference in certification time. We conclude that there is a slight gendered career rein. A rather depressing result is that our model could explain more of male than female certification time, thus implying that even the theory offered is gendered...|$|R

30|$|In Germany, {{becoming}} a <b>certified</b> <b>auditor</b> (comparable to a CPA) requires passing an exam on four topics: auditing, business administration, commercial law, and taxation. The state examination for auditors enables auditors, once qualified, to advise non-listed corporate clients on various issues including taxation. However, {{it is common}} practice for auditors to also take a state examination specifically for taxation {{so they can be}} fully certified chartered tax consultants. This particular exam goes beyond tax issues dealt with in the state examination for auditors and is very challenging. The failure rate regularly lies at around 50 %. This exam {{can be seen as a}} further education of auditors that broadens individual auditors’ knowledge and allows to differentiate among auditors. Consequently, since this tax certification expands the knowledge acquired with the audit examination, audit exam candidates who have already passed the state examination for chartered tax consultants are permitted to bypass the exam on taxation. However, candidates for the state examination for chartered tax consultants who are already <b>certified</b> <b>auditors</b> may only bypass the accounting portion of the state examination for tax consultants.|$|R

30|$|I conduct several {{additional}} tests {{to examine the}} robustness of my results also because StB shows no association with ETR. I conduct analyses to control for companies’ complexity, their selection for (non) tax <b>certified</b> individual <b>auditors,</b> and the selection of individual auditors to become tax consultants or not. I also run a time-series based change analysis for tax <b>certified</b> individual <b>auditor</b> changes when the engaged audit firm remains to be the same. Further, I integrate additional variables that may moderate the effects of tax certification with knowledge spillover effects (e.g., tax confirmation services, and local tax authorities’ enforcement strength). In that regard, further tests reveal that the association of tax <b>certified</b> individual <b>auditors</b> is complemented by the provision of tax confirmation services leading {{to higher levels of}} reported effective tax rates. This finding is in line with prior evidence and confirms that audit teams benefit from client-specific knowledge of tax teams (Christensen et al. 2015; Kinney et al. 2004). In other analyses, I run tests on individual auditor involvement by limiting the sample depending on company size and individual financial statements according to German GAAP of the parent companies. The results given by moderations with company size show more pronounced associations between tax <b>certified</b> individual <b>auditors</b> and cash effective tax rates the bigger corporate clients are. When individual parent company financial statements according to German GAAP are regarded the association with tax <b>certified</b> individual <b>auditors</b> is found to be even stronger.|$|R

First, it briefly summarizes the history of auditing throughout the world and in the Czech Republic. It analyses the meaning and objectives of the statutory audit and explains the triangular relationship between the auditor, management of the entity and its owners. The description of a typical course of assurance engagement is accompanied by cautionary advice for intricate aspects of acceptance of an audit engagement and the preparation of engagement letter. Attention is paid to materiality levels used during the statutory audit and to the expression that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the entity. Different types of auditor's report are distinguished and a variety of errors frequently made not only by users of financial statements from the common public but also by experts participating in management of audited entities is mentioned as well. The three chapters dealing with auditor's liability discuss the civil, disciplinary and criminal issues related to assurance activities. As regards auditors' civil [...] ...|$|R
