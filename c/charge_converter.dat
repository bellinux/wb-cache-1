40|$|In this {{technical}} note, {{we address}} the {{comments on the}} energy estimates for Magnetoelectric Spin-orbit (MESO) Logic, a new logic device proposed by the authors. We provide an analytical derivation of the switching energy, and support it with time-domain circuit simulations using a self-consistent ferroelectric (FE) compact model. While the energy to charge a capacitor is dissipated in the interconnect and transistor resistance, we note that the energy to switch a capacitor and a FE is independent of the interconnect resistance value to the first order. Also device design can mitigate the parasitic energy losses. We further show the circuit simulations for a sub 10 aJ switching operation of a MESO logic device comprehending: a) Energy stored in multiferroic; b) Energy dissipation in {{the resistance of the}} interconnect, Ric; c) Energy dissipation in the inverse spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) spin to <b>charge</b> <b>converter</b> Risoc; d) Supply, ground resistance, and transistor losses. We also identify the requirements for the resistivity of the spin-orbit coupling materials and address the effect of internal resistance of the spin to charge conversion layer.

40|$|IEEE Hybrid {{electric}} bus (HEB) {{presents an}} emerging solution to {{exhaust gas emissions}} in urban transport. This paper proposes a multiport bidirectional switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive for solar-assisted HEB (SHEB) powertrain, which not only improves the motoring performance, but also achieves flexible charging functions. To extend the driving miles and achieve self-charging ability, photovoltaic (PV) panels are installed on the bus to decrease the reliance on fuels/batteries and charging stations. A bidirectional front-end circuit with a PV-fed circuit is designed to integrate electrical components into one converter. Six driving and five charging modes are achieved. The dc voltage is boosted by the battery in generator control unit (GCU) driving mode and by the charge capacitor in battery driving mode, where the torque capability is improved. Usually, an extra dc-dc converter is needed to achieve battery charging. In this paper, the battery can be directly charged by the demagnetization current in GCU or PV driving mode, and can be quickly charged by the PV panels and GCU/AC grids at SHEB standstill condition, by utilizing the traction motor windings and converter circuit, without external <b>charging</b> <b>converters.</b> Experiments on a three-phase 12 / 8 SRM confirm {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed drive and control scheme...|$|R
