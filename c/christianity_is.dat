50|$|<b>Christianity</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} to Japan during its feudal era by Saint Francis Xavier in 1550. From the beginning, <b>Christianity</b> <b>was</b> {{seen as a}} threat to the power of the Shogun. In 1643, <b>Christianity</b> <b>was</b> banned, all churches were destroyed, all known Christians tortured and demanded to convert to Buddhism or face execution, and all signs of Christian influence were systematically eliminated.

At the time of the 2001 UK census the population of the East Riding was 314,113 and its ethnic composition was 96.80% white, compared with the English average of 90.92%. The area has a slightly higher elderly population, of 24.0% in 2008, than the national average.|$|E
5|$|For the French Byzantinologist Gilbert Dagron, Philip's <b>Christianity</b> <b>is</b> a legend—albeit a {{very old}} one—that intended, in a Late Roman/Early Byzantine context, to foster {{the idea of a}} Roman Empire that was Christian almost from the beginning, thereby melding Roman Imperial {{ideology}} and Christianism, and therefore offering a base for other later legends showing Roman emperors, beginning with Augustus , to be aware and/or sympathetic to Christian revelation, forming a legendary corpus that was brought together during the 6th century by the chronicler John Malalas.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012 census most islanders {{identified}} themselves as Christian (66 percent), followed by those who had no religious affiliation (32 percent).

50|$|Alfonsi never {{directly}} {{made this}} claim, but rather wanted his readers {{to think that}} <b>Christianity</b> <b>was</b> correct, and that opposing religions would work together before ever conceding that <b>Christianity</b> <b>was</b> the valid choice. He wanted the readers to believe that Judaism is only interested in disproving Christianity, and would even defend Islam if necessary. This was an effective method, because the readers of the Dialogi were Christians, and they would assume that since <b>Christianity</b> <b>was</b> correct, all other “false” religions would work together for the downfall of Christianity.|$|R

5|$|Many major {{religions}} {{are represented in}} Dayton. <b>Christianity</b> <b>is</b> represented in Dayton by dozens of denominations and their respective churches.

5|$|Why Æthelberht {{chose to}} convert to <b>Christianity</b> <b>is</b> uncertain. Bede {{suggests}} that the king converted strictly for religious reasons, but most modern historians see other motives behind Æthelberht's decision. Certainly, given Kent's close contacts with Gaul, {{it is possible that}} Æthelberht sought baptism in order to smooth his relations with the Merovingian kingdoms, or to align himself with one of the factions then contending in Gaul. Another consideration may have been that new methods of administration often followed conversion, whether directly from the newly introduced church or indirectly from other Christian kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|After some time, Rodrigues is {{eventually}} taken {{to meet an}} older Ferreira. Ferreira says he committed apostasy while being tortured, and states that after 15 years {{in the country and}} a year in the temple, he believes <b>Christianity</b> <b>is</b> futile in Japan. Rodrigues repudiates him, but Ferreira is implacable. That night in his prison cell, Rodrigues hears five Christians being tortured. Ferreira tells him that they have already apostatized; it is his apostasy the Japanese demand. As Rodrigues looks upon a fumi-e, he hears an inner voice of Christ giving him permission to step on it, and he does.|$|E
50|$|Alexis de Tocqueville {{believed}} that <b>Christianity</b> <b>was</b> {{the source of}} the basic principles of liberal democracy, and the only religion capable of maintaining liberty in a democratic era. He was keenly aware of the mutual hatred between Christians and liberals in 19th-century France, rooted in the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. In France, <b>Christianity</b> <b>was</b> allied with the Old Regime before 1789 and the reactionary Bourbon Restoration of 1815-30. However he said <b>Christianity</b> <b>was</b> not antagonistic to democracy in the United States, where it was a bulwark against dangerous tendencies toward individualism and materialism, which would lead to atheism and tyranny.|$|R

5|$|<b>Christianity</b> <b>is</b> the {{official}} religion in Zambia {{according to the}} Constitution of Zambia.

In 2010, according to World Christian Trends, 85.5 per cent of the population were identified as Christian, 11.2 per cent with indigenous religions, 1.8 per cent as Bahá'í, 1.1 per cent as Muslim, 0.2 per cent as agnostic, 0.1 per cent as Hindu, and all other groups accounted for less than 0.1 per cent. The 2010 Zambian census found that 75.3 per cent of Zambians were Protestant, 20.2 per cent were Catholic, 0.5 per cent were Muslim, 2.0 per cent followed other religions, and 1.8 per cent had no religion.|$|E

This Celtic Church was gradually joined to the Catholic hierarchy following the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by StAugustine.

5|$|John Chrysostom, deacon at Antioch from 381, {{was made}} priest in 386. As a special distinction, his bishop, Flavian, {{decided that he}} should preach in the city's {{principal}} church. Chrysostom's contribution to the literature on Philip and <b>Christianity</b> <b>is</b> a homily on Babylas, a martyr-bishop who died in 253, during the Decian persecution. The treatise was composed about 382, when John was a deacon, and forms part of Chrysostom's corpus of panegyrics. Chrysostom's Babylas confronts an emperor; and, since Chrysostom {{is more interested in}} the bishop than his opponent, the emperor goes unnamed. He has since been identified with Philip.|$|E
5|$|Philip the Arab {{was one of}} the few 3rd-century Roman {{emperors}} {{sympathetic to}} Christians, although his relationship with <b>Christianity</b> <b>is</b> obscure and controversial. Philip was born in Auranitis, an Arab district east of the Sea of Galilee. The urban and Hellenized centers of the region were Christianized in the early years of the 3rd century via major Christian centers at Bosra and Edessa; there is little evidence of Christian presence in the small villages of the region in this period, such as Philip's birthplace at Philippopolis. Philip served as praetorian prefect, commander of the Praetorian Guard, from 242; he was made emperor in 244. In 249, after a brief civil war, he was killed at the hands of his successor, Decius.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} their connection with the afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced <b>Christianity</b> <b>is</b> controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E

5|$|Christianity in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all aspects of}} Christianity in the modern borders of Scotland in the Middle Ages. Christianity was probably introduced {{to what is now}} Lowland Scotland by Roman soldiers stationed in the north of the province of Britannia. After the collapse of Roman authority in the fifth century, <b>Christianity</b> <b>is</b> presumed to have survived among the British enclaves in the south of what is now Scotland, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced. Scotland was largely converted by Irish missions associated with figures such as St Columba, from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions founded monastic institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas. Scholars have identified a distinctive form of Celtic Christianity, in which abbots were more significant than bishops, attitudes to clerical celibacy were more relaxed and there were significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of tonsure and the method of calculating Easter, although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-seventh century. After the reconversion of Scandinavian Scotland in the tenth century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant religion of the kingdom.|$|E
