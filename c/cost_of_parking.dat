40|$|<b>Costs</b> {{to parents}} <b>of</b> hospitalised {{children}} have been extensively explored, from financial costs to psychological, social and emotional costs.

For those whose income is dependent on a low wage, or welfare, <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> such an event take up {{a larger proportion of}} an income than for families from well-to-do backgrounds. In this paper, we explore the potential impact on a family budget <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> and meals incurred during a child’s admission to hospital. To determine costs, a survey was conducted at food outlets to examine types and availability of meals, opening times, proximity to wards and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> average types of meals on offer at different facilities. <b>Costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> were determined. We took income figures for a family from the website of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). An estimate <b>of</b> the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>parking</b> to support one parent to remain with the child was at least 30 % of the average weekly family disposable income. For one-parent families, their income is significantly proportionally depleted by covering <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>parking</b> for an accompanying parent. We recommend that parents be provided with meals whilst staying with their hospitalised child; that provision be made to allow families to eat together and that free parking be made available to all parents...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to 1984, the IRS treated free {{employee}} parking, {{provided by}} an employer, as a tax-free fringe benefit {{regardless of the}} value of the parking. [...] There was no tax-free benefit for transit commuting. This parking subsidy served as an incentive, in some cases a significant incentive, to drive to work even in areas where there was a good transit alternative. Many believed that such subsidies contributed to the growing congestion on the highways. In one study conducted in the New York City metro area, as many as 64% of the solo drivers commuting into Manhattan, an area well served by transit, were receiving a parking subsidy. The parking exemption was codified into law as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 when it was part of a new category of [...] "working condition fringe benefits." [...] Normally these kinds of fringe benefits referred to things that an employer provided, but would be tax-deductible if paid for by the employee. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking,</b> however, could not be deducted by employees and so employer-paid parking did not fit this definition; nonetheless, an exemption for employer-paid parking was carved out.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a stylized econometric {{model for the}} demand for on-street parking with focus on estimation of the elasticity of demand {{with respect to the}} full <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking.</b> The full <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> consists of a parking fee and the cost of searching for a vacant parking space (cruising). The cost of cruising is usually unobserved. Ignoring this issue implies a downward bias of the elasticity of demand with respect to the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> since the cost of cruising depends on the number of cars parked. We also demonstrate that, even when the cost of cruising is unobserved, the demand elasticity can be identified by extending the econometric model to include the spatial interaction between the parking facilities. We illustrate the model with on-street parking data from Copenhagen and find indications of a somewhat greater parking demand elasticity than is usually reported in the literature. ...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{planners}} typically set {{the minimum}} parking requirements for every land use {{to satisfy the}} peak demand for free parking. As a result, parking is free for 99 % of automobile trips in the United States Minimum parking requirements increase the supply and reduce the price – but not the cost – of parking. They bundle the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> spaces into the cost of development, and thereby increase the prices of all {{the goods and services}} sold at the sites that offer free parking. Cars have many external costs, but the external <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> in cities may be greater than all the other external costs combined. To prevent spillover, cities could price on-street parking rather than require off-street parking. Compared with minimum parking requirements, market prices can allocate parking spaces fairly and efficiently...|$|E

40|$|Urban areas {{increasingly}} face {{problems associated}} with traffic congestion and vehicle air emissions. Employer-paid parking—a form of matching grant whereby an employer offers to pay the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> if employees {{are willing to pay}} all other costs of driving to work—contributes to the tendency of employees to drive alone to work. In downtown Los Angeles, the average employer-paid parking subsidy is equivalent to 11 cents per mile traveled to and from work. Thus, imposing a congestion toll of 11 cents per vehicle mile traveled would raise the cost of driving to the Los Angeles CBD by only as much as employer-paid parking already lowers it. A survey of 5, 060 commuters to downtown Los Angeles was used to estimate how employer-paid parking affects transportation system performance. The results show that employer-paid parking: × increases the number of solo drivers by 44 percent; × increases parking demand by 34 percent; × increases automobile vehicle miles traveled to work by 33 percent; × increases gasoline consumed for driving to work by 33 percent; × increases the cost of automobile travel to work by 33 percent; × increases the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>parking</b> at work and driving to work by 33 percent. Although employers spend an average of $ 750 per employee per year for parking subsidies ($ 563 in replaced employee spending, and $ 187 in stimulated spending), the employees ' own average spending for parking and driving declines by only $ 183 per year. The net effect is that the employer must spend $ 4. 10 on parking subsidies for every $ 1 the employee saves on th...|$|E
