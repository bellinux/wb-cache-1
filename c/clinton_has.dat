5|$|The highway was {{constructed}} from1926to1935. Route31 has carried two different {{numbers in the}} past. It was known as Route30 between1927and1953, when it was renumbered to Route69 to avoid conflicting with US30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number69. There were plans made in the late1960s and early1970s to build a freeway in the Route31 corridor that would begin in the Trenton area and extend {{as far north as}} Interstate84 (I-84) in Port Jervis, New York; however, it was canceled in the mid-1970s due to opposition from area residents and environmental and financial constraints. In recent years, the portion of Route31 between Flemington and <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> been widened to four lanes. In addition, there was a failed project to build a bypass of Flemington that would have also eliminated the Flemington Circle.|$|E
