40|$|This thesis {{was carried}} out to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>connecting</b> <b>pipes</b> in a piping system using acoustic emission techniques. A plumbing system that {{is equipped with a}} number of <b>connecting</b> <b>pipes</b> was tested with acoustic emission sensors on the different fluid pressure. The sources of the acoustic emission signals (AE) is the activity prior to and after the fluid through <b>connecting</b> <b>pipes</b> and it is observed using acoustic sensors with a view of software USB E 3. 34. For study effects of pipe connections, all time domain parameters (maximum amplitude, power, RMS amplitude) of signals were observed and processed with the aid of Matlab software. All parameters were compared with the pressure of the fluid flow at eleven different points. The results showed that the difference between the AE parameters of high-flow pressure and low flow pressure is not much different. From this relationship, it may not conclude that the <b>pipe</b> <b>connecting</b> is the main factor to the difference in acoustic emission technique effects...|$|R

50|$|Their design {{benefited from}} {{experience}} with the Baden VI b steam engines, but they were a fundamentally different class with a superheater, new running gear with larger wheels and a longer, fixed wheelbase.

5000|$|The main {{characteristics}} of the offset smoker are that the cooking chamber is usually cylindrical in shape, with a shorter, smaller diameter cylinder attached {{to the bottom of}} one end for a firebox. To cook the meat, a small fire is lit in the firebox, where airflow is tightly controlled. The heat and smoke from the fire is drawn through a <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> or opening into the cooking chamber.|$|E
5000|$|The Baden VI b was {{the first}} German tank {{locomotive}} with a 2-6-2 wheel arrangement. It {{was developed by the}} firm of Maffei for the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways in order to provide faster services on the Höllentalbahn. As a result, the first six batches were given a firebox sloping to the rear. One striking feature was also the <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> between the two steam domes.|$|E
50|$|From 1926 to 1934 the ČSD rebuilt five of its 354.0 into {{superheated}} two-cylinder locomotives {{which they}} {{designated as the}} ČSD Class 355.0. These machines were also given a second steam dome and a <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> between the domes. Between 1936 and 1940, the trailing axle on another five engines {{was replaced by a}} bogie; these locomotives then became the ČSD Class 353.1. In 1944 another engine was converted to superheating, but the second steam dome was not used.|$|E
50|$|To {{check that}} the device is {{offering}} a correct reading and the <b>connecting</b> <b>pipes</b> to the boiler are not blocked by scale, the water level needs to be “bobbed” by quickly opening the taps in turn and allowing a brief spurt of water through the drain cock.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{a boiler}} barrel, made from two shells, {{as well as}} two steam domes, which were linked by an internal <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe.</b> The boiler feed was achieved using injectors, but from locomotive number 1856 they were given Knorr feed pumps with a preheater located transversely under the boiler. Later the preheater was positioned on the left hand side next to the chimney on all locomotives, which gave them their characteristic appearance. Schmidt superheaters were used.|$|E
5000|$|Inadvertent {{isolation}} of the pressurizing vessel from the reactor plant, via the closing of an isolation valve or mechanically clogged piping. Because of this possibility, no commercial nuclear power plant has any kind of valve in {{the connection between the}} pressuriser and the reactor coolant circuit. To avoid clogging anywhere in the primary circuit, the coolant is kept very clean, and the <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> between the pressuriser and the reactor coolant circuit is short and large diameter.|$|E
50|$|An {{eccentric}} reducer is {{a fitting}} used in piping systems between two pipes of different diameters. They are used where {{the diameter of}} the pipe on the upstream side of the fitting (i.e. where flow is coming from) is larger than the downstream side. Unlike a concentric reducer, which resembles a cone, eccentric reducers have an edge that is parallel to the <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe.</b> This parallel edge results in the two pipes having offset center lines. The same fitting can be used in reverse as an eccentric increaser/expander.|$|E

50|$|These steam {{locomotives}} {{were brought}} into service, {{after it was}} clear that the Saxon Class I V (later DRG Class 55) could no longer the demands placed on it. The locomotive had a hollow, Klien-Lindner axle at the back and, initially, a long steam collection pipe above the centre of the boiler which was replaced on later models by two steam domes and a <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe.</b> Twenty machines were delivered by the firm of Hartmann as wet steam engines, a further 30 with a Schmidt smoke tube superheater.|$|E
50|$|On May 1, 2010, the Chestnut Hill Reservoir was {{temporarily}} brought back online during {{a failure of}} a <b>connecting</b> <b>pipe</b> {{at the end of}} the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel. The Sudbury aqueduct was also activated to feed Chestnut Hill from the Foss and Sudbury reservoirs to keep the supply going. Separately the Spot Pond reservoir, also an emergency source, was tapped during the pipe break incident. Though a boil-water order was issued for fear that the water would not be safe to drink, following heavy treatment with chlorine later tests showed the water to be completely safe for drinking.|$|E

Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park in New York City and the Emerald Necklace in Boston, the park offers beautiful views of the Boston skyline, and is framed by stately homes and the campus of Boston College.
