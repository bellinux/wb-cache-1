50|$|Visible CD {{spectroscopy}} is a {{very powerful}} technique to study metal-protein interactions and can resolve individual d-d electronic transitions as separate bands. <b>CD</b> <b>spectra</b> in the visible light region are only produced when a metal ion is in a chiral environment, thus, free metal ions in solution are not detected. This has the advantage of only observing the protein-bound metal, so pH dependence and stoichiometries are readily obtained. Optical activity in transition metal ion complexes have been attributed to configurational, conformational and the vicinal effects. Klewpatinond and Viles (2007) have produced a set of empirical rules for predicting the appearance of visible <b>CD</b> <b>spectra</b> for Cu2+ and Ni2+ square-planar complexes involving histidine and main-chain coordination.|$|E

50|$|It {{may be of}} {{interest}} to note that the protein <b>CD</b> <b>spectra</b> used in secondary structure estimation are related to the π to π* orbital absorptions of the amide bonds linking the amino acids. These absorption bands lie partly in the so-called vacuum ultraviolet (wavelengths less than about 200 nm).

50|$|The far-UV (ultraviolet) CD {{spectrum}} of proteins can reveal important characteristics of their secondary structure. <b>CD</b> <b>spectra</b> {{can be readily}} used to estimate the fraction of a molecule {{that is in the}} alpha-helix conformation, the beta-sheet conformation, the beta-turn conformation, or some other (e.g. random coil) conformation. These fractional assignments place important constraints on the possible secondary conformations that the protein can be in. CD cannot, in general, say where the alpha helices that are detected are located within the molecule or even completely predict how many there are. Despite this, CD is a valuable tool, especially for showing changes in conformation. It can, for instance, be used to study how the secondary structure of a molecule changes as a function of temperature or of the concentration of denaturing agents, e.g. Guanidinium chloride or urea. In this way it can reveal important thermodynamic information about the molecule (such as the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of denaturation) that cannot otherwise be easily obtained. Anyone attempting to study a protein will find CD a valuable tool for verifying that the protein is in its native conformation before undertaking extensive and/or expensive experiments with it. Also, {{there are a number of}} other uses for CD spectroscopy in protein chemistry not related to alpha-helix fraction estimation.|$|E

The existence of these two types of <b>CD</b> <b>spectra</b> for -rich proteins form the basis for their classification as I- and II-proteins.
