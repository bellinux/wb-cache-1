50|$|The air (which {{is to be}} cooled), often {{after being}} {{filtered}} by a <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filter,</b> is blowed by an adjustable speed electric powered centrifugal blower across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled, and also deprived of any humidity (which condenses on the evaporator coils and is drained outside of the vehicle) in the process. It is then passed through an heater matrix, inside of which the engine's coolant circulates, {{where it can be}} reheated to a certain degree or even a certain temperature selected by the user and then delivered inside the vehicle's cabin through a set of adjustable vents. The user is also given the option to close the vehicle's external air flaps, in order to achieve even faster and stronger cooling by recirculating the air inside the cabin.|$|E

This lower limiter on the 2002 and 2005 models reduces the {{available}} performance as the 2ZZ is primarily a high-revving engine, and {{it is more difficult}} for the driver to land in the 'lift' (aggressive cam) rev range on an upshift. This only affects the 6-speed manual transmission as the gearing is spaced to where shifting up at approximately 8,250 rpms in any gear other than first gear will result in about 6,200 rpm after the shift, which is where [...] "lift", or the aggressive cam, engages. This allows models without the limited rpm range to remain within the car's power band throughout the gears. First gear is excluded because the gearing ratio is much lower than 2nd gear. The Celica received facelift for 2003 model year. The interior was mildly restyled, power antenna replaced the fixed one, the front and rear fascias were redone.

40|$|AbstractThe {{previous}} research on air filters has shown that they are replaced prematurely before reaching full capacity of utilization, leading to increasing maintenance costs and to reduced engine protection against abrasive wear. Also, the customers play {{a very important part}} because beyond the warranty period, they have the last word, making decisions about replacing or not the air filters. In this context, the present research aims to analyze drivers’ perceptions on the air filters maintenance for internal combustion engines. We also investigated drivers’ level of knowledge about the consequences of their decisions regarding air filters maintenance. We conducted a quantitative research, using the survey method based on a questionnaire. Most respondents are aware of the main filters used by cars systems. The best known filter is the fuel filter and the less known is <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filter.</b> The most important characteristic in selecting air filters is higher filtering efficiency. When choosing the air filter, the first criterion taken into account by respondents is the recommendations from the maintenance and repair handbook of the car. The main consequence of dust penetration inside the internal combustion engine is the engine's wear. This study is useful both for practitioners and academics...|$|E

40|$|Background Particulate matter (PM) air {{pollution}} {{is associated with}} increased respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Diesel engine exhaust (DE) and wood combustion are major contributors to ambient {{air pollution}} and adverse health effects. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} fate of inhaled combustion-derived PM, the subsequent effects on pulmonary inflammation and symptomatology and to explore the potential for particle filters to improve public health. Additionally, it aimed at increasing the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the adverse vascular effects of PM inhalation in man. Methods In study I, lung deposition of wood smoke-derived particulates from incomplete combustion was determined in healthy and COPD subjects. In study II, airway inflammation was assessed in healthy subjects exposed to wood smoke and filtered air. In study III, vehicle cabin air inlet filters were evaluated regarding filtering capacity for DE and whether they affected the toxicological potential of the filtered PM. Healthy subjects were then exposed to filtered air and unfiltered DE, as well as DE filtered through two selected filters. In study IV, healthy subjects were exposed to filtered air and DE. Nitric oxide bioavailability was assessed by plethysmography in the presence of an NO clamp (NO synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl locally and systemically administered) with measurements of arterial stiffness, cardiac output and blood pressure (BP). Results Study I: The total PM number deposition fraction of the wood smoke was 0. 32 and 0. 35 for healthy and COPD subjects respectively. Study II: Inhalation of wood smoke caused CD 3 + and mast cell infiltration in the bronchial submucosa along with CD 8 + cell recruitment to the epithelium. In bronchial wash, inflammatory cells, myeloperoxidase and matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels decreased. Study III: An efficient <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> with an active charcoal component was most favourable in in-vitro tests and reduced symptoms in the human exposure study. Study IV: Local NO synthase inhibition caused similar vasoconstriction after exposure to DE and filtered air, along with an increase in plasma nitrate concentrations, suggesting an increase in the basal NO release due to oxidative stress. Systemic NO synthase inhibition increased arterial stiffness and blood pressure after DE exposure along with an increase in systemic vascular resistance and reduced cardiac output, implying that the increased basal NO release could not compensate for the reduced NO bioavailability in the conduit vessels. Conclusion Wood smoke particles from incomplete combustion tend to have a greater airway deposition than particles from better combustion. The airway inflammatory responses to the former particles differ from what have been shown for other PM pollutants, which may be of importance for subsequent health effects. The vasomotor dysfunction shown after DE exposure may largely be explained by reduced NO bioavailability. A vehicle cabin air inlet particle filter with active charcoal was effective to reduce DE exposure and subsequent symptoms. This may conceptually be of benefit when it comes to decreasing engine exhaust-related adverse health effects...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of}} different automotive <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> to prevent penetration of components of diesel exhaust and thereby reduce biomedical effects in human subjects. <b>Filtered</b> <b>air</b> and unfiltered diluted diesel exhaust (DDE) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, and were compared with exposure to DDE filtered with four different filter systems. METHODS: 32 Healthy non- smoking subjects (age 21 - 53) participated in the study. Each subject was exposed six times for 1 hour in a specially designed exposure chamber: once to air, once to unfiltered DDE, and once to DDE filtered with the four different <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters.</b> Particle concentrations during exposure to unfiltered DDE were kept at 300 micrograms/m 3. Two of the filters were particle filters. The other two were particle filters combined with active charcoal filters that might reduce certain gaseous components. Subjective symptoms were recorded and nasal airway lavage (NAL), acoustic rhinometry, and lung function measurements were performed. RESULTS: The two particle filters decreased the concentrations of diesel exhaust particles by about half, but did not reduce the intensity of symptoms induced by exhaust. The combination of active charcoal filters and a particle filter significantly reduced the symptoms and discomfort caused by the diesel exhaust. The most noticable differences in efficacy between the filters {{were found in the}} reduction of detection of an unpleasant smell from the diesel exhaust. In this respect even the two charcoal filter combinations differed significantly. The efficacy to reduce symptoms may depend on the abilities of the filters investigated to reduce certain hydrocarbons. No acute effects on NAL, rhinometry, and lung function variables were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the use of active charcoal filters, and a particle filter, clearly reduced the intensity of symptoms induced by diesel exhaust.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringSteven J. EckelsByron W. JonesPoor {{air quality}} in {{commercial}} aircraft cabins {{can be caused}} by volatile organophosphorus (OP) compounds emitted from the jet engine bleed air system during smoke/fume incidents. Tri-cresyl phosphate (TCP), a common anti-wear additive in turbine engine oils, is an important component in today’s global aircraft operations. However, exposure to TCP increases risks of certain adverse health effects. This research analyzed used aircraft <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> for jet engine oil contaminants and designed a jet engine bleed air simulator (BAS) to replicate smoke/fume incidents caused by pyrolysis of jet engine oil. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and neutron activation analysis (NAA) were used for elemental analysis of filters, and gas chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to analyze used filters to determine TCP isomers. The filter analysis study involved 110 used and 74 incident <b>filters.</b> Clean <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> samples exposed to different bleed <b>air</b> conditions simulating <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> contamination incidents were also analyzed by FESEM/EDS, NAA, and GC/MS. Experiments were conducted on a BAS at various bleed air conditions typical of an operating jet engine so that the effects of temperature and pressure variations on jet engine oil aerosol formation could be determined. The GC/MS analysis of both used and incident filters characterized tri-m-cresyl phosphate (TmCP) and tri-p-cresyl phosphate (TpCP) by a base peak of an m/z = 368, with corresponding retention times of 21. 9 and 23. 4 minutes. The hydrocarbons in jet oil were characterized in the filters by a base peak pattern of an m/z = 85, 113. Using retention times and hydrocarbon thermal conductivity peak (TCP) pattern obtained from jet engine oil standards, five out of 110 used filters tested had oil markers. Meanwhile 22 out of 74 incident filters tested positive for oil fingerprints. Probit analysis of jet engine oil aerosols obtained from BAS tests by optical particle counter (OPC) revealed lognormal distributions with the mean (range) of geometric mass mean diameter (GMMD) = 0. 41 (0. 39, 0. 45) [mu]m and geometric standard deviation (GSD), [sigma][subscript]g = 1. 92 (1. 87, 1. 98). FESEM/EDS and NAA techniques found a wide range of elements on filters, and further investigations of used filters are recommended using these techniques. The protocols for <b>air</b> and <b>filter</b> sampling and GC/MS analysis used in this study will increase the options available for detecting jet engine oil on <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters.</b> Such criteria could support policy development for compliance with <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> quality standards during incidents...|$|R

In this article we are going to discuss the manufacturing of the adsorbents by "liquid phase infiltration" and their characterization by techniques, such as nitrogen sorption analysis, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. The new adsorbents were evaluated in repeated breakthrough tests using NO 2 (4 ppm(V) as feed concentration) in humid air as the adsorptive.

In this study, we measured fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations inside and outside 17 taxis simultaneously while they were driven on roadways. The drivers' urinary monohydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations just before and right after the driving tests were also determined. Data were collected under three driving conditions (i. e. no mitigation (NM), window closed (WC), and window closed plus using high efficiency <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> (WC+HECA)) for each taxi and driver. The results show that, compared to NM, the WC+HECA reduced in-cabin PM 2. 5 and UFP concentrations, by 37 % and 47 % respectively (p < 0. 05), whereas the reductions on PAH exposures were insignificant. Although nonsignificant, a reduction of 17 % was also observed in the drivers' urinary MDA under WC+HECA. The MDA concentrations were found to be significantly associated with the in-cabin PM 2. 5 and UFP concentrations, suggesting the reduction of the drivers' lipid peroxidation can be at least partially attributed to the PM 2. 5 and UFP reduction by WC+HECA.

40|$|Activate carbon {{impregnated}} with {{a mixture}} of copper oxide and zinc oxide performs well as active adsorber for NO 2 removal in automotive <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters.</b> The oxide-loaded activated carbon exhibits superior long-term stability in comparison to pure activated carbon as has been shown in previous studies. The carbon material was loaded only with 2. 5 wt% of each metal oxide. Characterization of the oxide nanoparticles within the pores of the activated carbon is difficult because of the rather low concentration of the oxides. Therefore, a systematic study was performed to evaluate the limits of line profile analysis of X-ray powder diffraction patterns. The method allows evaluation of crystalline domain size distributions, crystal defect concentrations and twinning probabilities of nanoscopic materials. Here, the analysis is hampered by the presence of several phases including more or less amorphous carbon. By using physical mixtures of defined copper oxide and zinc oxide particles with activated carbon, potential errors and limits could be identified. The contribution of the activated carbon to the scattering curve was modeled with a convolution of an exponential decay curve, a Chebyshev polynomial, and two Lorentzian peaks. With this approach, domain size distributions can be calculated that are shifted only by about 0. 5 – 1. 0 nm for very low loadings (≤ 4 wt%). Oxide loadings of 4 wt% and 5 wt% allow very reliable analyses from diffraction patterns measured in Bragg–Brentano and Debye–Scherrer geometry, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to {{particulate}} matter (PM) air pollution especially derived from traffic {{is associated with}} increases in cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. In this study, we evaluated the ability of novel vehicle <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> inlet <b>filters</b> to reduce diesel exhaust (DE) -induced symptoms and markers of inflammation in human subjects. METHODS: Thirty healthy subjects participated in a randomized double-blind controlled crossover study where they were exposed to <b>filtered</b> <b>air,</b> unfiltered DE and DE filtered through two selected particle filters, one with and one without active charcoal. Exposures lasted for one hour. Symptoms were assessed before and during exposures and lung function was measured before and after each exposure, with inflammation assessed in peripheral blood five hours after exposures. In parallel, PM were collected from unfiltered and filtered DE and assessed for their capacity to drive damaging oxidation reactions in a cell-free model, or promote inflammation in A 549 cells. RESULTS: The standard particle filter employed in this study reduced PM 10 mass concentrations within the exposure chamber by 46 %, further reduced to 74 % by the inclusion of an active charcoal component. In addition use of the active charcoal filter was associated by a 75 % and 50 % reduction in NO 2 and hydrocarbon concentrations, respectively. As expected, subjects reported more subjective symptoms after exposure to unfiltered DE compared to <b>filtered</b> <b>air,</b> which was significantly reduced by the filter with an active charcoal component. There were no significant changes in lung function after exposures. Similarly diesel exhaust did not elicit significant increases {{in any of the}} inflammatory markers examined in the peripheral blood samples 5  hour post-exposure. Whilst the filters reduced chamber particle concentrations, the oxidative activity of the particles themselves, did not change following filtration with either filter. In contrast, diesel exhaust PM passed through the active charcoal combination filter appeared less inflammatory to A 549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: A <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> inlet particle <b>filter</b> including an active charcoal component was highly effective in reducing both DE particulate and gaseous components, with reduced exhaust-induced symptoms in healthy volunteers.

Since UFPs primarily origin from traffic emissions in urban environment, previous research efforts have dedicated to study UFPs in near-freeway and on-freeway environments. Despite improved understanding of UFPs in last two decades, UFPs in the in-cabin environment, whereby passenger exposures occur, has been largely overlooked. Although modern passenger vehicles are commonly equipped with <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters,</b> in-cabin UFP reduction is low (i. e., 40 - 60 %) in outdoor air (OA) mode and commuting exposure alone can account for a significant level of total daily exposure (i. e., up to 45 - 50 %). Although setting the ventilation system to recirculation (RC) mode can reduce in-cabin UFPs by 80 - 95 %, carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the exhaled breath of passengers can quickly accumulate in the passenger cabin. In order to reduce passenger exposures to UFPs and CO 2, this dissertation work investigated the in-cabin environment experimentally and quantitatively. From experimental measurements, this work quantified automotive envelope leakage and ventilation systems across {{a wide range of}} vehicle models / types from various manufacturers. The infiltration was found specific to location and also conditionally occurred as a result of two competing pressures: in-cabin pressure and aerodynamic pressure on vehicle envelope. The aerodynamic pressure also changed as a function of driving speed. To extend the findings, this dissertation work developed a quantitative model to simulate in-cabin air quality and evaluated the effects of infiltration and passive ventilation in wide range of driving speed and ventilation conditions. Parametric analysis using the model elucidated the fractional significance of in-cabin UFP gain/loss mechanisms affected by driving speed. Finally, the dissertation work proposed a novel simultaneous control method and demonstrated in-cabin concentration reduction of 93 % on average for UFPs in filed conditions while reducing CO 2 level by a factor of 3 - 4...|$|R
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) DC- 8 {{airborne}} sciences research airplane inadvertently {{flew through}} a diffuse {{volcanic ash cloud}} of the Mt. Hekla volcano in February 2000 during a flight from Edwards Air Force Base (Edwards, California) to Kiruna, Sweden. Although the ash plume was not visible to the flight crew, sensitive research experiments and instruments detected it. In-flight performance checks and postflight visual inspections revealed no damage to the airplane or engine first-stage fan blades; subsequent detailed examination of the engines revealed clogged turbine cooling air passages. The engines were removed and overhauled. This paper presents volcanic ash plume analysis, trajectory from satellites, analysis of ash particles collected in <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> heat exchanger <b>filters</b> and removed from the engines, and data from onboard instruments and engine conditions...|$|R
40|$|Mechanised {{production}} of peat for fuel consumption {{is associated with}} high concentrations of organic dust, which is inhaled by the peat workers. In the present study 17 workers at two peat bogs in northern Sweden were examined. Personal sampling of total dust and the respirable fraction was performed during several workshifts. Dynamic spirometry was carried out before {{and at the end}} of shifts. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in six subjects at the end of the working season and the results were compared with unexposed reference subjects. Peat workers using modern machines with ventilated <b>cabins</b> containing <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> were found to be exposed to low concentrations of peat dust. The recorded dust concentrations were below the threshold limit value for organic dust (5 mg/m 3 air) in all but one worker. The respirable fraction of peat dust recorded in the breathing zone of the workers correlated significantly with a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). The effect on lung function in non-asthmatic peat workers was, however, small. The concentration of lysozyme positive alveolar macrophages in BAL fluid was significantly lower in the peat workers compared with reference subjects. An inverse correlation was found between the mentioned cells and exposure to the respirable fraction of the peat dust. Furthermore, one particularly dust exposed worker had pronounced increases in alveolar macrophages, fibronectin concentration, and mast cells in BAL fluid...|$|R
