2500|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form [...] "cutbacks" [...] with reduced melting point or mixing {{with water to}} turn the asphalt into an emulsion. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, cationic and anionic. Asphalt emulsions are used {{in a wide variety}} of applications. Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregate</b> that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth, and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} from a comparison study of two methods, the sieve stability test and the J-ring test, for testing the resistance of fresh self-compacting concrete (SCC) to segregation. The sieve stability test {{is based on the}} measurement of the sieved portion of the sample passing through a 5 mm sieve, while the J-ring test is based on the difference between two measurements of the blocking step. Different mixes of fresh SCC with natural, blended natural and <b>crushed,</b> and <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> were tested in parallel using both the test methods. Concrete were cast in plastic pipes with 2 m height using some of representative mixes with <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Specimens from different heights were taken for testing compressive strength and chloride migration coefficient. The results show that there is a fairly good correlation in the measurement results from the two methods for the SCC with natural aggregates, but not for that with <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The relationships between the fresh and hardened properties of SCC as well as some discrepancies between the two methods in the test results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|High-performance {{concrete}} (HPC) {{is usually}} produced using high quality materials. These high quality constituents drastically increase the initial cost of HPC, hence hindering its more widespread use. Therefore, {{the main goal}} of this research project was to produce a low cost enhanced performance concrete or even a low cost HPC, using low quality fly ash and locally available <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates.</b> In this way, {{a significant reduction in}} the use of Portland cement, {{as well as that of}} scarce natural resources, would be obtained. The effect of high percentages of fly ash and <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> on concrete performance was studied by comparing the mechanical and durability performances of such concretes with nominally similar types of concrete with no fly ash incorporated. The results obtained indicate that it is possible to produce concrete in the low range of HPC with up to 65 MPa at 56 days by replacing up to 40 % of cement with as received fly ash using <b>crushed</b> granite <b>aggregates.</b> Furthermore, it was observed that workability and durability both increased significantly when fly ash partially replaced Portland cement...|$|R

50|$|A shared-use path or mixed-use path {{is a form}} of {{infrastructure}} that supports multiple recreation and transportation opportunities, such as walking, bicycling, inline skating and people in wheelchairs.

50|$|Scrubbers are {{material}} washers used {{to break}} down and disperse clays in order to prepare mineral ores or construction aggregates for further processing. Sepro Tyre Drive Scrubbers are manufactured up to 3.6m in diameter and are capable of processing up to 1500 tonnes per hour of material. Shell supported Scrubbers such as the Sepro PTD Scrubber minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over {{the full length of}} the washing drum. These scrubbers operate in many applications on feeds with high clay content, and are commonly used for difficult ore and stone washing duties. A few specified applications of Sepro Scrubbers include removal of gold “robbing” carboniferous material and other contaminants from gold ores, the processing of bauxite ores for aluminum production, the washing of laterites (gold, nickel, cobalt) to liberate fine metals for gravity recovery, and the washing of <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregate,</b> gravel and sand to remove clay contamination.|$|E
40|$|Rewetting events after {{a drought}} produce a pulse of soil {{respiration}} (the “Birch Effect”) {{that leads to}} a loss of carbon from soil, especially in Mediterranean ecosystems. Two main hypotheses have developed to explain the Birch effect: the “metabolic explanation”, based on the rapid consumption of intracellular osmolytes previously accumulated to survive to dry conditions, and the “physical explanation”, based on the consumption of carbon made accessible by physical destruction of internal structures of the soil. Here, we compared the respiration response of intact and crushed 9 e 4 mm aggregates from a California grassland soil under two different rewetting schemes: (1) successive short dry/wet events and (2) increased drought periods followed by a single rewetting. In intact aggregates, both microbial biomass and respiration rates were relatively stable through both experimental treatments. In <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates,</b> through multiple short dry/wet cycles, both respiration rate and microbial biomass increased, while as drought length increased, biomass was unaffected but the magnitude of the following rewetting pulse increased. A mechanism that explains both these results is that <b>crushing</b> <b>aggregates</b> exposes occluded particular material that must be degraded into an immediately bioavailable form for microbes to take it up and metabolize it. Nitrification was generally higher in intact than <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates,</b> suggesting the importance of physical association between nitrifiers and resources in regulating overall soil nitrification. This work suggests that physical processes are most important in driving respiration pulses through multiple rewetting cycles and that the physical association of organisms, substrates, and mineral particles are critical in controlling the functioning of the “microbial landscape”...|$|R

40|$|Today, no {{general design}} method for shear {{strength}} capacity of RC beams can predict the failure load {{with a high}} degree of accuracy. The failure load between two beams cast from the same batch may vary as much as 30 percent.

40|$|Crushed rock {{becomes more}} and more common as {{aggregate}} in concrete, due to the restriction to use natural gravel. Today <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregate</b> is commonly used from the size of 8 mm and upwards. Natural gravel is still used for the finer gradings.

The method is based on image analysis where images of the material are taken with scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy.

The results show that this method is quite robust and that there is no significant difference between the two measured parameters...|$|E
