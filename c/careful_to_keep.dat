5|$|In 1714, {{with the}} {{accession}} of George I, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both {{came to be}} ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover. Early Hanoverian monarchs were <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the heirlooms of the two realms separate. George III gave half the British heirlooms to his bride, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, as a wedding present. In her will, Charlotte left the jewels to the 'House of Hanover'. The Kingdom of Hanover followed the Salic Law, whereby the line of succession went through male heirs. Thus, when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom, her uncle Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover. King Ernest demanded {{a portion of the}} jewellery, not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte. Victoria flatly declined to hand over any of the jewels, claiming they had been bought with British money. Ernest's son, George V of Hanover, continued to press the claim. Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, suggested that she make a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep the jewels, but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase the jewels nor loan funds for the purpose. A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover. On 28 January 1858, 10 years after Ernest's death, the jewels were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador, Count Kielmansegg. Victoria did manage to hang on to one of her favourite pieces of jewellery: a fine rope of pearls.|$|E

Any foreign Jew who landed in Sweden was accordingly required to report, within eight days of his arrival, to the local authorities, and to produce his passport and a certificate of character, as well as a statement of his purpose in coming to the country. These certificates were issued by the elders of the congregation to which the immigrant belonged in his native country, and had to be verified by the municipal authorities of the place in which the immigrant had last resided. If the certificates were unsatisfactory, the authorities were at liberty to expel the holder; but in case he was admitted he was directed to Stockholm, Gothenburg, or Norrköping. Jews who were residents of the country prior to the promulgation of this ordinance were called upon to present their certificates of character to the proper authorities, together with a statement setting forth in which city they desired to settle and make their living. The ordinance enumerated the different trades the Jews were permitted to follow, and it stipulated also that they should apprentice their sons to Swedish tradesmen in one of the three cities mentioned above. In order to prevent the overcrowding of the mercantile field it was prescribed that no foreign-born Jew should be allowed to start in business unless he possessed at least 2,000 Swedish riksdaler in cash or negotiable securities; a native-born Jew need have only 1,000 riksdaler. Rabbis were exempt, and according to previous ordinances, poor Jews were to be deported from the country.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1925, Disney {{hired an}} ink artist, Lillian Bounds. They married in July of that year. The {{marriage}} was generally happy, according to Lillian, although according to Disney's biographer Neal Gabler {{she did not}} [...] "accept Walt's decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people 'how henpecked he is'."

Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously). Within the family, neither Disney nor his wife hid the fact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people outside the family raised the point.

500|$|In skilled hands, the net was {{a useful}} weapon. The retiariuss primary {{objective}} with {{it was to}} capture his opponent. A ewer found at Rheinzabern demonstrates the throwing technique: the retiarius held the net folded up {{in his right hand}} and cast it underhanded. He held his trident and dagger in his left hand, <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the trident's prongs pointed downward to avoid snagging it in the mesh. If the toss missed, the retiarius used the drawrope tied to his wrist to bring the net back in hand. On a successful cast, the gladiator tightened the drawcord around the net's perimeter and tried to unbalance or topple his rival. A successful cast of the net could win the battle for the retiarius straightaway. This was not certain, however, as a mosaic at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid shows: in the first panel, the retiarius Kalendio has caught his opponent, a secutor named Astyanax, in his net. In the later image, however, Kalendio lies on the ground, wounded, and raises his dagger to surrender. The inscription above Kalendio shows the sign for [...] "null", implying that the match organisers ordered him killed.|$|E

40|$|The goal {{of modern}} {{neonatal}} care of extremely preterm infants {{is to reduce}} mortality and long-term neurological impairments. Preterm infants frequently experience cerebral intraventricular or pulmonary hemorrhage, which usually occurs within 72  hours after birth {{and can lead to}} long-term neurological sequelae and mortality. These serious hemorrhagic complications are closely related to perinatal hemodynamic changes, including an increase in the afterload on the left ventricle of the heart after the infant is separated from the placenta, and an increased preload from a left-to-right shunt caused by a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The left ventricle of a preterm myocardium has limited ability to respond to such an increase in afterload and preload, and this can result in cardiac dysfunction and hemodynamic deterioration. We suggest that delayed umbilical cord clamping or umbilical cord milking to maintain optimal blood pressure and systemic blood flow (SBF), <b>careful</b> assessment <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the afterload at an acceptable level, and a strategy of early targeted treatment of significant PDA to improve perfusion during this critical time period may reduce or prevent these serious complications in preterm infants...|$|R

Strongly opposed to the apartheid system of racial segregation and white-minority rule in South Africa, Biko was frustrated that NUSAS and other anti-apartheid groups were dominated by white liberals, {{rather than by the}} blacks who were most affected by apartheid. He believed that even when well-intentioned, white liberals failed to comprehend the black experience and often acted in a paternalistic manner. He developed the view that to avoid white domination, black people had to organise independently, and to this end he became a leading figure {{in the creation of the}} South African Students' Organisation (SASO) in 1968. Membership was open only to [...] "blacks", a term that Biko used in reference not just to Bantu-speaking Africans but also to Coloureds and Indians. He was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his movement independent of white liberals, but opposed anti-white racism and had various white friends and lovers.

40|$|Preterm infants {{frequently}} experience pulmonary hemorrhage or cerebral {{intraventricular hemorrhage}} after birth. The immature myocardium {{of the left}} ventricle faces a high afterload after the baby is separated from the placenta. However, the preterm left ventricle has limited {{ability to respond to}} such an increase in afterload. This results in depressed cardiac function and a deterioration in hemodynamics. We speculated that the perinatal deterioration in cardiac performance would be closely related to serious hemorrhages. To prove our hypothesis, we studied the interrelationship between the perinatal changes in cardiac performance and the incidences of intraventricular and pulmonary hemorrhage. We obtained the stress–velocity relationship (rate-corrected mean fiber shortening velocity and end-systolic wall stress relationship) by M-mode echocardiography and arterial blood pressure measurement. We found that the incidences of intraventricular and/or pulmonary hemorrhages were higher in infants with an excessive afterload, which resulted in a decrease in the function of the left ventricle. We suggest that <b>careful</b> attention <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the afterload at an acceptable level by vasodilator therapy and sedation may reduce or prevent these serious complications. In this review, we will discuss our data along with related literature...|$|R

[...] Early in the continuity Capp a few times referred to Dogpatch being in Kentucky, but he was <b>careful</b> afterwards <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its location generic, probably to avoid cancellations from offended Kentucky newspapers.

He left it at Dogpatch USA so there would be no headaches and problems. Like the Coconino County depicted in George Herriman's Krazy Kat and the Okefenokee Swamp of Walt Kelly's Pogo, Dogpatch's distinctive cartoon landscape became as identified with the strip as any of its characters.
