50|$|Ten {{year old}} Roche had {{received}} critical acclaim for his performances as Ben in the BBC comedy series Outnumbered. Isabella Blake-Thomas, {{who appeared in}} the BBC Four television film Enid, got the part of Violet Elizabeth Bott, William's neighbour. Due to {{the setting of the}} series, Roche had to have his trademark <b>curly</b> hair <b>cut</b> short.|$|R
50|$|Other common {{causes of}} hair damage {{include the use}} of {{relaxers}} and other harsh chemicals; use of a razor to <b>cut</b> <b>curly</b> hair, which weakens the hair cuticle and promotes frizz; and harsh shampoos that strip the hair of its natural oils.|$|R
5000|$|Hair {{was worn}} short and curled with the New Look, and hats were {{essential}} {{for all but}} the most casual occasions. [...] Wide-brimmed saucer hats were shown with the earliest New Look suits, but smaller hats soon predominated. Very short cropped hairstyles were fashionable in the early 1950s. By mid-decade hats were worn less frequently, especially as fuller hairstyles like the short, <b>curly</b> poodle <b>cut</b> and later bouffant and beehive became fashionable. [...] "Beat" [...] girls wore their hair long and straight, and teenagers adopted the ponytail, short or long.|$|R
60|$|The {{owner of}} the decided voice went on writing. Clodd, having done as he was bid, sat himself in the easy-chair before the fire and smoked. Of the person behind the desk Mr. Clodd could see but the head and shoulders. It had black, <b>curly</b> hair, <b>cut</b> short. It's only garment visible below the white collar and red tie {{might have been a}} boy's jacket {{designed}} more like a girl's, or a girl's designed more like a boy's; partaking of the genius of English statesmanship, it appeared to be a compromise. Mr. Clodd remarked the long, drooping lashes over the bright, black eyes.|$|R
50|$|The blonde {{encourages}} Curly to rape Lisa but he {{is unable}} to break her hymen. Although Blackie is now becoming concerned at the way events are heading the blonde holds down Lisa while encouraging <b>Curly</b> to <b>cut</b> her with his flick knife to help him. The blonde enthusiastically grabs the knife and forces it deeper into Lisa causing her to hemorrhage and die. Margaret manages to lock herself in the toilet while the blonde orders the two thugs to bring her back. Frantic, Margaret climbs out of the window and flings herself from the train only to be killed in the fall. The men throw Lisa's body out of the window followed by their luggage, stealing their tickets and other items.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Oriental Flower Girl" by Nathaldi Siehel, depicting a western woman in Japanese robes with a basket of flowers, [s. d. ]. The woman stands at center, her legs bound closely together by the skirt of the robe, which is decorated with a floral pattern. Long, billowing sleeves drape down to the mid-forearm at each side, where the left arm is held at the hip and the right hand holds {{the edge of a}} metal plate on which flowers have been placed. To the left, a small table supports a cloisonne vase. Below, a few blossoms from the plate have fallen onto the patterned rug which covers the floor. The womans hair is dark, <b>curly</b> and <b>cut</b> short. Hoop earrings hang from her ears. Her eye makeup is heavy...|$|R
50|$|Confectioners {{developed}} the candy as a Christmas decoration for their shops, modeling the wavy form around the candy maker’s thumb. In the 1800s mechanical crimpers were invented {{to shape the}} ribbons. Finger-like crimpers simulated the curl originally put into the candy by hand. A candy maker made the candy, another spun off a ribbon and fed it into a crimper which was then turned by hand. Finally, the <b>curly</b> ribbon was <b>cut</b> with scissors as it came down a small conveyor.|$|R
5000|$|Nigger Hair Smoking Tobacco {{was first}} {{manufactured}} by the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based B. Leidersdorf Company in 1878. According {{to the company}} the product was named after [...] "its distinctive, <b>curly</b> Long <b>Cut</b> strands". The product was sold at economic prices and packaged in metal tins with [...] "the head of a negro surmounted with a copious crop of wool, and having a large ring pending from the nose and another from the ear" [...] stamped on the front. Early advertisements for Nigger Hair bore the tagline [...] "Always be a good boy and smoke B. Leidersdorf and Co.'s Nigger Hair". In 1917, tickets for tradeable Nigger Hair Smoking Tobacco were commissioned by the American Tobacco Company. The production company changed the product's name to [...] "Bigger Hair" [...] in the 1950s, following fierce criticism from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The product was sold predominantly in North America. Today, its tins remain a prominent collector's item {{and can be found}} at various auctions.|$|R
5000|$|Platten was {{recruited}} to Carlton {{but after a}} protracted legal case eventually joined Hawthorn for the 1986 season. Keeping the number 44 {{on the back of}} his guernsey, he went on to play for the Hawks from 1986 to 1997, playing 258 games and kicking 228 goals. Nicknamed [...] "The Rat" [...] with his diminutive frame and unruly tangle of <b>curly</b> hair, he <b>cut</b> a distinctive if unlikely looking footballer, yet despite this he enjoyed a career which saw him firmly established as one of the best players of the 1980s and early '90s. He was a gutsy rover who won a Brownlow Medal in 1987, tying with Tony Lockett. He played in four VFL/AFL premierships with Hawthorn, in 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1991, and a State of Origin Carnival Championship for South Australia in 1988 ...|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} the call, a tall, handsome, earnest-eyed boy {{advanced}} timidly to the platform. It was no wonder that those enthusiastic Gideonite visionaries should have seen in his face the visible stamp of the Apostleship. Paul Owen had a rich crop of dark-brown glossy and <b>curly</b> hair, <b>cut</b> something after the Florentine Cinque-cento fashion--not because his parents wished him to look artistic, but {{because that was the}} way in which they had seen the hair dressed in all the sacred pictures that they knew; and Margaret Owen, the daughter of some Wesleyan Spitalfields weaver folk, with the imaginative Huguenot blood still strong in her veins, had made up her mind ever since she became Convinced of the Truth (as their phrase ran) that her Paul was called from his cradle to a great work. His features were delicately chiselled, and showed rather natural culture, like his mother's, than rough honesty, like John Owen's, or strong individuality, like the masterful Apostle's. His eyes were peculiarly deep and luminous, with a far-away look which might have reminded an artist of the central boyish figure in Holman Hunt's picture of the Doctors in the Temple. And yet Paul Owen had a healthy colour in his cheek and a general sturdiness of limb and muscle which showed that he was none of your nervous, bloodless, sickly idealists, but a wholesome English peasant boy of native refinement and delicate sensibilities. He moved forward with some natural hesitation before the eyes of so many people--ay, and what was more terrible, of the entire Church upon earth; but he was not awkward and constrained in his action like his father. One could see that he was sustained in the prominent part he took that morning by the consciousness of a duty he had to perform and a mission laid upon him which he must not reject.|$|R
60|$|The {{dogs were}} not {{neglected}} during the meal; but over-eagerness was repressed by a stout truncheon lying handily near the old negro Jarl. The animals {{are small and}} stunted, long-nosed and crooked-limbed, with <b>curly</b> tails often <b>cut,</b> sharp ears which show {{that they have not}} lost the use of the erecting muscles, and so far wild that they cannot bark. The colour is either black and white or yellow and white, as in Stambul and India. Overrun with ticks and foul with mange, they are too broken-spirited to rob, except by secretly sneaking into the huts, and, however often beaten off, they return to the charge like sitting hens. The people prize these wretched tikes, because they are ever ready to worry a stranger, and are useful in driving game from the bush. Yet they barbarously ill-treat them. The hungry cats are as poor a breed as the pure English, and, though no one feeds them, these domesticated tigerkins swarm. The only happy pets are the parrots. Every village swarms with hogs, the filthy wealth of the old Saxon proprietor, and their habits are disgusting as their forms are obscene. Every Anglo-Indian will understand what I mean.|$|R
5000|$|Moe Howard had fond {{memories}} of filming A Pain in the Pullman. He also recalled his intense dislike for shellfish, and how brother <b>Curly</b> Howard <b>cut</b> {{the inside of his}} mouth eating the shells from a Dungeness crab: ...In one sequence, all three of us wound up in the same upper berth. Later, we found ourselves a drawing room, not knowing it was assigned to the star of the show (James C. Morton). There was a lovely table set in the room with all kinds of delicacies.At one point Curly picked up the hard-shelled Dungeness crab. We, of course, were not supposed to know what it was. Larry thought it was a tarantula, Curly figured it to be a turtle, and I concluded that it must be something to eat or it wouldn't be on the table with crackers and sauce.As the scene progressed, Curly tried to open the crab shell and bent the tines of his fork. I took the fork from Curly, tossed a napkin on the floor, and asked him to pick it up. When Curly bent over, I hit him on the head with the crab, breaking the shell into a million pieces. Then Curly scooped out some of the meat, tasted it, and made a face. He threw the meat away and proceeded to eat the shell.I have to tell you, if there's one thing to which I have an aversion, it's shellfish, and I couldn't bring myself—even for a film—to put that claw in my mouth. Preston Black, the director, asked me to just lick the claw, but I couldn't. He finally had the prop man duplicate the claw out of sugar and food coloring and had me nibble on it as though I was enjoying it. I was still very wary during the scene. I was afraid they had coated the real shell with sugar and that that awful claw was underneath. I chewed that claw during the scene, but if you'll notice, I did it very gingerly.In the meantime, Curly was still chewing on the shell, which was cutting the inside of his mouth. Finally, our star comes back to his room and kicks us out, and we three climb into our upper berth to go to sleep.|$|R
