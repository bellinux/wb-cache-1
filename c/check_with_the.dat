2500|$|Some {{of the top}} AA pros, Stu Thomsen, Harry Leary, Greg Hill, Brent and Brian Patterson among them, {{met with}} ABA {{officials}} before the 1983 Winternationals to discuss the method of choosing the National number one pro for the year. Dissatisfied with the ABA's response, many pros, most notably Greg Hill, shunned the ABA circuit {{and focused on the}} NBL and third-party sanctioning bodies like the regional United Bicycle Racers (UBR) and the National Pedal Sport Association (NPSA). This tactic was not new to Mr. Hill. He led a one-man boycott of the ABA during the 1980 season in part due to Mennenga's perceived lack of concern for an allegedly unsafe number of racers at the starting gate of a national. Mennenga allegedly said to Mr. Hill that the [...] "...ABA doesn't cater to the Pros". Even Tommy Brackens who had a reputation of being low key and easy going had an alleged unpleasant run-in with the alleged intransigence of Merl Mennenga. During the 1982 Fall National in a semi moto race there was an exceedingly close finish for the fourth and last position to qualify for the main between Brackens and Jeff Kosmala at the finish line. Merl Mennenga called the race in Kosmala's favor and against Brackens. Brackens tried to make an official protest. Merl allegedly said <b>check</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> scorer as Mr. Brackens moved to do so. Larry Greer, the Race Director, allegedly threatened to have Brackens suspended for 30 days if he did not leave the track. Mennenga allegedly told Brackens shortly after {{that there would be no}} change in his call and whatever he says goes. Such was the relations Mennenga had with the Pros. Indeed, the ABA decided to reuse the same system it used in 1982 to decide the number one pro for 1983. As a result, many pros still feeling that they weren't being listen to stayed away from the ABA circuit and concentrated on the NBL and the NBA.|$|E
