This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells.

25|$|Many {{different}} geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and {{retinoic acid}} are possible {{as a result}} of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown here). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the <b>chromophore</b> of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Rhodopsin is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a Schiff base to the opsin protein (either rod opsin or blue, red or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced isomerisation of the <b>chromophore</b> from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule.

40|$|Sol-gel films {{used for}} second-order {{non-linear}} optical applications often contain some organic molecules working as spacers between <b>chromophores</b> with large permanent dipolar moments. The spacers improve the optical {{quality of the}} films because they avoid the <b>chromophores</b> aggregation. We propose the use of silver nanoparticles as good spacers, instead of organic molecules. In this work the effect of silver nanoparticles on the arrangement of push-pull <b>chromophores</b> inside SiO 2 sol-gel films is investigated by UV-vis optical absorption spectroscopy. Key variables for a good performance of spacers are: their polarizability, their concentration {{with respect to the}} concentration of the <b>chromophores,</b> as well as the temperature of the system. Disperse Red 1 <b>chromophores,</b> well known push-pull <b>chromophores,</b> arrange themselves forming H-aggregates when they are inside films in high enough concentrations. Those aggregates are clearly detected by UV-vis optical absorption spectroscopy, where they show an absorbance peak close to 404 nm. That peak disappears as the temperature of the films and/or the concentration of the spacers and/or the polarizability of the spacers increase. A possible electrostatic shielding between the <b>chromophores,</b> created by the spacers, makes us to think about the possibility to use metallic nanoparticles as a new kind of molecular spacer...|$|R

In this method, fluorophores are chemically linked or genetically fused to two proteins hypothesised to interact. If the proteins interact, this will bring the fluorophores into close spatial proximity.

25|$|The {{identification}} of suitable matrix compounds {{is determined to}} some extent by trial and error, but {{they are based on}} some specific molecular design considerations. They are of a fairly low molecular weight (to allow easy vaporization), but are large enough (with a low enough vapor pressure) not to evaporate during sample preparation or while standing in the mass spectrometer. They are often acidic, therefore act as a proton source to encourage ionization of the analyte. Basic matrices have also been reported. They have a strong optical absorption in either the UV or IR range, so that they rapidly and efficiently absorb the laser irradiation. This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several conjugated double bonds, as seen in the structure of cinnamic acid.

25|$|The Franck–Condon principle, in its {{canonical}} form, {{applies only}} {{to changes in the}} vibrational levels of a molecule {{in the course of a}} change in electronic levels by either absorption or emission of a photon. The physical intuition of this principle is anchored by the idea that the nuclear coordinates of the atoms constituting the molecule do not have time to change during the very brief amount of time involved in an electronic transition. However, this physical intuition can be, and is indeed, routinely extended to interactions between light-absorbing or emitting molecules (chromophores) and their environment. Franck–Condon metaphors are appropriate because molecules often interact strongly with surrounding molecules, particularly in liquids and solids, and these interactions modify the nuclear coordinates of the <b>chromophore</b> in ways closely analogous to the molecular vibrations considered by the Franck–Condon principle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Short DNA duplexes can be {{stabilized}} by {{the presence}} of organic <b>chromophores,</b> which serve as hairpin linkers or end-capping groups. Capped hairpins possessing one or more base pairs form stable folded structures in aqueous solution. Increasing the number of base pairs separating the two <b>chromophores</b> increases both the distance between the two <b>chromophores</b> and the dihedral angle between their electronic transition dipoles. Thus, du-plex DNA can serve as a helical scaffold for the study of electronic interactions between two <b>chromophores.</b> Three types of electronic interaction have been investigated: (a) exciton cou-pling (EC) between two identical <b>chromophores,</b> as probed by exciton-coupled circular dichroism (EC-CD); (b) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a fluores-cent donor and acceptor; and (c) photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between an electron donor and acceptor. EC and the efficiency of fluorescence energy transfer are dependent upon both the distance and dihedral angle separating the two <b>chromophores.</b> Electron transfer oc-curs via both single-step superexchange and bridge-mediated hopping mechanisms, neither of which displays angular dependence.

25|$|In the {{original}} Franck–Condon principle, after the electronic transition, the molecules which {{end up in}} higher vibrational states immediately begin to relax to the lowest vibrational state. In the case of solvation, the solvent molecules will immediately try to rearrange themselves {{in order to minimize}} the interaction energy. The rate of solvent relaxation depends on the viscosity of the solvent. Assuming the solvent relaxation time is short compared with the lifetime of the electronic excited state, emission will be from the lowest solvent energy state of the excited electronic state. For small-molecule solvents such as water or methanol at ambient temperature, solvent relaxation time is on the order of some tens of picoseconds whereas <b>chromophore</b> excited state lifetimes range from a few picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. Immediately after the transition to the ground electronic state, the solvent molecules must also rearrange themselves to accommodate the new electronic configuration of the <b>chromophore.</b> Figure 7 illustrates the Franck–Condon principle applied to solvation. When the solution is illuminated by with light corresponding to the electronic transition energy, some of the chromophores will move to the excited state. Within this group of chromophores there will be a statistical distribution of solvent-chromophore interaction energies, represented in the figure by a Gaussian distribution function. The solvent-chromophore interaction is drawn as a parabolic potential in both electronic states. Since the electronic transition is essentially instantaneous on the time scale of solvent motion (vertical arrow), the collection of excited state chromophores is immediately far from equilibrium. The rearrangement of the solvent molecules according to the new potential energy curve is represented by the curved arrows in Figure 7. Note that while the electronic transitions are quantized, the chromophore-solvent interaction energy is treated as a classical continuum due to the large number of molecules involved. Although emission is depicted as taking place from the minimum of the excited state chromophore-solvent interaction potential, significant emission can take place before equilibrium is reached when the viscosity of the solvent is high or the lifetime of the excited state is short. The energy difference between absorbed and emitted photons depicted in Figure 7 is the solvation contribution to the Stokes shift.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} retinal {{molecular}} pathway defects have been matched to multiple known RP gene mutations. Mutations in the rhodopsin gene, {{which is responsible}} for the majority of autosomal-dominantly inherited RP cases, disrupts the rod-opsin protein essential for translating light into decipherable electrical signals within the phototransduction cascade of the central nervous system. Defects in the activity of this G-protein-coupled receptor are classified into distinct classes that depend on the specific folding abnormality and the resulting molecular pathway defects. The Class I mutant protein's activity is compromised as specific point mutations in the protein-coding amino acid sequence affect the pigment protein's transportation into the outer segment of the eye, where the phototransduction cascade is localized. Additionally, the misfolding of Class II rhodopsin gene mutations disrupts the protein's conjunction with 11-cis-retinal to induce proper <b>chromophore</b> formation. Additional mutants in this pigment-encoding gene affect protein stability, disrupt mRNA integrity post-translationally, and affect the activation rates of transducin and opsin optical proteins.|$|E
