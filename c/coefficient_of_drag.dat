40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the properties of}} flows around objects embedded within common envelopes in the simplified context of a "wind tunnel. " We establish characteristic relationships between key common envelope flow parameters like the Mach number and density scale height. Our wind tunnel is a three-dimensional, cartesian geometry hydrodynamic simulation setup that includes {{the gravity of the}} primary and secondary stars and allows us to study the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>drag</b> and accretion experienced by the embedded object. Accretion and drag lead to a transformation of an embedded object and its orbit during a common envelope phase. We present two suites of simulations spanning a range of density gradients and Mach numbers [...] relevant for flow near the limb of a stellar envelope to the deep interior. In one suite, we adopt an ideal gas adiabatic exponent of γ= 5 / 3, in the other, γ= 4 / 3. We find that <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>drag</b> rise in flows with steeper density gradients and that <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>drag</b> and accretion are consistently higher in the more compressible, γ= 4 / 3 flow. We illustrate the impact of these newly derived coefficients by integrating the inspiral of a secondary object through the envelopes of 3 M_ (γ≈ 5 / 3) and 80 M_ (γ≈ 4 / 3) giants. In these examples, we find a relatively rapid initial inspiral because, near the stellar limb, dynamical friction drag is generated mainly from dense gas focussed from deeper within the primary-star's envelope. This rapid initial inspiral timescale carries potential implications for the timescale of transients from early common envelope interaction...|$|R

25|$|A {{rear spoiler}} usually comes {{standard}} in most sports vehicles and resembles {{the shape of}} a raised wing {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. The main purpose of a rear spoiler in a vehicle's design is to counteract lift, thereby increasing stability at higher speeds. In order to achieve the lowest possible drag, air must flow around the streamlined body of the vehicle without coming into contact with any areas of possible turbulence. A rear spoiler design that stands off the rear deck lid will increase downforce, reducing lift at high speeds while incurring a drag penalty. Flat spoilers, possibly angled slightly downward may reduce turbulence and thereby reduce the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>drag.</b> Some cars now feature automatically adjustable rear spoilers, so at lower speed the effect on drag is reduced when the benefits of reduced lift are not required.|$|E

Both are aspects of the ball performance that are experimentally intensive to obtain. The simulated flights show that the inclusion of spin degradation is important if flight validation is the objective, but that it may be unnecessary in a comparative study.
