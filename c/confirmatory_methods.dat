40|$|The {{application}} and utility of confirmatory second-order factor analytic methods are discussed. Factor analysis {{is central to}} concerns regarding measurement validity. <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>methods</b> are especially useful because they explicitly consider measurement error influences and because the methods are inherently theory-driven and theory-oriented. Secord-order <b>confirmatory</b> <b>methods,</b> which have not been applied with great frequency in the literature, allow the researcher to explore more thoroughly a reality that {{may be just as}} complex as are other formulated models. To make the explanation of applying confirmatory second-order methods more concrete, a data set involving responses of 487 undergraduates and graduate students (representing three pooled samples from previous research studies) to the Hendrick-Hendrick love instrument was analyzed for heuristic purposes.

40|$|Background &amp; objectives: Clinical {{laboratories}} need {{to develop}} quick screening methods for detection of Extended Spectrum ?-Lactamases (ESBL) &amp; Amplified C (AmpC) ?-Lactamase, so that the appropriate medication can be started without delay. Here, we reported the screening &amp; <b>confirmatory</b> <b>methods</b> for detection of ESBL &amp; AmpC in Klebsiella pneumoniae in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Methods: We had tested 600 blood culture samples from the NICU patients. From the positive bacterial isolates, Klebsiella pneumoniae were screened for ESBL &amp; AmpC production followed by <b>confirmatory</b> <b>methods</b> as per Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results: Out of the 600 blood culture, 266 were positive for microbial growth. Among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae were in 54 patients. Out of 54 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 48 were positive for ESBL in screening method. Out of 48, 41 isolates were ESBL positive &amp; 4 were AmpC positive by Confirmatory test (Modified Three Dimensional Method for AmpC). Interpretation &amp; conclusions: The prevalence of ESBL &amp; AmpC producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in NICU at our institute is 75. 92 % &amp; 7. 4 % which is very alarming, and it requires strict implementation of infection control guidelines in NICU by safe hygiene practices, restricted use of broad spectrum antibiotics as empirical therapy in septicemic cases and also formulation of uniform antibiotic policy for such patients based on the current trend of antibiotic resistance.

40|$|His {{study was}} {{performed}} to compare the methods of detection and to estimate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) among Klebsiella spp and E. coli in a university hospital in southern Brazil. We also used a molecular typing method to evaluate the genetic correlation between isolates of ESBL K. pneumoniae. Production of ESBL was investigated in 95 clinical isolates of Klebsiella spp and Escherichia coli from Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, using Kirby-Bauer zone diameter (KB), double-disk diffusion (DD), breakpoint for ceftazidime (MIC CAZ), increased zone diameter with clavulanate (CAZ/CAC) and ratio of ceftazidime MIC/ceftazidime-clavulanate MIC (MIC CAZ/CAC). Molecular typing was performed by DNA macrorestriction analysis followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The KB method displayed {{the highest rates of}} ESBL (up to 70 % of Klebsiella and 59 % of E. coli), contrasting with all the other methods (p < 0. 05). The <b>confirmatory</b> <b>methods</b> (DD, MIC CAZ, CAZ/CAC and MIC CAZ/CAC) showed a range of ESBL production from 8 to 13 % for E. coli and from 33 to 40 % for Klebsiella species. Therefore, the KB method was useful only as a screening method as it provided several false positive results. Molecular typing of 17 ESBL K. pneumoniae indicated that the isolates had no clonal relation. We found a good correlation among the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>methods</b> for ESBL detection although the methods which evaluate inhibition of the beta-lactamase by clavulanate appeared to be more specific. The high prevalence of ESBL Klebsiella in our hospital is probably due to individual selection of resistant strains rather than the transmission of a common strain...|$|E
