The injection of 100 s of eV plasma into a magnetic flux nozzle that converts thermal energy into directed thrust is fundamental to enabling 10 000 s of seconds specific impulse and 10 s of kW/kg specific power piloted interplanetary propulsion. An expression for the initial thickness of the interface is derived and found to be approx. 10 (exp - 2) m. An algorithm is reviewed and applied to compare classical resistivity to gradient-driven microturbulent (anomalous) resistivity, in terms of the spatial rate and time integral of resistive interface broadening, which can then be related to the geometry of the nozzle. An algorithm characterizing plasma temperature, density, and velocity dependencies is derived and found to be comparable to classical resistivity at local plasma temperatures of approx. 200 eV. Macroscopic flute-mode instabilities in regions of "adverse magnetic curvature" are discussed; a growth rate formula is derived and found to be one to two e-foldings of the most unstable Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) mode.

This thesis discusses {{the development of a}} pressurized gasification system that converts bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of red oak into producer gas.

Demonstration experiments using methanol resulted in development of experimental methods to show <b>critical</b> <b>nozzle</b> designs and their affects on gasification of liquid jets. Start up of the bio-oil gasification system was performed using methanol as a model fuel.

The plant started operation in the year 1985 and it is approaching the completion of its originally stipulated design life. In view of the excellent record of plant operation for the past so many years, it has been planned to carry out various exercises for the life extension of the plant. In the first stage, evaluation of operation stresses was carried out for the process critical piping layouts and equipment, which are connected with 25 process <b>critical</b> <b>nozzle</b> locations, identified based on past history of the plant performance. Fatigue life evaluation {{has been carried out}} to fmd out the Cumulative Usage Factor, which helps in arriving at a decision regarding the life extension of the plant.

40|$|This thesis investigates solid {{freeform}} fabrication of biological materials for dental restoration and orthopedic implant applications. The basic approach in this study for {{solid freeform}} fabrication of biological materials is micro-extrusion of single or multiple slurries for 3 D components and inkjet color printing of multiple suspensions for functionally graded materials (FGMs). Common issues associated with micro-extrusion and inkjet color printing are investigated. These common issues include (i) formulation of stable slurries with a pseudoplastic property, (ii) cross-sectional geometry of the extrudate {{as a function of}} the extrusion parameters, (iii) fabrication path optimization for extrusion process, (iv) extrusion optimization for multi-layer components, (v) composition control in functionally graded materials, and (vi) sintering optimization to convert the freeform fabricated powder compact to a dense body for biological applications. ^ The present study clearly shows that the rheological and extrusion behavior of dental porcelain slurries depend strongly on the pH value of the slurry and extrusion conditions. A slurry with pseudoplastic properties is a basic requirement for obtaining extruded lines with rectangular cross-sections. The cross-sectional geometry of the extrudate is also strongly affected by extrusion parameters including the extrusion nozzle height, nozzle moving speed, extrusion rate, and <b>critical</b> <b>nozzle</b> height. Proper combinations of these extrusion parameters are necessary in order to obtain single line extrudates with near rectangular cross-sections and 3 D objects with dimensional accuracy, uniform wall thickness, good wall uprightness, and no wall slumping. Based on these understandings, single-wall, multi-wall, and solid teeth have been fabricated via micro-extrusion of the dental slurry directly from a CAD digital model in 30 min. ^ Inkjet color printing using stable Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 aqueous suspensions has been developed to fabricate functionally graded materials. The volume and composition of the suspensions printed in droplets at a small area are controlled by the inkjet Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black color printing principle. The potential of this newly-developed method for fabricating FGMs with arbitrarily designed three-dimensional composition profiles is demonstrated. ^ Sintering investigation focuses on dental porcelain and hydroxyapatite (HA) bodies. Proper sintering conditions have been established for dental porcelain bodies to maintain dimensional accuracy and to prevent slumping. For sintering of HA bodies, a novel approach for sintering of HA bodies at temperatures as low as 900 °C has been developed. Low temperature sintering of HA bodies is critical for the success of fabricating functionally graded HA/Ti- 6 Al- 4 V materials for orthopedic implant applications because co-sintering of HA and Ti- 4 Al- 4 V at temperatures above 950 °C can result in the formation of soluble tricalcium phosphate and severe oxidation of Ti- 6 Al 4 V. The low temperature sintering of nanocrystalline HA developed in this study, based on the morphology driven anisotropic crystal coarsening mechanism, opens up the opportunity to fabricate functionally graded HA/Ti- 6 Al- 4 V materials with no decomposition of HA and oxidation of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and to improve the quality of HA coatings on Ti alloys. ...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with a study of certain phenomena related to the performance and design of distributors in gas fluidized beds with particular regard to flowback of solid particles. The work to be described {{is divided into two}} parts. I. In Part one, a review of published material pertaining to distribution plates, including details from the patent specifications, has been prepared. After a chapter on the determination of the incipient fluidizing velocity, the following aspects of multi-orifice distributor plates in gas fluidized beds have been studied: (i) The effect of the distributor on bubble formation related {{to the way in which}} even distribution of bubbles on the top surface of the fluidized bed is obtained, e. g. the desirable pressure drop ratio ?PD/?PB for the even distribution of gas across the bed. Ratios of distributor pressure drop ?PD to bed pressure drop at which stable fluidization occurs show reasonable agreement with industrial practice. There is evidence that larger diameter beds tend to be less stable than smaller diameter beds when these are operated with shallow beds. Experiments show that in the presence of the bed the distributor pressure drop is reduced relative to the pressure drop without the bed, and this pressure drop in the former condition is regarded as the appropriate parameter for the design of the distributor. (ii) Experimental measurements of bubble distribution at the surface has been used to indicate maldistribution within the bed. Maldistribution is more likely at low gas flow rates and with distributors having large fractional free area characteristics (i. e. with distributors having low pressure drops). Bubble sizes obtained from this study, as well as those of others, have been successfully correlated. The correlation produced implies the existence of a bubble at the surface of an orifice and its growth by the addition of excess gas from the fluidized bed. (iii) For a given solid system, the amount of defluidized particles stagnating on the distributor plate is influenced by the orifice spacing, bed diameter and gas flow rate, but independent of the initial bed height and the way the orifices are arranged on the distributor plate. II. In Part two, solids flowback through single and multi-orifice distributors in two-dimensional and cylindrical beds of solids fluidized with air has been investigated. Distributors equipped with long cylindrical nozzles have also been included in the study. An equation for the prediction of free flowback of solids through multi-orifice distributors has been derived. Under fluidized conditions two regimes of flowback have been differentiated, namely Jumping and weeping. Data in the weeping regime have been successfully correlated. The limiting gas velocity through the distributor orifices at which flowback is completely excluded is found to be indepnndent of bed height, but a function of distributor design and physical properties of gas and solid used. A criterion for the prediction of this velocity has been established. The decisive advantage of increasing the distributor thickness or using nozzles to minimize solids flowback in fluidized beds has been observed and the opportunity taken to explore this poorly studied subject area. It has been noted, probably for the first time, that with long nozzles, there exists a <b>critical</b> <b>nozzle</b> length above which uncontrollable downflow of solids occurs.

50|$|A {{hypersonic}} {{wind tunnel}} {{is designed to}} generate a hypersonic flow field in the working section, thus simulating the typical flow features of this flow regime - including compression shocks and pronounced boundary layer effects, entropy layer and viscous interaction zones and most importantly high total temperatures of the flow. The speed of these tunnels vary from Mach 5 to 15. The power requirement of a wind tunnel increases with the cross section, the flow density and is directly proportional to the third power of the test velocity. Hence installation of a continuous, {{closed circuit wind tunnel}} remains a costly affair. The first continuous Mach 7-10 wind tunnel with 1x1 m test section was planned at Kochel am See, Germany during WW II and finally put into operation as 'Tunnel A' in the late 1950s at AEDC Tullahoma, TN, USA for an installed power of 57 MW. In view of these high facility demands, also intermittently operated experimental facilities like blow-down wind tunnels are designed and installed to simulate the hypersonic flow. A hypersonic wind tunnel comprises in flow direction the main components: heater/cooler arrangements, dryer, convergent/divergent nozzle, test section, second throat and diffuser. A blow-down wind tunnel has a low vacuum reservoir at the back end, while a continuously operated, closed circuit wind tunnel has a high power compressor installation instead. Since the temperature drops with the expanding flow, the air inside the test section has the chance of becoming liquefied. For that reason, preheating is particularly <b>critical</b> (the <b>nozzle</b> may require cooling).|$|R

Previous studies have only considered using steam with high levels of superheat where it behaves more like an ideal gas. This present study considers steam with low levels of superheat and at wet saturated conditions. The isentropic real gas flow coefficient, which is needed for the calculation of the flow through a sonic nozzle, has been obtained using the equations of state for steam. Tables of the flow coefficient for both superheated and saturated steam have been produced. It is shown how, at pressures above 7 bar, superheat is required to prevent condensation of the steam before the nozzle throat. Experimental calibration tests have been carried out using superheated steam with pressures up to 10 bar; these suggest that the nozzle can be used, in conjunction with the tables produced herein, to measure the flow rate of steam with an accuracy of Â± 2. 5, although some of {{this is due to the}} uncertainty in the calibration rig and in the variables in tile nozzle equation.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. A nozzle design tool for real gases has been devised for investigating the features of gasdynamic nozzles operating with supercritical or close to critical carbon dioxide. Three exemplary real-gas expansions, originating from a reservoir at a temperature of 400 K and at a pressure of 10, 5 and 1 MPa, respectively, were considered and compared to the corresponding dilute gas case, for which reservoir conditions are 400 K and 0. 1 MPa. Differently from the well­-known ideal-gas results, the nozzle shape depends on the reservoir or total flow conditions and therefore diverse designs are obtained for a given exit Mach number depending on the relative location of the initial state in the volume­-pressure thermodynantic plane {{with respect to the}} liquid­-vapor saturation curve. For flow states close to the liquid­-vapor saturation curve and <b>critical</b> point, the <b>nozzle</b> length and height are larger than the corresponding ideal gas designs. Differences are as large as 17 % for the divergent length and 18. 4 % for the nozzle height. More relevant differences are found for the mass flow, which for high pressure exceeds its ideal gas value by two order of magnitudes. This difference is mainly due to the effect of the density, which is increases with increasing reservoir density. ej 201...|$|R
40|$|Small {{pressure}} perturbations in the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) {{are caused}} by the periodic expulsion of molten aluminum oxide slag from a pool that collects in the aft end of the motor around the submerged nozzle nose during {{the last half of}} motor operation. It is suspected that some motors produce more slag than others due to differences in aluminum oxide agglomerate particle sizes that may relate to subtle differences in propellant ingredient characteristics such as particle size distributions or processing variations. A subscale motor experiment was designed to determine the effect of propellant ingredient characteristics on the propensity for slag production. An existing 5 inch ballistic test motor was selected as the basic test vehicle. The standard converging/diverging nozzle was replaced with a submerged nose nozzle design to provide a positive trap for the slag that would increase the measured slag weights. Two-phase fluid dynamic analyses were performed to develop a nozzle nose design that maintained similitude in major flow field features with the full scale RSRM. The 5 inch motor was spun about its longitudinal axis to further enhance slag collection and retention. Two-phase flow analysis was used to select an appropriate spin rate along with other considerations, such as avoiding bum rate increases due to radial acceleration effects. Aluminum oxide particle distributions used in the flow analyses were measured in a quench bomb for RSRM type propellants with minor variations in ingredient characteristics. Detailed predictions for slag accumulation weights during motor bum compared favorably with slag weight data taken from defined zones in the subscale motor and nozzle.

40|$|Continuous caster moulds are {{the last}} and most {{important}} stage in the steelmaking process, where inclusions can either be generated or removed. With increasing casting speed using conventional immersion <b>nozzles</b> <b>critical</b> problems, such as unstable bulk mould flow have been noticed. Mould flux entrapment due to vortex and shearing action from the oscillating surface waves have become of particular concern. It is therefore necessary to have a calm inlet flow {{at the entrance of}} the mould. Recently, it has been acknowledged that a swirl blade placed at the upstream of the immersion nozzle effectively resolves the problems arising from unstable bulk mould flow. Therefore, to increase the knowledge of effect of swirling flow on the flow pattern in the mould, fundamental mathematical models of a billet mould equipped with a swirl blade in the nozzle have been developed. The model was used to study the effect of divergent angle of the immersion nozzle and mould aspect ratio on the flow field and temperature distribution inside billets moulds. Data from water model experiments were used to verify the mathematical model predictions. A fairly good agreement was found between physical modeling data and predictions, which ensured that the numerical model is reliable. Thereafter, the differences between square and round billet moulds were studied. Next, the effect of changing aspect ratio of the rectangular mould on the fluid flow and heat transfer, while keeping mould surface area constant, was studied. Two types of immersion nozzles, bottomless and conventional, were also analyzed during the research. The model moulds were changed gradually from a square billet with an aspect ratio of 1 x 1 to a rectangular billet with an aspect ratio of 3 x 1. First, the temperature and velocity distributions were calculated. Later, unsteady calculations were done to determine velocity fluctuations on the meniscus level for two types of nozzles and several moulds geometries. QC 20101110 </p...|$|R
