5000|$|The cockerel [...] "waltz", {{when the}} cockerel struts {{in a half}} circle with one wing {{extended}} down, is an aggressive approach signifying to females his dominance, and usually, the female will submit by running or {{moving away from the}} cockerel in acknowledgement. On rare occasions, the hen will attempt to fight the <b>cockerel</b> <b>for</b> dominance. Once dominance is established, the cockerel will rarely waltz again. When other cockerels are in the hen yard, this waltz is used significantly more and most cockerels will waltz together if dominance has not been established; either one will back off, or the two cockerels will fight. Note also that the cockerel will waltz again if he is taken out of the pen for a period, usually 24 hours, and put back.|$|R

40|$|Motivations <b>for</b> <b>sex</b> are {{numerous}} and varied (Browning, 2004; Meston 2 ̆ 6 Buss, 2007). Using exploratory factor analytic methods, 21 theoretically distinct motivations {{have been proposed}} (Browning, 2004; Meston 2 ̆ 6 Buss, 2007). A comprehensive number of motivations <b>for</b> <b>sex</b> {{has yet to be}} examined with confirmatory techniques. Theoretical work related to the treatment of sexual dysfunction has suggested that motivations focused on individual and partner pleasure would positively relate to sexual functioning (e. g., Leiblum 2 ̆ 6 Rosen, 1992). Motivations <b>for</b> <b>sex</b> also appear to vary as a function of ethnocultural factors, as some motivations have only been uncovered utilizing qualitative methods with diverse samples (Browning, 2004) and some ethnic groups appear to differ in the average degree to which they endorse specific motivations (Browning; 2004; Cooper et al., 1998). The current study expanded on previous literature by examining four distinct aims: (1) to confirm a comprehensive number of motivations <b>for</b> <b>sex,</b> (2) to examine ethnic differences in motivations <b>for</b> <b>sex</b> among the four largest ethnic groups in the U.

40|$|Abstract − Recent {{discussions on}} roboethics have {{introduced}} {{the subject of}} sex with robots.

The very high cost of the early generations of sexually functioning robots will cause the hire of robots <b>for</b> <b>sex,</b> rather than their purchase, to become commonplace. The most often stated motivations <b>for</b> hiring human <b>sex</b> workers are discussed in relation to how these motivations could be satisfied by robots. Five ethical aspects of robot prostitution are introduced and discussed. “I pay <b>for</b> <b>sex</b> because that is the only way I can get sex.

In this paper we evaluate the utility of four different PCR-based sex determination techniques using genomic DNA <b>for</b> <b>sexing</b> Magellanic Penguins.

Additionally, we obtained discriminant functions <b>for</b> <b>sexing</b> adults and chicks, sampled at six colonies differing in size and other ecological characteristics. Discriminant function for adults used two variables, bill length and bill depth that correctly classified 97 % of the birds. Discriminant function for chicks included bill length and flipper length and correctly classified 78 % of the individuals. Although molecular and biometric approaches could be useful <b>for</b> <b>sexing</b> adult Magellanic Penguins, only molecular procedures proved appropriate <b>for</b> accurately <b>sexing</b> chicks.
