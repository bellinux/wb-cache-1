5|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy {{convened a}} {{commission}} to investigate the explosion {{the day after the}} incident with Vice Admiral Murakami Kakuichi as chairman. The commission first suspected arson, but no plausible suspect could be found and it reported that the cordite in her magazine might have spontaneously ignited due to decomposition. Kawachis magazines had been inspected in January–February 1918, however, and no problems were discovered, which made that possibility less likely. The commission made recommendations on tighter <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and handling of cordite that were successfully adopted by the navy. The Japanese Navy considered salvaging Kawachi, but ultimately decided that it would be too expensive and would delay the construction of one battlecruiser by over a year. Stricken from the navy list on 21 September 1918, the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an artificial reef.|$|E

Likewise, he envisaged independent Ireland as a socialist republic. His connection and views on Revolutionary Unionism and Syndicalism have raised debate on if his image for a workers republic would be one of State or Grassroots socialism. During his lifetime he was a supporter of syndicalism and was most strongly influenced by the Marxist school of De Leonism (though he had his own take on it), dying a year before the emergence of the Russian Revolution and Leninism.|$|E
25|$|Inter-service rivalry also {{hampered}} {{the development}} of German naval air doctrine. The Navy was unwilling to cooperate too closely with the army in aerial manoeuvres. The former Luftstreitkräfte (Air Service) officers, now employed in the army, knew that the naval staff had been the main opponents {{of the creation of}} an independent air arm. The navy resented the Luftstreitkräfte in turn for its <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and development of aircraft during the war. The German naval staff also resented the army's unwillingness to support naval logistics and {{the development of}} naval aviation requirements. Commander-in-chief of the Reichsmarine Admiral Hans Zenker was also wary of the Reichstag's attitude toward the navy and the very need for a fleet of any kind was in question. Zenker was certain that if cooperation with the army was too close, the navy maybe placed under army command.|$|E

2500|$|The Star Cycle Company run by Lisle's son, {{also called}} Edward, had {{continued}} in business building bicycles and motorcycles and in 1905 entered the car industry {{in its own}} right. The company was affected by the deep depression that hit the bicycle industry in 1905. In order to combat the decline in sales Star decided to produce a cheaper car called the 'Starling' that sold for £110. Although the name of these cars was changed to 'Stuart' the 'Starling name was readopted in 1907 and production continued until 1909. In 1907, there was a 1296cc (79ci) single and a 1531cc (94ci) twin and the Stuart (Starling after 1907), with chassis from Hopper, a Barton-on-Humber cycle maker (which sold them as Torpedoes). The decision was taken in 1909 to make the Star Engineering Company a limited liability company with the Star Cycle Company becoming a subsidiary company. Joseph Lisle, one of Edward's sons, was appointed {{managing director of the}} company. To avoid confusion a new company, the Briton Motor Company was formed in 1909 and the products were badged as Britons. Briton took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of the 'Starling' and 'Stuart' and the first two cars were a 2282cc (139ci) 12hp twin and a 2413cc (147ci) 14hp four; the [...] became available as a Star in 1910.|$|E
2500|$|At the studio's {{annual sales}} meeting in June 1937, Briskin {{announced}} that Marcus' {{position within the}} organization would remain unchanged for the upcoming 1937-38 season. Marcus was responsible for overseeing {{about half of the}} overall production for RKO. Briskin, rather than giving Marcus a budgeted amount for each picture, simply gave Marcus an overall lump sum with which he was responsible for completing all his filming assignments. This was an effort {{to do away with the}} practice of grading pictures as either [...] "A" [...] or [...] "B" [...] films. When Briskin departed RKO in the Fall of 1937, Marcus retained his position, although there was some discussion of him replacing Berman. His name was on a short list, along with David O. Selznick, Mervyn LeRoy, Ben Kahane, and Jesse L. Lasky. When that didn't materialize, by the beginning of 1938 there was talk that he would split the head production activities of the studio with Pandro S. Berman, with Marcus in charge of B-films and Berman in charge of A-films. By the end of February 1938 that arrangement was made official by Leo Spitz, the new president of RKO, and in August Marcus was given a new three-year contract with the studio. In 1938 RKO created a new type of motion picture, the exploitation film, in response to potential issues from the Hays commission and the National Legion of Decency about the number of crime dramas which were being produced by the studios. One of the first was Smashing the Rackets (1938), after which Marcus suggested two other exploitation films, Clip Joint and Strip Tease. Neither had either social significance or artistic value, but were conceived solely to drive viewers through the turnstiles. While they perfectly fit the bill of what Spitz was looking for, he passed on making either film. When Berman was replaced by Harry Eddington in December 1939 as the head of A-film production, Marcus remained in charge of RKO's B product. In 1940, Marcus produced what many consider the first film noir, Stranger on the Third Floor. Marcus remained in charge of the low-budget films at RKO until February 19, 1941, when studio head George J. Schaefer assumed total <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> demoting both Eddington and Marcus. Marcus was relegated to being simply a studio producer. Marcus lasted three months in his new position, resigning from RKO at the end of April, 1941.|$|E
