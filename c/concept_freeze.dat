40|$|To better {{understand}} the impact of early versus late design decisions, a study was undertaken on {{the root causes of}} missed requirements in new product development and their impact on development cost through rework activities. The context is the industrial development of unmanned aerial vehicles. The aim is to understand the occurrence rate of missed requirements, their root causes, and their relative impact. A quantitative approach of counting requirements changes and using engineering documentation enabled traceability from observation back to root cause origin. The development process was partitioned into sequential program segments, to categorize activities to before and after concept and design freeze. We found that {{there was a significant difference}} in the rate of design defects arising before and after concept freeze; and found there was a significantly higher number of corrective activities required for design defects arising earlier before <b>concept</b> <b>freeze.</b> The revision rate of concept phase decisions was over 50 %, and the rework multiplier if detected late was over 10 X. In combination, design decisions made before design freeze accounted for 86 % of the total expected program cost, and 34 % was determined before <b>concept</b> <b>freeze.</b> These results quantify and support the anecdotal 80 - 20 impact rule for design decisions.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} has pointed out {{the need for a}} contingent approach in the design of new product development processes, highlighting the risk of simply accepting a normative perspective that leads to the identification and diffusion of decontextualized ‘‘best practices. ’’ In the literature there are contrasting views regarding the identification of the characteristics of product innovation processes in extremely uncertain and dynamic conditions. Some studies propose a fascinating dichotomy: the contraposition between flexible processes and Stage-Gates processes. They maintain that Stage-Gates processes are characterized by ‘‘early and sharp’’ product definition and clear separation between concept development and implementation (detail design and production ramp-up), whereas flexible development models seek to delay the <b>concept</b> <b>freeze</b> point and overlap product development stages going beyond concurrent engineering. Other studies have arrived at seemingly conflicting results; the suitability of the early and sharp product definition approach in turbulent environments is debated without supporting the dichotomy between flexible processes and Stage-Gates processes. Moreover, additional reasons for questioning the contraposition between Stage-Gates and flexible processes come from a series of studies on the management of discontinuous innovation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop a conceptual framework that can overcome this widely accepted but controversial dichotomy. The framework is based on the recognition of the orthogonality among three analytical dimensions: organizational, informational, and temporal. The organizational dimension refers to the structuration of the process. The informational dimension deals with classifying the development activities and investigating the firm’s product definition approach (early and sharp mode vs. late freeze mode). The temporal dimension relates to the execution strategies of development tasks. The three-dimensional framework enables us to better understand the complex relationships between the degree of structuration in process design (organizational dimension), the degree of intersection between problem- formulation and problem-solving in product definition (informational dimension), and different types of execution strategies (temporal dimension) ...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{innovation}} in turbulent environments (e. g., in environments with extreme uncertainty and complexity in market needs and technological opportunities) {{is a major}} challenge. A recent stream of studies in the management literature has suggested that when facing turbulent environments, firms should deploy more flexible develop- ment processes. This paper approaches this issue {{by looking at the}} Italian mobile telecommunications (TLC) industry. Nine in-depth case studies were conducted in five different companies. Data analysis showed some important results. First of all envi- ronmental turbulence should be considered to be project specific rather than company or industry specific. Moreover, it can come from both shift in the market needs and in the technology. Nevertheless, it seems clear that having rapid changes is not enough to have environmental turbulence. If rapid changes can be somehow foreseen, there is no turbulence at all. Hence, when approaching projects in potentially turbulent environ- ments, managers should assess both rapidity and unpredictability of the environment. Finally, looking at the in-depth cases, the paper points out what of the main practices to increase flexibility that are described in literature are actually adopted by compa- nies. In case of turbulence (both in the market and/or in the technology) companies delay <b>concept</b> <b>freezing</b> point. Moreover, in the case of technological turbulence, they also leverage on rapid project iterations, whereas in case of market turbulence they more likely adopt early experiments involving customers, formal and cross-functional project teams, and flat organizational structures...|$|R
40|$|The <b>concept</b> of <b>freeze</b> out volume {{used in many}} {{statistical}} {{approaches for}} disassembly of hot nuclei leads to ambiguities. The fragmentation pattern and the momentum distribution (temperature) of the emanated fragments {{are determined by the}} phase space at the freeze-out volume where the interaction among the fragments is supposedly frozen out. However, to get coherence with the experimental momentum distribution of the charged particles, one introduces Coulomb acceleration beyond this freeze-out. To be consistent, we investigate the effect of the attractive nuclear force beyond this volume and find that the possible recombination of the fragments alters the physical observables significantly casting doubt on the consistency of the statistical model.

40|$|YesIn this work, a novel <b>concept</b> in <b>freeze</b> {{desalination}} (FD) was introduced. Nowadays {{the total}} {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) production capacity has reached 290 Megatons per year. Its enormous cold energy released from re-gasification {{can be used in}} the freeze desalination process to minimize the overall energy consumption. A process of FD on flake ice maker utilizing LNG cold energy was designed and simulated by HYSYS software. An ice bucket on flake ice maker was chosen as seawater crystallizer mainly due to its continuous ice making and removing ice without heat source. A dynamic model of the freezing section has been developed and simulated through gPROMS software. The results show that the consumption of 1 kg equivalent LNG cold energy can obtain about 2 kg of ice melt water. In addition, it is shown that the power consumption of this LNG/FD hybrid process is negligible...|$|R

40|$|The {{controlled}} cooling of biological materials to subzero temperatures involves passage through several phases: the liquid aqueous phase, the aqueous to ice transformation or {{heat of fusion}} phase, anti the solid ice phase. Cooling rate in the liquid phase prior to entering the heat of fusion-transformation phase appears to be of least significance in most biological systems. The time in-volved for liquid to solid (aqueous to ice) phase transformation and concomitant {{latent heat of fusion}} removal appears to be of considerable biological significance. Decreasing biological viability is obtained as the duration of the specimen in the heat of fusion phase is prolonged, presumably due to prolonged exposure to dehydration effects of water-ice crystals and increased concentration of solutes. Rate of heat removal in the post-heat of fusion solid state is also important in maintaining viability of the biological specimen. Experimental biological evidence supports these contentions and provides a basis upon which to formulate and verify some basic <b>concepts</b> of <b>freezing</b> injury...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{organic polymer}} {{chemistry}} {{has been successful}} in producing composition of matter with thermal oxidation stability and progressively higher glass transition temperatures. In part, this was done by increasing the steric-hindrance of moieties in the chain of a macromolecule. The resulting polymers are usually quite insoluble and produce molten polymers of very high viscosities. These types of polymers are not easily processed into graphite fiber prepregs by melt or solution impregnation methods. Hence, a technological need exists to produce new knowledge of how to produce polymer-fiber composites from this class of polymers. The <b>concept</b> of <b>freeze</b> drying amic-acid prepolymers with reactive thermoplastic was proposed as a research topic for the ASEE/NASA Summer Faculty Program of 1989 as a means of producing polymer-fiber composites. This process scheme has the thermodynamic attribute that the magnitude of phase separation due to differences in solubility of two organic constituents in solution will be greatly reduced by removing a solvent not by evaporation but by sublimation. Progress to date on evaluating this polymer processing concept is briefly outlined...|$|R
40|$|Microalgae {{currently}} receive growing {{attention as}} promising candidates for future bio-economy concepts. However, the reliable maintenance of production strains remains challenging. The well-established serial subculturing techniques suffer from low long-time stability and high effort {{and are therefore}} stepwise being replaced by cryopreservation. Currently, available protocols are often deduced from cell culture technology and are rather complex. This study aimed to investigate if less complex approaches can be applied. We introduce an easy-to-use cryopreservation protocol based on the model organism Chlorella vulgaris. To overcome error-prone viability estimation by plating techniques, an alternative method using growth pattern analysis was developed. As revealed by growth pattern analysis, the preservation of stationary phase cells proved superior to the commonly applied <b>concept</b> of <b>freezing</b> cells from the growing phase. Controlled-rate cooling using simple devices resulted in reproducibly high post-thawing viabilities {{in the range of}} 63 ± 2 %. Moreover, the presented protocol highlights the potential of simplifying microalgal cryo-preservation procedures, thereby reducing the required labor and material need to a minimum. Apart from the viability analysis of the cryopreserved microalga C. vulgaris, this approach seems to have the potential to be applied for other algae species and microorganisms, as well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Throughout {{the first}} term of the Reagan administra-tion, the nuclear freeze {{movement}} headlined the news and scored numerous political victories. Hundreds {{of state and local}} govern-ments, as well as the U. S. House of Representatives, passed resolutions in support of the freeze. Public opinion polls {{played a major role in}} the debate, as the media and freeze advocates cited numerous polls indicating overwhelming public support for the initiative. Yet a comprehensive and detailed examination of national polls reveals that public support for the freeze came heavily qualified. While Americans expressed strong support for the basic <b>concept</b> of a <b>freeze,</b> they expressed doubts about the possibility of a verifiable and balanced freeze agreement. Further-more, the public doubted that the Soviet Union genuinely desired such an agreement. Most surprisingly, the public did not pay much attention to the debate. Few Americans claimed to kno...|$|R
40|$|The {{freezing}} {{of ground}} for the containment of subsurface hazardous waste is a promising method that is environmentally friendly and offers a safe alternative to other methods of waste retention in many cases. The frozen soil method offers two concepts for retaining waste. One <b>concept</b> is to <b>freeze</b> the entire waste area into a solid block of frozen soil thus locking the waste in situ. For small areas where the contaminated soil does not include vessels that would rupture from frost action, this concept may be simpler to install. A second concept, of course, {{is to create a}} frozen soil barrier to confine the waste within prescribed unfrozen soil boundaries; initial research in this area was funded by EPA, Cincinnati, OH, and the Army Corps of Engineers. The paper discusses advantages and limitations, a case study from Oak Ridge, TN, and a mesh generation program that simulates the cryogenic technology...|$|R

40|$|Freezing {{behavior}} of wood tissue of red osier dogwood (Cornus sericea L.) cannot {{be explained by}} current <b>concepts</b> of <b>freezing</b> resistance. Previous studies indicated that water in wood tissue presumably froze extracellularly. However, {{it was observed that}} xylem ray parenchyma cells within these tissues could survive temperatures as low as - 80 [deg]C and the walls of these cells did not collapse during freezing (S. R. Malone and E. N. Ashworth [1991] Plant Physiol 95 : 871 - 881). This observation was unexpected and is inconsistent with the current hypothesis of cell response during freezing. Hence, the objective of our study was to further examine the mechanism of freezing resistance of wood tissue of red osier dogwood. We studied freezing stress response of xylem ray parenchyma cells of red osier dogwood using freeze substitution and transmission electron microscopy. Wood samples were collected in winter, spring, and summer of 1992. Specimens were cooled from 0 [deg]C to - 60 [deg]C at 5 [deg]C/h. Freezing stress did not affect the structural organization of wood tissue. However, the xylem ray parenchyma cells showed two unique responses to a freezing stress: protoplasm contraction and protoplasm fragmentation. Protoplasm contraction was evident at all freezing temperatures and in tissues collected at different times of the year. Cells with fragmented protoplasm, however, were noticed only in tissues collected in spring and summer. Protoplasm contraction in winter tissue occurred without apparent damage to the protoplasm. In contrast, protoplasm contraction in spring and summer tissues was accompanied by substantial damage. No evidence of intracellular ice formation was observed in parenchyma cells exposed to freezing stress. Differences in protoplasm contraction and appearance of cells with fragmented protoplasm likely indicated seasonal changes in cold hardiness of the wood tissue of red osier dogwood. We speculate that the appearance of fragmented protoplasm may indicate that cells are being injured by an alternative mechanism in spring and summer...|$|R
40|$|Using the freeze-melting {{process for}} the {{disposing}} of high saline brines was {{the aim of the}} paper by confirming the performance estimation of the treatment system. A laboratory bench scale freezing technique test unit was designed, constructed, and tested at Doha Research Plant (DRP) in Kuwait. The principal unit operations that have been considered for the laboratory study are: ice crystallization, separation, washing, and melting. The applied process is characterized as “the secondary-refrigerant indirect freezing”, which is utilizing normal <b>freezing</b> <b>concept.</b> The high saline brine was used as definite feed water, i. e. average TDS of 250, 000 ppm. Kuwait desalination plants were carried out in the experimental study to measure the performance of the proposed treatment system. Experimental analysis shows that the freeze-melting process is capable of dropping the TDS of the feed water from 249, 482 ppm to 56, 880 ppm of the freeze-melting process in the two-phase’s course, whereas overall recovery results of the salt passage and salt rejection are 31. 11 %, 19. 05 %, and 80. 95 %, correspondingly. Therefore, the freeze-melting process is encouraging for the proposed application, as it shows on the results, which approves the process capability of reducing a major amount of the dissolved salts of the high saline brine with reasonable sensible recovery. This process might be reasonable with other brine disposal processes...|$|R
40|$|Astrophysical fluids are generically {{turbulent}} {{and this}} {{must be taken into}} account for most transport processes. We discuss how the preexisting turbulence modifies magnetic reconnection and how magnetic reconnection affects the MHD turbulent cascade. We show the intrinsic interdependence and interrelation of magnetic turbulence and magnetic reconnection, in particular, that strong magnetic turbulence in 3 D requires reconnection and 3 D magnetic turbulence entails fast reconnection. We follow the approach in Eyink, Lazarian & Vishniac 2011 to show that the expressions of fast magnetic reconnection in Lazarian & Vishniac 1999 can be recovered if Richardson diffusion of turbulent flows is used instead of ordinary Ohmic diffusion. This does not revive, however, the concept of magnetic turbulent diffusion which assumes that magnetic fields can be mixed up in a passive way down to a very small dissipation scales. On the contrary, we are dealing the reconnection of dynamically important magnetic field bundles which strongly resist bending and have well defined mean direction weakly perturbed by turbulence. We argue that in the presence of turbulence the very concept of flux-freezing requires modification. The diffusion that arises from magnetic turbulence can be called reconnection diffusion as it based on reconnection of magnetic field lines. The reconnection diffusion has important implications for the continuous transport processes in magnetized plasmas and for star formation. In addition, fast magnetic reconnection in turbulent media induces the First order Fermi acceleration of energetic particles, can explain solar flares and gamma ray bursts. However, the most dramatic consequence of these developments is the fact that the standard flux <b>freezing</b> <b>concept</b> must be radically modified in the presence of turbulence.
