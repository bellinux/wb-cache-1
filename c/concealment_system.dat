The theories research show that the orthogonal projection sequence of a digital image is one-to-one correspondence with this digital image. By this conclusion, we designed a novel blind watermark detector. In this detector, to calculate the correlation value between the image and watermark, the intensity information of digital image is not used, and the orthogonal projection sequence of this image is used. Experiment results show that this watermark detector not only to have very strong resistant ability to translation and rotation attacks, but also to have the good robustness to Gaussian noise. Performance of this watermark detector is better than general detector designed by the intensity information directly. The conclusions of this paper are useful to the research in the future.

40|$|Error {{concealment}} in packet-loss-corrupted {{streaming video}} is in-herently an under-determined problem, {{as there are}} insufficient num-ber of well-defined criteria to recover the missing blocks perfectly. When a Region-of-Interest (ROI) based unequal error protection (UEP) scheme is deployed during video streaming—i. e., more vi-sually salient regions are strongly protected—a lost block {{is likely to be}} of low saliency in the original frame. In this paper, we propose to add a low-saliency prior to the error concealment problem as a reg-ularization term. It serves two purposes. First, in ROI-based UEP video streaming, low-saliency prior provides the right side informa-tion for the client to identify the correct replacement blocks for con-cealment. Second, in the event that a perfectly matched block cannot be unambiguously identified, the low-saliency prior reduces viewer’s visual attention on the loss-stricken region, resulting in higher over-all subjective quality. We study the effectiveness of a low-saliency prior in the con-text of a previously proposed RECAP [1] error <b>concealment</b> <b>system.</b> RECAP transmits a low-resolution (LR) version of an image along-side the original high-resolution (HR) version, so that if blocks in the HR version are lost, the correctly-received LR version can serve as a template for matching of suitable replacement blocks from a previ-ously correctly-decoded HR frame. We add a low-saliency prior to the block identification process, so that only replacement candidate blocks with good match and low saliency can be selected. Further, we design and apply four saliency reduction operators iteratively in a loop, {{in order to reduce the}} saliency of candidate blocks. Exper-imental results show that: i) PSNR of the error-concealed frames can be increased dramatically (up to 3. 2 dB over the original RE-CAP), showing the effectiveness of a low-saliency prior in the under-determined error concealment problem; and ii) subjective quality of the repaired video using our proposal, as confirmed by an extensive user study, is better than the original RECAP.

40|$|Summary. The {{computer}} is most certain the best effective tool ever created for mankind. It has brought solutions and shortcuts {{in order to}} make life simpler. Because of its enormous <b>concealment</b> computers <b>systems</b> security, meaning the hardware and what is stored inside it, is threatened every second. Our concernment is about how these threats and risks directly affect other computer systems and software. We need to be in control of how to improve the security, and most importantly, how to improve it without making it less user friendly. Before we actually can deal with problems, we have to survey what threats and risks we might face. We have to calculate and evaluate the likelihood of things which might go wrong and how this {{will have an impact on}} our system. In order to do all this we have to make use of risk analyses and security seeking techniques. This thesis presents CORAS analysis, which is a method for risk analyses, and Markov chains, which is a method for probability estimation. The context of the work has been to introduce the idea of an active relation between CORAS diagrams and Markov chains. We have seen through different scenarios if and how they can be related. The result of this thesis is a method including simulation of the system on the basis of CORAS threat diagrams, that produces the needed values to use Markov chains to calculate the probability...|$|R
