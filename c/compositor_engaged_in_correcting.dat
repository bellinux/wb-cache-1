Of the 215 million lei demanded by the new administration in order to cover its expenses, 86 were owed by the capital. After the Compiègne Armistice, German troops evacuated Bucharest, and a Romanian administration was reinstated in late November 1918. As the country was embarking on the course that {{led to the creation of}} a Greater Romania (confirmed by the treaties of Saint-Germain, Neuilly and Trianon), its capital witnessed a relatively expanded social crisis - on December 26, 1918, troops fired on <b>compositors</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> a strike, who had been agitated by the newly created Socialist Party of Romania.|$|R

Our corpus includes chat conversations which took place between LSP students <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>correcting</b> errors <b>in</b> their peers’ summaries. The participants worked in groups and used the Windows Messenger program for communication within the group. Their task also included making use of electronic dictionaries and other reference materials. The conversations’ corpus obtained {{as a result of}} this exercise was analyzed holistically for possible indicators of each particular stage of the problem solving process. Later these indicators were validated throughout the entire corpus. Each problem solving process was thus represented as a chain of indicators and acceptability was determined for each error correction. The resulting problem solving chains were used to prove our hypotheses concerning internal and external support in text reproduction...|$|R

5000|$|In July 1905, Potter was <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>correcting</b> proofs for The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle when Warne {{proposed}} marriage {{by letter}} on 25 July. Potter accepted the same day. A firestorm was unleashed in the Potter household: her parents vehemently objected to her union {{with a man}} they considered their social inferior, a tradesman without professional accomplishment. Potter regarded her parents objections as hypocritical and unreasonable because both sets of her grandparents had been tradesmen <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> the cotton trade. At some point, Warne and Potter exchanged rings but Potter ceded to her parents' demands and {{did not make a}} public announcement. The engagement would be a family secret. Meanwhile, Norman returned from a sales trip to Manchester very ill, and was ordered to complete bed rest on 29 July. Potter last saw him on 22 July before leaving on 4 August for a sketching trip to Wales. Warne died in his bedroom in Bedford Square on 25 August of lymphatic leukaemia, a disease difficult to diagnose at that time. He was 37. His burial was held on 29 August in Highgate Cemetery in London. Potter had been summoned to London on the 25th by the Warnes but did not arrive until the 27th. Her grief was immeasurable. In December she sent Warne's sister Millie a watercolour sketch of a barley field she had completed the evening before Warne's death: [...] "I try to think of the golden sheaves, and harvest," [...] she wrote, [...] "he did not live long but fulfilled a useful happy life." ...|$|R

Participants were trained to identify the critical and non-critical features of human trafficking and safe ways to respond to identified trafficking situations.

This included written responses as well as simulation assessments across five different trafficking scenarios. Results indicate that all participants <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> more <b>correct</b> responding within the written assessment and asked specific relevant questions with greater confidence within the simulation assessment following training.

Results are discussed in the context of instructional design, measurement of outcomes, and interdisciplinary collaboration...|$|R
40|$|Anti-individualism (externalism about mental content) is {{in tension}} with epistemic transparency. Rationality {{involves}} {{the ability to}} reliably <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>correct</b> univocal reasoning. Mental content is epistemically transparent iff the ability to reason univocally can always apriori produce correct univocal reasoning and avoid equivocation. Anti-individualism holds that relations between a thinker's mental states and environment partially individuate those mental states' contents. A consequence of anti-individualism is that the contents of one thinker's different mental states can differ from one another solely because those mental states differently relate to the environment. Such a thinker could not on apriori grounds alone avoid equivocating between these different contents; anti-individualism contradicts transparency. I argue that content is epistemically translucent: in any normal situation, a rational thinker can always apriori produce correct univocal reasoning and avoid equivocation. John Campbell and Ruth Millikan advance anti-individualist views on which univocal reasoning is empirically warranted. Paul Boghossian has suggested rejecting anti-individualism because of its incompatibility with transparency. All of these positions neglect the possibility of translucent content. Anti-individualist views advanced by Krista Lawlor and Mikkel Gerken are friendlier to transparency. But these views do not explain the warrant for univocal reasoning. They fail to distinguish the contributions made to an attitude's content by reasoning capacities from those made by the attitude's relations to the environment. I provide such a distinction. Reason can establish that different representations have the function of having the same content. Then, equivocation is produced only by abnormal mistakes about the identities of entities in the environment. In a normal environment, a thinker's logical reasoning powers can on apriori grounds alone produce correct univocal reasoning and avoid equivocation. Reason cannot guarantee that its contributions to a thinker's conceptual activity always match the world's contribution. Reason can only be sensitive to evidence of abnormality, and, {{in the absence of}} such evidence, produce cognitive structures that would function correctly in a normal environment. In very abnormal identity mistakes, different attitudes have such different causal relations to the environment that those causal relations overwhelm reason's contribution, and differently type the attitudes. Lacking evidence of abnormality, rational equivocation ensues...|$|R

But Bostick [...] "would not have felt free to leave the bus even if the police had not been present.

40|$|Since {{problem solving}} {{is the heart}} of “doing science”, it is an {{essential}} skill for success in many science courses. In this presentation I will discuss an instructional technique that <b>engages</b> students <b>in</b> <b>correcting</b> their own problem solving errors during class time. Insights from the disciplines of organic chemistry and computer science will be shared. The instructional technique asks students to first attempt to solve a problem on carbonless-copy paper (CCP) and hand-in the top page as their initial work. During an instructor’s explanation of the problem solving and/or class discussion, students make corrections to their own work. Students then hand in this second layer of CCP. The third layer of the CCP, their corrected work, is kept by the students and becomes part of their course notes. This method increases participation in problem solving and provides useful feedback to the instructor on how students are thinking about the material. Some students do not detect and correct their own errors, even when presented with a correct solution. Reasons and remedies for this will be discussed. The CCP instructional method is flexible in that it can be used in any science discipline, for individual or group work, and for participation marks or for performance grades. I will briefly discuss how I am using the results of the analysis of student errors and error correction to develop ways to improve students’ prior knowledge (pre-lecture learning support) and for creating opportunities for more useful feedback (via peers, instructors, or technology) ...|$|R
40|$|Young {{children}} often perseverate, <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> previously <b>correct,</b> {{but no longer}} appropriate behaviors. One account posits that such perseveration results {{from the use of}} stimulus-specific representations of a situation, which are distinct from abstract, generalizable representations that support flexible behavior. Previous findings supported this account, demonstrating that only children who flexibly switch between rules could generalize their behavior to novel stimuli. However, this link between flexibility and generalization might reflect general cognitive abilities, or depend upon similarities across the measures or their temporal order. The current work examined these issues by testing the specificity and generality of this link. In two experiments with 3 -year-old children, flexibility was measured in terms of switching between rules in a card-sorting task, while abstraction was measured in terms of selecting which stimulus did not belong in an odd-one-out task. The link between flexibility and abstraction was general across (1) abstraction dimensions similar to or different from those in the card-sorting task and (2) abstraction tasks that preceded or followed the switching task. Good performance on abstraction and flexibility measures did not extend to all cognitive tasks, including an IQ measure, and dissociated from children’s ability to gaze at the <b>correct</b> stimulus <b>in</b> the odd-one-out task, suggesting that the link between flexibility and abstraction is specific to such measures, rather than reflecting general abilities that affect all tasks. We interpret these results in terms of the role that developing prefrontal cortical regions play in processes such as working memory, which can support both flexibility and abstraction...|$|R

We took Bowness and Storrs, in our way from Appleby to Lancaster; and I visited Wordsworth, and my dear friend Arnold from Storrs. It was my fortune to have to try the great Hornby Castle cause, as it was called; this I did {{at the end of}} the circuit, {{returning}} from Liverpool to Lancaster for the purpose. Arnold was kind enough to lend me his house (Foxhow) for the vacation; and when the circuit ended, my wife and children accompanied me to it, and we remained there six weeks. During that time Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth were our only neighbours, and we scarcely saw any one besides; but we needed no other addition to the lovely and loveable country in which we were. He was extremely kind, both in telling us where to go, and very often going with us. He was <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>correcting</b> the press for a new edition of his poems. The London post, I think, went out at 2 P.M., and then, he would say, he was at our service. A walk with him in that country was a real treat: I never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so well, or to love them better, nor one who had such exquisite taste for rural scenery: he had evidently cultivated it with great care; he not only admired the beauties, but he could tell you what were the peculiar features in each scene, or what the incidents to which it owed its peculiar charm. He combined, beyond any man with whom I ever met, the unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them. In examining the parts of a landscape he would be minute; and he dealt with shrubs, flower-beds, and lawns with the readiness of a practiced landscape-gardener. His own little grounds afforded a beautiful specimen of his skill in this latter respect; and it was curious to see how he had imparted the same faculty in some measure to his gardener--James Dixon, I think, was his name. I found them together one morning in the little lawn by the Mount. 'James and I,' said he, 'are in a puzzle here. The grass here has spots which offend the eye; and I told him we must cover them with soap-lees. [...] "That," [...] he says, [...] "will make the green there darker than the rest." [...] "Then," [...] I said, [...] "we must cover the whole." [...] He objected: [...] "That will not do with reference to the little lawn to which you pass from this." [...] "Cover that," [...] I said. To which he replies, [...] "You will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it."' ...|$|R
