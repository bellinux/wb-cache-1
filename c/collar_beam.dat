5|$|The College, {{like the}} Church of All Saints, is {{constructed}} of Kentish rag-stone in the Perpendicular style. The main building, a two-storey structure with attic, was mostly {{built in the}} 14th century and served originally as the Master's house. Some later 18th century alterations have been made and later windows added. The building contains a <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> roof and a 16th-century staircase, moulded ceiling and aumbry cupboard. Poste records in his 1847 history of the College {{that some of the}} rooms retained traces of decorative wall painting.|$|E
500|$|The 16th-century prior's lodging {{which was}} {{converted}} into a two storey farmhouse had major alterations and extensions in 1701. Inside the building are massive beams. The [...] was added in the 19th century. The 15th-century barn, which is approximately [...] north west of the church has seven bays supported by buttresses with diagonal buttresses at the corners. It has a <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> roof. It has a well at the eastern end. The old infirmary {{was built in the}} 15th century and has an arch braced <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> roof. The south wall shows the site where a stair turret was included, which would have linked the ground floor infirmary chapel with the infirmarer's quarters, which have both been demolished.|$|E
500|$|The rows of arcade posts support tie beams, with curved braces to {{strengthen}} the frame. The <b>collar</b> <b>beam,</b> which supports the opposing principal rafters, {{is supported by the}} crown post. Roof purlins run the length of the barn and are tenoned into the principal rafters, with additional support from curved wind braces. Some aspects of this design are unusual, both {{in the way that they}} are executed and in terms of their early date. A number of features in the barn's carpentry are described by English Heritage as [...] "experimental, precocious and regionally unusual," [...] which is attributed to the very high level of skill of the master carpenters who built it.|$|E
50|$|A crown post is a {{compression}} member, a post, in roof framing {{which carries}} a longitudinal beam called a crown plate. The crown plate in turn carries <b>collar</b> <b>beams</b> which help support and carry the rafters, thus <b>collar</b> <b>beams</b> are always found in crown post roof framing.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} {{plan has been}} substantially altered over the centuries, and the interiors [...] modernised. The internal beams of the former buttery are more crudely finished {{than those of the}} parlour, and this wing has a sandstone chimneystack. The staircases date from the late 17th or 18th century; that in number 67 has latticework in the Chinese Chippendale style. The roof truss is unusual in having a short king post from the <b>collar</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of roof framing is {{a common}} rafter roof. This roof framing has nothing but rafters and a tie beam at the bottoms of the rafters. The {{next step in the}} development of roof framing was to add a collar, called a <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> roof. <b>Collar</b> <b>beam</b> roofs are suitable for spans up to around (4.5 meters).|$|E

50|$|Locally, it is {{believed}} that the outbuilding was originally a boathouse. Although modified during the 20th century for use as a garage, it is too small to have served as a stable prior to that and the low rafters on its <b>collar</b> <b>beams</b> were ideal places to hang sails to dry.|$|R

50|$|A <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> or collar is a {{horizontal}} member between two rafters {{and is very}} common in domestic roof construction. Often a collar is structural {{but they may be}} used simply to frame a ceiling. A <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> is often called a collar tie but this is rarely correct. A tie in building construction is an element in tension rather than compression and most collar beams are designed to work in compression to keep the rafters from sagging. A collar {{near the bottom of the}} rafters may replace a tie beam and be designed to keep the rafters from spreading, thus are in tension: these are correctly called a collar tie.|$|E
50|$|St Mary's Church or {{its full}} name St Mary and St Bodfan Church is a church {{located in the}} village of Llanaber in Wales. St Mary and Bodfan is a Grade I listed building, which despite {{substantial}} restoration work in 1860, is a well-preserved 13th-century building with lancet windows and arch-braced <b>collar</b> <b>beams</b> (16th-century) to the chancel roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} remains basically unchanged {{since it}} was first built. The altar is along the east wall of the sanctuary. The aisle is left of center with the pews along the north wall. The structural system on the inside consists of King posts, Queen posts, <b>collar</b> <b>beams</b> and struts which enhance the vertical character of the space.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{house of}} Rade {{people is the}} longhouse made of bamboo and wood. The longhouse's length is {{measured}} by the number of <b>collar</b> <b>beams</b> (Rade language: de). Once a girl living in the house gets married, the house is lengthened by one compartment, as the matrilocal aspect of Rade marriage means that the husband will live in his wife's house. The orientation of buildings are North-South.|$|R
50|$|The 16th-century prior's lodging {{which was}} {{converted}} into a two storey farmhouse had major alterations and extensions in 1701. Inside the building are massive beams. The pentice was added in the 19th century. The 15th-century barn, which is approximately 50 m north west of the church has seven bays supported by buttresses with diagonal buttresses at the corners. It has a <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> roof. It has a well at the eastern end. The old infirmary {{was built in the}} 15th century and has an arch braced <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> roof. The south wall shows the site where a stair turret was included, which would have linked the ground floor infirmary chapel with the infirmarer's quarters, which have both been demolished.|$|E
5000|$|The roof of Westminster Hall (1395-1399) is a {{fine example}} of a hammerbeam roof. The span of Westminster Hall is 20.8 metres (68 ft. 4 in.), and the opening between the ends of the hammer beams 7.77 metres (25 ft. 6 in). The height from the paving of the hall to the hammerbeam is 12.19 m (40 ft.), and to the {{underside}} of the <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> 19.35 metres (63 ft. 6 in.), so that an additional height in the centre of 7.16 m (23 ft. 6 in.) has been gained. In order to give greater strength to the framing, a large arched piece of timber is carried across the hall, rising {{from the bottom of the}} wall piece to the centre of the <b>collar</b> <b>beam,</b> the latter also supported by curved braces rising from the end of the hammerbeam.|$|E

50|$|Like its English counterpart, a wooden, hammerbeam roof is adorned by ten carved angels. The arched {{design of}} the roof is {{supported}} by six <b>collar</b> <b>beams,</b> and is architecturally reminiscent of such British interiors as those of Stirling Castle, Hampton Court and Etham Castle, all equally typical of Gothic constructions. The marble floor, elevated upon {{the western side of}} the hall, mirrors the dais found in Westminster Hall, upon which the throne of King Richard II stood.|$|R
50|$|The nave, aisles and chancel {{are under}} a single arched roof with exposed rafters {{supported}} by arch-braced king post roof trusses and the <b>collar</b> <b>beams</b> are supported on corbels. The main entrance is in the narthex at the east end which also provides access to the gallery which houses the organ. The altar survives {{and there is a}} carved wooden pulpit. The central aisle has contemporary pews on either side. The sanctuary windows from 1881 are by Mayer.|$|R
50|$|The {{footings}} are of mortared flint {{and stone}} rising to 1.2 m {{at the northern}} end of the barn. They may originally have been lime rendered internally. The heart of the structure is a series of rectangular frames (arcade posts and <b>collar</b> <b>beams)</b> rising approximately 5 m above the dwarf walls. The frames are transversely braced. Linking the tops of the frames longitudinally is the arcade plate which is jointed and braced to each upright. 2 m outside the arcade are the aisle posts (2m high) supporting an aisle tie to the main arcade posts. The aisle posts are linked by the eaves plate, though not braced to it. Resting on and braced to the <b>collar</b> <b>beams</b> are crown posts supporting a collar plate. The rafters are supported by the eaves plates, arcade plates and collar plates forming a single unbroken slope. To complete the exterior of the building, weatherboards run from under the eaves vertically down to the ground plates. The weatherboards are thought to be a rare survival of the original boards. A dendrochronological of one board gave 1357, but this was not the outermost ring of the tree.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} truss construction uses two queen posts (or queen-posts). These vertical posts, positioned {{along the}} base of the truss, are supported by the sloping sides of the truss, rather than reaching its apex. A development adds a <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> above the queen posts, which are then termed queen struts. A section of the tie beam between the queen posts may be removed to create a hammerbeam roof.|$|E
50|$|An earlier wooden {{manor house}} {{may have been}} on the same site or nearby. The {{earliest}} parts of the present building are the tower with its battlements and the dining room with its oak ceiling. The hall has a <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> roof. At the house's north-east corner is a polygonal stair turret, and the chimneys of the west wing rise higher than the battlements of the main tower.|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{the hall}} has a diagonally boarded raked ceiling, a flat section with fretwork vents at the <b>collar</b> <b>beam</b> and metal {{ties to the}} top plate. The {{building}} has a timber floor, tongue and groove walls, raised stage and side partitions with double timber doors either side, and timber posts with arched brackets which separate the side aisles. The central entry has a room to either side, and the rear section has a kitchenette.|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} project documentation of residential building for four members family. The house {{is situated in}} the South Moravian Region {{in the village of}} Pavlov, cadastral territory of Dolní Věstonice. The building is designed as a timbered construction. The vertical constructions are designed as a massive timbered walls and horizontal constructions are designed as wood-beamed ceilings. The main object is covered with a gable roof. Adjacent buildings - garage and terrace are both roofed shed roof. Construction of pitched roof is purlin system with <b>collar</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} timber framing, a crown post looks {{similar to}} a king post, {{but it is very}} different structurally: whereas the king post is in tension, usually supporting the tie beam as a truss, the crown post is supported by the tie beam and is in compression. The crown post rises to a crown plate immediately below and supporting <b>collar</b> <b>beams,</b> it does not rise to the apex like a king post. Historically a crown post was called a king post in England but this usage is obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|A purlin {{plate in}} wooden {{construction}} is also called an [...] "arcade plate" [...] in European English, [...] "under purlin", and [...] "principal purlin". The term plate means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. Purlin plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and {{are supported by}} posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. Purlin plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America. A crown plate has similarities to a purlin plate but supports <b>collar</b> <b>beams</b> {{in the middle of}} a timber framed building.|$|R
