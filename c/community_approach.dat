40|$|Using {{the global}} tobacco {{advocacy}} networks {{as a case}} study, this article argues that the Advocacy Coalition Framework (Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith 1999), which theorises how advocacy coalitions affect policymaking domestically, and Keck and Sikkink's research into transnational advocacy networks (Keck and Sikkink 1998) can provide insights into the mechanisms of how transnational advocacy networks impact both local and intergovernmental policymaking. I argue that by combining aspects {{of each of these}} approaches, all sides of a policy situation can be analysed. I contrast these approaches with the epistemic <b>communities</b> <b>approach</b> (Haas 1992), suggesting that, for the tobacco policy system, the epistemic <b>communities</b> <b>approach</b> provides less insight than the other two...|$|R
40|$|This study {{takes one}} aspect of the post-conflict peace-building process in Bosnia- Herzegovina since 1995 - the {{recognition}} of three official but mutually comprehensible languages - and examines {{the way in which the}} international <b>community's</b> <b>approach</b> to it has impacted on broader peacebuilding goals for the country. The originality of this thesis lies in the fact that it views post-conflict peace-building in Bosnia-Herzegovina through the lens of the language issue. Taking the Dayton Peace Agreement (1995) as the starting point I look at the way in which its provisions have largely dictated the international <b>community's</b> <b>approach</b> to the language issue and created the political environment in which language operates. Further, applying the concept of societal security I explain how the language issue is used by domestic elites to frustrate attempts at reconciliation by the international community; I argue that the international <b>community's</b> <b>approach,</b> based on the equality of the three languages, only feeds into the divisive ethnic politics of present-day Bosnia-Herzegovina and ultimately undermines the security and stability of the country. I also look in detail at two very different but complimentary areas of ongoing post- conflict reform in Bosnia-Herzegovina and analyse the international <b>community's</b> <b>approach</b> to language in each: reform of the education system and defence reform. In the former the language issue cannot be divorced from the identity-formation goals of domestic elites in the education reform. The international <b>community's</b> <b>approach</b> to language in this regard has been counterproductive and has only bolstered attempts to maintain segregation in schools. In the area of defence reform the focus of language policy is not on issues of identity but on the translation and interpretation policy of the international military force which is guided by locally-hired interpreters and translators. I use narrative theory (Baker, 2006) to explain how they negotiate issues of identity, loyalty and ethics and argue that through their influence policy has been more flexible and able to adapt to the requirements of the defence reform. Finally I contend that the international community has tended to view language as an unimportant element of its activities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This study argues that far from this being the case the international <b>community's</b> <b>approach</b> to language holds important lessons for future peacebuilding endeavours elsewhere.

40|$|Childhood obesity {{remains a}} major public health concern. To {{successfully}} address the childhood obesity epidemic, intersectoral community interventions that {{take into account the}} multifactorial aetiology of childhood obesity are needed. However, the implementation of such interventions has proved to be difficult and prone to error. This thesis therefore examines the implementation process of five EPODE-derived intersectoral <b>community</b> <b>approaches</b> targeting childhood obesity in the Netherlands. It focuses on both the level of implementation and determinants of implementation. Quantitative as well as qualitative methods are used, next to novel “in-between” methods such as Quantitative Comparative Analysis and Social Network Analysis. Recommendations are provided on how to design strategies to improve the implementation of intersectoral <b>community</b> <b>approaches,</b> and suggestion for future research initiatives are made...|$|R
