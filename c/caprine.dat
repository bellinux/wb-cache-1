40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the approximate prevalence, distribution and different types of ocular disorders in domestic animals. Material and Methods: A retrospective study of ocular affections in domestic animals was conducted at referral veterinary polyclinic, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar from January 2002 to December 2011. The data obtained were analysed after calculating percent of distribution. Results: Totally 799 animals were affected among which Canines and Equines were most commonly affected, followed by Cattle, Buffaloes, <b>Caprines,</b> Felines, Avian and lab animals. Among the disease conditions corneal opacity showed higher incidence and the <b>Caprines</b> and buffaloes were the most affected. Equines and canines highly affected by ocular setariasis and traumatic injury respectively. Cataract incidences were high in spitz breed and cherry eye affect mostly the Neapolitan mastiff. As per age mostly animals of more than 5 years were affected except in <b>Caprines,</b> ages between 1 to 5 years were most commonly affected. Left side of the eye was most commonly affected than the right side and fewer incidences were noted in both sides of the eye. Sex wise distribution showed increased incidences of eye diseases in male canines and equines and, female cattle, buffaloes and <b>caprines.</b> Conclusion: Based on this study we concluded that traumatic injury and ocular setariasis are more common in Canines and Equines respectively.

40|$|A Nubian {{culture that}} emerged in the early third millennium, the Kingdom of Kerma has {{retained}} in a rather lively fashion certain traditions of the pastoral societies that preceded it, notably the tight relationship between man and cattle. Evidence is plentiful and shows that cattle not only played an economic role, but also served a social function. Cattle have been depicted as small figurines discov-ered in the ancient city of Kerma (Ferrero 1984) or painted on murals decorating one of the large funerary chapels of the Eastern Cemetery (Bonnet 2000). More spectacular, however, is their use in funerary rituals, where thousands of bucrania were placed in front of burials. During all phases of the Kerma culture, domestic animals have played an essential role in the economy (Chaix, Grant, 1992). The study of numerous remains found in the kingdom’s capital shows the importance of livestock, which represent more than 95 % of the fauna (Chaix 1994). Hunting activities were rare, with only scarce remains of gazelles, hippopotami and small game of various sorts. The meat diet of the Kerma people was essentially based on cattle (Bos	taurus L.) and <b>caprines,</b> sheep (Ovis	aries L.) and goat (Capra	hircus L.). Some donkeys were also eaten. Cattle represent around 50 % of stock breeding, while <b>caprines</b> form 44 %. These proportions changed as the Kerma culture developed (2450 - 1480 BC). From 1750 BC onward, a strong increase of domestic <b>caprines</b> is noted, cattle becoming more rare and precious during the Ker-ma classique period (Chaix 1994). The decrease of oxen is probably due to the more arid environmental conditions of the second millennium BC...|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{field study}} on the prevalence of Dicrocoelium dendriticum was performed in the Emmental. The study included 211 bovines, 170 equines, 20 ovines, 46 <b>caprines</b> and 23 rabbits (from 119 farms). In addition, laboratory routine diagnostic data obtained from 2. 840 animals [...] all originating from the same area of investigation [...] were assessed in the same way. The infection extent concerning the different animal species were the following: bovines 46 %, equines 12 %, ovines 30 %, <b>caprines</b> 48 % and rabbits 9 %. Univariate analyses of baseline epidemiological data identified no significant risk factors, {{with the exception of}} the type of stable used. Bovines kept in a modern free ranging stable had a significantly lower chance of infection with D. dendriticum than cattle in conventional tie stalls. The epidemiological data characterizing the area of investigation suggest the following procedure to reduce the problem of dicrocoeliosis: Pasturing animals of all ages should be regularly dewormed (e. g. every six week during pasture) using a compound effective against D. dendriticum. A treatment is especially indicated at the time after pasture in autumn or before housing the animals in winter. In spring, only animals having pastured the year before need to be treated prior to pasture in the new year. However, it is recommended to perform an economic analysis comparing costs of treatment versus putative costs of damage prior to the initiation of a strategic campaign: animal welfare aspects have to be considered. The laboratory routine diagnostic data showed infection extent similar to those of the cross-sectional study: bovines 60 %, equines 24 %, ovines 26 %, <b>caprines</b> 31 %, rabbits 32 %. Atypical hosts such as dogs and cats exhibited low infection extent (3 % and 1 %, respectively), rather reflecting a gastro-intestinal passage of parasite eggs ingested by consumption of infected livers or by coprophagy of ruminant faeces...|$|R
40|$|Dietary intake, {{drinking}} behavior, {{and physiology}} together influence the isotopic composition of herbivore tooth enamel, but {{the degree to}} which these factors influence the sequence of δ 13 C and δ 18 O values along the tooth crown remain underexplored. Analysis of serially sampled molars from sympatric wild and domesticated <b>caprines</b> inhabiting the Gobi steppe-desert reveal inter-species distinction in carbon and oxygen isotope ratios as as well as pronounced differences in the amplitude of intra-tooth isotopic change. For domesticated sheep, consistently high ð 13 C values visible in intra-tooth sequences and 13 C enrichment in enamel with a winter season formation period indicates pronounced graze intake throughout the year including receipt of a C 4 fodder source during the winter months. This pattern contrasts with low δ 13 C values visible in the teeth of wild <b>caprines</b> indicating the intake of C 3 graze and browse throughout the year. Domesticated sheep also demonstrate a wide amplitude of intra-tooth oxygen isotope variation compared to wild <b>caprines</b> in addition to higher summer season maxima δ 18 O values and lower winter season minima δ 18 O values. The greater contribution of graze to the domesticated sheep diet suggests 18 O-enriched leaf water strongly influences summer season δ 18 O values, while 18 O-depleted groundwater imbibed from wells is likely responsible for low winter season δ 18 O values. The oxygen isotopic distinction between wild and domesticated sheep populations affirm previous observations that the ingestion of isotopically distinct water sources impacts body water oxygen isotopic composition and subsequent expression of δ 18 O values in herbivore tooth carbonates. This has important implications for the use of δ 18 O values obtained from serially sampled teeth for reconstructing paleoenvironment, seasonality and also the movement of wild and domesticated herbivores through modern and ancient landscapes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the distribution of testicular arterial vessels in <b>caprines</b> with different degrees of scrotal division.

A colored vinyl acetate solution was injected into 60 testicular arteries (30 pairs). After, the samples were submitted to corrosion cast method to obtain tubular vascular models for macroscopic analysis. We observed that the testicular arteries emerge from the abdominal aorta, cross the inguinal canal to become coiled and involved by the pampiniform plexus. Close to the caudal extremity of the testis, the arteries become divided in cranial and caudal branches that emit collateral vessels to originate emerging branches. Testicles with intermediate level of scrotal division (group II) showed a smaller amount of those branches than the others, being the most populated the ventrolateral and the dorsolateral quadrants. The origin, distribution and localization of the testicular arteries did not show any differences related to the degree of scrotal division in <b>caprines...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Caprines</b> {{belong to}} the most {{endangered}} group of mammals and artiodactyls suffering from many negative human impacts.

Our data suggest the utility of this microsatellite set for detecting shared and species-specific alleles, characterising the genetic variability, and determining phylogenetic relationships and intraspecific structures in investigated taxa. We detected a depleted genetic variability in Capra falconeri and Capra cylindricornis in European ex situ populations; unrelated individuals are therefore needed for improving genetic variability parameters, as they are for the extralimital population of Capra aegagrus in the Vřísek game reserve (Czech Republic), for which we identified no genetic introgression from the domestic goat and great dissimilarity with some analysed individuals from European zoos.

40|$|Thermal {{discomfort}} inside facilities {{is one of}} {{the factors}} responsible for low productivity of <b>caprines</b> in the Brazilian Northeast region, because inadequate weather conditions can cause elevated rectal temperature, increased respiratory rate, decreased food ingestion and reduced production.

The time of data collection was related to the values of environmental and physiological variables. At 2 p. m. it was found the highest values of Radiant Heat Load on the three types of covering. The values of RT and RR were higher at 11 a. m. and 2 p. m., and the straw tile provided better thermal conditions of microclimate for the animals.

In southern Africa people have different subsistence strategies such as hunting, gathering and/or herding.

However, to differentiate between the „original‟ hunter-gatherer population, immigrant herders and hunter-gatherers that accepted livestock based on the archaeological record remains challenging.
