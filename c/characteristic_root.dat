40|$|Spectral {{discretization}} {{methods are}} well established methods for the computation of <b>characteristic</b> <b>roots</b> of time-delay systems. In this paper a method is presented for computing all <b>characteristic</b> <b>roots</b> {{in a given}} right half plane. In particular, a procedure for the automatic selection {{of the number of}} discretization points is described. This procedure is grounded in the connection between a spectral discretization and a rational approximation of exponential functions. First, a region that contains all desired <b>characteristic</b> <b>roots</b> is estimated. Second, the number of discretization points is selected {{in such a way that}} in this region the rational approximation of the exponential functions is accurate. Finally, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>roots</b> approximations, obtained from solving the discretized eigenvalue problem, are corrected up to the desired precision by a local method.

We calculate the starting, branch and boundary crossing roots of root-locus branches inside the region. We compute the root locus of each <b>characteristic</b> <b>root</b> based on a predictor-corrector type continuation method.

40|$|An {{eigenvalue}} based {{approach for}} the stabilization of linear neutral functional differential equations is presented, which extends the recently developed continuous pole placement method for delay equations of retarded type. The approach {{consists of two}} steps. First {{the stability of the}} associated difference equation is determined and a procedure is applied to compute the supremum of the real parts of its <b>characteristic</b> <b>roots,</b> which corresponds to computing the radius of the essential spectrum of the solution operator of the neutral equation. No restrictions are made on the dimension of the system and the number of delays. Also the effect of small delay perturbations is explicitly taken into account. As a result of this first step the stabilization problem of the neutral equation is reduced to a problem involving only a finite number of <b>characteristic</b> <b>roots.</b> As a second step, stabilization is achieved by shifting the rightmost or unstable <b>characteristic</b> <b>roots</b> to the left half plane in a quasi-continuous way, by applying small changes to the controller parameters, and meanwhile monitoring other <b>characteristic</b> <b>roots</b> with a large real part. A numerical example is presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
