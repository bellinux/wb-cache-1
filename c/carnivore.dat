50|$|On September 10, 2013, {{a remake}} version of <b>Carnivores</b> was {{released}} for the PlayStation 3, developed by Vogster Online titled <b>Carnivores</b> Dinosaur Hunter HD (not {{to be confused}} with the Android app of the same name). The <b>carnivores</b> are limited to Ceratosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Unlike previous iterations in the <b>Carnivores</b> series, the death sequences have been removed. Another feature worth mentioning is the inclusion of herbivores that can now kill the player; an event that only the Triceratops and Chasmosaurus could accomplish in <b>Carnivores</b> and <b>Carnivores</b> 2, and that only the Chasmosaurus and Iguanodon could accomplish in Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. Another feature added is that the carnivorous dinosaurs can now eat the downed dinosaurs, which can either prevent the player from collecting trophies or be used to the player's advantage. Two years later, a different development team created and released <b>Carnivores</b> Dinosaur Hunter Reborn exclusively for the PC. The game is a port of <b>Carnivores</b> HD and boasts improvements along with small additions to the core gameplay.|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} article we conceptually reframed the discussions {{surrounding}} how to conserve large terrestrial <b>carnivores</b> in the Anthropocene [1]. Our main proposal is to unite the understandings of the impacts <b>carnivores</b> have on humans and the impacts that humans have on large <b>carnivores</b> within a frame of human–carnivore interactions where the conservation goal being pursued is sustainable coexistence. Among key elements that we identified are: (i) tolerable impact levels (coexistence does not imply the absence of risk from <b>carnivores,</b> just that it is contained within acceptable levels); (ii) effective governance (coexistence requires mechanisms for addressing conflicting priorities among different publics); and (iii) coadaptation (both humans and <b>carnivores</b> change their behaviours to accommodate each other). Importantly, coadaptation between people and <b>carnivores</b> is the dynamic mechanism by which coexistence is achieved and maintained. Our ideas are developed from our own experiences working with large terrestrial <b>carnivores.</b> However, as Gallagher [2] very correctly points out, these ideas are relevant for other species groups...|$|R

5|$|A protocarnivorous plant (sometimes also paracarnivorous, subcarnivorous, or {{borderline}} <b>carnivore),</b> {{according to}} some definitions, traps and kills insects or other animals but lacks the ability to either directly digest or absorb nutrients from its prey like a carnivorous plant. The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants parallel the trap structures of confirmed carnivorous plants.|$|E
5|$|A small, reddish-brown <b>carnivore,</b> Salanoia durrelli is {{characterized}} by broad feet with prominent pads, reddish- underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other differences from the brown-tailed mongoose. In the only two weighed specimens, body mass was 600g and 675g (21 and 24oz). It is a marsh-dwelling animal that may feed on crustaceans and mollusks. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and S.durrelli may also be endangered by competition with introduced species.|$|E

5000|$|Obligate <b>carnivores,</b> or [...] "true" [...] <b>carnivores,</b> {{are those}} <b>carnivores</b> whose {{survival}} depends on nutrients which are {{found only in}} animal flesh.

5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a <b>carnivore,</b> as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|Besides Majungasaurus, fossil taxa {{recovered}} from the Maevarano include fish, frogs, lizards, snakes, seven distinct species of crocodylomorphs, five or six species of mammals, Vorona and several other birds, the possibly flighted dromaeosaurid Rahonavis, the noasaurid Masiakasaurus and two titanosaurian sauropods, including Rapetosaurus. Majungasaurus {{was by far the}} largest <b>carnivore</b> and probably the dominant predator on land, although large crocodylomorphs like Mahajangasuchus and Trematochampsa might have competed with it closer to water.|$|E

40|$|Large <b>carnivores</b> face serious {{threats and}} are {{experiencing}} massive declines in their populations and geographic ranges around the world. We highlight how these threats {{have affected the}} conservation status and ecological functioning of the 31 largest mammalian <b>carnivores</b> on Earth. Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large <b>carnivores</b> have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these <b>carnivores</b> are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large <b>carnivores</b> is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth’s largest <b>carnivores</b> and all that depends upon them, including humans...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Carnivores</b> {{games are}} {{a series of}} hunting {{simulation}} video games featuring prehistoric species ranging from dinosaurs to extinct Megafauna (depending on the title). The first three games were developed for the PC by Action Forms and published by WizardWorks between 1998 and 2001. The fourth game, <b>Carnivores</b> Cityscape, was developed by Sunstorm Interactive and released by Infogrames in 2002. The fifth installment, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter, is a port of <b>Carnivores</b> 2 to the iOS and Android by Tatem Games and the PSP by Beatshapers, released in 2010. <b>Carnivores</b> Ice Age soon followed and got its own port debuting for iOS, eventually making its way into Android. September 2013 marked the release of yet another game, <b>Carnivores</b> Dinosaur Hunter HD, an HD remake of the series. This new title includes new graphics and new hunting experiences packed with exciting features never seen before. Two years later, the title <b>Carnivores</b> Dinosaur Hunter Reborn was released for the PC. The series has attracted a small cult following.|$|R
5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher <b>carnivore</b> density and increased competition.|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea, {{also known}} as the giant fossa, is an extinct species of <b>carnivore</b> from Madagascar in the family Eupleridae, which is most closely related to the {{mongooses}} and includes all Malagasy carnivorans. It was first described in 1902, and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative, the living fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox). C.spelea is larger than the fossa, but otherwise similar. The two have not always been accepted as distinct species. When and how the larger form became extinct is unknown; there is some anecdotal evidence, including reports of very large fossas, that {{there is more than one}} surviving species.|$|E
5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} analysis, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and caribou specialists, and the other half were either horse and bison specialists or generalists.
