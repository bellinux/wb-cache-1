2500|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} time off during working life will be to care for newly born or adopted children. However, unlike paid holidays or breaks that are available for [...] "workers", child care rights are restricted to [...] "employees". They are also less favourable for male parents, which affects gender equality. Going beyond the minimum in the Pregnant Workers Directive, the ERA 1996 section 71 to 73 and the Maternity and Parental Leave, etc Regulations 1999 guarantee maternity leave for 52 weeks in total, but in four steps, paid and unpaid. First, women must take two weeks <b>compulsory</b> <b>leave</b> {{at the time of}} child birth. Second, and covering the <b>compulsory</b> <b>leave,</b> there is a right to 6 weeks' leave paid at 90 per cent of ordinary earnings. Third, there is a right to 33 weeks leave at the statutory rate, or 90 per cent of ordinary earnings if this is lower, which was £138.18 per week in 2014. The government reimburses employers for the costs according to the employer's size and national insurance contributions. Fourth, the mother may take additional, but unpaid maternity leave for another 13 weeks. A contract of employment can always be, and if collectively bargained usually is, more generous. There is no qualifying period for the right to unpaid leave, but the mother must have worked for 26 weeks for the right to paid leave. The mother must also tell the employer 15 weeks before the date of the expected birth, in writing if the employer requests it. Employees may not suffer any professional detriment or dismissal while they are absent, and should be able to return to the same job after 26 weeks, or another suitable job after 52 weeks. If parents adopt, then the rights to leave follow maternity rules for one primary carer. However, for fathers ordinarily, the position is less generous. The Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 entitle a father to 2 weeks leave, at the statutory rate of pay. Both parents may also take [...] "parental leave". This means that, until a child turns 5, or a disabled child turns 18, parents can take up to 13 weeks unpaid leave. Unless there is another collective agreement in place, employees should give 21 days' notice, no more than 4 weeks in a year, at least 1 week at a time, and the employer can postpone the leave for 6 months if business would be unduly disrupted. Otherwise, employees have a right to suffer no detriment, nor be dismissed, and have the right to their previous jobs back. To redress the imbalance between women and men bearing children, the Additional Paternity Leave Regulations 2010 made it possible for the woman to transfer up to 26 weeks of her maternity leave entitlements to her partner. However, it remains the case that women care for children more than men, which operates as a comparative obstacle to career advancement, and perpetuates the gender pay gap.|$|E
2500|$|Vallejos {{herself was}} again unable to attend court. Her counsel Gladys Li responded to Pannick's {{arguments}} {{by stating that}} Vietnamese refugees were not given identity cards and had to live in government-specified refugee centres; she thus argued that Vietnamese refugees did not fall within the definition of [...] "ordinarily resident". She also argued that the case of Vietnamese refugees was of no value as a precedent, since unlike before 1997 when the colonial government was free to make any immigration laws without limitation, the Hong Kong government today is bound by the Basic Law. Li contrasted the treatment of Vietnamese refugees with that of FDHs: while FDHs' work contracts limited their place of residence, they were issued with identity cards, could have ordinary social lives outside of work. She described their position as comparable to foreign civil servants. She also argued that the standard FDH contract's requirement that an FDH return {{to his or her}} country of origin every two years did not affect Vallejos' ordinary residence in Hong Kong, because she was offered a renewal of contract prior to departure each time, and her departure from Hong Kong was little different than any other category of employee required by his or her employer to take a <b>compulsory</b> <b>leave.</b> However, Justice Stock did not seem convinced by this argument, stating that Vallejos' absence from Hong Kong was [...] "enforced", while Justice Tang pointed out that Vallejos could not return to Hong Kong as she wished during such absences, further bringing into doubt the idea that she could be considered [...] "ordinarily resident" [...] during such absences.|$|E

5000|$|Teaching {{was one of}} {{the first}} careers outside of the home which was open to American women. As a result, in the late 19th century and the 20th century, women {{dominated}} the field of teaching. In 1919, 86% of teachers were women. However, traditional attitudes in American society still held that a women’s primary role should be that of housewife. This bias was shared by the male administrators and politicians, who generally ran the schools, and thus married women were discouraged from, and overlooked for, teaching positions. This was justified by the belief that men and single women needed the jobs more. Only after the World War II labor shortages were married women widely hired as teachers. [...] After the war, many married women remained employed as teachers; however, traditional prejudices against them endured. The attitude changed focus into discrimination against pregnant women. In 1948, a National Education Association survey showed 43% of schools as having no maternity leave, and the rest having <b>compulsory</b> maternity <b>leave.</b> The <b>compulsory</b> maternity <b>leave</b> rules were grounded in the belief that women were incapable of making their own decisions about work, health care, and their professional competency. Most of these <b>compulsory</b> maternity <b>leave</b> rules required teachers to take leave 4-6 months before childbirth until well after the child was born, leaving visibly pregnant women basically unable to work. Virtually all maternity leave was unpaid. The stated rationale behind these <b>compulsory</b> maternity <b>leave</b> laws were: that pregnant women could not meet the physical or mental demands of the job, that pregnancy interrupted the continuity of instruction for students, and that pregnant women might get hurt on the job. In this case the court found that this reasoning was faulty, as women do not lose all sense and ability simply because they are visibly pregnant.|$|R

30|$|Finally, and as {{has been}} {{outlined}} {{in regards to the}} educational situation immediately after <b>leaving</b> <b>compulsory</b> schooling, the results confirm that the regional opportunity structures affect the educational attainment net of institutional constraints and individual resources. Regional opportunity structures have a significant negative effect in respect to the probability of attending VET and, conversely, a significant positive effect on the probability of pupils attending a general education program. However, if we additionally control for pupils’ realistic educational aspirations in model 2, the direct effects of the opportunity structures are narrowed but still significant. The results differ from those presented for the educational situation after <b>leaving</b> <b>compulsory</b> schooling, in which the the positive effect on the probability of attending bridge year courses is significant. Since only a minority of a school-leaver cohort is not able to realize a certifying upper secondary training place within 15  months after <b>leaving</b> <b>compulsory</b> education, {{it is not surprising that}} institutional (attended school type at lower secondary level) and individual constraints (GPA) matter more than the regional opportunity structure.|$|R

Under the Maternity and Parental Leave, etc Regulations 1999 mothers must take <b>compulsory</b> <b>leave</b> at the time of child birth for two weeks. After that comes a right to 6 weeks' leave paid at 90 per cent of ordinary salary. Then is 20 weeks leave paid at a rate set by statute, which was £123.06 per week in 2010. This has to be at least the same level as statutory sick pay. Then she may take additional but unpaid maternity leave for another 26 weeks.
