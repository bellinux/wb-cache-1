5|$|By 1939, the Bells {{had moved}} to Brisbane, where John was Queensland manager for Airlines of Australia Ltd, having left the RAAF in 1929. Mary became leader of forty or so members of the Women's National Emergency Legion Air Wing who had volunteered to assist with {{aircraft}} maintenance during times of war. Determining that their objectives would not be met in their existing organisation, on 17July they formed a new paramilitary group, the Women's Air Training Corps (WATC), and elected Bell its commander. She soon expanded the WATC into a national organisation, with Commandants leading each state's chapter, and herself as Australian Commandant. Bell wrote to Air Vice Marshal Richard Williams, with whom she was acquainted via her husband and through aviation circles, advocating {{the establishment of a}} women's branch of the RAAF similar to the RAF's Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). Among other things, she pointed out that female volunteers such as hers were already supporting the Air Force in driving, nursing and <b>clerical</b> <b>duties.</b> The WATC was one of several women's voluntary organisations whose members were keen to support the military, arguing that their personnel provided a ready-made pool of skilled staff for auxiliary services, saving the government time and money training unskilled labour.|$|E

A few became radio operators, electricians, draftsmen, pharmacists, photographers, telegraphers, fingerprint experts, chemists, torpedo assemblers and camouflage designers. Female Yeomen {{did not attend}} boot camp. A large number were stationed in Washington, D.C., while others served in naval stations, hospitals, shipyards and munitions factories around the country. Many recruiting stations employed the women who volunteered there as very effective recruiters, {{and as many as}} forty women served in England, France, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Canal Zone, Guam, and the Territory of Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|The Ukrainian Catholics {{continued}} to exist underground for decades and were the subject of vigorous attacks in the state media. The clergy gave up public exercise of their <b>clerical</b> <b>duties,</b> but secretly provided services for many lay people. Many priests took up civilian professions and celebrated the sacraments in private. The identities of former priests could {{have been known to}} the Soviet police who regularly watched them, interrogated them and put fines on them, but stopped short of arrest unless their activities went beyond a small circle of people. New secretly ordained priests were often treated more harshly.|$|E

Some were assigned to nursing, dental or <b>clerical</b> <b>duties,</b> however some women were assigned to units which were stationed in the European Theater of operations. Puerto Ricans played important roles as commanders in the Armed Forces of the United States for the first time.

50|$|In Eastern Christianity {{there are}} two types of cassock: the Inner Cassock and the Outer Cassock or Rason. Monastics always wear a black cassock. There is no rule about {{coloration}} for non-monastic clergy, but black is the most common. Blue or grey are also seen frequently, while white is sometimes worn for Pascha. In the Eastern Churches, cassocks are not dress for any lay ministry. Generally, one has to be blessed to wear a cassock usually in the case of exercising a <b>clerical</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|R

60|$|His father wished {{him to take}} Holy Orders {{with a view to}} the {{reversion}} of the Rectory, but Mark's {{estimate of}} <b>clerical</b> <b>duty</b> and vocation was just such as to make him shrink from them. He was three-and-twenty, an awkward age for all those examinations that stand as lions in the face of youth intended for almost any sort of service, and seldom or never to be gagged by interest. For one indeed, he went up and failed, and in such a manner as to convince him that cramming had more to do than general culture with success.|$|R
25|$|After Hidalgo {{settled in}} Dolores, {{he turned over}} most of the <b>clerical</b> <b>duties</b> to one of his vicars, Fr. Francisco Iglesias, and devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to commerce, intellectual pursuits and humanitarian activity. He spent much of his time studying literature, scientific works, grape cultivation, and the raising of silkworms. He used the knowledge that he gained to promote economic activities for the poor and rural people in his area. He established factories to make bricks and pottery and trained indigenous people in the making of leather. He promoted beekeeping. He was interested in promoting activities of commercial value to use the natural resources of the area to help the poor. His goal was to make the Indians and mestizos more self-reliant and less dependent on Spanish economic policies. However, these activities violated policies designed to protect agriculture and industry in Spain, and Hidalgo was ordered to stop them. These policies as well as exploitation of mixed race castas fostered resentment in Hidalgo of the Peninsular-born Spaniards in Mexico.|$|E

[...] Jones resigned his position in the Methodist church, but continued to undertake work here and there as his health permitted. [...] By 1850, his doctor had ordered him to completely stop travelling and performing his <b>clerical</b> <b>duties,</b> but Jones ignored his advice. [...] In 1851, Jones {{moved to a new}} estate near Echo Place, which he dubbed Echo Villa. [...] The estate was close to the established town of Brantford, but also allowed him to be close to New Credit. [...] Although he continued to work, his failing health kept him at home often, and he began pursuing more domestic activities. [...] Taking up woodcarving, he won £15 for his bowl and ladle at the annual provincial exhibition. [...] He began writing for the Aborigines Protection Society, acting as their Canadian correspondent for their publication The Colonial Intelligencer; or, Aborigines' Friend. In the 1850s, Peter began to devote his time and efforts more to his wife and children. [...] His son Charles attended Genesee College in Lima, New York, then studied law. [...] Jones continued travelling when his health permitted.

He served until November 9, reviving the draft, and overseeing a prisoner of war camp in New York Harbor. He then went to work {{in the office of the}} Secretary of War, unofficially describing himself in correspondence as an [...] "Assistant Adjutant General."

500|$|Once back in Saint Petersburg in May 1865, Rimsky-Korsakov's onshore duties {{consisted}} {{of a couple of}} hours of <b>clerical</b> <b>duty</b> each day, but he recalled that his desire to compose [...] "had been stifled... I did not concern myself with music at all." [...] He wrote that contact with Balakirev in September 1865 encouraged him [...] "to get accustomed to music and later to plunge into it". At Balakirev's suggestion, he wrote a trio to the scherzo of the E-flat minor symphony, which it had lacked up to that point, and reorchestrated the entire symphony. Its first performance came in December of that year under Balakirev's direction in Saint Petersburg. A second performance followed in March 1866 under the direction of Konstantin Lyadov (father of composer Anatoly Lyadov).|$|R

60|$|All the Doctor's {{requirements}} {{were not}} at once fulfilled. Mrs. Peacocke's position was easily settled. Mrs. Peacocke, {{who seemed to be}} a woman possessed of sterling sense and great activity, undertook her duties without difficulty. But Mr. Peacocke would not at first consent to act as curate in the parish. He did, however, after a time perform a portion of the Sunday services. When he first came to Bowick he had declared that he would undertake no <b>clerical</b> <b>duty.</b> Education was his profession, and to that he meant to devote himself exclusively. Nor for the six or eight months of his sojourn did he go back from this; so that the Doctor may be said even still to have failed in carrying out his purpose. But at last the new schoolmaster appeared in the pulpit of the parish church and preached a sermon.|$|R
60|$|A {{new phase}} of Coleridge Patteson's life was {{beginning}} with the year 1867, {{when he was in}} full preparation for the last of his many changes of home, namely, that to Norfolk Island, isolating him finally from those who had become almost as near kindred to him, and devoting him even more exclusively to his one great work. No doubt the separation from ordinary society was a relief, and the freedom from calls to irregular <b>clerical</b> <b>duty</b> at Auckland was an immense gain; but the lack of the close intercourse with the inner circle of his friends was often felt, and was enhanced by the lack of postal communication with Norfolk Island, so that, instead of security of home tidings by every mail, letters and parcels could only be transmitted by chance vessels touching at that inaccessible island, where there was no harbour for even the 'Southern Cross' to lie.|$|R
50|$|Lorber {{continues}} to describe social boundaries {{set up by}} gender using technology; she brings up two examples—computers and cars. When computers first came into use, office jobs involving them were given to women, as {{it appeared to be}} a <b>clerical</b> <b>duty.</b> It was not until computers were revealed to be complex and intellectually demanding that they became the domain of men. “By the 1960s programing was split into more and less skilled specialties, and the entry of women into the computer field in the 1970s and 1980s was confined to the lower paid specialties…employers invoked women and men’s purportedly natural capabilities for the jobs for which they were hired”. This means women will do the more menial tasks, where men will shape the industry and control it. Lorber also describes how this has influenced young people; for example we see far more young men and boys playing computer games and getting involved in computer clubs. In this way we are furthering women’s supposed natural disadvantage with computers by allowing boys to get more education and comfort with computers than girls.|$|R
2500|$|In 1914, at {{the start}} of the First World War, Novello wrote [...] "Keep the Home Fires Burning", a song that {{expressed}} the feelings of innumerable families sundered by World War I. Novello composed the music for the song to a lyric by the American Lena Guilbert Ford, and it became a huge popular success, bringing Novello money and fame at the age of 21. In other respects, the war had less impact on Novello than on many young men of his age. He avoided enlistment until June 1916, when he reported to a Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) training depot as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant. After twice crashing an aeroplane, and with the influence of Marsh, he was moved to the Air Ministry office in central London performing <b>clerical</b> <b>duties</b> for the duration of the war.|$|E

He was supported by prominent men, among the friends of Margaret Chapel being Mr. Serjeant Bellasis, Mr. Beresford-Hope, and William Gladstone. The year 1845 was a turning-point in Oakeley's life. As a fellow of Balliol he had joined in the election to a fellowship there of his lifelong friend and former pupil Archibald Campbell Tait, the future primate; but Tait had signed, with three others, the first protest against Tract XC. The furore over this last Tract led Oakeley, like Ward, to despair of his church and university; and in two pamphlets, published separately at the time both in London and Oxford, he asserted that he held, [...] "as distinct from teaching, all Roman doctrine". For this avowal he was cited before the court of arches by the Bishop of London. His license was withdrawn, and he was suspended from all <b>clerical</b> <b>duty</b> {{in the province of}} Canterbury until he had [...] "retracted his errors" [...] (July 1845).|$|R

He would have given up active <b>clerical</b> <b>duty</b> if he could, never having liked it (for he was above hypocrisy), but Christina was against the project, and his bishop would not hear of it. The Church could ill afford to lose such a man as Mr. Dene, the bishop said, in these troubled times; and he begged him as a personal favour to accept the living of Churnside, which was in his gift. But Walter did not like the place, and asked for another living instead, which, being of less value--"so like Mr. Dene to think nothing of the temporalities,"--the bishop even more graciously granted. He has since published a small volume of dainty little poems on uncut paper, considered by some critics as rather pagan in tone for a clergyman, but universally allowed to be extremely graceful, the perfection of poetical form with much delicate mastery of poetical matter. And everybody knows that the author is almost certain to be offered the first vacant canonry in his own cathedral. As for the little episode, he himself has almost forgotten all about it; for those who think a murderer must feel remorse his whole life long, are trying to read their own emotional nature into the wholly dispassionate character of Walter Dene.|$|R
