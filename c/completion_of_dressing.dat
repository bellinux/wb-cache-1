40|$|High voltage {{electrical}} stimulation {{applied to the}} lamb carcass {{at the end of}} the dressing procedure often leads to an improvement in overall product quality by reducing the incidence of toughness. It would be advantageous if the same results could be consistently achieved with the use of lower, safer, voltages - medium voltage {{electrical stimulation}}. Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of medium voltage electrical stimulation applied to wool-on carcasses on meat quality as assessed using the Sheep Meat Eating Quality protocols. A further experiment examined the interaction of electrical stimulation and meat aging time on the consumer acceptance of lamb meat. In the first experiment, 3 treatments: control (non-stimulated), medium voltage electrical stimulation (applied to the wool-on carcass) and high voltage electrical stimulation (applied at the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>dressing)</b> were examined. Samples of the loin (LTL) and rump (GM) muscles were evaluated by consumers using Sheep Meat Eating Quality protocols. For both muscles, the consumers gave higher scores for tenderness, juiciness, flavour and overall acceptability to the stimulated product (P< 0. 001). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 stimulation treatments. The second experiment was conducted at a commercial lamb-processing abattoir that had installed a prototype automated electrode system designed to work at chain speed. Lambs received either no stimulation (control), low current medium voltage electrical stimulation (constant current 300 mA peak, 15 Hz, maximum voltage 550 V peak) or high current medium voltage electrical stimulation (constant current 600 mA peak, 15 Hz, maximum voltage 550 V peak) immediately after sticking. Electrical stimulation improved both the objective and sensory (Sheep Meat Eating Quality) eating quality attributes of lamb loin muscle when assessed following 2 days of ageing. When expressed according to consumer satisfaction rating, 30, 37 and 70 % of the loins receiving low, high or no electrical stimulation, respectively, were rated as unsatisfactory at 2 days of ageing. At 4 days of ageing no loins from carcasses in the low stimulation treatment were rated by consumers to be unsatisfactory (P< 0. 05) compared with either non-stimulated (40 %) or high-stimulated loins (35 %). With respect to the effects of aging meat, electrical stimulation improved the consumer score at 2 days post-stunning by 8. 9 and 4. 7 points for tenderness and overall liking, respectively. Further linear improvements due to aging were similar for both electrical stimulation and unstimulated products. Under conditions of no electrical stimulation used in this experiment, 10 days aging results in tenderness and overall liking scores greater than 60 and with ES similar scores are achieved in 5 days. Consumer scores over 60 greatly reduce the chance of meat being classified as unsatisfactory...|$|E
60|$|During {{all that}} time, instead of {{appearing}} to weary of Mrs. Wragge's society, she had patiently, almost eagerly, associated herself with her companion's one absorbing pursuit. She who had often chafed and fretted in past days under {{the monotony of}} her life in the freedom of Combe-Raven, now accepted without a murmur the monotony of her life at Mrs. Wragge's work-table. She who had hated the sight of her needle and thread in old times--who had never yet worn an article <b>of</b> <b>dress</b> <b>of</b> her own making--now toiled as anxiously over the making of Mrs. Wragge's gown, and bore as patiently with Mrs. Wragge's blunders, as if the sole object of her existence had been the successful <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> that one <b>dress.</b> Anything was welcome to her--the trivial difficulties of fitting a gown: the small, ceaseless chatter of the poor half-witted creature who was so proud of her assistance, and so happy in her company--anything was welcome that shut her out from the coming future, from the destiny to which she stood self-condemned. That sorely-wounded nature was soothed by such a trifle now as the grasp of her companion's rough and friendly hand--that desolate heart was cheered, when night parted them, by Mrs. Wragge's kiss.|$|R

Carried by the Crawler Transporter, Discovery arrived and was secured at LC-39A on 3 May 2008 at 06:06 EDT. The payload canister containing the JEM was rolled out to the Payload Changeout Room at the pad on 29 April 2008 and was later installed into Discoverys payload bay on 5 May 2008.
