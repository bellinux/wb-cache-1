40|$|Worried by {{the rising}} {{incidence}} of arrests, detention, jail, harassment and even murder of journalists across the world, {{all of which}} are crimes against press freedom, this paper {{takes a look at the}} reasons for the unpunished offences against press men and women and examines the efforts made to combat the impunity of such crimes. To accomplish this objective, the paper reviews the place of the press in society as the Forth Estate of the Realm; and discusses the specific roles of the media for the state, politics and religion. The work which is anchored on the social Responsibility Theory of the press, does an overview of press freedom, presents a roll call of past and contemporary cases of assault on the media; and lists possible causes of impunity of offenders against press freedom.

40|$|In Europe, the {{old adage}} that {{individuals}} are sent to prison as punishment rather than for punishment has now been supplemented by a further maxim: that prisoners retain all civil rights other than those that are incompatible with the very fact of loss of liberty. Prisoners retain their human rights, and the scope of these rights is increasing. For example, a plethora of decisions and judgments of the European Court of Human Rights has helped spell out the content of rights relating to communication {{with the outside world}} and exercise of the franchise. In Europe at least, prisons are changing in how the legal system engages with the treatment of prisoners. This text examines one particular aspect of this protection: the prohibition of ill-treatment in prison. It focuses upon what this prohibition entails, and the emergence of positive obligations and new expectations in respect of the responsibilities of prison services towards those entrusted to its care. It also examines the development of new obligations in respect of <b>combating</b> the <b>impunity</b> of those who use ill-treatment in places of detention. It seeks to provide a basic awareness of European standards, both in terms of legal obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and in respect of standard-setting by allied bodies (in particular, by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), but also by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe). It also highlights examples of good practice in domestic systems that may be worthy of emulation elsewhere. Working in prisons is not without significant challenge. The intention is that this text will help those concerned with this area of public provision achieve a more humane and open service. In this regard, it seeks to help realisation of Rule 81 (4) of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec. R(2006) 2 on the European Prison Rules. This provides that “The training of all staff shall include instruction in the international and regional human rights instruments and standards, especially by ECHR and the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT Convention), {{as well as in the}} application of the European Prison Rules. ” This text is designed for practitioners. It provides a guide to these legal instruments and standards in an accessible way. It follows upon a multilateral meeting held in Strasbourg in spring 2015 which helped bring together management and leadership from prison services from across Europe to address issues of common concern. It was clear from the discussions during the two days of the meeting that not only do many countries face the same set of problems, but also that “good practice” does exist across Europe, and that discussion not only of these challenges but also of possible solutions can be of real assistance. Following the meeting, representatives were asked to highlight further instances of “good practice” in their countries that could be of use elsewhere across Europe. Many good ideas were highlighted. In the space available, only a handful of these could be included...|$|R

40|$|I wish {{to recall}} that, {{in line with}} the {{decision}} adopted by the Peace and Security Council (PSC) at its 142 nd meeting held on 21 July 2008, calling for the formation of an AU High‐Level Panel on Darfur (AUPD), I appointed several eminent African personalities as members of the AUPD. The PSC decision was subsequently endorsed by the 12 th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Union held from 1 to 3 February 2009. The AUPD, which is chaired by former President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, was mandated to examine the situation in Darfur in‐depth and submit recommendations on how best to effectively and comprehensively address the issues of accountability and <b>combating</b> <b>impunity,</b> on the one hand, and peace, healing and reconciliation, on the other. In this context, the AUPD convened its inaugural meeting in Addis Ababa on 18 and 19 March 2009. This inaugural meeting was followed by wide consultations with both the Sudanese and international stakeholders. The Panel completed its work early this month and formally submitted its report to me on 8 October 2009. The Commission fully associates itself with the recommendations contained in the report and believes that they provide a clear roadmap on how best the interrelated issues of peace, justice, reconciliation and healing could be addressed in Darfur, thereby contributing to the overall objective of promoting sustainable peace and stability in the Sudan. It is my earnest hope that the PSC will seize the opportunity of the consideration of the report to further enhance Africa’s leadership in guiding the International community’s efforts to help Sudan and the Sudanese people attain peace, security, reconciliation and justice.

The creation of the International Criminal Court has been cited by scholars and activists as an achievement in <b>combating</b> <b>impunity</b> of the main perpetrators of crimes against human rights. The Organization was negotiated during the Clinton government and its treaty entered into force in 2002. The United States during Bush government conducted a calculated campaign to undermine the Court. Thus, the article analyzes the U. S. opposition to the International Criminal Court entered into a wider debate that takes into account different views regarding the new role of the United States in the international system reconfiguration in the post-cold war period. Since then, this article demonstrates that to understand the possibilities of strengthening or breakdown of global governance structures as the International Criminal Court is necessary to consider the variation of North American foreign policy in key fields such as security and human rights.

40|$|Idealism {{about what}} {{international}} criminal justice mechanisms can achieve has lead to ideologically driven judicial decision-making in international criminal law (ICL). ICL idealism manifests itself {{in the belief that}} international criminal prosecutions can achieve an awesome array of goals. These include retribution, deterrence, reconciliation, rehabilitation, incapacitation, restoration, building a historical record, preventing revisionism, expressive and didactic functions, crystallizing international norms, general affirmative prevention, establishing peace, preventing war, vindicating international law prohibitions, setting standards for fair trials, <b>combating</b> <b>impunity,</b> and more. Ironically, this idealistic overreach, although usually well intended, has actually contributed to the politicization of the international judicial process. The perverse consequences of this politicization frequently surface in the sentencing jurisprudence and punishment of perpetrators of atrocity crimes. The shortcomings of the sentencing practice of ICTR and ICTY provide ammunition for today’s ICC skeptics. In a trial process that frequently appears opaque to outsiders because of complex facts, extraordinary crimes, and unfamiliar procedural rules, the sentence is one feature that is readily accessible to the victimized communities {{and the rest of the}} watchful world. Unfortunately, as illustrated by local reactions and criticized by observers, sentencing appears erratic, unprincipled, and politically motivated. This article argues that international idealism has distorted the expression of condemnation and the just distribution of punishment among perpetrators of atrocity crimes. I establish this thesis by examining the application of reconciliation and deterrence in sentencing practice of international criminal courts. My tentative conclusion is that both reconciliation and deterrence ideologies have perversely impacted international sentencing such that the punishment imposed does not reflect the culpability of the individual. This is a troubling setback for any institution that holds itself out to be a criminal justice mechanism, and could challenge the supremacy of this type of mechanism as the primary response to atrocity crimes. Moreover, it is important to respect the limits of legalism as an agent of social engineering in post-conflict and transitional justice initiatives. Thus, this article’s findings also illuminate assumptions underlying the on-going debate concerning the efficacy of international criminal tribunals...|$|E
40|$|As stated at Nuremberg, {{the crime}} of {{aggression}} is the “supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole. ” International instruments clearly and repeatedly have outlawed initiating wars of aggression and other illegal uses of armed force. States parties recently have defined and codified the crime in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and delineated {{the scope of the}} ICC’s jurisdiction over aggression. Although the ICC is an important mechanism for accountability and justice, it is not certain when {{it will be able to}} adjudicate {{the crime of}} aggression. Moreover, the ICC will not have jurisdiction to prosecute all individuals who wage aggressive war, nor will it be free of political cooptation by states parties interested in quashing attempts to seek justice for acts of aggression committed by their leaders. Consequently, advocates <b>combating</b> <b>impunity</b> for international crimes should continue to view the ICC as a court of last resort, especially for prosecuting cases of aggression. Despite the many legal and political challenges, primary responsibility for prosecuting individuals for the use of armed force in violation of the U. N. Charter—the crime of aggression—should still rest with national courts. Once aggression is criminalized at the domestic level, three types of extraterritorial jurisdiction—passive nationality jurisdiction, protective jurisdiction, and universal jurisdiction—are avenues for enabling criminal prosecution of leaders who illegally use armed force. This Article examines each of these principles, their potential, and the challenges inherent in prosecuting the crime of aggression in national courts. In addition, it supports scholars’ arguments for expanding national-level jurisdiction over crimes of aggression committed domestically and internationally, finding that the crime of aggression is among the ‘core’ international crimes demanding accountability at the domestic level. It challenges arguments put forth by some scholars that national legislatures and prosecutors should not criminalize or prosecute individuals who wage aggressive war and finds that domesticating international criminal law, including outlawing the crime of aggression, is essential to achieve more effective prosecution of aggression. Unless additional exceptions are made to the current legal structures, however, the challenges of bringing perpetrators of aggressive war to justice under domestic law are considerable. Individual states, therefore, should (1) exercise jurisdiction and prosecute the crime whenever possible, and (2) consider ways to widen domestic avenues for justice in cases of aggression...|$|E
40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{problems}} and challenges of international criminal prosecutions in Africa. Part I examines the values of criminal prosecution. It examines whether international criminal prosecutions {{can be used as}} a vehicle to contribute to 2 ̆ 2 national reconciliation and to the restoration and maintenance of peace. 2 ̆ 2 I concede that punishing perpetrators of evil is definitively a viable mechanism for <b>combating</b> <b>impunity.</b> In appropriate cases, the criminal process can be deployed to engineer compliance with the law and to deter would-be perpetrators of evil. I argue, however, that the objectives of using criminal prosecution to reestablish social equilibrium and promote reconciliation, though laudable and rhetorically inspiring, are simply unattainable. The hope that international criminal prosecutions will reconcile mutually distrustful ethnic groups with a long history of reciprocal hatred is quaint, perhaps even naive. International criminal prosecutions launched in Africa amidst much publicity and high expectations are on the verge of oblivion, perhaps irrelevance. After more than ten years of international criminal prosecutions in Africa, it is becoming increasingly obvious that criminal prosecution is a weak reed on which to hoist the strategy of reestablishing social equilibrium and reconciling intergroup hostilities in post-conflict African societies. A confluence of systemic and environmental factors have undermined the hoped-for influence of international criminal prosecutions in Africa. Part II examines the limitations of criminal trials. This portion presents a clear and rich exploration of the causes of violence in Africa and explains why international criminal law has not delivered as promised. It offers some explanations of factors that undermine the effectiveness of international criminal prosecutions, namely attitudinal, environmental factors, lack of cooperation from state governments, and limits of criminal prosecution. It urges all those involved in the fight against impunity in Africa to rethink the deeply flawed assumptions about the capacity of international law to bring about transformative changes in the conduct of citizens and group relations in Africa. Violence is so interwoven with the maladies in the continent - corruption, poverty, ethnic tensions - that it is doubtful if criminal prosecutions alone can serve as a chastening influence on the behavior of the leaders or the citizens trapped within the society. Building an effective strategy to reestablish social order in post-conflict African societies requires an understanding of the idiosyncratic environmental factors that animate violence, as well as recognition that criminal prosecutions cannot address the social pathologies that have disfigured Africa. It is these pathologies that will define and shape Africa 2 ̆ 7 s future, not the legacy of criminal prosecutions...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{assesses the}} effectiveness {{and efficiency of}} the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), in implementing International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principles in sexual war crimes. The dissertation draws from disparate literature on the SCSL and on IHRL and IHL. As such it is mainly exploratory and qualitative in nature. The research also draws much from the theories on special tribunals, conduct of civil wars and theories {{on the rights of}} individuals. â€˜Efficacyâ€™ of the SCSL includes mainly the backlog clearance rate of the SCSL, whilst â€˜effectivenessâ€™ explores the reasons for the establishment of the SCSL. The ultimate aim of this research work is to explore the role of the SCSL in punishing offenders who bear the greatest responsibility in sexual war crimes perpetrated in the Sierra Leonean conflict. The study situates IHRL and IHL principles in sexual war crimes since gender-based crimes are often overlooked by most researchers. The research is exploratory in nature and relies mainly on secondary data on IHL and IHRL as well as the SCSL. This study focuses on the SCSL, which is a hybrid criminal court established in 2002 by the United Nations (UN) and the Government of Sierra Leone. As such, this study also gives brief backgrounds of the SCSL and the conflict in Sierra Leone. This study shows that serious IHL and IHRL violations have forced the international community to establish special courts the world over to deal with individual criminal liability. Tribunals that have been set up include: the Nuremburg or International Military Tribunal, Tokyo Tribunal, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The research also shows that IHL and IHRL are important areas of law that the international community is increasingly using in protecting victims of sexual crimes in peaceful and turbulent times by punishing offenders who bear the greatest criminal responsibility. It also demonstrates the role of the international community, governments, rights movements and victims in combating sexual crimes and dealing diligently with the culture of impunity in sexual crimes. It is against this background that this research shows that the SCSL has been effective though not very efficient in dealing with sexual war crimes. In spite of the challenges it faces, this research shows that the SCSL is implementing IHL and IHRL principles in punishing perpetrators of sexual war crimes committed during the strife in Sierra Leone. The research also shows that the international community has not taken a quasi-indifferent approach to issues of IHL and IHRL that arose during the civil war in Sierra Leone. This is because the United Nations and the government of Sierra Leone formed the SCSL together. The international community has thus set precedents on command, direct and indirect responsibility in internal conflicts, particularly in relation to crimes of a sexual nature. The jurisprudence on sexual crimes is now available. Future hybrid tribunals can now be established with clear time lines and basing on the SCSL model. The international community can also move towards restorative justice considering the fact that criticism of the SCSL includes its focus on retributive justice. Retributive justice is an important consideration in <b>combating</b> <b>impunity</b> in international crimes but it should be accompanied by restorative justice particularly in crimes of a sexual nature where victims are traumatized through being infected with sexually transmitted diseases, forced pregnancies, and forced illicit affairs or incest...|$|E
40|$|This {{volume is}} an inter-disciplinary {{scholarly}} resource bringing together contributions from writers, experienced academics and practitioners working in {{fields such as}} human rights, humanitarian law, public policy, psychology, cultural and peace studies, and earth jurisprudence. This collection of essays presents the most up to date knowledge and status {{of the field of}} transitional justice, and also highlights the emerging debates in this area, which are often overseen and underdeveloped in the literature. The volume provides a wide coverage of the arguments relating to controversial issues emanating from different regions of the world. The book is divided into four parts which groups different aspects of the problems and issues facing transitional justice as a field, and its processes and mechanisms more specifically. Part I concentrates on the traditional means and methods of dealing with past gross abuses of power and political violence. In this section, the authors also expand and often challenge the ways that these processes and mechanisms are conceptualised and introduced. Part II provides a forum for the contributors to share their first hand experiences of how traditional and customary mechanisms of achieving justice can be effectively utilised. Part III includes a collection of essays which challenges existing transitional justice models and provides new lenses to examine the formal and traditional processes and mechanisms. It aims to expose insufficiencies and some of the inherent practical and jurisprudential problems facing the field. Finally, Part IV, looks to the future by examining what remedies can be available today for abuses of rights of the future generations and those who have no standing to claim their rights, such as the environment. Since the late 1980 s massive political and legal transformations have taken place in Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America and Southern Africa, which has challenged many of the presumptions of legal and political foundations of a nation-state including the questions of how to build a nation-state in divided societies or the role of law in democracy building {{in the face of such}} massive societal changes driven by a holistic mix of players. This process is by no means over as one can judge but the most current ‘Arab Spring’ or even the ‘Occupy Wall Street’ type of movements across the world, including in the developed states. Participators of these events call for their rights to be upheld and protected; some others lobby for new rights to be recognised and realised. These worldwide phenomena challenge the existing international (legal and political) system and call for some novel and innovative means by which the new challenges can be addressed. Despite the vastness of research done on the subject matter this monograph suggests an innovative, if not challenging, way of utilising what the field of transitional justice has acquired in the process of examining how societies deal with past abuses to meet victims’ legitimate expectations of justice, truth and reparation. This manuscript will look to expand the field even further by suggesting that there are emerging fields which will, and in some instances already have, influenced the way we think about human rights in a global context. It will set forth new dimensions in conceptualising human rights and how their current and future instances of abuse can be addressed. This is a call to look ahead and into the future by trying to define the inadequacies of the current international system in recognising emerging trends. Understanding the world-wide developments, even if not yet fully legally defined, contributes to the work on <b>combating</b> <b>impunity</b> and ensuring respect for victims’ rights. As it is widely accepted that societies have different means of dealing with past (human) rights abuses thus it would be sensible to suggest that widening understanding of the relationship and cross-reference between the different fields and branches of international legal and political scholarship (all which affect human rights field) should also be encouraged. The Changing International Landscape of Transitional Justice: Emerging Trends and Issues will be a scholarly resource bringing together current knowledge and debates in the field and developing the many areas that are currently underdeveloped in the literature. The book will provide full coverage of the arguments relating to hot topics and controversial issues (e. g. hybrid threats, ecocide, ecological jurisprudence, case studies by practitioners from the human rights field). The invited contributors are all experienced academic writers and practitioners in their respective areas of expertise (law, politics, public policy, cultural studies) ...|$|E
