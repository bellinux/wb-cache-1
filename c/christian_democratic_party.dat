The parties in the coalition, named the Collective for Democracy (CD) and chaired by COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota, will retain their own identity and contest the election individually. The IFP denied {{being part of the}} coalition, saying they were wary of forming such alliances given the confusion it had caused for their supporters in previous elections. Three days later, the 20th, COSATU's largest affiliate National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) announced that they would not endorse the ANC or any other political party in 2014. NUMSA planned to establish a new working class collective {{along the lines of the}} defunct United Democratic Front, with the ultimate goal of forming a socialist party that will contest the 2019 general election. An opposing COSATU faction has obtained a legal opinion on removing NUMSA from COSATU, with significant implications for the country's labour and political landscape.|$|E

5|$|When the {{standing}} committee visited the two projects in 1996, they {{were met by}} demonstrators {{in favor of the}} bridge in Hardanger, and demonstrators in opposition to the fixed link in Sunnhordland. In May, SBT proposed building a culvert on Digernes as a compromise for a proposal from the Labour Party and the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> to consider other solution, which could have postponed the project several years. Parliament decided on 11 June 1996, with 144 against 20 votes, to build the Triangle Link. The Folgefonna Tunnel was also passed, while the Hardanger Bridge was put aside.|$|E

The second cabinet Bondevik did not survive the 2005 elections, and as such Hareide had to step down from office that year. His successor was Helen Bjørnøy. Until 2009, Hareide had never been elected to the Norwegian Parliament, but served as a deputy representative during the terms 19972001, 20012005 and 20052009.

5|$|In December 1999, a {{disagreement}} arose between the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the city; {{the city would}} not except the government's promise to finance part of the line. Both Minister of Transport and Communications, Dag Jostein Fjærvoll from the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and Oslo City Commissioner of Transport and the Environment, Merete Agerbak-Jensen from the Conservative Party, agreed upon the distribution of funding {{from the city and}} state, and both wanted construction to start as soon as possible. The city council did not accept the guarantees from the state until March 2000. Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. The city would pay NOK 224 million, while the state would pay NOK 673 million.|$|E
5|$|Oslo {{announced}} in January 2004 that they, jointly with Lillehammer, planned {{to bid for}} the 2014 Winter Olympics. Deputy Mayor Svenn Kristiansen (Progress Party) speculated that normal hill ski jumping would be replaced with ski flying on the Olympic program and that it therefore {{would be necessary to}} build a ski flying hill in Oslo. In November 2004, a Norwegian Ski Federation committee concluded that a new hill in Rødkleiva should be prioritized and that is would cost between NOK300 and 400 million. The following month Minister of Culture Valgerd Svarstad Haugland (<b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party)</b> criticized the federation for allowing Bertil Pålsrud and Steinar Johannesen to hold key roles in the decision process, while both owned a 13.3-percent stake in Rødkleiva Skiflyging.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{political}} parties have been represented in the committee. The first committee consisted exclusively {{of members of the}} Liberal Party.

In 1907, Francis Hagerup became the first representative from the Conservative Party, and this party has been represented on the board since. The Labour Party has been represented on the board since 1919, when Halvdan Koht became a member. The Agrarian Party (since named the Centre Party) was first represented on the board by Birger Braadland in 1938. The <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> was first represented by Erling Wikborg in 1965, the Socialist Left Party by Hanna Kvanmo in 1991 and the Progress Party by Inger-Marie Ytterhorn in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|As a generalization, {{it can be}} {{said that}} <b>Christian</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> in Europe tend to be {{moderately}} conservative, and in several cases form the main conservative party in their respective countries (e.g. in Germany, Spain and Belgium, Switzerland: <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Peoples <b>Party</b> of Switzerland (CVP), Christian Social Party (CSP), Evangelical Peoples Party of Switzerland (EVP). Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland (EDU). In Latin America, by contrast, <b>Christian</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> tend to be left-leaning and to some degree influenced by liberation theology. These generalizations, however, must be nuanced by the consideration that Christian democracy does not fit precisely into the usual categories of political thought, but rather includes elements common to several other political ideologies, including conservatism, liberalism, and social democracy: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{position}} was created with the ministry on 22 February 1946, when Nils Langhelle (Labour) was appointed. The ministry and minister position were split {{out from the}} Ministry of Labour. Twenty-eight people have held the position, representing six parties. Sixteen people have represented the Labour Party, five the Centre Party, two each the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party {{and one for the}} Progress Party. The longest-sitting minister is Kjell Opseth (Labour) who sat a week short of six years. Lars Leiro (Centre) sat for only four weeks, giving him the shortest tenure. He both succeeded and preceded Trygve Bratteli, the only person to have held the position twice and the only officeholder to later become Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|After Høybråten {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection as party leader of KrF, Hareide quickly emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Høybråten, after the two other apparent candidates, Dagrun Eriksen and Hans Olav Syversen, announced they would not run. Hareide is considered to belong to the socially liberal wing of the party, and conservative members of the party have demanded {{that at least one of}} the deputy leaders be from the party's conservative wing if they are to support Hareide. Hareide supported the efforts to eliminate the rule which requires <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> representatives to declare a Christian faith, and a vote gave a clear majority to abolish that rule two years later. Hareide was unanimously voted in as new party leader at the 2011 convention on 30 April 2011. Hareide declined the nomination as parliamentary leader, and Hans Olav Syversen was elected to this position.|$|E
5|$|During late 1989, advance tolls on the ferries were {{approved}} by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990, {{but this was not}} immediately supported by the government. On 18 and 19 September 1990, the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications visited the region and looked at the proposed areas of the Triangle Link, the Hardanger Bridge and the Folgefonna Tunnel. By then it had been established that the Triangle Link would not need state grants, as it could be entirely financed with tolls. Tore Haugen, Conservative parliamentarian from Akershus, proposed that the project be considered independent of the regular national road plans. However, Lars Gunnar Lie, Minister of Transport and Communications from the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> stated that he planned a single report to Parliament for all three projects.|$|E
