5|$|During the {{economic}} {{expansion of the}} 1830s, Irish and German immigration to St. Louis increased substantially. In particular, the writings of Gottfried Duden encouraged German immigration. Many Irish were motivated by the Irish potato famine of 1845–1846 and the failed Irish uprising of 1848. Other Irish settlers <b>came</b> <b>because</b> of its reputation as a Catholic city.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{women in the}} Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women. They held various roles {{including}} prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing {{to be left behind}} to fend for themselves, some <b>came</b> <b>because</b> their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.|$|E

5000|$|As Paul Goldberger pointed out, [...] "Xintiandi is so {{successful}} that Shui On {{has been asked to}} replicate its formula elsewhere in China, and other developers are trying to build copycat projects. Christopher Choa, an American architect who lives in Shanghai, told me, “It has become a verb. Developers say to architects, ‘Can you Xintiandi this project for me?’ The young Chinese people <b>come</b> <b>because</b> they think it’s trendy, the foreigners <b>come</b> <b>because</b> they think it’s historically significant, and the old people <b>come</b> <b>because</b> they feel nostalgia.” Since Xintiandi opened, Shanghai has begun to preserve much more architecture than it ever did before.|$|R

25|$|Currencies {{like the}} Alfonsino peso, Mexican cob coins (locally called hilis kalamay), other {{currencies}} and coins from other Spanish colonies were also used. Many of the coins that reached the Philippines <b>came</b> <b>because</b> of the Manila Galleon which dominated trade {{for the next}} 250 years. These were brought across the Pacific Ocean in exchange for odd-shaped silver cobs, which are also known as macuquinas. Other coins that followed were the dos mundos or pillar dollars in silver, the counterstamped coins and the portrait series, also in silver.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish conquest {{also brought}} the {{migration}} of people of African descent to the many regions of the Viceroyalty. Some came as free blacks, but vast majority <b>came</b> <b>because</b> of the introduction of African slavery. As the native population was decimated by epidemics and forced labor, black slaves were imported. Mixes with Europeans and indigenous peoples also occurred, resulting {{in the creation of}} new racial categories such as Mulattos and Zambos to account for these offspring. As with the term Mestizo, these other terms were associated with illegitimacy, since a majority—though not all—of these people were born outside of wedlock.|$|E

25|$|Gopher {{tortoises}} {{have been}} kept as pets, preventing them from reproducing in their local populations. Captured gopher tortoises can be raced in tortoise races. This practice was banned in Florida in 1989. Moving a tortoise can lead to harmful consequences to the environment from which it <b>came,</b> <b>because</b> the tortoise is often not returned {{to the same place}} where it was found. Also, as tortoise racing involves several tortoises in close proximity to one another, diseases can easily spread from one tortoise to another. If an infected captive tortoise is then returned to the environment, other tortoises may be infected.|$|E
25|$|An {{assistant}} coachof Los Angeles Rams, Bruce Snyder {{arrived to}} {{head coach at}} Berkeley in 1987. Snyder was able gradually turn the program around. In 1990 Cal had its first winning season since Kapp's 1982. The Golden Bears went 4–3–1 in the Pac-10, finishing 4th, which was its highest since Mike White's 4th place in 1977. That year California played in the Copper Bowl where it beat Wyoming 17–15. This was the Bears first bowl win since the 1938 Rose Bowl. Part of Snyder's success <b>came</b> <b>because</b> {{he was able to}} recruit a number of outstanding players, such as Russell White, Mike Pawlawski,Sean Dawkins, Troy Auzenne, David Ortega, away from football powers such as USC and UCLA.|$|E
25|$|However, Charmley {{dismisses the}} {{concerns}} of contemporaries such as Charles Webster and Lord Cecil of Chelwood that Bevin, a man of very strong personality, was “in {{the hands of his}} officials”. Charmley argues that much of Bevin's success <b>came</b> <b>because</b> he shared the views of those officials: his earlier career had left him with an intense dislike of communists, whom he regarded as workshy intellectuals whose attempts to infiltrate trade unions were to be resisted. His former Private Secretary Oliver Harvey thought Bevin’s staunchly anti-Soviet policy was what Eden’s would have been had he not been hamstrung, as at Potsdam, by Churchill’s occasional susceptibility to Stalin’s flattery, whilst Cadogan thought Bevin “pretty sound on the whole”.|$|E

25|$|Walking {{and hiking}} {{opportunities}} attract {{a large number}} of people to North Devon's Biosphere Reserve. There are footpaths throughout the national parks of Exmoor and Dartmoor, and the South West Coast Path stretches along the whole of the north coast of the reserve from Welcombe to Lynton. In 2003 research indicated that the South West Coast Path brought around £300million a year in total to the South West, which could support more than 7,500 jobs. This research also recorded that 27.6% of visitors to the region <b>came</b> <b>because</b> of the Path, and they spent £136million in a year. Local people took 23million walks on the Path and spent a further £116million, and other visitors contributed the remainder. A further study in 2005 estimated this figure to have risen to around £300 million.|$|E
25|$|LeMay piloted one {{of three}} {{specially}} modified B-29s flying from Japan to the U.S. in September 1945, in the process breaking several aviation records at that date, including the greatest USAAF takeoff weight, the longest USAAF non-stop flight, and the first ever non-stop Japan–Chicago flight. One of the pilots was of higher rank: Lieutenant General Barney M. Giles. The other two aircraft used up more fuel than LeMay's in fighting headwinds, and they could not fly to Washington, D.C., the original goal. Their pilots decided to land in Chicago to refuel. LeMay's aircraft had sufficient fuel to reach Washington, but he was directed by the War Department to join the others by refueling at Chicago. The order was ostensibly given because of borderline weather conditions in Washington, but according to First Lieutenant Ivan J. Potts who was on board, the order <b>came</b> <b>because</b> LeMay had one fewer general's stars {{and should not be}} seen to outperform his superior.|$|E
25|$|Sehwag had his {{international}} {{breakthrough in}} Sri Lanka in August 2001 {{when he was}} promoted to the opening slot for the tri-series also involving New Zealand. The promotion to open the innings <b>came</b> <b>because</b> regular opener Sachin Tendulkar was absent due to a foot injury. In the match against New Zealand that was to decide the finalist, he scored his maiden century from 69 balls. At the time, the century was the third fastest ODI century for an Indian behind Mohammad Azharuddin's 62 ball effort and Yuvraj Singh's 64 ball effort. This was his first score beyond 50 in ten matches and saw him named the Man of the Match. This performance earned him a regular spot in the ODI squad in the middle-order. He bettered his own record by hitting a 60-ball century against New Zealand during the 2009 tour. An innings of note in 2002 was the 22 ball half-century against Kenya in Bloemfontein, tying the second fastest 50 by an Indian. Because of his attacking cricket stroke plays, Sehwag has got many fans, including the WestIndies legend Desmond Haynes, who admitted that he is a great fan of him.|$|E

25|$|The {{truth about}} Dumbledore's death is {{revealed}} through Snape's last memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore {{made a terrible}} error by placing a cursed ring on his right hand, sometime between the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the ring. The ring held the Resurrection Stone, which Dumbledore hoped to use {{to allow him to}} apologise to his sister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape arrived and assessed the curse, {{all he could do was}} contain it. Snape told Dumbledore that he had little more than a year to live. After hearing this news, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have Draco kill him. He asked Snape to use the Killing Curse on him when the time <b>came</b> <b>because</b> he did not want Draco to have to kill him, saying that the boy's soul was still intact; Draco's soul would have been damaged in killing Dumbledore out of malice, whereas Snape was fully aware that he would be merely sparing Dumbledore pain and humiliation. He also intended for Snape to be the one to kill him and for the Elder Wand to be buried with him, in order to prevent the wand from being passed on again.|$|E
