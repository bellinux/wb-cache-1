By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer {{different types of}} lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, {{with the development of}} iceberg lettuce, 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce.</b> By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production.

However, one consists in technology of high cost, that it may be attenuated with the increase in the efficiency of the use of the protected area, proportionated for the intercropping. The experiment was carried out at greenhouse at UNESP, Jaboticabal-SP, in the period of August and November of 2005, with the aim of evaluating the operational cost (COT) and the profitability of the <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> "Veronica" (Lactuca sativa L.) in monoculture and in intercropping with the Japanese cucumber "Hokushin" (Cucumis sativus L.), in protected environment. The main cost items analyzed were the operational cost, the agricultural amendments and the materials cost.

40|$|Combining {{photovoltaic}} panels (PVPs) and crops {{on the same}} land unit were recently proposed {{as an alternative to}} the conversion of cropland into photovoltaic plants. This could alleviate the increasing competition for land between food and energy production. In such agrivoltaic systems, an upper layer of PVPs partially shades crops at ground level. The aim of this work was to (i) assess the effect on crop yield of two PVPs densities, resulting in two shade levels equal to 50 % and 70 % of the incoming radiation and (ii) identify morphological and physiological determinants of the plant response to shade. Experiments were conducted on four varieties of <b>lettuces</b> (two <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuces</b> and two cutting lettuces), during two seasons. In all cases, the relative lettuce yield at harvest was equal or higher than the available relative radiation. Lettuce yield was maintained through an improved Radiation Interception Efficiency (RIE) in the shade, while Radiation Conversion Efficiency (RCE) did not change significantly. Enhanced RIE was explained by (i) an increase in the total leaf area per plant, despite a decrease in the number of leaves and (ii) a different distribution of leaf area among the pool of leaves, the maximal size of leaves increasing in the shade. Our result provides a framework for the selection of adapted varieties according to their morphological traits and physiological responses to PVP shade, in order to optimize agrivoltaic systems...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{is intended}} to assist nursery and greenhouse growers, extension personnel, researchers and others concerned about control of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) {{in the field and}} greenhouse. Growers should be particularly cautious about selecting susceptible cultivars as well as allowing susceptible weeds to grow in or around their crops. These lists can help determine which plants or weeds pose a threat. The bibliography of original references might be especially useful to researchers as a starting point to the current literature base on TSWV. Tomato spotted wilt virus has one of the widest host ranges of any known plant virus. Over 550 species, including both monocots and dicots representing 62 families are confirmed hosts. In recent years, TSWV has accounted for major crop losses of <b>crisphead</b> and romaine <b>lettuce</b> in Hawaii, and for losses in peanuts exceeding five million dollars in 1986 in Texas alone. In 1989 and 1990, commercial greenhouses throughout the United States and Canada suffered heavy losses in bedding plant production to the virus. Onion, tobacco, tomato, pineapple, watermelon, and ornamentals have incurred significant economic damage from TSWV as well. Serological analysis confirms that TSWV-I (the impatiens strain of TSWV) has been responsible for serious losses in the bedding plant industry in the Northwest, particularly in impatiens, begonia, an...|$|R

40|$|Beginning in 2000 and {{continuing}} into 2004, a previously undescribed disease caused significant damage to romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa) {{in the coastal}} Salinas Valley of California. Symptoms were brownish black, sunken cavities on the crown and upper taproot. Cavities were firm, lacked signs of fungal growth, and resulted in cracking and weakening of the crown. Affected plants were stunted, uneven in growth, and unmarketable. <b>Crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> also developed these symptoms, although disease incidence was always lower than that for romaine. A fungus was consistently isolated from cavities. Using morphological features and molecular methods, the fungus was identified as Phoma exigua. Pathogenicity of isolates from romaine and <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> was demonstrated on both of these lettuce types. Replicated field studies showed that azoxystrobin, boscalid, and cyprodinil + fludioxonil fungicides effectively controlled the disease.

Os resultados evidenciaram elevados percentuais de contaminação em todas as variedades de hortaliças analisadas, porém as freqüências de protozoários foram maiores no agrião. As amostras de alfaces apresentaram os menores percentuais de contaminação, enquanto que a escarola apresentou valores geralmente situados entre o agrião e as alfaces. Observou-se uma grande variedade de protozoários, cujas freqüências de ocorrência na população residente na Região Metropolitana de São Paulo são igualmente elevadas. Os mais freqüentes foram Entamoeba sp (com 4 e 8 núcleos) e Giardia sp. Foram também isolados cistos de Iodamoeba sp, Endolimax sp e Chilomastix sp.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Chemicals {{are being}} sought that can control weeds in lettuce under {{different}} environmental conditions, soil types and weed populations. The extensive or repeated {{use of a}} herbicide may lead to important changes in the weed population which call for new materials that {{can take care of}} the modified situation. In the search for new chemicals, RH 315 has appeared promising in some respects. Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to determine the tolerance of <b>lettuce</b> (<b>crisphead</b> type) to RH 315 in three types of soil. Its performance on weeds under different environmental conditions, its residual action on other vegetables, as well as pre and postemergence activity on weeds were also tested. Other herbicides were used in some experiments. <b>Lettuce</b> of the <b>crisphead</b> type proved to possess high tolerance to RH 315. The tolerance was greater in a silty clay loam and a muck soil than in a sandy soil. In all types of soil, the safety factor was greater than 2 X when susceptible weeds are considered. The degree of tolerance varied with the season in field experiments. RH 315 at 1. 5 to 2 lb/A in a silty clay loam and at 1 to 1. 5 lb/A in a sandy loam provided excellent control of annual bluegrass, Italian ryegrass, barnyardgrass, green foxtail, common chickweed, purslane, mouseear chickweed, lambsquarters, henbit, red dead-nettle, shepherspurse and bittercress. The control of pigweed and wild mustard required higher rates. No control of composite species was achieved with this compound. Delaying sprinkler irrigation after application caused reduction in RH 315 activity. It was more effective in controlling weeds in early fall than during the summer. Two months after application, RH 315 residues from rates which were effective in controlling susceptible weeds did not cause injury to bush beans, sweet corn, cucumbers, red beets, common chickweed and annual bluegrass, under summer conditions. When applied at the stage of two true leaves or before, under conditions of early fall, RH 315 proved to possess postemergence activity on weed species that are controlled by preemergence applications of this compound. From 17 to 2 O days were required for RH 315 to exert its effect in postemergence application. Trifluralin at 0. 75 lb/A provided excellent control of Italian ryegrass, barnyardgrass, pigweed and purslane both in a silty clay loam and a sandy loam. Benefin and EL 179 both at 1 lb/A gave good control of the same weeds in the silty clay loam, but their performance was inferior to that of trifluralin.

This fungus is a soil-borne pathogen that can remain viable in soil for many years. Soil solarization has shown promise in managing Fusarium wilt in other cropping systems {{as well as}} in lettuce field trials conducted during 2004 and 2005. In an effort to maximize the solarization effect on subsequent disease development, the following factors were evaluated in a 2006 field trial: 1) solarization of unshaped versus preshaped beds, 2) the effect of soil moisture on solarization efficiency of preshaped beds, and 3) effect of lettuce type on Fusarium wilt incidence after solarization. The entire field was flood irrigated on Jun 21. Plots were solarized during Jul and/or Aug by covering beds with 1 -mil thick clear plastic. During the solarization treatment from Jul 3 to Sep 10, the mean soil temperature in preshaped solarized beds at a depth of 2 and 9 inches was 116 and 95 °F, respectively, and 102 and 97 °F, respectively, in beds not covered with plastic. When solarization was initiated 15 days after soil irrigation, a 20 % reduction in Fusarium wilt was recorded for a <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> cultivar grown on solarized unshaped beds compared to a 56 % reduction in disease when the same crisphead cultivar was grown on preshaped solarized beds. There {{was no significant difference between}} a one and two month solarization period in the subsequent number of diseased lettuce plants. Solarization of preshaped beds 15 days after irrigation for one month reduced Fusarium wilt on <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> by 56 %, whereas the same solarization period initiated seven days after irrigation resulted in a 96 % reduction of disease. The same one-month solarization period started one week after soil irrigation reduced the incidence of Fusarium wilt on green leaf (Two Star) and romaine (Green Towers) by 97 and 88 %, respectively, compared to plants grown on unsolarized beds. The data show that summer solarization of moist soil can 1) destroy propagules of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae in infested fields and 2) be a useful cultural management tool to significantly reduce the incidence of Fusarium wilt in a subsequent crop of lettuce...|$|E

A randomized complete block design with three replications was used. Treatments were a factorial combination of four nitrogen rates (0. 0; 60. 0; 120. 0 and 180. 0 kg ha- 1) applied in additional the dose commonly used by growers (60 kg ha- 1 of N) and five foliar molybdenum rates (0. 0; 35. 1; 70. 2; 105. 3 and 140. 4 g ha- 1). The total and commercial fresh weight and head circumference showed significant effects for doses of nitrogen and of molybdenum, {{as well as for}} their interaction. No significant effects of the treatments for stem length were observed. There was a linear effect of N and Mo doses for postharvest conservation at 28 days, and the rate of 150. 0 kg ha- 1 of N showed the best conservation at 35 days after the harvest.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} low temperature on the physiological and biochemical processes, we held two <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa L.) cultivars ‘Shizuka` and ‘Cisco` at 5 °C for 10 days. Minimum weight loss and lower respiration rate along with a higher hue angle value were recorded from both cultivars. However, cultivar ‘Cisco` showed higher relative weight loss, respiration rate and accumulation of ammonia {{compared to that of}} ‘Shizuka`. Except in the leaf portion of ‘Shizuka`, glutamine synthetase (GS, 6. 3. 1. 2) activity did not change significantly. The accumulation of ammonia was supposed to be below the critical level to repress GS activity. However, the highest amount of ammonia content was found {{at the end of the}} storage period in all cases. Amination activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, 1. 4. 1. 2) decreased by day 4 and slightly increased thereafter while the deamination activity did not show any significant change. Overall, GDH-amination activity was remarkably higher than GDH-deamination activity and the leaf portion showed higher GDH-amination activity while the midrib portion showed higher GDH-deamination activity. Between the two cultivars, ‘Cisco` could have a shorter shelf life than ‘Shizuka`. The results suggested that although the visual quality of lettuce was maintained at low temperature, some physio-biochemical changes occurred in this period...|$|E

Raider, foram conduzidos dois ensaios nos períodos de maio a agosto de 2002 (inverno) e novembro de 2002 a janeiro de 2003 (verão), no município de Três Pontas-MG. Utilizou-se o delineamento de blocos ao acaso em parcelas subdivididas, sendo as parcelas constituídas pelas épocas de plantio (inverno e verão) e as subparcelas pelas doses de silício (0, 0; 0, 9; 1, 8; 2, 7 e 3, 6 L ha- 1), com quatro repetições. A maior massa fresca total, {{comercial}} e circunferência da cabeça foram obtidas no plantio de inverno. Para os dados relativos às doses de silício ajustou-se modelo quadrático, pelo qual se estimaram as doses 2, 0 e 2, 7 L ha- 1, como as que proporcionaram os maiores rendimentos de massa fresca total e comercial, respectivamente. Ajustou-se modelo quadrático com ponto de máxima circunferência para a dose de 2, 1 L ha- 1 de silício, que proporcionou circunferência de 40, 1 cm. O plantio de inverno apresentou melhor conservação pós-colheita que o de verão, quando avaliado por uma escala de notas, aos 10 e 20 dias após a colheita. Para aplicação aos 20 dias após o transplante, evidenciou-se efeito quadrático onde a dose de 2, 0 L ha- 1 de silício promoveu a melhor conservação pós-colheita da alface. The {{influence of}} planting times and silicon levels were evaluated on yield and post-harvest quality of <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce,</b> cv. Raider. Two trials {{were carried out}} in Três Pontas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from May to August of 2002 (winter season) and November to January of 2003 (summer season). A randomized complete block design of split-plots was used, with two planting times applied to the main plots (winter and summer season) and five silicon levels (0. 0; 0. 9; 1. 8; 2. 7 and 3. 6 L ha- 1) applied to the subplots in four replications. The highest total and commercial fresh mass and head circumference were obtained in the winter planting times. A quadratic model adjusted for silicon levels showed that 2. 0 and 2. 7 L ha- 1 levels resulted in the highest yield of total and commercial fresh mass, respectively. A maximum circumference of 40. 1 cm was obtained with 2. 1 L ha- 1 silicon, according to a quadratic model. The winter planting showed better post-harvest conservation than the summer planting when evaluated by a scale at 10 and 20 days after harvest.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the physiological and biochemical changes during postharvest storage of two <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa L.) cultivars, `Shizuka` and `Cisco`. Lettuce heads were stored for up to 10 days at 20 °C. Both cultivars showed remarkable changes in weight loss and respiration rate along with hue angle value. The glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6. 3. 1. 2) activity decreased gradually in the leaf portion of both cultivars. However, in the midrib portion, these changes were not so prominent. Increased activities of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, EC 1. 4. 1. 2) were found in both portions and cultivars with little fluctuation on 2 and 4 days. The aminating activity of GDH was substantially higher than deaminating activity. Though ammonia content was increasing throughout the storage period, significantly higher accumulation was started after 4 days. However, the initial content and accumulation of ammonia were noticeably higher in the cultivar `Cisco` for both portions. There was a highly significant negative correlation observed between GS activity and ammonia content whereas a significantly positive (highly in `Cisco`) relationship was found between GDH activity and ammonia content in the leaf portion of both cultivars. An inverse relationship between GS and GDH indicated that these two enzymes are subject to concurrent regulation by a common metabolite. Based on the parameters determined in this study, the cultivar `Shizuka` showed longer shelf-life than `Cisco`...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} with lettuce at the field and in the glasshouse at the Hatfield Experimental Farm, University of Pretoria. The objectives {{of the study were}} to evaluate the performance of selected <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> cultivars in relation to yield and quality performance and to investigate which level of nitrogen can produce high quality transplants. In the lettuce cultivar trial, fifteen <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> cultivars were grown, during March to May 2004. The experiment was laid out as a randomised complete block design with four replications. At harvest, the centre 20 plants were cut for yield determination and five uniform plants were then cut longitudinally for head quality characteristics. For each cultivar, compactness and uniformity were also evaluated and the number of days to maturity was recorded. Among the cultivars tested, the best yielding cultivars were Dual Purpose (46. 8 t•ha- 1), Great Lakes (45. 8 t•ha- 1), Mohawk (44. 3 t•ha- 1) and Victory (43. 9 t•ha- 1). Poor yielding cultivars were Taina (30. 5 t•ha- 1), Cannon (31. 5 t•ha- 1), Summer Time (32. 1 t•ha- 1) and Classic (33. 2 t•ha- 1). Del Rio was the best disease resistant cultivar, producing 100 % marketable heads. All cultivars tested had good compactness and uniformity with the exception of Great Lakes 659. Early-maturing cultivars were ready 60 days after transplanting. Seeds of the lettuce cultivar ‘Aviram’ were sown, in the nitrogen nutrition of lettuce transplant’s trial. Two days after seeding, the seedlings were fertigated every second day by floating the trays in the plastic-lined tubs containing nutrient solution at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg•L- 1 N until field capacity was reached. Transplants produced with 0 N grew poorly, regardless of the sampling date. Nitrogen at 120 mg• L- 1 improved the response of shoot growth, plant height and leaf area, but adversely affected root growth. In general, relative growth rate was improved while net assimilation rate was reduced as N level increased. Root: shoot ratio decreased with applied N. The largest values of root: shoot ratio were obtained with 0 N. Both specific leaf area and leaf area ratio increased with applied N. Leaf mass ratio improved, while root mass ratio was reduced as N levels increased. At 35 days after sowing, leaf tissue N increased from 0. 43 to 4. 15 mg•kg- 1 with N applied. Only 25 % of the plants produced without N could be pulled from the seedling trays, whereas 90 % could be pulled when 90 mg•L- 1 N was added. This work suggested that at least 90 mg•L- 1 N, supplied via floatation irrigation was required to produce a transplant with sufficient roots for ease of pulling. Applying 90 mg•L- 1 N, resulted in improved root and shoot growth, resulting in high quality transplants. Dissertation (M Inst Agrar (Horticulture)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|The genetic {{architecture}} of crop domestication is generally characterized by three trends: relatively few genomic regions with major QTL effects are involved, QTL are often clustered, and alleles {{derived from the}} crop do not always contribute to the crop phenotype. We have investigated the genetic {{architecture of}} lettuce using a recombinant inbred line population from {{a cross between a}} crop Lactuca sativa (‘Salinas’) and its wild relative L. serriola. Few genomic regions with major QTL, plus various intermediate QTL, largely control the transition from wild to cultivated <b>Crisphead</b> <b>lettuce.</b> Allelic effects of all major QTL were in the expected direction, but there were intermediate QTL where the crop contributed to the wild phenotype and vice versa. We found two main regions with clusters of QTL, one on linkage group 3, where the crop allele induced lower seed output, another on linkage group 7, where the crop allele caused a delay in flowering time. Potentially, knowledge of genetic changes due to the domestication could be relevant for the chance that a transgene inserted in a crop genome will spread to wild relatives due to hitchhiking effects. If a transgene would be inserted in one of these regions, background selection on the crop alleles may lead to a reduced fitness of hybrids with the transgene. QTL research on the effects of domestication genes can thus indicate regions in the crop genome that are less likely to introgress, although these still need to be verified under field conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a clear}} {{need for}} new {{approaches}} {{in the field of}} microbial community analyses, since the methods used can be severely biased. We have developed a DNA array-based method that targets 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), enabling the direct detection and quantification of microorganisms from complex communities without cultivation. The approach is based on the construction of specific probes from the 16 S rDNA sequence data retrieved directly from the communities. The specificity of the assay is obtained through a combination of DNA array hybridization and enzymatic labeling of the constructed probes. Cultivation-dependent assays (enrichment and plating) and cultivation-independent assays (direct fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) were used as reference methods in the development and evaluation of the method. The description of microbial communities in ready-to-eat vegetable salads in a modified atmosphere was used as the experimental model. Comparisons were made with respect to the effect of storage at different temperatures for up to 12 days and with respect to the geographic origin of the <b>crisphead</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Spanish or Norwegian), the main salad component. The conclusion drawn from the method comparison was that the DNA array-based method gave an accurate description of the microbial communities. Pseudomonas spp. dominated both of the salad batches, containing either Norwegian or Spanish lettuce, before storage and after storage at 4 °C. The Pseudomonas population also dominated the batch containing Norwegian lettuce after storage at 10 °C. On the contrary, Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria dominated the microbial community of the batch containing Spanish lettuce after storage at 10 °C. In that batch, the Enterobacteriaceae also were abundant after storage at 4 °C as well as before storage. The practical implications of these results are that microbial communities in ready-to-eat vegetable salads can be diverse and that microbial composition is dependent both on the origin of the raw material and on the storage conditions...|$|E
