He questioned Dorsey concerning each of the cash memoranda--certain <b>checks,</b> <b>charge</b> slips, etc., carried over from the previous day's work--with unimpeachable courtesy, yet with something so mysteriously momentous in his frigid manner, that the teller was reduced to pink cheeks and a stammering tongue.|$|R

5000|$|The {{basis of}} WeRe Bank is the Re unit of currency, {{effectively}} a time-based currency where members can be credited with units {{according to the}} [...] "energy" [...] they expend.

These have {{the appearance of a}} standard British bank cheque, and several websites have encouraged their readers to become WeRe members and attempt to use the [...] "cheques" [...] to settle debts such as mortgage arrears, loan repayments or utility bills. Because WeRe Bank is not a bank within the British Cheque and Credit Clearing Company system or even a company, and because WeRe Bank does not subscribe to the standards of the UK Payments Administration nor any of the world's clearing houses, the payees will not receive payment of the amounts on the fake cheques, meaning that the debt is unpaid, and can be increased by late payment fees, return <b>check</b> <b>charges</b> and legal costs.

5000|$|The {{transformation}} of the 105th and Euclid intersection and wild successes of the 23 businesses were not welcomed by the powerful establishment elite and other institutional neighbors in the previously racially restricted University Circle area. The visible infiltration of such large numbers of blacks into their community was viewed as “an eyesore”. As reported in the local press, the City of Cleveland’s and Cleveland Clinic Foundation’s joint plans for creating a sprawling, mega-billion-dollar medical educational metropolis connecting Case Western Reserve University, University hospitals, and the clinic were well underway. Having formed this alliance {{to become one of}} the most dominant medical facilities in the country, these powerful entities also joined forces in seizing strategically located parcels situated in the middle of their planned massive expansion. In spite of years of legal battles and courtroom confrontations, the adversaries proved to be too powerful. Finally, in 1982, with its millionaire owner incarcerated on a bogus bad <b>check</b> <b>charge</b> and isolated in solitary confinement in a penal facility 190 miles away, the entire block was seized, cordoned off and demolished “to make way for redevelopment” and further expansion of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.

40|$|This {{progress}} report describes several projects that U of Oklahoma has participated in. The {{first is a}} muon background calculation from decay of charged pions and kaons, using ISR data at center of mass energies of 31 and 53 GeV. These calculations were compared {{with a number of}} different events. A copy of an agreement between Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and participants in experiment E- 653 is enclosed. This experiment tags charm and beauty particles by observing their decay lengths. The agreement sets out the items which need to be done in order to properly execute this experiment. A program to construct and test prototype silicon stripe detectors is also described. Preliminary detectors are in hand for testing, some are installed for actual beams for testing, and {{on the basis of these}} results the group expects to specify the design for a new system. The goals at present are to <b>check</b> <b>charge</b> collection, to <b>check</b> track point resolution, and to check vertex reconstruction resolution. A copy of a letter of intent to submit a proposal to LEP is included. The group proposes to submit a proposal to build an experiment with approximately 1 % momentum resolution at 50 GeV/c for identifying photons, electrons, and muons. This proposal would aim at scalar particles, where accurate measures of small branching ratio decays are important. Some preliminary results from Monte Carlo simulation and data analysis of experiment E- 516 are presented. In addition one group participant was involved in a CLEO experiment, which is an ongoing extension of work on a shower detector system. At present OU has the offline CLEO analysis software running and is supporting an effort with Rutgers to completer the inclusive electron measurements in the {gamma}(4 S) resonance region. This involves proper operation of the shower detector, and development of analysis software...|$|R
