40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, a number of {{researchers}} have undertook the comparison of American and Canadian <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> Among them, Lipset (1990) and Hagan (1991) have shown that violence was more frequent south of the border than north of it. To explain why crime was more frequent in the US than in Canada, those authors argued that differences in values and culture of each country's residents was the principal determinant of this situation. Using regional and infranational disaggregated <b>crime</b> <b>rates,</b> this article shows that differences in both country's <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> are not univocal. For example, <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> in Canada are not higher than those of Northern United States for three crimes out of four studied. What makes US <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> appear much higher than the Canadian ones can be attributable to a small number of States and cities which have extraordinarily high <b>crime</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Regression and econometric {{models are}} {{commonly}} applied in modeling of violent <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> However, these models are mainly linear and only capable in modeling linear relationships. Moreover, the econometric models are quite complex to develop. Although time series {{model is a}} promising alternative tool, limited historical data of <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> makes the standard time series models less suitable for modeling the violent <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, in this study, a hybrid model that can handle limited historical data is proposed for modeling the violent <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> The proposed hybrid model combines grey relational analysis and support vector regression. Since inaccurate parameters setting leads to inaccuracy of support vector regression model, particle swarm optimization is used to increase {{the accuracy of the}} model. The proposed hybrid model is used to model the violent <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> of United State based on economic indicators. The proposed model also has additional features such as able to choose the data series for economic indicators and significant economic indicators for the violent <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> The experimental results showed that the proposed model produces more accurate forecast as compared to multiple linear regression in forecasting the violent <b>crime</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

Utilizing an 8 -year panel data sample for all 32 states in Mexico, this study assesses the impact of Mexican labor market and deterrence variables on various Mexican <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> The principal results indicate that: 1) State GDP per capita has ambiguous effect on <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> under different conditions. Both wages and unemployment rates are negatively linked with <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> 2) Although the Mexican judicial and public security systems are widely believed to be ineffective, increased federal police forces and incarceration rates are associated with lower <b>crime</b> <b>rates,</b> but higher public security expenditure per capita is associated with higher <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> 3) The impacts from labor market and deterrence variables presented in 1) and 2) continue to hold under the Fox administration as well as for non-border states. Their respective impacts diminish, however, under the Calderon administration as well as for border states due to the small number of observations. Overall, the results indicate that increasing average wages, federal police forces, and incarceration rates would have significant impacts on reducing <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> in Mexican states...|$|R

Using geocoded crime data for Glasgow for 2001 and 2008 alongside neighbourhood structural data, including tenure mix, this paper examines the influence of neighbourhood structural factors upon annual <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> as well as upon changing <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> Although <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> are patterned by local tenure structures, the direct effects are not large. The strongest associations with local <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> are for income deprivation levels and the number of alcohol outlets in an area. Although housing tenure structures play a part in influencing local <b>crime</b> <b>rates,</b> it may be more a result of sorting effects than neighbourhood effects...|$|R
