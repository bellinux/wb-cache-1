Therefore, understanding the relationship between carbon sources and sinks is the first step toward mitigating the effect of urban areas on climate change. Combined with the land use and land cover (LULC) empirical coefficients and statistical methods, urban <b>carbon</b> and <b>oxygen</b> balances in Beijing were evaluated. In this study, the <b>carbon</b> sequestration and <b>oxygen</b> emission capabilities of various LULC types were calculated, and the partitioning of <b>carbon</b> emissions and <b>oxygen</b> consumption in Beijing were estimated. The evaluation results indicated that the ecosystem services from the LULC in an area were not adequate to offset the urban <b>carbon</b> emissions and <b>oxygen</b> consumption. The areas with a high capacity for <b>carbon</b> sequestration and <b>oxygen</b> emissions were primarily distributed in the exurban districts of Beijing, and the <b>carbon</b> and <b>oxygen</b> balances in the exurban districts were superior to those of core urban areas.
