40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} possibility that cognitive engagement with fictional movies, stemming from either individual motivations for movie viewing or from moral ambiguity as a characteristic of story protagonists, may result in increased thoughtfulness about moral themes, real world issues and movie authors. After responding an online survey to determine their motivations to watch movies, 154 college-aged participants saw clips edited from feature films in which protagonists were portrayed as either unambiguously bad, or morally <b>ambiguous.</b> <b>Participants</b> then rated their enjoyment of the movie, the characters, the movie authors, and suggested topics {{they would like to}} discuss with friends after watching each clip. Participants also rated their interest in reading more information about the movie and the movie authors. Participants seeking affective gratifications from movies (hedonic) were more likely than those seeking cognitive motivations (eudaimonic) to suggest moral issues as topics of conversation when characters were <b>ambiguous.</b> <b>Participants</b> seeking cognitive gratifications from movies (eudaimonic) were significantly more likely than hedonic viewers to propose movie authors and real world issues as topics of conversation, but, contrary to expectations, they were not more likely than others to connect these issues to the self. Viewers who had a dual orientation to movies (high in both hedonic and eudaimonic motivations) were more likely than other groups to judge movie authors as technically competent, and to like unambiguously bad movies and bad characters. Different patterns of thoughtfulness and enjoyment between hedonically and eudaimonically motivated groups may indicate that they process ambiguity through different cognitive schemas. Results regarding thoughtfulness about morality and real world issues are discussed in terms of movies‟ potential to foster individual and social change. The results regarding thoughts about authors are discussed in terms of their relevance to the theoretical debate on fiction as a sophisticated form of communicative exchange between authors and audiences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Subjective group {{dynamics}} theory (Marques, Páez, & Abrams, 1998) proposes that deviant ingroup members who threaten the positive {{value of the}} group members’ social identity are evaluated negatively.

40|$|Although {{companies}} implement moral {{policies to}} prevent discrimination {{of minorities in}} selection procedures, evidence shows its persistence. Drawing on insights from the concept of moral licensing we predict that the presence (versus absence) of a moral policy may increase the expression of prejudices and concrete discriminatory hiring decisions. Moreover, we suggest that this effect {{is more likely to}} occur when the context allows for a rationalization of discrimination and as such renders the behavior ambiguous, (e. g., in the presence of information about a hostile work environment versus no information). In an experimental study with 115 participants we show that a moral policy licensed the expression of prejudice when this behavior is <b>ambiguous.</b> <b>Participants</b> in general expressed greater prejudices when their behavior was ambiguous [...] No effects on the concrete decision for a white or equally qualified black candidate were observed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of sad mood on the judgment of ambiguous facial emotion expressions among 47 healthy volunteers who had been induced to feel sad (n = 13), neutral (n = 15), or happy (n = 19) emotions by watching video clips. The findings suggest that when the targets were <b>ambiguous,</b> <b>participants</b> who were in a sad mood tended to classify them in the negative emotional categories rather than the positive emotional categories. Also, this observation indicates that emotion-specific negative bias in the judgment of facial expressions {{is associated with a}} sad mood. The finding argues against a general impairment in decoding facial expressions. Furthermore, the observed mood-congruent negative bias was best predicted by spatial perception. The findings of this study provide insights into the cognitive processes underlying the interpersonal difficulties experienced by people in a sad mood, which may be predisposing factors in the development of clinical depression. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Consumers {{may bring}} two {{implicit}} theories {{to bear on}} their interpretation of an advertisement: the theory that communications in general are intended to be informative and accurate and a domain-specific theory that ad claims are often exaggerated. The relative impact of these theories depends on both the ambiguity of the ad content and the motivation to think about its implications. Participants viewed ads describing the problem that a product purports to solve {{and the results of}} using it. When the ad's implications were <b>ambiguous,</b> <b>participants</b> interpreted the ad's literal implications {{in a way that was}} plausible but they were unmotivated to expend the additional effort required to invoke the theory that ad claims are exaggerated. Consequently, they evaluated the product favorably. When the product's literal implications were easy to construe, however, participants' implicit theory that ad claims are exaggerated had the predominant influence on their liking for the product. The relative impact of participants' implicit theories was influenced by both the cognitive load that participants experienced at the time they viewed the ad and by unobtrusively priming theory-related concepts before the ad was presented.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the use of}} advance information in the control of reach-to-grasp movements. The paradigm required participants to reach and grasp illuminated blocks with their right hand. Four target blocks were positioned on a table surface, two {{each side of the}} mid-saggital plane. In the complete precue condition, advance information precisely specified target location. In the partial precue condition, advance information indicated target location relative to the midsaggital plane (left or right). In the null condition, the advance information was entirely <b>ambiguous.</b> <b>Participants</b> produced fastest responses in the complete precue condition, intermediate response times in the partial condition, and the slowest responses in the null condition. This result was observed in adults and four groups of children including a group aged 4 – 6 years.

Movement duration was a clear function of age apart from children in the DCD group who showed equivalent movement times to those of the youngest children.

40|$|Background: The UK has {{introduced}} a national human papillomavirus (HPV) immunisation programme for girls aged 12 – 13 from autumn 2008. Previous research has explored public understanding {{of the causes of}} cervical cancer and found little awareness of the role of HPV. Objective: To explore GPs' and practice nurses' views of HPV vaccination, prior to implementation of the national immunisation programme, with a focus on their role and anticipated difficulties. Methods: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 GPs and practice nurses from practices in Hampshire and Wiltshire, in March 2008. Results: The prevailing theme of new communication challenges was identified and these were connected to the activities of (i) explaining, (ii) consenting and (iii) managing conflicts between parents and their children with respect to vaccination decisions. The importance of decisions being fully informed was emphasized and concern was expressed about the adequacy of the information provided to girls and their parents in schools. Whether consent would be granted by the parent or by the child and how potential disagreements should be managed remained <b>ambiguous.</b> <b>Participants</b> considered it appropriate to offer the vaccine without parental consent if other criteria, such as an assessment of competency, were met. Conclusions: Success of the national immunization programme will depend on overcoming the challenges of providing explanations to ensure that individuals understand the potential benefits of HPV vaccination. Primary care can play an important role, but this study suggests there are fundamental issues that need further clarification. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} scenario-based serious games, {{players can}} choose a skill level and then proceed to game play whereby {{they are exposed}} to <b>challenging,</b> <b>ambiguous</b> situations that mimic real-world reality through intelligent agents, 3 -D environments, and other computer-based stimuli. During game play, users are presented learning activities which involve complex decision-making and problem solving in order to advance to future time horizons and complete the scenario. However, some scenario-based serious games on the market today don't adapt to the player's skill level during game play. Moreover, most serious games don't offer opportunities for players to learn about their strengths and weaknesses, receive real-time in-game assessment feedback on their performance, and share diverse solutions and strategies during and after game play in order to update, adapt, and advance their understanding of the knowledge being presented to them. In this paper, we will overview several types of adaptive learning environments and present a conceptual model for integrating an intelligent adaptive learning architecture to an existing government-owned, web-based simulation gaming platform.

40|$|While strong {{activation}} of auditory cortex is generally found for exogenous orienting of attention, endogenous, intra-modal shifting of auditory attention {{has not yet}} been demonstrated to evoke transient {{activation of}} the auditory cortex. Here, we used fMRI to test if endogenous shifting of attention is also associated with transient activation of the auditory cortex. In contrast to previous studies, attention shifts were completely self-initiated and not cued by transient auditory or visual stimuli. Stimuli were two dichotic, continuous streams of tones, whose perceptual grouping was not <b>ambiguous.</b> <b>Participants</b> were instructed to continuously focus on one of the streams and switch between the two after a while, indicating the time and direction of each attentional shift by pressing one of two response buttons. The BOLD response {{around the time of the}} button presses revealed robust activation of the auditory cortex, along with activation of a distributed task network. To test if the transient auditory cortex activation was specifically related to auditory orienting, a self-paced motor task was added, where participants were instructed to ignore the auditory stimulation while they pressed the response buttons in alternation and at a similar pace. Results showed that attentional orienting produced stronger activity in auditory cortex, but auditory cortex activation was also observed for button presses without focused attention to the auditory stimulus. The response related to attention shifting was stronger contralateral to the side where attention was shifted to. Contralateral-dominant activation was also observed in dorsal parietal cortex areas, confirming previous observations for auditory attention shifting in studies that used auditory cues...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{present study}} aimed at finding any {{relation}} between alcohol craving and strategies {{of coping with}} stress and satisfaction with life in the addicted. Until now, {{studies have shown that}} generalized deficits in coping with stress, and the dominance of avoidance strategies, are significantly related to the increase of the risk of addiction and the course of this disease. This relation, which could link strategies of coping with stress and quality of life with experiencing alcohol craving, has only been explained to a small extent. Also, the role of gender in explaining these relations is <b>ambiguous.</b> <b>Participants</b> and procedure The study was conducted in a group of 550 addicted subjects in out-patient or in-patient treatment (396 men and 114 women). In the present study the following instruments were used: the Craving Typology Questionnaire by Marinotti et al., the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale by Modell et al., the Mini-Cope by Carver et al., SADD by Reistrick et al., and the Satisfaction with Life Scale by Diener et al. Statistical correlational analysis and structural equations were applied, namely partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM). Results There are two types of links between craving and strategies of coping with stress among the addicted. The first dominating type is pointing at casual link between ineffective strategies of coping with stress and craving. The other weaker type indicates the diminishing influence of effective strategies of coping with stress on alcohol craving. Life satisfaction lowers alcohol craving. Conclusions Effective strategies of reacting to stress, together with life satisfaction, protect against increase of alcohol craving. Severity of dependence is an important factor which moderates the influence of strategies of coping with stress on alcohol craving...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the <b>participant</b> entry <b>criteria</b> used by Australian-based pulmonary rehabilitation {{programs and the}} factors that influence selection. Methods This cross-sectional observational study invited all program coordinators listed on the Australian Lung Foundation's pulmonary rehabilitation database in November 2009. Results The response rate was 40. 5 % (79 / 195), with 58 % of respondents reporting a waiting list. Forty respondents reported prioritising referrals due to: disease severity (75 %), requirement for medical procedure (70 %), upon medical request (60 %) or participant's likelihood to benefit (55 %). Fifty-eight respondents reported using entry <b>criteria</b> to select <b>participants,</b> which was mainly for safety reasons and performance-based expectations. All 58 respondents used at least one exclusion criterion in selecting their participants, compared with only 25 programs using inclusion criteria. Increased demand on individual programs was related to prioritising referrals (P < 0. 001) and was reported by 12 programs as a reason for using <b>participant</b> entry <b>criteria.</b> Conclusions Program coordinators commonly prioritise referrals and use <b>participant</b> entry <b>criteria</b> to manage clinical demand with performance-based expectations an important consideration. The inclusion <b>criteria</b> that identify <b>participants</b> more likely to benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation are less commonly used in the performance-based selections. What is known about the topic? Pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential component of chronic lung disease management due to the high-quality evidence demonstrating that these programs can improve participants' exercise capacity, dyspnea and quality of life. However, access to pulmonary rehabilitation is severely limited in Australia with < 1 % of individuals with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease able to participate in these programs each year. Prior to the present study it was unknown how Australian pulmonary rehabilitation coordinators manage this demand on their programs. What does this paper add? Program coordinators commonly prioritise referrals and use <b>participant</b> entry <b>criteria</b> to select <b>participants,</b> with performance-based expectations an important consideration. Although higher demand and waiting list pressure appear to influence these performance-based considerations, programs do not report using the existing evidence identifying responders to pulmonary rehabilitation in selecting participants for program inclusion. This finding {{is a reflection of the}} inadequate evidence identifying which individuals are more likely to benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation. What are the implications for practitioners? With the current healthcare resources in Australia, pulmonary rehabilitation programs cannot meet the burden of all people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore the selection of participants considered most likely to benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation programs will continue to occur. Better criteria are needed to improve participant selection to ensure timely access to individuals that are most likely to benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation. No Full Tex...|$|R
