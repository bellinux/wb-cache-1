50|$|The camera {{will take}} a series of {{pictures}} around the patient, dividing each 'step' of the <b>camera</b> <b>head's</b> motion into the predetermined number of 'frames.' The details of this acquisition vary with single-headed, double-headed, or triple-headed cameras—but a single-headed camera typically acquires 32 'steps' over an arc of 180 degrees around the patient.|$|R
30|$|The {{use of the}} {{circular}} trajectory with a 25 cm radius could also be questioned. In the clinical context, the automatic body contour device is generally activated, and this results in non-circular trajectories with a variable distance between the axis of rotation and the <b>camera</b> <b>heads.</b> For some slim patients and some explorations, this distance would be less than 25 cm, especially when the <b>camera</b> <b>heads</b> are in imaging positions close to the anterior-posterior direction. However, for many other cases (trunk explorations and obese patients), this distance would also be longer for all head positions. The selection of the joint smallest possible radius for the four cameras {{was found to be}} an acceptable compromise. Moreover, {{the circular}} trajectory with a manually fixed radius renders our experiments very easy to repeat on other already existing (for example the SPECT-CT system from another manufacturer) or future SPECT-CT systems.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the temporal geometric constrained bundle adjustment method for exterior orientations of individual images acquired from an aerial multi-head camera system without platform calibration parameters and navigation solutions. The aerial multihead camera system provides a single synthetic image, which has large coverage, from precisely estimated exterior orientation parameters (EOP) of each image. The EOP of each image {{can be directly}} calculated from navigation solutions and platform geometric calibration parameters. However, if these values are not available for some reason, the EOP of each image can be estimated with control points. In this case, the geometric relationship between <b>camera</b> <b>heads</b> should be considered. Each camera of the multi-head camera system is tightly affixed to the platform; therefore, the geometry between <b>camera</b> <b>heads</b> {{can be considered a}} constant. The temporal geometric constraint introduced in this paper is that the relative position (X, Y, and Z) and relative orientation angles (ω, φ, and κ) between <b>cameras</b> <b>heads</b> are the same at different frames (different time instants). This condition can be used as additional observations in the bundle adjustment. Also, small movements or vibration can be considered by selecting proper weights to the constraint. The experiment results show that the temporal geometric constrained approach provides better results, in terms of accuracy as well as precision, than those of the bundle adjustment without constraints. The proposed approach can also be used for calibrating any multihead camera system. 1...|$|R
