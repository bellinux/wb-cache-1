40|$|Vestibular {{examination}} (electronystagmography with rotatory {{chair and}} caloric tests) {{was performed on}} 18 carriers and 1 phenocopy carrier in a Dutch family with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic DFNA 15. This is the second DFNA 15 family worldwide to have a novel L 289 F mutation in POU 4 F 3. Vestibular involvement appeared {{to be present in}} 2 affected individuals according to their medical history. Vestibular examination results in an extended subset of L 289 F POU 4 F 3 mutation carriers varied from normal to areflexia. DFNA 15 is the third <b>cochleovestibular</b> <b>disorder,</b> after DFNA 9 and DFNA 11, in the autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing impairment...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report on}} the {{audiometric}} characteristics of a large Dutch family linked to DFNA 15 with a novel mutation (p. L 289 F) in POU 4 F 3 (OMIM 602460). DESIGN: Clinical investigation. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Family members from a large 5 -generation pedigree with sensorineural hearing impairment segregating as an autosomal dominant trait. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of pure-tone audiometric data, and cross-sectional analyses of speech audiometry data. RESULTS: Overall, a flat to gently downsloping audiometric configuration was observed with a progression rate of approximately 0. 8 dB/y across most frequencies. Speech recognition scores remained fairly good in relation to age and hearing level compared {{with a group of}} patients with presbycusis. Interindividual variability was observed in terms of subjective onset age and audiometric configuration. Two mutation carriers, who reported vestibular symptoms, underwent vestibular examination and showed hypofunction of the vestibular labyrinth. CONCLUSIONS: The audiometric phenotype of the Dutch family linked to DFNA 15 with a novel mutation in POU 4 F 3 is comparable to that observed in the original Israeli family linked to DFNA 15. Relatively good speech recognition scores suggest outer hair cell involvement. DFNA 15 may represent a <b>cochleovestibular</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Steroids {{are widely}} used for the {{treatment}} of <b>cochleovestibular</b> <b>disorders.</b> Direct steroid application in the middle ear cavity, when combined with a round window membrane permeability-modulating substance, increases the level of the steroid reaching the target cells. We measured hearing in patients with idiopathic isolated low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss and a history of Meniere 2 ̆ 7 s disease. Contradictory reports about effectiveness of intratympanic steroid therapy on vertigo control and hearing improvement in patients with Meniere 2 ̆ 7 s disease exist in the literature...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} year {{patients}} presenting with progressive bilateral or sudden sensorineural deafness of unknown aetiology have been investigated for possible abnormal immune activity. Twenty-six cases are reported in which significantly raised circulating immune complexes were present, together with 2 cases of clinical autoimmune deafness where the complexes were normal. Thirty-six control subjects were also studied. Following {{a review of the}} clinical features, the pathogenesis of this new association with sensorineural deafness is discussed. In some cases the aetiology is probably autoimmune, and in others related to infection. In certain patients the deafness has been partly reversed by medical treatment with systemic steroids or plasma exchange. It is hypothesized that circulating immune complexes may reflect a previously unrecognized final common pathophysiological pathway in a variety of <b>cochleovestibular</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} the <b>cochleovestibular</b> <b>disorders</b> is part of otoneurology. The scope of the {{etiopathogenesis}} of these lesions is wide. The examination of an otoneurological profile using the cochleovestibular diagnostic tests and imaging techniques can distinguish an organic lesion - mostly a vestibular schwannoma - from idiopathic lesions. The treatment of idiopathic and organic lesions is vastly different. The return to the original state takes precedence {{in the treatment of}} idiopathic sensorineural hearing impairment. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy plays an important role. This, however, is not the case with a vestibular schwannoma. The removal of a tumor or its radiosurgical treatment to stop its growth is given priority. Observation of tumor growth is an independent method. Preservation of hearing in the state as before the treatment is considered a success. Revealing the etiology of hearing impairment by means of examining a patient's otoneurological profile determines totally different medical procedures and diverse outcomes of the treatments for idiopathic and organic lesions, and this is what the thesis is focusing on. The introductory chapters give an overview of the current knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the vestibular apparatus in relation to an otoneurological profile. This is [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{reports have}} focused on a {{possible}} association between migraine and Menière’s disease; patients suffering from Menière’s disease present {{a higher rate of}} migraine. In some cases, the clinical features of migraine-associated vertigo may mimic the presentation of Menière’s disease. The present report focuses on two cases of females with recurrent episodes of rotational vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus lasting from a few minutes to several hours; both cases also presented migrainous attacks. As a result of repeated cochleovestibular attacks, both patients presented a permanent low frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Preventive therapies for Menière’s disease did not reduce vertigo attacks, while topiramate and acetylsalicylic acid treatment resulted in a significant reduction of both migraine and vertigo. Both the diagnosis of Menière’s disease and of migraine-associated vertigo rely on clinical history and both disorders lack a specific diagnostic test. In the early stages, differential diagnosis between Menière’s disease and migraine-associated vertigo is often very difficult; previous investigations focused on the possibility that subjects with migraine may experience all symptoms of Menière’s disease, including sensorineural fluctuating hearing loss. In conclusion, a trial with prophylactic drug treatment for migraine might be suggested in patients with clear symptoms of migraine and recurrent <b>cochleovestibular</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

ObjectiveTo evaluate {{the influence of the}} disturbance of {{carbohydrate metabolism}} in the recurrence of idiopathic BPPV. MethodsA longitudinal prospective study of a cohort, with 41 months follow-up. We analyzed the results of 72 glucose–insulin curves in patients with recurrence of BPPV. The curves were classified into intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and normal. ResultsThe RR for hyperinsulinism was 4. 66 and p= 0. 0015. Existing hyperglycemia showed an RR= 2. 47, with p= 0. 0123. Glucose intolerance had a RR of 0. 63, with p= 0. 096. When the examination was within normal limits, the result was RR= 0. 2225 and p= 0. 030. DiscussionMetabolic changes can cause dizziness and vertigo and are very common in people who have <b>cochleovestibular</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, few studies discuss the relationship between idiopathic BPPV and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism. In the present study, we found that both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are risk factors for the recurrence of BPPV, whereas a normal test was considered a protective factor; all these were statistically significant.

40|$|Rationale: Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{dysfunction}} and occlusion abnormalities {{can cause}} cochlear and vestibular disorders. This issue {{is at the}} crossroads of several disciplines: otoneurology, physiotherapy, dentistry, medical rehabilitation and posturology, which often makes it difficult to timely diagnose them and delays the onset of treatment. Aim: To assess the role of abnormal dental occlusion and TMJ disorders in the pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of cochleovestibular syndrome. Materials and methods: We examined 300 subjects with clinical signs of cochleovestibular syndrome, asymmetry of occlusion and/or TMJ dysfunction (the main group), 55 patients with signs of TMJ structural and functional disorders and occlusal <b>disorders</b> without a <b>cochleovestibular</b> syndrome (the reference group), and 35 healthy volunteers (the control group). All patients were examined by a neurologist, an ENT specialist, a dentist and a physiotherapist. A series of additional investigations of the brachiocephalic vessels, cervical spine, TMJ, auditory and vestibular function, premature tooth contacts were performed. Results: The main group patients had high values of TMJ dysfunction in the Hamburg test (5. 85 vs 2. 2 in the reference group) and higher proportions of patients with moderate and severe TMJ dysfunction (n = 243, 81 % and n = 13, 23. 7 %, respectively). The functional muscle test parameters and the results of manual muscle testing in the main group patients were significantly different from those in the control group (р 0. 05). Patients with cochleoves-tibular syndrome had 2 to 3 -fold higher rates of vertebrogenic dysfunctions than those from the reference group. The video nystamography technique detected the positional cervical nystagmus in 100 % (n = 300) of patients from the main group, whereas there were no nystagmus in those from the reference group. Voluntary dental occlusion in the main group patients was associated with a deterioration of postural tests in 61. 8 % (n = 185) of patients; in the reference group patients these parameters deteriorated in 38. 2 % (n = 21) of cases. According to T-SCAN assessment, 300 (100 %) patients from the main group had in imbalance of total distribution of the occlusion force (р < 0. 05 compared to the control group). The biggest number of patients from the main group (73. 7 %, n = 221) had an imbalance of occlusion force within 20 to 40 %, and in most patients from the reference group this parameter was in the range of 10 to 30 % (85. 5 %, n = 47), with 14. 5 % (n = 8) of this group having a normal balance of the occlusion force. Cerebrovascular reactivity parameters measured by ultrasound Doppler technique demonstrated a moderately significant (р < 0. 05) strain of the cerebral hemodynamic reserve in the posterior arterial system in patients with cochleovestibular syndrome. Conclusion: <b>Cochleovestibular</b> <b>disorders</b> can be caused by a dysfunction of the dentoman-dibular system and/or cervical / masticatory myofascial syndrome. After exclusion of any otogenic pathology in patients with cochleovestibular syndrome, their neurological examination should include a visual assessment of the occlusion and mandibular movements, as well as testing of the cervical and masticatory muscles. If any abnormalities of occlusion and/or TMJ and local muscle dysfunction are revealed, then a dentist and a physiotherapist consultation should be performed. </p...|$|R
