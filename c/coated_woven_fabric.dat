The surface {{morphology}} of woven fabrics {{was characterized by}} SEM technique and shows uniform distribution of nanoparticles throughout the fabric surface. The coated woven fabrics were further characterized by EDS and FT-IR technique; confirming the presence of copper nanoparticles on/in <b>coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> samples. The structure of the prepared composite woven fabrics was analyzed by X-ray diffraction technique, which indicates that the d-spacing value of polyester polymeric structure was higher than the highly amorphous structure of cotton and p–c blended fabrics. In case of dyeing the improvement could not exceed that obtained using bulk conventional mordanting agent but introduction of nano copper in the system enhanced the wash fastness of dyed fabric samples. Dyeing of the nano copper loaded woven fabrics with natural dye (Myrobolan) also proved to be beneficial.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} tension loaded {{structures}} made of <b>coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> cables and rigid frames such as mats and hoops. It describes in details a general framework for modelling and numerical simulation of their mechanical behavior. Several methods, developped {{in these last}} decades, are presented and compared. The principal particularity of these structures is that they derive their stiffness and their stability from the surface geometry and tensile stress field coupling. This particularity is combined with nonlinearities which can be due to possible large deflections, material law behavior and local instabilities due to wrinkling effects. In addition, {{a great number of}} design parameters {{must be taken into account}} in order to optimize the mechanical behavior of the structure. Therefore, the design and the analysis of such structure are complex and involve extensive computational costs. The principal steps of the analysis process are: form-finding, structural response of the structure to loads, cutting pattern and optimization. In this work, after a short description of the methods developed in this field as well as a critical comparison, new approaches are proposed. ...|$|E
40|$|The tensile {{performance}} of <b>coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> under multiaxial loads is {{examined in the}} present study. Two groups of experiments were conducted to investigate the influences of {{the configuration of the}} fabric specimen and the loading speed on the multiaxial tensile properties of the fabrics. The configuration of the specimen for the multiaxial tensile tests is identified as gear-shape with large arm widths. A loading speed of lower than 20 mm/min is suggested to obtain the tensile properties of the <b>coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> under multiaxial loads. The tensile performances of <b>coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> under uni-, bi-, and multiaxial loads were compared. We found that the tensile performances under bi- and multiaxial loads are much better than those under uniaxial loads. Therefore, for the application of the <b>coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> in lightweight structures, biaxial or multiaxial loading conditions will be necessary. Experiments on the specimens with an initial crack in the center under multiaxial loads show that, by comparison with other loading directions, the tensile properties in warp direction of the <b>coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{play an important role in}} the failure performance and crack propagation under multiaxial loads. To eliminate the dependence on the mechanical properties in warp direction, the balance of the two principle directions of <b>coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> should be improved.

A through thickness approximate homogeneous modulus from the weft and warp uniaxial tests results of the membrane for a simple linear elastic anisotropic material model was used in ABAQUS finite element software to simulate the bulge test experiments.

40|$|<b>Coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{are used}} in {{state-of-the-art}} structures and yet broad assumptions are made in both material testing and behaviour. Current design practice makes little reference to the complex non-linear behaviour of architectural fabrics. A better understanding of fabric response should enable reduction of safety factors, use of more economic materials and allow more architectural freedom in the forms that can be achieved. With limited availability of test equipment and no European standards on biaxial testing, a biaxial test rig has been designed and built for this work and a new test protocol has been developed. Application of prestress followed by cyclic loading conditions the fabric and enables medium to long term properties to be measured which are appropriate for structural design. Thorough sampling of all feasible design stress states fully quantifies the fabric response. Testing {{has been carried out}} {{on a wide range of}} PVC coated polyester and PTFE coated glass-fibre fabrics. Fabric test data is commonly manipulated to fit within a plane stress framework. It is shown in this work that plane stress theory is inappropriate for representing the complex deformation mechanisms of <b>coated</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> It is proposed that the test data is used directly in finite element structural analysis by interpolation between values in a database of test results, with no limiting plane stress assumptions. 'Feasible strain plots' provide a new tool for quantifying fabric behaviour. A predictive fabric model based on force equilibrium in the fabric 'unit cell' has been developed. The model aims to be easily accessible to the design engineer, with all parameters derived from standard tests. Whilst avoiding unnecessary complexity, the model realistically models key fabric deformation mechanisms. The model provides a more accurate representation of fabric behaviour than current industry best practice (i. e. use of elastic constants based on biaxial test data), but without the need for specialist testing.

The SEM analysis was done on the SEM instrument named JSM 5610  L manufactured by JEOL Electronics, Japan at the resolution of 3  nm. To avoid the charge effect, the samples were coated with gold layer.

30|$|From the results, it may {{be summed}} up that this {{technique}} for the <b>coating</b> of <b>woven</b> polyester <b>fabric</b> using TiO 2 nanoparticles be effectively utilized. This technique of nanocoating is relatively cheaper than others as {{it does not require}} the costly precursors of TiO 2. The uniform dispersion of TiO 2 nanoparticles was obtained by immersing the fabric into the silica sol containing suspended TiO 2 nanoparticles. The simplicity of this method may lead to the concept of commercialization of this technique. The nanocoated fabric was found to be active for photocatalytic degradation of methanol in the air under UV light at the room temperature. The degradation rate of the formaldehyde mainly depends on the number of active sites available for the reaction.

The enhancement of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> in HAH sandwich panel further strengthens the sandwich panel especially in ballistic tests. Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed extensive pull out (rupture of yarns) when less than 6 layers of fabric impacted by ballistic projectile at a velocity of 293 m/s. Sandwich panel consisting of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> incorporated with aluminium honeycomb showed no pull out when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 312. 5 m/s.

A laminate configuration with optimum shifts gives higher elastic properties compared to the other configurations. A comparison between in-plane elastic moduli of the unidirectionally laminated symmetric cross-ply laminates and plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates is made. The in-plane elastic moduli of plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates predicted by the models are found to he in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

In this work, existing models for predicting the bending rigidity of <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> are applied to bending hysteresis in various directions. A wide range of cotton plain <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> is examined by comparing theoretical data with experimental results. The results show that Cooper's model is the most reliable in predicting polar diagrams of bending hysteresis in cotton plain <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The results also indicate that the shape of polar diagrams of bending hysteresis along the weft direction spreads outward with an increase in the ratio V introduced by Cooper.
