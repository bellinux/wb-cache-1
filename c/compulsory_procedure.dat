40|$|UNCLOS (UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} constitutive instruments in international law. It represents the creation and codification of a substantial body of law that impacts on a variety of economic, political, military, and social interests of States, international organizations, companies, and individuals. Every State, landlocked or coastal, relies on the oceans as a supply of resources as well as for communication and security, and can thus benefit from the way that this global resource is regulated. The rights and obligations embodied in UNCLOS affect the decisions and relationships of all States. While the Convention is firmly grounded in traditional principles of the law of the sea, it also marks important developments in ocean use (the clearest examples being the institution of the EEZ, the creation of the transit passage regime, and a special international regime for the exploration and exploitation of the deep seabed). This book has focused on one particularly unusual feature in UNCLOS: the inclusion of a compulsory dispute settlement system as an integral feature of the Convention. When States become parties to the Convention, as over 140 States are, they also take the unique step of agreeing to mandatory jurisdiction for certain disputes relating to the interpretation and application of this instrument.

40|$|The quantum key {{distribution}} (QKD) technology is achieving a growing interest in both the scientific and industrial communities.

The Supply Chain is distributed collaborative environments involves the acquisition and use of extensive informational and physical flows. The flows management seems a complex task for the actors of the multimodal transport chain which the transport is the major driver in a Supply Chain. The literature reviews throws light on the traceability in the Supply Chain Management (SCM) shows the lack of interoperability and flexibility in data management systems hinders the work of traceability. And it introduces the importance and complexity of multimodal transport operations. To ensure effective traceability all along this chain, we relied on the agent paradigm and the ontology which facilitate the integration of goods data in order to exploit and reuse. Indeed, to ensure communication and interoperability of these data we relied on Multi-Agent Systems, due to their characteristics of autonomy, sociability and responsiveness that are generally associated. The Multi-Agent Systems can build flexible systems whose behaviors are complex and complicated due to the combination of different types of agents. With a focus on the importance of the concept of the traceability, the objective of this work is to propose an intelligent system for the traceability of containerized goods in the context of multimodal transport: Intelligent Traceability System of Containerized Goods (i-TSCG) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a dynamic model of Tiebout-like migration between communities that utilize distinct allocation procedures for public goods. At {{issue is whether}} voluntary or <b>compulsory</b> <b>procedures</b> {{are more likely to}} prevail over time. We model infinitely lived individuals who make repeated, sequential location decisions over one of two communities. Each community uses a distinct mechanism for allocating public goods. The first is one in which contributions are given voluntarily by the citizenry of the community. The second is a compulsory scheme by which individuals are taxed proportionately to wealth with the tax determined by a majority vote. Opportunities to accumulate wealth exist via accumulation of public capital. The Markov Perfect equilibria of the dynamic game are studied. Our main result shows that when accumulated wealth converges to a steady state, individuals' locational choices eventually "select" the involuntary provision mechanism. This holds despite the fact that unanimous location in the voluntary provision community may in many cases remain as a Nash equilibrium of the static game each period. We also describe conditions under which voluntary provision survives. These conditions require that accumulation of capital fails to decrease wealth dispersion over time. The results are shown to be consistent with findings relating inequality to school choice. Copyright 1999 by The Review of Economic Studies Limited. ...|$|R

I argue that this needs to be addressed before the state can justify the parameters of the information recorded. I then use an outline of historical reforms relating to the registration of births outside of marriage to highlight the normative two-parent family model that underpins the birth registration system. I argue that legal reform must be cognizant of the tenacity of this normative family model, particularly in relation to reform proposals surrounding donor conception and the annotation of birth certificates.

The purpose of ByggaF is to highlight moisture issues {{at an early stage}} in the building process by introducing documents, activities and actions. Today ByggaF is structured in a way suitable for new building. Adjustments of ByggaF are needed to improve the current use and to suit the process of renovation. This report provides suggestions to improve the ByggaF-documents, which are based on current acts and regulations, research reports from the field and interviews with moisture experts and representatives of property developers. The results from the interviews conclude that the average knowledge in moisture safety is low in the construction industry, and there are problems to introduce ByggaF to other participants. For adapting ByggaF to the renovation process, a visual moisture inventory is suggested to be included as a <b>compulsory</b> <b>procedure</b> in the program stage. This provides information about the existing building for all involved. Visual moisture inventory checklists are created and recommended to use. Another main finding is the issue with using the ByggaF document Moisture safety planning with risk evaluation in the design process. Moisture safety officers for planning need clearer competence requirement. Designers need better guidance in moisture safety design to fully use the document, especially to perform the risk evaluation. Earlier risk assessments from research, expert system and software products are suggestions to simplify the designer’s work. A change of the numeric risk evaluation is also a suggested solution. This document has also been updated to reduce conflicts with other industry regulations and to have better consistency and to better suit the process of renovation. All suggestions requires both to be tested and further developed. Finally, the suggestions are implemented in the main document Industry standard ByggaF...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{prevention}} of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programme has been operational in Uganda since the year 2000, but its performance remains sub-optimal. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to increase {{understanding of the role}} of the social context in the delivery and utilization of PMTCT services, focusing on how pregnant women experience routine HIV counselling and testing as part of antenatal care, HIV status disclosure to partners and lessons leant by health care providers, to inform strategies for improving the effectiveness of the programme. Methods: This was a qualitative study conducted in 2010 in Eastern Uganda. We conducted 1) indepth interviews with 30 pregnant women (15 HIV positive and 15 HIV negative) attending the antenatal clinic at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, 2) key informant interviews with 6 health workers involved in providing antenatal care and HIV counselling and testing at the same hospital; and 3) 24 individual interviews with health workers involved in the PMTCT programmes at 10 health care facilities and 4 key informant interviews with district officials and The AIDS Support Organisation Mbale (TASO). We did observations at the antenatal clinics at 2 TASO clinics and at Mbale Hospital. The content thematic approach was used for data analysis. Results: Most women knew that the hospital provided HIV counselling and testing services as part of antenatal care (ANC) prior to attending the current ANC visit. Most women perceived HIV testing within the ANC as a <b>compulsory</b> <b>procedure,</b> a belief that was re-enforced by health workers’ downplay of the opt-out option during health education and counselling sessions. In general, most women viewed routine HIV testing as beneficial by enabling those who test HIV positive to access PMTCT services and HIV treatment. Most women who tested HIV positive were satisfied with the immediate counselling they received. However, they identified the need for follow-up and supportive counselling to cope with the fears and the stigma of living with HIV. Some HIV negative women mentioned that the post-test counselling they received was inadequate. All HIV negative women reported that they had disclosed their HIV status to their sexual partners but expressed need for support to convince their partners to undergo HIV testing. Women reported that their partners often assumed that they were equally HIV negative (testing by proxy). Most of the HIV positive women had not disclosed their HIV status to their sexual partners for fear of abandonment, violence and accusation of bringing HIV infection into the family. However, the few positive women who disclosed their status generally experienced positive responses from their sexual partners. The key lessons for programme improvement were: ensuring constant availability of critical PMTCT supplies, regular in-service training of health workers to keep them abreast with the rapidly changing knowledge and guidelines for PMTCT, ensuring that lower level health centres provide maternity services and ARVs for women in the PMTCT programme and that they had adequate facilities for effective follow-up and support for mothers. </p...|$|E

From the factors of this complex structure–education policy, corresponding ministry and services, higher education institutions, schools, and others–we have decided to choose the future teachers as a key link in educational process. Given the fact that education is an open process that continuously strives for modernization, we were interested in correlating the acquired knowledge and its application in class teaching. The initiative came from the previous data about the status of the subject music education in which is evident its low positioning in the entire educational system. The targets were the students (N 115) of the Pedagogical faculty in Skopje in the last phase of studies who had passed the methodologies of all subjects, as well as the pedagogical probationary period implemented compulsorily in the primary school. The results showed that teaching and study programs (textbooks, music equipment, etc.) directly influenced the shaping and organizing the class teaching. Also, the subjective treatment of the music education among the respondents proved to be decisive in practical application. However, research results have opened a general dilemma about the need to implement the <b>compulsory</b> <b>procedures</b> for auditing the overall acquired knowledge during the studies at the employment in educational institutions.

40|$|L'auteur décrit d'abord une série d'équivoques « secondaires » du régime légal de règlement des conflits d'intérêts dans la {{province}} de Québec hors les services publics. Il rattache ces ambiguïtés actuelles ou virtuelles à une équivoque « fondamentale », qui est l'écartèlement entre la liberté qui doit servir de base à une société démocratique et la peur qui suscite les lois restrictives. Pour éliminer la crainte et pour redonner à la démocratie industrielle toute sa vitalité, l'auteur s'efforce de situer le conflit social (surtout industriel) dans sa véritable perspective, en décrivant sa diversité et ses conséquences utiles fort nombreuses. We {{shall be}} dealing {{here with the}} legal arrangements for the prevention or the settlement of union-management disputes over matters of interests, thus excluding conflicts over rights. The Quebec conciliation system shall {{be used as a}} case in point, since it is typical of most labour legislations in Canada and other "free entreprise" countries. Conflicts in public utilities shall not be dealt with, nor shall we analyse the whole picture of union-management relations, since our study is strictly juridical and theoretical in nature. Our aim is to improve labour legislation in the area of disputes settlement by pointing to a number of ambiguities and confusions in the law which should be corrected. Any body of social legislation which is not constantly improved {{on the basis of its}} obvious consequences is a dead body and a dangerous nuisance. It should be noted, however, that the most technically correct piece of legislation will yield poor results in a hypothetical climate of political tensions, antagonisms and distrust, while a less perfect body of laws will foster peace and harmony where there exist freedom, confidence and co-operation. SOME SECONDARY CONFUSIONS 1. "Arbitration". Our "councils of arbitration" arbitrate nothing, inasmuch as the final award is solely a set of recommendations which have no binding power (and more often than not very little moral authority) on the parties. They constitute only the second step of the conciliation procedure. 2. It might be very useful for our legislation to distinguish clearly between "conflicts of interests" and "conflicts over rights", in order to determine the proper jurisdictions (conciliator or arbitrator) and effects (binding or not) of the award, if any. Although most collective labour agreements do draw the line by stipulating compulsory arbitration of grievances, some ambiguities still remain. The main one is the tendency to assimilate "grievances" with "conflicts over rights", and to limit conflicts of interests to the pre-contract phase, while it should be obvious that many disputes arising while an agreement is in force cannot be dealt with on the basis of clear predetermined rights. Since the agreement cannot foresee and provide for every situation, conflicts of interests are bound to arise after it has been signed, and deserve the same careful discussion and honest consideration as conflicts arising at the negotiation phase prior to the signature of the agreement. 3. The meaning and scope of the word "dispute" must be looked for, not in the Quebec Trades Disputes Act, but in the Labour Relations Act. And care must be taken not to unduly restrict the field of so-called "conditions of employment" nor to limit the scope of the agreements which the parties are allowed to reach, with a view to reducing the possibilities of conflict. 4. "Equity and good conscience" are resorted to only when the law is silent or ambiguous. They are mere natural justice and common sense. And since objective economic criteria are lacking, on the whole, for the "council of arbitration" to make a scientifically-based award, it should be kept in mind that "equity and good conscience" will permit only an approximation of justice. 5. Being the first step in a <b>compulsory</b> <b>procedure,</b> the conciliation officer does not have an easy job, especially when the parties are powerhouses in strategic bargaining centers and are expected to create patterns which will be followed by an industry or a region. True, he intervenes only when direct negotiations break, and at the request of one of the parties; but as an essential part of a rigid procedure, he is often seen as a hurdle to be cleared as quickly as possible, rather than as a competent friend eager and able to help. He can be imposed by either party upon the other whenever negotiations (whether seriously carried out or not) run into a deadlock. It is this very imposition that irritates some of the parties and leads them to retaliate by treating the conciliator lightly, particularly so in the hypothesis of a tense political environment. The conciliation officer will usually be more welcome in sectors where collective bargaining is new or relatively weak, or where one party is much weaker than the other. In all cases, however, the conciliator may be relatively useful he realizes that he is above all the servant of the parties themselves, and never the distributor of rules of conduct and "solutions" to the parties. 6. The president of the "council of arbitration" will do a helpful job (again despite the compulsory character of the procedure) in some cases if he understands clearly that his first duty is to serve the parties, and not the minister of Labour who appoints him. He is primarily a man of conciliation, not a man of awards. He will realize this more easily if he ponders over the scarcity of sound and safe economic criteria by which he can reach not too haphazard decisions in a most complex field, economic activity. For conflicts of interests are born out of the antagonism of two freedoms which, left undefined by law, may pretend to total discretion. Such being the case, the president will never attempt to pass judgment as a magistrate would do in a court of law, but will on the contrary always be looking for the very mobile point of mutual acceptability at which the parties may agree. 7. The representatives of the parties on the "council of arbitration" are exactly that; they should not be expected to be impartial, since their appointment is suggested by the respective parties and since they are in most cases remunerated by them. They may be assimilated to assessors trying to enlighten the president on the merits of a given viewpoint (their own) and to get the best possible deal for their party. To see them as "arbitrators" would be extremely misleading. 8. The award of the "council of arbitration" is usually at best a good guess, having little claim to scientific accuracy. It is a set of recommendations, and not a judgment, since in the first place it is not binding for the parties which constitute our object of study here. Therefore, it deserves little publicity, and should never be intended to be used as precedent. It is strictly the property of the parties themselves, and should not, as a rule, be used as an instrument of public control. If made public prematurely, it may have most injurious effects on subsequent, post-arbitral negotiations, on the precarious equilibrium of the parties, on the relative flexibility of their positions, by creating false hopes on not too certain grounds and by possibly displacing artificially and arbitrarily the point of mutual acceptability and thus delaying the settlement of the dispute. THE MAIN CONFUSIONAll the above confusions may be traced to one fundamental ambiguity, one big opposition between two prime movers: liberty, on the one side, and fear, on the other. In a democratic society, the freedoms of association, professional activity, expression, enterprise and contract, among others, are held as sacred and seen as the very foundations of democracy itself. And yet, in the face of oppositions of interests (just another definition for conflicts), we are tempted to quickly throw overboard all principles, allowing ourselves instead to be governed by sheer physical fear of potential outbursts of violence. Without realizing that aggressive forms of conflict are the exception in Canada and in Quebec particularly, and possibly led by fear-mongers with an axe to grind, we are inclined to favour restrictive measures (in legislation and administration) destined to prevent conflict at all costs. Needless to say, conciliation legislation based on freedom will be diametrically opposed to another based on fear. In the first instance, the parties will be allowed to bargain on all matters which do not go against public order and safety; the preventive procedure will be optional and will provide alternatives; if for a while the procedure remains compulsory, its steps will be as few and as short as possible; and the conciliation services provided by the government will be aimed not only at prevention, but mainly at education of the parties in the intricacies of collective bargaining. In the perspective of fear, conciliation legislation shall be exactly the opposite. To prevent open conflict, the law will provide a number of time-consuming steps, with the hope that the parties will gradually "cool off". Unfortunately, the "cooling-off period" more often than not turns into a "warming-up period", and the procedure defeats its avowed purpose by creating or at least magnifying the object of its fear. The parties, frustrated and irritated by long delays, and compelled to stimulate their respective militancy during the protracted debates under "public scrutiny", are often led to uncompromising stands where flexibility could have been possible otherwise, thus multiplying the possibilities of aggressive conflict. THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF CONFLICTThe fear just described has its main root in a false notion of the meaning, variety and functions of conflict, social and particularly industrial. Conflict is essentially an opposition, manifested in a good number of ways, "diplomatic", "aggressive" and possibly violent. "Conflict and co-operation are not separable things, but phases of one process which always involves something of both". "Social conflict [...] . mean[s] a struggle over values and claims to scarce Status, power and resources in which the aims of the opponents are to neutralize, injure or eliminate their rivals". Furthermore, conflict is everywhere, and seems only partly avoidable: we have it in primary groups (family, groups of friends, neighborhood), within and between cities, associations and countries; once institutionalized, however, conflict becomes an essential element of the social structure. Industrial conflict, for instance, can be expressed in a number of ways, such as: systematic restriction of output, sabotage, excessive turnover, absenteeism or lateness, boycott, grievances, accident-proneness, waste, pilfering, unduly strict abidance by the letter of the agreement or deliberate dents into its provisions, and more aggressive and concerted forms like the strike. We exclude the lockout, which has ceased to be a tactically useful and socially acceptable mode of industrial warfare. Social conflict, despite the harm which may accompany it in some instances, has many positive functions. It is an essential element of sociation, together with co-operation. It is responsible for most of the dynamism of a social structure. It helps a group or a society rid itself of violently disagreeable features which weaken it. It provides a safety-valve for the reduction of conflict of a more violent and persistent nature; by bringing oppositions into the open, it permits their quick solution under the eye of public opinion. It increases the cohesiveness and individuality of the contestant groups. It provokes associations and coalitions which are so many forms of sociation; in a perspective of synthesis, of global social relationship, opposition (even violent) between individuals, groups or societies may be signally positive in its consequences. Now with regard to industrial conflict, the strike, for instance, does perform a useful function. It is, either as a fact or as a possibility, part and parcel of the collective bargaining process. "In the last fifteen minutes of big controversies, it is the right to strike, the possibility of a strike, that is the instrument with which the controversy is settled. It is always present at the conference table. Without it, you do not have collective bargaining". Moreover, the strike helps reduce social tensions by airing grievances, suggesting improvements and establishing a new "order" on more acceptable grounds. And finally, the strike is a symbol of freedom and independence. The fact that it occurs or can happen is a clear indication of the vitality of a society and of the liberty therein. CONCLUSIONThe above notions may suggest a new outlook on social and industrial conflict which would eliminate fear, restore freedom in practice and provide us with a more rational labour legislation in the specific field of disputes settlement...|$|E

It is suggested that three key elements for improving the quality of agricultural studies in Croatia are (i) improving the confidence of the students in conjunction with (ii) a more rigorous, <b>compulsory</b> examination <b>procedure</b> and (iii) a supportive tutorial system...|$|R

40|$|Until {{the ending}} of Communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the {{objective}} of compulsory purchase was the achievement of a socialist society in which the ownership {{of the means of}} production, including land, was to be collective rather than private. Compulsory purchase legislation and laws on ownership were used to expropriate private property. After 1990 the newly elected democratic governments changed the constitutions to permit and protect private ownership of land. However, compulsory purchase is essential in a market economy to deal with certain aspects of market failure. These include the need to facilitate the provision of collective goods, such as infrastructure and utility networks, and regeneration where the state may need to disrupt a prisoners’ dilemma situation. In spite of their commitment to the inviolability of private property, the transitional economies have had to develop <b>compulsory</b> purchase <b>procedures</b> and means of assessing compensation...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the question of}} access to patented medicines in international law. It analyzes {{the extent to which}} international agreements may lawfully limit affordable versions of these medicines that may be available through parallel imports or <b>compulsory</b> licensing <b>procedures.</b> It considers the concept of intellectual property rights from a national and international perspective to determine how these rights must be sensitive to matters of national sovereignty when extraordinary, life-threatening diseases afflict societies in catastrophic ways. This Article suggests that viewing property (including intellectual property) as a human right requires that its scope be delimited and understood in the context of other human rights. In short, property and human rights should be understood as complementary, rather than antagonistic ideas. This Article also reviews the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in light of the contemporary standards of construction and interpretation applicable to agreements of international human rights law...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{compulsory purchase}} as an administrative procedure. In many countries {{the procedure is}} handled in courts {{and it is very}} complicated and time consuming. The present system in Finland based on legislation from 1977 is an administrative procedure lead by cadastral surveyors. There are already a lot of experiences in Finland, so we are able to present the system and analyse its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, there are similar types of procedures for almost the same purposes, which make the analysis even broader. The main objective of the paper is to examine the possibility to make the <b>procedure</b> of <b>compulsory</b> purchase more efficient. It is based on studies done in the Institute of Real Estate Studies and the Institute of Law, Department of Surveying at the Helsinki University of Technology during the past few years. It is hoped that the paper may {{contribute to the development of}} <b>compulsory</b> purchase <b>procedures</b> in the future also in other countries...|$|R
40|$|In Slovenia, many {{companies}} {{try to avoid}} bankruptcy {{with the introduction of}} a <b>compulsory</b> settlement <b>procedure,</b> but only a handful of companies successfully complete the compulsory settlement {{in the sense of a}} final repayment of creditors in accordance with the adopted financial restructuring plan. The article identified the factors affecting the confirmation of a compulsory settlement as well as the factors affecting the final repayment of creditors and, thus, permanently eliminated the causes of insolvency. The factors were divided into internal and external, whereby the impact of factors on a successfully completed compulsory settlement was verified using quantitative and qualitative research methods. V Sloveniji se veliko podjetij poskuša izogniti stečaju z uvedbo postopka prisilne poravnave, vendar le peščica od njih prisilno poravnavo uspešno zaključi v smislu dokončnega poplačila upnikov s skladu s sprejetim načrtom finančnega prestrukturiranja. V članku smo opredelili tiste dejavnike, ki vplivajo na potrditev prisilne poravnave, in tudi tiste, ki vplivajo na dokončno poplačilo upnikov in s tem trajno odpravo vzrokov insolventnosti. Dejavnike smo razdelili na notranje in zunanje, njihov vpliv na uspešno dokončano prisilno poravnavo pa preverili s kvantitativnimi in kvalitativnimi metodami raziskovanja...|$|R
2500|$|In December 2014, {{following}} {{allegations of}} rape against an Uber driver in New Delhi, India, Uber was banned from New Delhi for not following the city's <b>compulsory</b> police verification <b>procedure.</b> The driver had been charged, then acquitted, of a prior sexual assault in 2011. Within {{two days of}} the rape incident, almost 7,000 people signed a petition calling on Uber to conduct mandatory seven-year background checks on drivers, in line with its U.S. operations.

Uber issued a statement stating that it would work with the Indian government [...] "to establish clear background checks currently absent in their commercial transportation licensing programs." ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mental health advance {{directives}} (ADs) are potentially useful for bipolar patients {{due to the}} episodic characteristic of their disease. The aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the impact of {{advance directives}} based on cognitive therapy (ADBCT) on the number and duration of hospitalizations as well as compulsory admissions and seclusion procedures. METHOD: Charts of all treatment non-adherent patients and committed patients who wrote their ADs following an ADBCT intervention within a 24 months period prior {{to the beginning of the}} study were included. Number and duration of psychiatric hospitalizations for a mood or a psychotic episode as well as compulsory admissions and seclusion procedures were recorded for each patient 2 years before ADBCT and during a follow-up period of at least 24 months. RESULTS: The number of hospitalizations, the number of <b>compulsory</b> admission <b>procedures</b> and the number of days spent in psychiatric hospital reduced significantly after ADCBT in comparison to the 2 years who preceded this intervention. CONCLUSION: This retrospective data suggest that ADBCT is effective for patients with compliance and coercion problems. However, these results need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: ADBCT seems to be a useful approach for treatment-non-adherent and previously coerced patients...|$|R
