40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} general {{equilibrium}} model with heterogeneous agents to assess the macroeconomic and welfare consequences in the United States of alternative fiscal policies over the medium-term. We find that failing to address the fiscal imbalances associated with current federal fiscal policies for a prolonged period {{would result in a}} significant <b>crowding-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>investment</b> and a severe drag on growth. Compared to adopting a reform that gradually reduces federal debt to its pre-crisis level, postponing debt stabilization for two decades would entail a permanent output loss of about 17 percent and a welfare loss of almost 7 percent of lifetime consumption. Moreover, the long-run welfare gains from the adjustment would more than compensate the initial losses associated with the consolidation period.

30|$|Using the Scrabble-based word {{creation}} task {{introduced by}} Crosetto (2010), Brüggemann and Meub (2015) analyze the individual behavior in {{two types of}} innovation contests by awarding subjects with a bonus for the best innovation in one treatment and for the largest innovation effort in another, comparing individual performance to a benchmark treatment without a prize. They find that the willingness to cooperate decreases when innovation contests are introduced, while the overall welfare remains constant across treatments. Furthermore, using the same word task, Brüggemann (2015) analyzes the effects of two distinct forms of subsidies on innovativeness: first, by supplying resources determined for innovative activities and, second, by providing additional financial resources not restricted to the use in innovative activities. She finds that both forms of subsidy lead to a <b>crowding-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>investment</b> and negative welfare effects when the costs for the subsidy are included. Furthermore, subsidies fail to induce {{a positive effect on}} the individual innovation behavior.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} public {{subsidies}} in supporting innovative activity {{is subject to}} long-standing debates. Since empirical findings remain largely inconclusive, this study adds to this debate with counterfactual evidence from a laboratory experiment. In a creative real effort task simulating the innovation process, two distinct means of allocating subsidies are compared to a benchmark treatment without subsidies to identify their effects in fostering innovativeness. Furthermore, subjects' cooperative behavior in relation to subsidies is investigated. Overall, subsidies lead to a substantial <b>crowding-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>investment.</b> While the individual revenues increase due to the subsidy, the innovative activity fails to increase and less sophisticated innovations are realized. Consequently, subsidies have no or negative effects on overall welfare, depending on the subsidy specifics. However, subsidies do not influence cooperative behavior. These findings imply that the additional costs of subsidies for innovations might not be warranted by gains from additional innovations and increased welfare. Revised Version February 201...|$|E

The actual ‘suspension’ from the ’no bail-out’ restriction (Art. 125 TFEU) and the prohibition of funding national debts (Art. 123 TFEU) transfers risks and financial burdens from deeply indebted states to solvent EU member states. As a result an unauthorized „transfer union" emerges, whose Central Bank lost its independence to a political leadership and cannot focus on its objective of price stability as contracted any longer. Even without the use of financial and guarantee aids the German economy suffers from a distorted yield structure and <b>crowding-out</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>investments.</b> From the economic point of view the used measures are neither appropriate nor necessary for achieving financial stability within the European Economic and Monetary Union.

40|$|The authors provide {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} impact that private participation in infrastructure has had on key macroeconomic variables {{in a sample of}} 21 Latin American countries from 1985 - 98. Specifically, they look at the effects on GDP per capita, current public expenditures, public investment, and private investment, controlling for country effects and institutional factors. The authors also investigate the relevance of the specific contractual form of private participation contracts on these variables and show differentiated effects according to contract types. The results suggest that: 1) Private sector involvement in utilities and transport have some, but not impressive, positive effects on GDP per capita. 2) There is some degree of <b>crowding-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>investment</b> resulting from greenfield projects in utilities, and delayed crowding-in from concessions in transport. 3) There is crowding-in of public investment by private participation in utilities, while there is crowding-out by increased private investment in transport. 4) Private participation in utilities decreases recurrent expenditures, while in transport it results in an increase. The net effect on the public sector account is uncertain, but this uncertainty is a major risk. The revelation of this risk may be the main contribution of this paper since it is inconsistent with the fiscal gains expected by many policymakers as they engage in infrastructure privatization programs.

40|$|The {{findings}} from the VECM for BBS data reveal {{that there is a}} positive and significant relationship between FD and GDPGR, supporting the Keynesian theory, while {{findings from}} the VECM for World Bank data indicate that the impact of Fiscal Deficit (FD) on GDPGR is mild but negative and significant at the 5 % level. This contradicts the Keynesian theory, but is in accord with Neo-classical theory which asserts that fiscal deficits lead to a drop in the GDP. Nevertheless, the government must strive to keep deficit under control, not to hamper growth, and expenditure ought to be set so as to avoid massive deficits leading to debt financing and the <b>crowding-out</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>investment.</b> If deficits become unsustainable, it can lead to higher interest payments, and the government may well default. Although in the economic literature, there is no definitive conclusion as to whether fiscal deficit helps or hinders economic growth for any country, many argue that fiscal deficit leads to economic growth of a country, which cannot be achieved only through domestic savings, not enough for investment. It can be assumed safely that to some extent fiscal deficit is good for economic growth if the borrowed money is spent on beneficial projects, provided the return from such investments exceeds the funding cost.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the short run and long run effects of fiscal policy. The classical-Harrodian model {{developed}} in Moudud (2000, 1999), which is an extension of Shaikh (1995, 1992, 1991), provides a demonstration of dynamic fiscal policy context. It asserts that the there is a crowding in of output growth in the short run. In the long run, however, the impact of government spending is subject to change under some circumstances of capital utilization, normal profit rate and social savings rate. Blinder and Solow (1973), using IS-LM model, reveal that bond-financed fiscal expansion does not engender a complete crowding out. Friedman (1978, 1985) notices the possibility of crowding-in. Crowding-out or crowding-in debate can be extended to other economists. Blanchard and Perotti (1999) and Easterly and Rebelo (1993) reach crowding-in results. Bairam and Ward (1993) find <b>crowding-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>investment.</b> Barro (1989, 1999) and Kormendi and Meguire (1985) obtain either a negative or no effect of government spending on the growth, whereas the works of Argimon et al. (1997), Devarajan et al. (1996) and Ahmed and Miller (2000) have mixed results. This study runs VECM models and impulse response analysis to juxtapose the crowding in/out effects of fiscal policy. Investigating the short run and long-run implications of fiscal policy for the Turkish economy, this paper concludes that government investments crowd out, whereas its current expenditures crowd in the private investment. ...|$|E
40|$|Nonpoint sources (NPS) {{pollution}} from agriculture {{is the leading}} source of water quality impairment in U. S. rivers and streams, and {{a major contributor to}} lakes, wetlands, estuaries and coastal waters (U. S. EPA 2016). Using data from a survey of farmers in Maryland, this dissertation examines the effects of a cost sharing policy designed to encourage adoption of conservation practices that reduce NPS pollution in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. This watershed is the site of the largest Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) implemented to date, making it an important setting in the U. S. for water quality policy. I study two main questions related to the reduction of NPS {{pollution from}} agriculture. First, I examine the issue of additionality of cost sharing payments by estimating the direct effect of cover crop cost sharing on the acres of cover crops, and the indirect effect of cover crop cost sharing on the acres of two other practices: conservation tillage and contour/strip cropping. A two-stage simultaneous equation approach is used to correct for voluntary self-selection into cost sharing programs and account for substitution effects among conservation practices. Quasi-random Halton sequences are employed to solve the system of equations for conservation practice acreage and to minimize the computational burden involved. By considering patterns of agronomic complementarity or substitution among conservation practices (Blum et al., 1997; USDA SARE, 2012), this analysis estimates water quality impacts of the crowding-in or <b>crowding-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>investment</b> in conservation due to public incentive payments. Second, I connect the econometric behavioral results with model parameters from the EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program to conduct a policy simulation on water quality effects. I expand the econometric model to also consider the potential loss of vegetative cover due to cropland incentive payments, or slippage (Lichtenberg and Smith-Ramirez, 2011). Econometric results are linked with the Chesapeake Bay Program watershed model to estimate the change in abatement levels and costs for nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment under various behavioral scenarios. Finally, I use inverse sampling weights to derive statewide abatement quantities and costs for each of these pollutants, comparing these with TMDL targets for agriculture in Maryland...|$|E
