50|$|Produce began Tippers 150 (4x2) and 151 (4x4) chassis 111 (4x4) and 122 (6x2) for the superstructure. Other {{enhancements}} to Series 100 {{has received}} since 1989, {{when the market}} opens increased competition. In the menu, {{so there was a}} new 16-speed gearbox ZF, remote cabin with high roof MAXI braking system ABS, <b>central</b> <b>lubrication,</b> electric mirrors and windows, cooling box or ISRI seats.|$|E
50|$|The chassis used {{leaf springs}} {{at the rear}} and {{independent}} coil springing at the front with a control {{on the steering wheel}} centre to adjust the hardness of the rear springing by hydraulically adjusting the rear dampers. A pedal-operated <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> system allowing oil to be applied to moving parts of the suspension from a central reservoir was fitted. The 12.25 in drum brakes were assisted by the traditional Rolls-Royce mechanical servo.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of a rigid X-shaped ovoid steel tube frame and four-wheel independent suspension provided surprisingly nimble handling. Double wishbones, coil springs, and a stabilizer bar were used up front and Mercedes' typical double coil spring swing axle in rear. An innovative dashboard-operated rear load-leveling suspension engaged a torsion bar to increase stiffness by one-third when needed, and a pedal-operated <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> system kept friction points silent. Brakes were hydraulic drum all around, steering worm-and-sector, replaced in 1952 by recirculating ball.|$|E
50|$|Other minor {{differences}} included {{fuel gauge}} placement, with the UK Phantom I's at the tank but some US models having {{one on the}} dash, and manual <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems. The UK Phantom employed Enots nipples, some {{times as many as}} 50, which required attachment of a special Enots oil pressure gun and needed time-consuming service at 500, 1000 and 2000 mile intervals; the US model used a centralized Bijur system which lubricated all the oiling points with a stroke of a single pump.|$|E

50|$|The Volga {{was shown}} at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair and {{together}} with the GAZ-52 and the GAZ-13 Chaika won the award; the same year production for export began. The Second Series Volgas became known for having no frills but outstanding durability. helped by the 23 cm ground clearance. In 1959, a Volga took a class win at the Thousand Lakes Rally in Finland, and third at the Acropolis Rally. That year, the <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> system was deleted, in favour of a more traditional local grease-application nipple.|$|E
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a four-cylinder motor with a displacement of 3768 cm³ (bore × stroke = 100 × 120 mm) which produced 24 PS (17.6 kW). The engine had dual ignition (magneto and battery), automatic <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> and overhead valves. The engine power was {{transmitted to the}} rear wheels via a leather cone clutch, a four-speed gearbox with a right-hand shift mechanism and a chain. The cars had a wheelbase of 3000-3200 mm, the track was 1450 mm and the weight {{in the case of}} the double phaeton was 1650 kg. The top speed was about 70 km / h.|$|E
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a six-cylinder motor with a displacement of 6494 cm³ (bore × stroke = 105 × 125 mm), which produced 40 PS (29 kW) at 1100 rpm. The engine had magneto ignition, automatic <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> and overhead valves. The power was {{transmitted to the}} rear wheels via a leather cone clutch, a three-speed gearbox with a right-hand shift mechanism and a chain. The wheelbase of the car was 3280 mm, the track was 1457 mm {{and the weight of}} the chassis was 1100 kg. The top speed was about 100 km / h.|$|E
50|$|The 16-slit {{vertical}} grille for {{models from}} 1958 (which {{gave it the}} unofficial nickname Akula (Shark)) was by far not the only change. Most of the changes came in February 1959, and included new front fenders with raised wheel arches, reflector glasses in the tail lights, a flock trim on the dashboard (later replaced by leatherette), a new radio with a metallic mesh speaker, windscreen washer and lock actuator on the boot. The following year {{was to have a}} new rear design with more contemporary tailfins http://www.gaz21volga.com/21/21_proto_1958/2serie_proto_003.jpg, but this was not implemented. Instead, the car body received several reinforcement supports and the novel, but ultimately troublesome <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> system was removed.|$|E
50|$|From 1950, 105 {{examples}} of this newly designed class were manufactured for medium passenger train and light express train services. They had welded locomotive frames, boilers and tenders together with all the latest refinements of German practice. These included a superheated multiple-valve regulator and <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> of the least accessible parts of the running gear. Engines up to operating number 023 had Knorr surface preheaters and journal bearings. Locomotives with serial numbers 024 and 025, {{as well as those}} from 053 onwards were equipped with roller bearings for the axles and drive as well as mixer-preheaters. A small number of vehicles were given Heinl preheaters and several were equipped for push-pull train operations.|$|E
50|$|In all gliding {{bearings}} wear is {{an issue}} of concern, as well as lubrication. Conventional gliding yaw bearings incorporate gliding elements manufactured out of polymer plastics such as POM or PA. To reduce friction, wear, and avoid stick-slip effects (often present in such high friction slow moving systems), lubrication is often introduced. This solution generally solves the gliding issues, but introduces more components to the systems and increases the general complication (e.g., difficult maintenance procedures for removal of used lubricant). Some wind turbine manufacturers now use self lubricating gliding elements instead of a <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> system. These gliding elements are manufactured from low friction materials or composites (e.t.g Teflon) that allow reliable operation of dry (non-lubricated) gliding yaw systems.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a six-cylinder 1,692 cc engine: [...] maximum power was set at [...] at 3,200 rpm. The engine {{featured}} <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> and the water-based cooling system for the engine employed both a pump and a thermostat. Power was transmitted to the rear wheels via what was in effect a four-speed manual transmission, on which the top gear operated {{as a form of}} overdrive. Third gear used the 1 : 1 ratio conventionally used by a top gear, and there was a fourth gear with a ratio of 1 : 0.73. Fuel economy was quoted as 11 l/100 km and top speed 90 km/h (56 mph), which combined to represent a competitive level of performance in the passenger car market of that time.|$|E
50|$|By {{the spring}} of 1954 the Volga prototypes were being {{actively}} tested. The new car introduced a range of additions and advantages over the Pobeda. In addition to being bigger, it had single panoramic forward and rear windscreens, a larger four-cylinder overhead-valve engine, <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> system of the main chassis elements, hypoid rear axle and an automatic hydromechanical gearbox. The car's external design was made by Lev Yeremeev and though influenced by North American vehicles of the same period, the 1954 Ford Mainline in particular, the project was mostly independent, with an exception for the automatic transmission that {{was derived from the}} 3-speed Ford-O-Matic. After thorough testing of the car, which lasted for a further two years, a go-ahead was finally given by the state, and the first pre-production batch left GAZ on 10 October 1956.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE had the Euro 4 engine as standard. At present, the ISBe5 Cummins engine or Cummins ISB6.7E5 250B or ISB6.7E5 285B {{can be used}} which meets Euro 5 (which is {{the same}} type, but with an {{additional}} filter) or EEV. The bus can also be fitted a CNG-powered engine. To reduce the rear axle load fuel tank with a capacity of 165 dm3 was placed behind the front door, and the AdBlue tank with a capacity of 40 dm3 was placed between the front wheel arches and the middle door. By using these solutions such as the <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> system and the self-diagnostic KFBS1 Kogel and the maintenance-free bearings in the drive and steering, this has reduced servicing time and cost. In 2011, the company debuted the first prototype Solaris Urbino electric LE 8.9 electric bus, which was created by a significant redesign of the Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the spring}} of 2005 the company has {{produced}} Solaris Urbino 10 in their third generation, {{but this is the}} second version of this bus. It is produced in versions with diesel engines (initially meeting emission standards of Euro 3 and Euro 4, Euro 5 or EEV), and since 2005 can be manufactured with a variety of gas-powered CNG engines by companies like Iveco and MAN. The basic engine used in this bus model is the Cummins ISB6.7E5 250B with a maximum power 180.5 kW (245 hp), meeting the requirements of the Euro 5 standard, with an option of stronger Cummins ISB6.7E5 285B unit with maximum power of 209 kW (284 hp). All axles come from ZF. The front axle is ZF RL 75 EC or optional ZF RL 85 A, rear axle ZF AV 132 is fitted as standard with a gearbox retarder. The chassis has a <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> system. The bus has the construction made from corrosion-resistant steel. Similarly the panels are from aluminium. The electrical system is based on the CAN bus system.|$|E
40|$|The Aim of {{this thesis}} is to search and {{analytical}} evaluation of different approaches applied by {{producers in the}} field of wheel flanges lubrication of railway vehicles by means of ecological lubricants. The analysis focuses on the cyclical and continuous methods of lubrication of different types of <b>central</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems placed on the railway vehicles...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{construction}} of the whole combustion engine, the crankshaft design, the piston and the piston rod. It also outlines the <b>central</b> <b>lubrication,</b> the cooling, the injection pump, the movable pump and the gear pump as well as fuel filtering, injection, engine timimg, etc. The four-cycle engine has four working cycles. During the first cycle the "clean" air is drawn and the piston moves from the bottom centre to the top centre and it comes to compression in the cylinder thanks to the adjusting of the advance and the fuel is injected into the cylinder. As the piston moves rapidly to the top centre, the pressure and the temperature increase so much that the fuel ignites. The pressure is about 26 atm (2. 634 Mpa) and the temperature is about 600 °C. The fuel burns ideally in spherical wave fronts. The fuel is injected under high pressure as aerosol generates. As the fuel expands, the volume increases and the piston moves to the bottom centre. And it is its only working cycle. The piston moves from the bottom centre to the top centre and the exhaust valve opens through which the hot gases of combustion leave - and everything repeats. The design of the particular components is shown in the animations. Modelling and simulations were produced using CAD system. Everything is supported with calculations...|$|E
40|$|A waste {{container}} vehicle for waste glass, building rubble and houshold refuse containers etc. was developed under the research project. The noise emitted by this vehicle amounting to a {{sound intensity level}} of 99 dB (A) during operation (raising and depositing operations) is roughly 10 dB (A) lower than comparable conventional vehicles. This substantial reduction in noise required the following complementary measures: Use of a chassis which fulfils the criteria under paragraph 49 of the regulations authorising the use of vehicles for road traffic (StVZO) for low-noise trucks. Reduction in the operating speed of the engine while retaining the working speed and performance (depositing and raising operations). Provision of additional engine and gearbox surrounds. Use of low-noise-units - (ancillary drive, hydraulic pump, control valve) - and reduction in the operating speeds. Reduction in the noise transmission of the hydraulic system to the vehicle and superstructure through solid-borne sound insulation. Optimisation of the hock control to reduce the impact noises of the containers (control of the lifting speed). Special measures on vehicle and containers to prevent screeching noises (roller guidance with ball bearings and <b>central</b> <b>lubrication).</b> Special measures on containers (building rubble, household refuse and waste glass containers) to reduce the noise emission (sandwich design, rubber inlays, sound-absorbing mats). The noise emitted while the containers are being deposited and raised has been reduced so much with these measures that 100 of these vehicles {{would have to be}} operated simultaneously in order to generate the same sound level as one conventional vehicle. A characteristic feature of the overall concept is that only units and components readily available on the market were used and it is possible to transfer the measures implemented to other container vehicle designs. The noise reduction measures do not limit the operation reliability, possible applications and performance compared with conventional vehiclesSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 8908 (93 - 024) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
