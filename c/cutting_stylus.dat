50|$|Preservation of the tablets {{presented}} unique challenges, as {{the usual}} preservation method for wood would have destroyed the wax layer, and vice versa. The method eventually decided on called for careful {{separation of the}} wax layer, and preserving each material separately. The newly exposed wood under the removed wax {{was found to have}} been extensively scratched by the <b>stylus</b> <b>cutting</b> through the thin wax. It took the research team several weeks to realize that some symbols could be discerned in the scratches.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, Harvey Fletcher of Bell Laboratories {{was also}} {{investigating}} techniques for stereophonic recording and reproduction. One {{of the techniques}} investigated was the [...] "wall of sound", which used an enormous array of microphones hung in a line {{across the front of}} an orchestra. Up to 80 microphones were used, and each fed a corresponding loudspeaker, placed in an identical position, in a separate listening room. Several stereophonic test recordings, using two microphones connected to two <b>styli</b> <b>cutting</b> two separate grooves on the same wax disc, were made with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra at Philadelphia's Academy of Music in March 1932. The first (made on March 12, 1932), of Scriabin's Prometheus: Poem of Fire, is the earliest known surviving intentional stereo recording.|$|R

5000|$|Among {{the later}} {{improvements}} by the Volta Associates, the Graphophone used a <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> to create lateral zig-zag grooves of uniform depth into the wax-coated cardboard cylinders, {{rather than the}} up-and-down vertically-cut grooves of Edison's then-contemporary phonograph machine designs.|$|E
5000|$|In late 1934, a {{new type}} of {{instantaneous}} disc was commercially introduced. It consisted of an aluminum core disc coated with black cellulose nitrate lacquer, although for reasons which are unclear it soon came to be called an [...] "acetate" [...] disc by radio professionals. Later, during World War II, when aluminum was a critical war material, glass core discs were used. A recording lathe and chisel-like <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> like those used to record in wax would be used to engrave the groove into this lacquer surface instead. Given a top-quality blank disc, <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus,</b> lathe, electronics and recording engineer, the result was a virtually noiseless broadcast-quality recording which could be played several times before the effects of wear started to become apparent. The new medium was soon applied to a number of purposes by local stations, but not by the networks, which had a policy against broadcasting prerecorded material and mainly used the discs for archiving [...] "reference recordings" [...] of their broadcasts.|$|E
5000|$|Among their innovations, the {{researchers}} experimented with lateral recording techniques {{as early as}} 1881. Contrary to the vertically-cut grooves of Edison phonographs, the lateral recording method used a <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> that moved {{from side to side}} in a [...] "zig zag" [...] pattern across the record. While cylinder phonographs never employed the lateral cutting process commercially, this later became the primary method of phonograph disc recording.|$|E
50|$|The {{direct metal}} {{mastering}} technology addresses the lacquer mastering technology's issue of pre-echoes during record play, caused by the <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> unintentionally transferring some of the subsequent groove wall's impulse signal into the previous groove wall. In particular, a quiet passage followed by a loud sound often clearly revealed a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time (the duration of one revolution at 33 rpm). This problem could also appear as post-echo, 1.8 seconds after a peak in volume.|$|E

5000|$|The process {{involved}} mechanically {{linking the}} television scanning mechanism, a Nipkow disk, and the record-mastering turntable. The video {{signal from the}} Nipkow disc scanner was amplified and connected to the <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> of the turntable. Baird {{had to make a}} number of compromises to get the process to work, among them using a picture rate of only four frames per second. Unlike Baird's other experiments (including stereoscopy, colour and infra-red night-vision), {{there is no evidence of}} a public demonstration of playback of pictures. The results were considered a failure at the time, and Baird moved on leaving behind several discs in the hands of museums and favoured company members.|$|E
5000|$|When sapphires were {{introduced}} for the 78 rpm disc and the LP, {{they were made}} by tapering a stem and polishing the tip to a sphere with a radius of around 70 and 25 micrometers respectively. A sphere is not equal to {{the form of the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> and by the time diamond needles came to the market, a whole discussion was started on the effect of circular forms moving through a non-circular cut groove. It can be easily shown that vertical, so called [...] "pinching" [...] movements were a result and when stereophonic LPs {{were introduced}}, unwanted vertical modulation was recognized as a problem. Also, the needle started its life touching the groove on a very small surface, giving extra wear on the walls.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem is}} in the {{tapering}} along a straight line, while {{the side of the}} groove is far from straight. Both problems were attacked together: by polishing the diamond in a certain way that it could be made doubly elliptic. 1) the side was made into one ellipse as seen from behind, meaning the groove touched along a short line and 2) the ellipse form was also polished as seen from above and curvature {{in the direction of the}} groove became much smaller than 25 micrometers e.g. 13 micrometers. With this approach a number of irregularities were eliminated. Furthermore, the angle of the stylus, which used to be always sloping backwards, was changed into the forward direction, in line with the slope the original <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> possessed. These styli were expensive to produce, but the costs were effectively offset by their extended lifespans.|$|E
50|$|The {{phonograph}} {{was invented}} in 1877 by Thomas Edison. While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds, Edison's phonograph {{was the first to}} be able to reproduce the recorded sound. His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder. A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill-and-dale groove in the foil. Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s, including the use of wax-coated cardboard cylinders, and a <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record. In the 1890s, Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center. Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system, the stylus or needle, and the sound and equalization systems.|$|E
5000|$|I have closely {{examined}} the original discs and photographed the grooves {{at the point}} of the explosion. You can see several deep digs in the lacquer before the groove disappears. Then almost immediately there is a faint groove for about two revolutions while Charlie Nehlsen gently lowered the cutting head back to the disc. Fortunately the <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> never cut through the lacquer to the aluminum base. If that had happened the most dramatic part of the recording would not have been made because the stylus would have been ruined. The digs and the bouncing off of the cutting head were caused by the shock wave of the explosion which reached the machine just after Morrison said [...] "It burst into flames&hellip;"I and several others believe that the originals were recorded slightly slow, and that all replays have been at too fast a speed. Comparison with the now two other known contemporary recordings of Morrison demonstrate this conclusion.|$|E
5000|$|If {{one goes}} to the Madacy site to view their 101 Strings collection, exactly the same {{description}} that was used on the Bel Canto's ST- 76 two track stereo release about the 101 Strings sound is reprinted. The 50 Hz hum heard on many of those tape recordings {{was due to the}} Ampex 350's filtering which was not well suited for European 50 Hz power. The [...] "My Fair Lady" [...] and [...] "King and I" [...] releases have {{what appears to be the}} sound of dirty mixing pots used on the fly during those sessions. There were a number of tape releases that sounded like tape copies of pristine Stereo Fidelity vinyl which actually, were not all that pristine. Stereo recordings were made with a triangular <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus.</b> This resulted at times in pinch distortion which early conical styli did not handle well. Inner grooves especially, due to the increased density of the recorded information due to the slower relative movement of the track under the stylus, were more susceptible to distortion with conical styli in use at the time this record was released. The later development of elliptical styli allowed more precise tracking of the track and greatly reduced inner-track distortion.|$|E
5000|$|Mike Dunne and Hugh Hopper then tweaked the raw sounds {{with all}} manner of analog and improvised effects. A big sheet of steel hanging in the studio acting as an {{unconventional}} echo plate. They experimented with tape loops, a trademark of Hopper's music since the early days. A couple of months after the initial sessions they did some further work at a farm in Hertfordshire where the mobile was now installed. Mike Travis laid down a new drumm track on [...] "Spanish Knee" [...] and they polished off the final mixes, all the time trying not to breathe too deeply - the studio was next to the pig shed of the farm. There were sticky flypapers hanging up everywhere, and once a fly landed on the multitrack tape as Travis pushed the Play button. The fly got squashed in the roll of recording tape. That's probably the cause of an analog blip somewhere on the record. Speaking of blips, when the record was on the cutting table to make the master disc, somehow the <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> jumped {{in the middle of}} Elton Dean's solo on [...] "Lonely Sea". Nobody noticed it before several thousand vinyl LPs had been pressed and issued, so all of the released LPs feature a weird leap in the music. In the remastered Cuneiform CD version we get to hear Elton's full solo for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|Recording {{was done}} using a cutting lathe and acetate discs. Programs were {{normally}} recorded at 33 rpm on 16 inch discs, the standard format used for such [...] "electrical transcriptions" [...] {{from the early}} 1930s through the 1950s. Sometimes, the groove was cut starting at {{the inside of the}} disc and running to the outside. This was useful when the program to be recorded was longer than 15 minutes so required more than one disc side. By recording the first side outside in, the second inside out, and so on, the sound quality at the disc change-over points would match and result in a more seamless playback. An inside start also had the advantage that the thread of material cut from the disc's surface, which had to be kept out of the path of the <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus,</b> was naturally thrown {{toward the center of the}} disc so was automatically out of the way. When cutting an outside start disc, a brush could be used to keep it out of the way by sweeping it toward the middle of the disc. Well-equipped recording lathes used the vacuum from a water aspirator to pick it up as it was cut and deposit it in a water-filled bottle. In addition to convenience, this served a safety purpose, as the cellulose nitrate thread was highly flammable and a loose accumulation of it combusted violently if ignited.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1925, {{recording}} {{was done}} by the same purely mechanical, non-electronic [...] "acoustical" [...] method used since the invention of the phonograph nearly fifty years earlier. No microphone was involved and there was no means of amplification. The recording machine was essentially an exposed-horn acoustical record player functioning in reverse. One or more funnel-like metal horns was used to concentrate the energy of the airborne sound waves onto a recording diaphragm, which was a thin glass disc about two inches in diameter held in place by rubber gaskets at its perimeter. The sound-vibrated center of the diaphragm was linked to a <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> that was guided across the surface of a very thick wax disc, engraving a sound-modulated groove into its surface. The wax was too soft to be played back even once without seriously damaging it, although test recordings were sometimes made and sacrificed by playing them back immediately. The wax master disc was sent to a processing plant where it was electroplated to create a negative metal [...] "stamper" [...] used to mold or [...] "press" [...] durable replicas of the recording from heated [...] "biscuits" [...] of a shellac-based compound. Although sound quality was gradually improved by a series of small refinements, the process was inherently insensitive. It could only record sources of sound that were very close to the recording horn or very loud, and even then the high-frequency overtones and sibilants necessary for clear, detailed sound reproduction were too feeble to register above the background noise. Resonances in the recording horns and associated components resulted in a characteristic [...] "horn sound" [...] that immediately identifies an acoustical recording to an experienced modern listener and seemed inseparable from [...] "phonograph music" [...] to contemporary listeners.|$|E
5000|$|One {{advantage}} of phonograph and gramophone discs over cylinders in the 1890s - before electronic amplification was available—was that {{large numbers of}} discs could be stamped quickly and cheaply. In 1890, the only ways of manufacturing copies of a master cylinder were to mold the cylinders (which was slow and, early on, produced very poor copies), to record cylinders by the [...] "round", over and over again, or to acoustically copy the sound by placing the horns of two phonographs together or to hook the two together with a rubber tube (one phonograph recording and the other playing the cylinder back). Edison, Bettini, Leon Douglass and others solved this problem (partly) by mechanically linking a <b>cutting</b> <b>stylus</b> and a playback stylus together and copying the [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] grooves of the cylinder mechanically. When molding improved somewhat, molded cylinders were used as pantograph masters. This was employed by Edison and Columbia in 1898, and was used until about January 1902 (Columbia brown waxes after this were molded). Some companies like the United States Phonograph Co. of Newark, New Jersey, supplied cylinder masters for smaller companies so that they could duplicate them, sometimes pantographically. Pantographs could turn out about 30 records per day and produce up to about 150 records per master. In theory, pantograph masters could be used for 200 or 300 duplicates if the master and the duplicate were running in reverse and the record would be duplicated in reverse. This, in theory, could extend the usability of a pantograph master by using the unworn/lesser worn part of the recording for duplication. Pathé employed this system with mastering their vertically-cut records until 1923; a 5 in, 4 or 6 in master cylinder, rotating at a high speed, would be recorded on. This was done as the resulting cylinder was considerably loud and of very high fidelity. Then, the cylinder would be placed on the mandrel of a duplicating pantograph that would be played with a stylus {{on the end of a}} lever, which would transfer the sound to a wax disc master, which would be electroplated and be used to stamp copies out. This system resulted in some fidelity reduction and rumble, but relatively high quality sound. Edison Diamond Disc Records were made by recording directly onto the wax master disc.|$|E
