Many factors contribute to the plasticity of the brain which, furthermore, alter the spatial ability. Physical activity, which can be further grouped into sport and exercise, is a modifiable factor that enhances the cognitive processes through a divergent mechanism.

40|$|Este trabalho se propõe constituir uma sistematização sobre o princípio da gestão democrática do ensino público contemplado na nova Constituição brasileira de 1988 e remetido a lei ordinária para sua regulamentação. Trata-se de um estudo sobre as várias percepções - o que as entidades da sociedade organizada na área de educação possuem sobre gestão dernocrática - e de uma análise desse princípio no projeto de Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional. da Comissão de Educação, Cultura e Desporto da Câmara dos Deputados, aprovado em junho de 1990. This work {{intends to}} be a systematization of the {{principle}} of democratical management of public education, which is part of Brazilian Constitution of 1988 and has been put on the way to ordinary law for its regulation. From a study on several insights, the author points out every material on democratical management available in the institutions of organized society. She also discusses this principle in the project of LDB, that is to say, the Law of Diretives and Fundamentals of National Education. This Law was formulated by the Chamber of Deputies <b>Comitte</b> on Education, Culture and Sports, and was approved in June 1990. Under the title of “The education in the new constitutional order”, there is a historical approach of National Constitutional Assembly, with its Committees and Subcommittees, where an emphasis is put {{on the role of the}} Catholic Church and other Christian beliefs, the private schools, and the “Big Centre” (a faction of the Parliament which tends to support the government and avoids either left or right political positions) – in the debate on education. Next theme, “The democratical management in LDB, from the point of view of educators” is a study of the proposals on democratical management included in a number of documents prepared by representative entities in the educational field. Finally, the author describes the process designing the project of LDB and analyses the concept of democratical management, under the title “Democratical management as it appears in the project of LDB, by the Chamber of Deputies Committee on Education, Culture and Sports”. The conclusion stresses some questions considered to be controversial and relevant about democratical management and points out the project’s possibilities of being approved or not in the present context of correlation of forces between the Executive power, the Legislative power and the organized civil society itself...|$|E
40|$|The 1951 - 1963 {{period was}} the most {{prolific}} of the Spanish comic. The adventures books, the long sagas starring an only one hero, {{are the most popular}} format. Around 500 collections are published, among these, some will last such as El Cachorro, Aventuras del FBI or the emblematic El Capitán Trueno, published by Bruguera, the publishing house that would rule the market in a nearly monopolistic way during both the 1960 and the 1970 decades. Its humour mastheads (Pulgarcito, DDT…) reached their maximum peak despite the censoring mechanisms carried out by the franquista government through the CIPIJ (Information Comittee for Children and Youth Publications), created in 1963, that considerably reduce the crytical intentions that characterized the publications some time ago. A similar situation happens to the adventures comics, hounded by this <b>Comitte</b> until is nearly disappearance by 1966. The market has to endure a deep crisis, new forms such as the so-called graphic novel or the European look magazine are tried but did not reach the same repercussion reached by the comics in the 1950 decade. Delta 99 , by Carlos Giménez, or the weekly magazine Trinca are the best examples of this kind of renovation which is being started by this time and which would bear fruit during the following decade. El periodo 1951 - 1963 es el más prolífico de la historieta española. Los cuadernos de aventuras, largas sagas protagonizadas por un solo héroe, son su formato más popular. Aparecen cerca de 500 colecciones de este tipo, entre ellas algunas destinadas a perdurar como El Cachorro, Aventuras del FBI o el emblemático El Capitán Trueno, editado por Bruguera, la empresa que va a dominar el mercado de modo casi monopolístico durante los años sesenta y setenta. Sus cabeceras de humor (Pulgarcito, DDT…) alcanzan entonces su máximo auge, si bien los mecanismos de censura ejercidos por el régimen a través de la CIPIJ (Comisión de Información de Publicaciones Infantiles y Juveniles) creada en 1963 merman considerablemente las intenciones críticas que antaño las caracterizaron. Algo semejante ocurre con los tebeos de aventuras, a los que dicha Comisión acosa hasta su práctica desaparición en 1966. El mercado entra entonces en una crisis profunda; nuevas formas como la llamada novela gráfica o la revista de aires europeos se intentan sin llegar a obtener la repercusión alcanzada por la historieta durante los años cincuenta.

40|$|As propriedades antibacterianas da própolis despertaram o interesse da Odontologia em utilizá-la como meio de controle do biofilme dental. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a ação de um gel de própolis 5 % associada ao fluoreto de sódio 0, 05 % sobre as contagens dos níveis salivares de Streptococcus mutans, inativação de manchas brancas e acúmulo do biofilme dental em pacientes de alto risco à cárie. Participaram do estudo 97 crianças que possuíam contagens de Unidades Formadoras de Colônia de Streptococcus mutans superiores a 106 / mL de saliva. A amostra foi dividida aleatoriamente em dois grupos experimentais: Grupo I (n= 49, Gel A) e Grupo II (n= 48, Gel B), realizando-se um ensaio clínico duplo-cego randomizado. Após quatro aplicações tópicas consecutivas do gel {{experimental}} (uma vez por semana), os níveis salivares de Streptococcus mutans foram avaliados pelo método da espátula; as manchas brancas através da observação clínica e o acúmulo do biofilme pelo Índice de Higiene Oral Simplificado. Os resultados revelaram uma redução significativa (p 0, 05). Concluiu-se que a Própolis 5 % acrescida de NaF 0, 05 % atou significativamente sobre as contagens salivares de Streptococcus mutans e é capaz de reequilibrar o processo DES-RE, inativando manchas brancas.
