5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E
25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The <b>crown</b> <b>cork,</b> the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E

50|$|In 1927, after {{a merger}} with New Process Cork Company, <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> and Seal Company was {{established}} in New York City. <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> International Corporation {{was established in}} the subsequent year in order to assist subsidiaries engaged in bottle crown and other cork business outside the United States.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> (also {{known as}} a crown seal, crown cap or just a cap), the first form of bottle cap, was invented by William Painter in 1892 in Baltimore. The company making it was {{originally}} called the Bottle Seal Company, but it changed its name with the almost immediate success of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> to the <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> and Seal Company. It still informally goes by that name, but is officially Crown Holdings. Crown corks {{are similar to the}} Pilfer proof caps, as usage of both products is to seal the bottle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>corks</b> are {{collected}} by {{people around the}} world who admire the variety of designs and relative ease of storage. Collectors tend to prefer the term <b>crown</b> cap over <b>corks.</b> In Mexico, these are called corcholatas. In Spain and South America, the names chapas or chapitas are used. (In northern Chile, the name calas is used.) In the Philippines, the term tansan is employed.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> bottle stopper, soda bottles had ordinary cork bottle stoppers and often had rounded bottoms so they could not be stored standing upright. The reason for this is corks have a tendency to dry out and shrink, which allows the gas pressure in the bottle to cause the cork to [...] "pop." [...] Storing bottles on their side prevents the corks from drying out and [...] "popping." [...] After {{the invention}} of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> bottle stopper, this problem was eliminated, and soda bottles could be stored standing upright.|$|E
50|$|The {{area has}} long been served by freight railroad, and there remains active {{industry}} in the area. <b>Crown,</b> <b>Cork,</b> and Seal was a long-time anchor on Ashton Road, finally relocating their world headquarters north on a large campus.|$|E
50|$|Until {{many years}} after the {{invention}} in 1892 of <b>crown</b> <b>corks,</b> beer bottles were stopped with corks. The increasing popularity of bottled beer created {{a need for a}} faster corkscrew. This led to the invention of a variety of “automatic” corkscrew mechanisms patented in the late 1800s and early 1900s in the United States, England and several European countries.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, {{approximately}} 99% of {{beer bottles}} are reusable deposit bottles and are either 330 ml or 500 ml. At any given time, an estimated 2 billion beer bottles are in circulation in Germany, {{each of which}} sees an average of 36 reuses. The deposit for beer bottles sealed with <b>crown</b> <b>corks</b> is €0.08; for bottles with flip-top closures, the deposit is €0.15.|$|R
5000|$|Göss {{quickly became}} the largest brewery in Upper Styria and by 1892 was {{producing}} ca. 60,000 barrels per year. In the 1920s the brewery began selling pasteurized beer in <b>crown</b> <b>corked</b> glass bottles permitting Gösser to market their beer outside of Austria. By 1930 the company was producing ca 340,000 barrels per year and had exceeded 850,000 barrels per year by 1973.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "flip-top" [...] or [...] "swing-top" [...] {{consists}} of a plastic or ceramic stopper {{held in place by}} a set of wires. Prior to the invention of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork,</b> this was the dominant method of sealing bottles that contained carbonated liquid.|$|E

5000|$|A {{corkscrew}} is a {{tool for}} drawing corks from wine bottles, beer bottles and other household bottles before the invention of screw caps and <b>Crown</b> <b>corks.</b> In its traditional form, a corkscrew simply consists of a pointed metallic helix (often called the [...] "worm") attached to a handle, which the user screws into the cork and pulls to extract it. Corkscrews are necessary because corks themselves, being small and smooth, are difficult to grip and remove, particularly when inserted fully into an inflexible glass bottle. More recent styles of corkscrew incorporate various systems of levers that further {{increase the amount of}} force that can be applied outwards upon the cork, making easier the extraction of difficult corks.|$|R
5000|$|Lotería is the Spanish {{word for}} lottery. The deck is {{composed}} {{of a set of}} 54 different images, each one in a card. To start the game, the caller (cantor, or singer) randomly selects a card from the deck and announces it to the players by its name, sometimes using a riddle or humorous patter instead of reading the card name. The players with a matching pictogram on their board mark it off with a chip or other kind of marker (many Mexican people traditionally use small rocks, <b>crown</b> <b>corks</b> or pinto beans as markers). The first player with four chips in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row, squared pattern,any other previously specified pattern, or fills the tabla first shouts [...] "¡Lotería!" [...] (Lottery!) or [...] "¡Buenas!" [...] (Good!) and is the winner.|$|R

50|$|The <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> was {{patented}} by William Painter on February 2, 1892 (U.S. Patent 468,258). It had 24 teeth and a cork seal {{with a paper}} backing to prevent contact between the contents and the metal cap. The current version has 21 teeth. To open these bottles, a bottle opener is generally used.|$|E
5000|$|Invented at {{the same}} time as the <b>crown</b> <b>cork,</b> it is the {{original}} [...] "bar blade". But as well as being portable it also comes as a fixed device to be attached to vertical surfaces, often with a tray to catch the bottle tops. It does not open wine bottles. It is class 2 fulcrum type.|$|E
