40|$|The {{incentive}} {{failures of}} rate-of-return regulation {{are well known}} and thus {{raise the question of}} whether to deregulate electric power. The development of long-distance transmission and of alternative power sources in networks has spawned several institutions that would or could allow markets to substitute for such regulation. These include long-term contract sales, spot power exchange, contract power pooling, shared facility ownership, and economic dispatch. Because of the current surplus of power, the existence of such institutions has caused increasing competition in the electric power market and has catalyzed the movement to deregulate generators from state authority and to restructure utility assets. By encouraging this movement, regulators can further the discipline that markets already exert on prices and costs. By making counterproposals to the utilities, regulators can influence asset restructuring so that some of the capital gains inherent in such restructuring can be shared with consumers in the form of rate relief. Finally, for the future, the <b>cotenancy</b> agreement-which is antitrust supervised and competitively ruled-has promising possibilities for deregulating transmission and distribution.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} with proposals for substantial institutional change in water systems is that modification and irreversibility make the process slow, cautious and costly to society. Experimental economics yields a formal and replicable system for analyzing alternative market structures, such as the ‘smart ’ market, before they are actually implemented. For example, a ‘smart ’ water market can be developed and tested in the laboratory during years of sufficient water to simulate drought conditions. In this paper, we discuss the role that experimental economics can play in evaluating proposed institutional changes to help facilitate a more rapid and smooth adoption of changes in the water system, and demonstrate it using a set of experiment under California conditions. A prototype of the California water transfer model and results from its testing in the laboratory, using trained student subjects, is presented. Results include levels of price efficiency achieved by the smart market players compared with a hypothetical set of perfectly competitive trades, and the rate of price discovery by the players. The experiments also address variability in supply of water and assignment of water transport rights as an institution for improved efficiency. Results suggest that <b>cotenancy</b> yields more stable and lower prices, an...|$|E
40|$|On June 18, 1982, the North Carolina General Assembly enacted House Bill No. 67 {{entitled}} 2 ̆ 2 AN ACT TO EQUALIZE BETWEEN MARRIED PERSONS THE RIGHT TO INCOME, POSSESSION, AND CONTROL IN PROPERTY OWNED CONCURRENTLY IN TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETY. 2 ̆ 2 This article explores {{several of}} {{the issues raised by}} the legislation: (1) Does it alter the pre-reform law under which a creditor of neither husband nor wife alone could reach any interest in entirety property? (2) Does it extend that exemption to the rents and profits arising from tenancy by the entirety property? (3) Will the provisions for management of entirety property by husband and wife generate a theory of estoppel by acquiescence? (4) Will the courts utilize the curative principles of the reform act when holding that pre-reform law was unconstitutional because of gender discrimination? (5) Does the act intend to change ownership of rents and profits accruing after the act 2 ̆ 7 s effective date, January 1, 1983, from entirety property where the <b>cotenancy</b> was created before that date? (6) Does the act intend to shift management and control of pre-enactment entirety property? (7) Does the act enable thirdparty donors creating a tenancy by the entirety to validly claim two federal gift tax annual exclusions on the theory that the wife 2 ̆ 7 s interest is no longer a future interest? and (8) Does the act cause a shift in the bases of the husband and wife in entirety property that will affect federal income tax liabilities...|$|E
