40|$|In many {{instances}} of virtual machine deployments today, virtual machine instances are created {{to support a}} single application. Traditional operating systems provide an extensive framework for protecting one process from another. In such deployments, this protection layer becomes an additional source of overhead as isolation between services is provided at an operating system level and each instance of an operating system supports only one service. This makes the operating system {{the equivalent of a}} process from the traditional operating system perspective. Isolation between these operating systems and indirectly the services they support, is ensured by the virtual machine monitor in these deployments. In these scenarios the process protection provided by the operating system becomes redundant and a source of additional overhead. We propose a new model for these scenarios with operating systems that bypass this redundant protection offered by the traditional operating systems. We prototyped such an operating system by executing parts of the operating system in the same protection ring as user applications. This gives processes more power and access to kernel memory bypassing the need to copy data from user to kernel and vice versa as is required when the traditional ring protection layer is enforced. This allows us to save the system <b>call</b> <b>trap</b> overhead and allows application programmers to directly call kernel functions exposing the rich kernel library. This does not compromise security on the other virtual machines running on the same physical machine, as they are protected by the VMM. We illustrate the design and implementation of such a system with the Xen hypervisor and the XenoLinux kernel. ii Table of Contents Abstract [...] . i...|$|E

30|$|Hardware rooting {{exploits}} system <b>call</b> <b>trapping</b> {{using an}} interrupt descriptor table register (IDTR) and an interrupt descriptor table. The IDTR value is {{set by the}} processor. Genuine interrupt descriptor table gets accessed using system <b>call</b> <b>trapping.</b> Every time {{the value of the}} CR 3 register needs to be changed, an interrupt needs to be generated. The VMI method traces this interrupt to detect process switching. In this way, the value of the CR 3 register, along with the value of the first valid entry in the corresponding top-level page directory, is accessed. The value of CR 3 register is unique for every process. It helps to identify the required process executing inside the VM.|$|R

5000|$|The {{notion of}} an [...] "apparent horizon" [...] begins {{with the notion of}} a trapped null surface. A (compact, orientable, spacelike) surface always has 2 {{independent}} forward-in-time pointing, lightlike, normal directions. For example, a (spacelike) sphere in Minkowski space has lightlike vectors pointing inward and outward along the radial direction. The inward-pointing, lightlike normal vectors converge, while the outward-pointing, lightlike normal vectors diverge. It can, however, happen that both inward-pointing and outward-pointing lightlike normal vectors converge. In such a case, the surface is <b>called</b> <b>trapped.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although Talbot once {{starred in}} a film <b>called</b> <b>Trapped</b> by Television (1936), the {{invention}} of TV actually revived his acting career, as his movie roles faded. Talbot was a frequent presence on American television from the 1950s well into the 1970s with occasional appearances in the 1980s. From 1955-66, he appeared in some seventy episodes of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, as neighbor Joe Randolph. He also had a recurring role (1955-58) as Robert Cummings's character's buddy from the Air Force, Paul Fonda, in numerous episodes of The Bob Cummings Show.|$|R
40|$|Nematode-trapping fungi are soil-living fungi {{that capture}} and kill {{nematodes}} using special hyphal structures <b>called</b> <b>traps.</b> They display a large diversity of trapping mechanisms and {{differ in their}} host preferences. To provide insights into the genetic basis for this variation, we compared the transcriptome expressed by three species of nematode-trapping fungi (Arthrobotrys oligospora, Monacrosporium cionopagum and Arthrobotrys dactyloides, which use adhesive nets, adhesive branches or constricting rings, respectively, to trap nematodes) during infection of two different plant-pathogenic nematode hosts (the root knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla and the sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii) ...|$|R
50|$|Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) is a {{food plant}} of some {{caterpillars}} which feed primarily on {{members of the}} cabbage family (brassicas), and some gardeners claim that planting them around brassicas protects the food crops from damage, as eggs of the pests are preferentially laid on the nasturtium. This practice is <b>called</b> <b>trap</b> cropping (using alternative plants to attract pests away from a main crop). However, while many trap crops have successfully diverted pests off of focal crops in small scale greenhouse, garden and field experiments, {{only a small portion}} of these plants have been shown to reduce pest damage at larger commercial scales.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{describe}} an {{implementation of a}} fine-grain adaptive scheduling mechanism, based on software feedback.

We broaden {{the meaning of the}} term "scheduling " to include job assignment as a function of a sequence of events, such as timer interrupts, I/O operations, queue overflodunderflow, and system <b>call</b> <b>traps.</b> Our implementation of software feedback in the Synthesis operating system is analogous to the hardware phase locked loop. Very low overhead context switches and scheduling cost (a few microseconds on a 68020 -based machine) makes this implementation useful to practical applications such as digital signal processing.

In particular, the “latent variable” formulation of the mixture model greatly reduces computational complexity. However, one failing of this approach is the possible existence of almost-absorbing states, <b>called</b> <b>trapping</b> states, as it may require an enormous number of iterations to escape from these states. Here we examine an alternative approach to estimation in mixture models, one based on a Rao–Blackwellization argument applied to a latent-variable-based estimator. From this derivation we construct an alternative Monte Carlo sampling scheme that avoids trapping states.

We realize detailed measurements linking a trap’s stability to the global evolution of the system and propose a model reproducing the entire dynamics of the system.
