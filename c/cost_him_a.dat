5|$|Norman Uprichard (20 April 1928 – 31 January 2011) was a goalkeeper {{who began}} his career playing Gaelic Football with St. Peter's GAC. His {{decision}} to sign for Glenavon <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> league medal under the GAA's now-defunct 'Rule 27'. He was finally awarded his medal by St. Peter's in 2004. He went on to play for Swindon Town, Portsmouth and Southend United at club level, and won 18 caps for Northern Ireland at international level.|$|E
5|$|Ziggler then {{entered an}} {{on-screen}} relationship with WWE Diva Maria {{and she became}} his valet. He simultaneously started a scripted rivalry with Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio, who defeated Ziggler at the Night of Champions and SummerSlam pay-per-views to retain the championship. In September, Mysterio lost the Intercontinental Championship to John Morrison, and Ziggler entered a feud with Morrison, losing {{to him at the}} Hell in a Cell pay-per-view. On the episode of SmackDown, following Hell in a Cell, Ziggler ended his on-screen relationship with Maria after she <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> match against Morrison.|$|E

5|$|During {{a costume}} party, Lois {{suggests}} Brian {{to find a}} girlfriend. After going to the bookstore to buy The God Delusion, Brian meets an atheist named Carolyn, {{who happens to be}} looking for the same book. Brian becomes interested in Carolyn, and the two begin to date. When she invites him to her house, Stewie apprehends Brian and tells him that his relationships fail because he has sex with his girlfriends immediately when they meet. Brian realizes that Stewie is right and decides to listen to his advice. However, he finds out that Carolyn has begun to date Cleveland, since Brian did not want to have sex for the three weeks they have dated, and assumed he just wanted to be friends. A heartbroken Brian tries to deal with his loss, but keeps running into Cleveland and Carolyn having sex in various locations. Blaming Stewie for his advice that <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> relationship with Carolyn, Brian is about ready to give up on love. Apologizing for his botched attempt to help him out, Stewie suggests that he can convince Cleveland's ex-wife, Loretta, to reconcile with him.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, {{while he}} was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him {{wandering}} barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet, as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.|$|E
5|$|Jardine's tactics were {{successful}} in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him. At the time, Bradman was in dispute with the Board of Control, who would not allow players to write in newspapers unless journalism was their full-time profession; Bradman, although not a journalist, had a contract to write for the Sydney Sun. A particular irritation for Bradman was that Jack Fingleton, a full-time journalist, was allowed to write for the Telegraph Pictorial, although he required permission from the Board to write about cricket. Bradman threatened {{to withdraw from the}} team unless the Board allowed him to write. Fingleton and Bradman were openly hostile towards each other. From their first meeting while playing together for New South Wales, they disliked each other. Fingleton, conscious that Bradman's self-possession and solitary nature made him unpopular with some teammates, kept his distance after a dressing room argument, while Bradman believed the more popular Fingleton had tried to turn the team against him. Later hostility arose from Bradman's public preference for Bill Brown as a batsman, which Fingleton believed <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> place on the 1934 tour of England. Fingleton's writings on the Bodyline series further soured the relationship. Bradman believed some of the differences stemmed from religion; Fingleton was a Roman Catholic, Bradman an Anglican.|$|E

5|$|The {{knee injury}} {{prevented}} Toshack from playing during the 1948–1949 Australian domestic season. The Australian team to tour South Africa in 1949–50 was named {{at the end}} of the previous season, and Toshack was omitted after a season on the sidelines. At the start of the 1949–50 season, when his Test teammates were sailing across the Indian Ocean to South Africa, Toshack made a strong start to his first-class comeback. He took 4/41 and 5/59 in a Shield match against Queensland in Brisbane, removing Ken Mackay and Wally Grout twice, helping to seal a close 15-run win. In the second match, against Western Australia, Toshack took 4/68 in the first innings before his injury resurfaced. New South Wales won the match despite Toshack's inability to bowl in the second innings. The injury cost Toshack dearly; it forced him to retire from first-class cricket and <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Test recall. Toshack had been offered a position on the South African tour as a reinforcement for Johnston, who had been involved in a car crash. Instead, Miller took the position and played in all five Tests.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, Pettini was {{included}} in England's provisional squad of 30 for the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup, but a loss of form <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> place in the final squad for the tournament.|$|E
25|$|After {{joining the}} Mariners during the 1989 season, Johnson led the AL in walks for three {{consecutive}} seasons (1990–92), and hit batsmen in 1992 and 1993. In July 1991, facing the Milwaukee Brewers, the erratic Johnson allowed 4 runs on 1 hit, thanks to 10 walks in 4 innings. A month later, a 9th-inning single <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics. Johnson suffered another 10-walk, 4-inning start in 1992.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her vacantly. It <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> effort before he could give her the {{attention}} that she had claimed.|$|R

25|$|After the war, Doss {{initially}} {{planned to}} continue his career in carpentry, but extensive damage to his arm left him unable to do so. In 1946, Doss was diagnosed with tuberculosis which he contracted in Leyte. He subsequently underwent treatment for {{five and a half}} years – which <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> lung and five ribs – before being discharged from the hospital in August 1951 with 90% disability.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{started the}} Chase seeded in second place. He started the Chase with a fifth-place finish at Chicago, {{followed}} by a fourth-place finish at New Hampshire. At Dover, Johnson led 243 laps and held off Dale Earnhardt, Jr. over the last 25 laps to win his eighth race at the track, also redeeming himself for the restart line violation that had <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> shot at winning the June race.|$|E
25|$|Cook was a {{prolific}} opening batsman both {{in his native}} South Africa and for Somerset County Cricket Club but South Africa's exclusion from Test cricket <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> significant Test career. He played in all 19 of South Africa's 'unofficial Test matches' against rebel sides. Aged 39 and having waited two decades for an official Test cap, he edged Kapil Dev's opening ball, a late outswinger, to third slip in the First Test between South Africa and India at Durban in November 1992, {{to become the first}} debutant to be dismissed by the first ball of a Test match; Leon Garrick of the West Indies also suffered this fate nine years later.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, with <b>a</b> {{carelessness}} which <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> effort. [...] "But I'm afraid I'm {{not a good}} correspondent. I'm too busy, for one thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Appleby {{smiled a}} little, though it {{apparently}} <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> effort. “Well,” he said, “I’m not burdened with money yet, and I {{think you can}} afford it.” ...|$|R

25|$|In the 2004 Athens Olympics, Haile {{sought to}} become the first man in history to win three {{straight}} Olympic gold medals in the 10,000 metres. He was unable to do so, however, he finished fifth in a race won by his compatriot Kenenisa Bekele, who had broken both of Haile's major track world records, the 5000 metres and the 10,000 metres records. Shortly before the Athens games, Haile was unable to train for three weeks due to inflammation of his Achilles tendon. The injury was severe enough that he would not have competed otherwise, but did so because of significant pressure from his country. This loss of the final period of training likely <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> medal.|$|E
25|$|In January 2001, Rikishi won a Fatal Fourway {{match on}} SmackDown for the #30 {{spot in the}} 2001 Royal Rumble match. There, he {{eliminated}} The Undertaker, and was soon eliminated by The Rock. Haku returned to the WWF in the Rumble, and he and Rikishi formed a tag team and feuded with The Brothers of Destruction, The Dudley Boyz then The Hardy Boyz. The team split while Rikishi was sidelined with an eardrum injury in March. He returned on the May 4 SmackDown and fought The Undertaker to no-contest. On the next Raw, he turned face and gave the Stink Face to Stephanie McMahon after she distracted him, and <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> non-title match with Austin. On May 20, at Judgment Day, he injured his shoulder in the opening bout with William Regal, which caused him to miss {{much of the year}} and the entire Invasion angle.|$|E
25|$|This {{eventually}} <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> point scoring position, as {{the gearbox}} {{went on to}} fail. Countering this was Mansell's impressive 12th-to-first race, even overtaking Senna in the area he excelled most, lapping back markers – an impressive move on a track notorious for mediocre and unpassable races. He went on to compare the race to his win at Silverstone two years earlier and dedicated it to the late Enzo Ferrari, {{a year after the}} Old Man's death. Caffi's race was the exact counterpoint of Mansell's – despite a strong start he finished a lonely seventh, earning no points. Senna finished nearly half a minute behind Mansell in second, while Prost again suffered problems and finished fourth. Patrese retired from the lead and Boutsen finished third. The final two points positions were taken by American Eddie Cheever in the Arrows, finishing 5th, followed by Piquet in 6th.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{going to}} <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> awful lot in marconigrams," [...] Peter said. [...] "By the by, wouldn't {{it have been}} better {{for us to have}} {{travelled}} separately, and incognito?" ...|$|R
60|$|The color {{appeared}} {{to grow a}} trifle warmer in Morales’ cheek, {{and there was a}} faint sparkle in his eyes, but though it seemed to <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> effort he smiled.|$|R
50|$|Bobby Allison {{dominated}} the early {{portion of the}} race. However, they found faulty lug nuts after pitting with two laps in the lead (which <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> almost-guaranteed victory in that race).|$|R
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{prevalent}} off-field occurrences were the actions taken by and against Tank Johnson and Ricky Manning, Jr. On December 14, 2006, Lake County police officers searched Johnson's home in Gurnee, Illinois, and discovered that he possessed six firearms, including two assault rifles. Johnson was charged with violation of probation and possessing unlicensed weapons. A Chicago media storm erupted shortly after when Johnson's bodyguard {{was shot and killed}} December 16, after attending a club with him. Bears coach Lovie Smith deactivated Johnson for the following game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers based on the incidents. Speculation arose in Chicago that the Bears' defensive tackle would not be allowed either legally or by the team to travel to Miami to play in the Super Bowl, but he was ultimately allowed to play. Johnson eventually served 60 days in a Cook County jail because of the charges. Manning Jr. faced a similar situation that <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> one-game suspension. On April 23, 2006, two days after receiving an offer sheet from the Bears, Manning Jr. attacked a man in a Denny's restaurant after teasing him for working on a laptop computer. In September 2006, Manning pleaded no contest to felony assault in exchange for another probation deal, though later he proclaimed his innocence.|$|E
25|$|The race's decisive moment also {{occurred}} on lap eleven. Coming {{out of the}} Melco Hairpin, Vernay fluffed a gear shift, and Mortara moved within half a second of him. At the line, Vernay's lead was 0.4 seconds, Mortara was in his slipstream, and the pass seemed inevitable. Sure enough, Mortara lined him up, and overtook him into Lisboa. Bird took fourth from Ericsson on the same lap, and looked set to finish behind team-mate Bottas; {{a far cry from}} his first-lap exit in 2008 after being taken out by Räikkönen Robertson Racing's Roberto Streit on the run to Mandarin. Mortara cruised to victory, winning by 1.1 seconds ahead of Vernay. Drama struck Bottas on the final lap, when he encountered a problem with one of his wheels. This <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> podium, as both Bird and Ericsson managed to pass him. Merhi had been set for sixth, but hit the barriers at Lisboa on the final lap, and ended up being classified seventeenth. This promoted the second TOM'S car of Iguchi into sixth, ahead of van der Zande, Mäki, Kunimoto and Bianchi, who made the top ten at Merhi's expense, making up eleven positions in fifteen laps. Outside the top ten were García, Huertas, Vanthoor, Saga, Dusseldorp and Arundel. Missing from the list was Sims, who retired on the final lap with a misfire. He was classified behind Merhi in eighteenth and last.|$|E
25|$|At Elimination Chamber, Ryback won {{the vacant}} Intercontinental Championship, his first {{professional}} wrestling championship in WWE, by defeating Sheamus, Dolph Ziggler, R-Truth, King Barrett and Mark Henry in an Elimination Chamber match. The following night, before Ryback {{was scheduled to}} make his first title defense against The Miz; Big Show attacked Miz and confronted Ryback, starting a feud between the two. At Money in the Bank, Big Show defeated Ryback by disqualification after Miz attacked him; Ryback retained the title as a result. Ryback was scheduled to defend the title against Big Show and Miz in a triple threat match at Battleground, but the match was postponed after Ryback developed a staph infection in his knee; the match was rescheduled for SummerSlam, where Ryback pinned The Miz to retain the title. Ryback once again defended his championship against Big Show on the August 31 episode of Raw, where he pinned Show after a distraction from The Miz, and ending the feud. On the September 11 episode of SmackDown, Kevin Owens, {{who was one of}} the lumberjacks, <b>cost</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> win against Seth Rollins. Three days later on the September 14 episode of Raw, it was announced that he would face Owens at Night of Champions for his Intercontinental Championship. Owens won the match by pinfall after he raked Ryback's eyes, ending his reign at 112 days. After initially failing to regain the title using his rematch clause after Owens proceeded to get himself counted out, Ryback defeated Rusev to earn another opportunity at Hell in a Cell, where Ryback failed to regain the championship from Owens, ending the feud.|$|E
