40|$|The {{number of}} {{containers}} handled by container terminals has increased significantly over {{the last fifty years}} and has stimulated researchers to improve storage yard operations. Container handling and crane deployment are two major yard operations that can impact the performance of a whole container terminal. This thesis establishes an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to <b>combine</b> <b>container</b> handling and yard crane deployment for Rubber Tired Gantry Cranes (RTG). Using real world data, we test the ILP for two different yard sizes. We find the resulting ILPs difficult to solve directly. In order to decrease the computation time, we apply a cascade method that solves the problem as a sequence of restricted subproblems. Each subproblem is restricted to a sequence of containers and the output of each subproblem provides an input to the next subproblem. This method provides better solutions than the solution that we get by solving the problem directly. The cascade method also decreases the computation time significantly. The results demonstrate the ability to <b>combine</b> <b>container</b> handling and yard crane deployment in a single model and they verify that the cascade method works well with the ILP.

Big potential in this direction lies in the rationalization of logistical functions of organization, like: transportation, warehousing, interfunctional and interorganizational coordination, etc. One of the possible ways to rationalize firms ’ performance, without any doubt, is industry leaders ’ best practices application. However, to switch from {{the role of the}} follower to the leader it is essential for the organization to foresee future trends, including the field of effective flow management (logistics).

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{container}} loading and contends that <b>combining</b> <b>Container</b> Loading Algorithms (CLAs) with Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is a feasible and useful way of analyzing trade-offs between loading efficiency and various practical considerations {{in relation to}} the cargo- such as its stability, fragility, or possible cross-contamination between items over time. The latter perspective is used to demonstrate the merits of the approach. More specifically, the paper considers a situation where the items involved have differing degrees of perishability and badly deteriorated items can affect others (e. g., through mold spreading). The output of the CLAs is used to create agents that simulate the spread of mold through proximity-based interactions. The results show the trade-offs between container utilization and the propagation of mold and demonstrate that there is not necessarily any correlation between these two factors. The key contribution of the research is the multi-methodology agent-based approach to container loading. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{rectangle}} packing {{problems we}} are given the task of placing axis-aligned rectangles in a given plane region, {{so that they do}} not overlap with each other. In Maximum Weight Independent Set of Rectangles (MWISR), their position is given and we can only select which rectangles to choose, while trying to maximize their total weight. In Strip Packing (SP), we have to pack all the given rectangles in a rectangular region of fixed width, while minimizing its height. In 2 -Dimensional Geometric Knapsack (2 DGK), the target region is a square of a given size, and our goal is to select and pack a subset of the given rectangles of maximum weight. We study a generalization of MWISR and use it to improve the approximation for a resource allocation problem called bagUFP. We revisit some classical results on SP and 2 DGK, by proposing a framework based on smaller containers that are packed with simpler rules; while variations of this scheme are indeed a standard technique in this area, we abstract away some of the problem-specific differences, obtaining simpler algorithms that work for different problems. We obtain improved approximations for SP in pseudo-polynomial time, and for a variant of 2 DGK where one can to rotate the rectangles by 90. For the latter, we propose the first algorithms with approximation factor better than 2. For the main variant of 2 DGK (without rotations), a container-based approach seems to face a natural barrier of 2 in the approximation factor. Thus, we consider a generalized kind of packing that <b>combines</b> <b>container</b> packings with another packing problem that we call L-packing problem, where we have to pack rectangles in an L-shaped region of the plane.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} describe the pasteurization, by hot filling, of fruit purees.

Specific filling temperatures <b>combined</b> with <b>container</b> dimensions are required to achieve a target pasteurization value.

Several simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of filling temperature, container shape, type of cooling medium and pasteurization value on final quality retention expressed as vitamin C retention.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) {{depends on their}} ability to collect contextual data from various sources and appropriately generate and transport comprehensible, reliable and timely content to users. In such applications, the exchanged content is structured in space and time.

However, a closer analysis of the available Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) protocols shows that the structure of the data gets lost and its short liveness leads to high signalling traffic.

We cultured eleven different stock-types of Pinus halepensis Mill. and Pinus pinea L. by <b>combining</b> different <b>container</b> capacities and nursery fertilization regimes; all stock-types were then outplanted under varying ecological conditions. Container capacity mainly determined pre-planting morphology, production costs and post-planting growth of the different stock-types.

Additional late season fertilization enhanced post-planting performance on all the sites and for both species. In general, the optimum stock-type for both species was that resulting from propagation in medium size containers (300 cm(3)) with additional late season fertilization, because this minimized cost per living seedling and per stem volume after three years in the field. These results reveal the importance of late season fertilization as an inexpensive tool to improve field performance and establish an operational limit to increasing stock-type size in Mediterranean pine species.
