5|$|The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily {{absent in}} a number of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that {{consists}} of mainly chitin and <b>conchiolin</b> (a protein hardened with calcium carbonate), except the outermost layer in almost all cases is all <b>conchiolin</b> (see periostracum). Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the questionable exception of Cobcrephora.|$|E
5|$|The spire is a {{protruding}} part of {{the shell}} that includes all of the whorls except the largest and final whorl (known as the body whorl). It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails, such as the closely related and larger goliath conch, Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil. In L.gigas, the glossy finish or glaze around the aperture of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink. It may show a cream, peach or yellow colouration, {{but it can also}} sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta, shading almost to red. The periostracum, a layer of protein (<b>conchiolin)</b> that is the outermost {{part of the}} shell surface, is thin and a pale brown or tan colour.|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present {{on the outside of the}} shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (<b>conchiolin)</b> that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Conchiolins</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as conchins) are complex proteins which are secreted by a mollusc's outer epithelium (the mantle).|$|R
5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a <b>conchiolin.</b> The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominantly}} blue-green iridescent {{shell of}} abalone (or paua; genus Haliotis) is one last possible imitation. Abalone shell is inexpensive and plentiful {{owing to the}} commercial mariculture of these gastropods for their meat. The shell's structure is distinctive: sinuous bands of blue, green, and rose iridescence are delineated by dark brown lines of <b>conchiolin,</b> a proteinaceous material that holds the shell together. The luster of abalone shell is silky rather than the near vitreous luster of polished ammolite, and {{the colors of the}} two materials do not closely approximate. However, some abalone shell has been dyed and given a transparent cap of synthetic quartz, forming a doublet in the same fashion as ammolite. These doublets are perhaps the most deceptive, and have also been used to imitate opal. Under magnification most abalone doublets will show dye concentrated along certain areas and air bubbles trapped at the shell-quartz interface.|$|E
500|$|Shells {{from both}} marine and land organisms consist {{almost entirely of}} calcium carbonate, either as {{aragonite}} or as calcite, or some mixture of the two. Calcium carbonate is very susceptible to dissolving and recrystallizing; the recrystallized material will contain carbon from the sample's environment, which may be of geological origin. [...] If testing recrystallized shell is unavoidable, it is sometimes possible to identify the original shell material from a sequence of tests. [...] It is also possible to test <b>conchiolin,</b> an organic protein found in shell, but it constitutes only 1â€“2% of shell material.|$|E
50|$|This {{shell layer}} is {{composed}} of a type of protein known as <b>conchiolin.</b> <b>Conchiolin</b> is largely composed of quinone-tanned proteins, which {{are similar to those}} found in the epidermal cuticle.|$|E
50|$|The calcium {{carbonate}} layers in a shell are generally of two types: an outer, chalk-like prismatic layer and an inner pearly, lamellar or nacreous layer. The layers usually incorporate a substance called <b>conchiolin,</b> often {{in order to}} help bind the {{calcium carbonate}} crystals together. <b>Conchiolin</b> is composed largely of quinone-tanned proteins.|$|E
50|$|The sclerites of Chrysomallon squamiferum {{are mainly}} {{proteinaceous}} (<b>conchiolin</b> {{is a complex}} protein); in contrast, the sclerites of chitons are mainly calcareous. There are no visible growth lines of <b>conchiolin</b> in cross-sections of sclerites. No other extant or extinct gastropods possess dermal sclerites, and no other extant animal is known to use iron sulfides in this way, either in its skeleton, or exoskeleton.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{specimens}} of Oxygyrus keraudreni have an uncalcified shell of <b>conchiolin</b> {{in the adult}} stage. Janssen (2007) have found an indication that, during the Pliocene, individuals of this species were yet further calcified than are extant specimens. This could point to a developmental trend involving a reduction of calcareous matter {{in the course of}} time, as a gradual weight reduction beneficial for holoplanktonic life. The distinct peripheral belt demonstrates that a <b>conchiolin</b> keel was present.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{providing}} a matrix {{into which the}} hard calcium carbonate part of the shell is precipitated, many species of mollusks (such as the land snail shown above) also have an outer shell layer called the periostracum which is composed of the protein <b>conchiolin.</b> Some land snails (especially the taxa that have become adapted to living on acidic soils) have very thin, transparent, tan-colored shells, even as adults, and those shells are composed entirely of <b>conchiolin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{gastropod}} shell {{has three}} major layers secreted by the mantle. The calcareous central layer, the ostracum, is typically made of calcium carbonate precipitated into an organic matrix known as <b>conchiolin.</b> The outermost layer is the periostracum which is resistant to abrasion and provides most shell coloration. The {{body of the}} snail contacts the innermost smooth layer that may be composed of mother-of-pearl or shell nacre, a dense horizontally packed form of <b>conchiolin,</b> which is layered upon the periostracum as the snail grows.|$|E
50|$|Natural pearls {{are nearly}} 100% calcium {{carbonate}} and <b>conchiolin.</b> It {{is thought that}} natural pearls form under a set of accidental conditions when a microscopic intruder or parasite enters a bivalve mollusk and settles inside the shell. The mollusk, irritated by the intruder, forms a pearl sac of external mantle tissue cells and secretes the calcium carbonate and <b>conchiolin</b> to cover the irritant. This secretion process is repeated many times, thus producing a pearl. Natural pearls come in many shapes, with perfectly round ones being comparatively rare.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell is}} coiled dextrally (i.e. clockwise). The thin, double-walled keel {{of the shell}} extends outward from the last shell whorl. The apex of the shell is found on the right side, the {{umbilicus}} on the left side. The shell and keel can be calcareous (genus Atlanta), or composed exclusively of <b>conchiolin</b> (genus Oxygyrus), or the shell can be calcareous and its keel composed of <b>conchiolin</b> (genus Protatlanta). The snails of this family can retract into their shell and close {{it off with a}} cartilaginous, flexible operculum.|$|E
50|$|The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily {{absent in}} a number of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that {{consists}} of mainly chitin and <b>conchiolin</b> (a protein hardened with calcium carbonate), except the outermost layer in almost all cases is all <b>conchiolin</b> (see periostracum). Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the questionable exception of Cobcrephora.While most mollusc shells are composed mainly of aragonite, those gastropods that lay eggs with a hard shell use calcite (sometimes with traces of aragonite) to construct the eggshells.|$|E
50|$|The {{shells of}} most {{molluscs}} {{are made of}} calcium carbonate (the main constituent of limestone and chalk), and of <b>conchiolin,</b> a protein. For more information, see Mollusc shell.|$|E
50|$|These snails {{all have}} a coiled shell present in their larval stage. But the shell is no longer present in the Pterotracheidae after metamorphosis. The keel (sharp ridge on a whorl of the shell) of the adult shell extends {{outwards}} in the Atlantidae and anteriorly in Carinariidae. The shell is calcareous in the Carinariidae. In the Atlantidae, however, the shell and the keel can be calcareous (genus Atlanta) or the shell calcareous and its keel composed of <b>conchiolin</b> (genus Protatlanta), or the shell composed exclusively of <b>conchiolin</b> (genus Oxygyrus). Only the Atlantidae can retract into their shell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Conchiolin</b> {{serves as}} a {{relatively}} flexible, crack-deflecting matrix for the mineral aggregate particles; its strength and the strong bonding of perlucin can in some cases (such as {{in the formation of}} nacre) give the finished material an impressive level of toughness.|$|E
50|$|In {{many species}} of {{molluscs}} the epidermis of the mantle secretes calcium carbonate and <b>conchiolin,</b> and creates a shell. In sea slugs there is a progressive loss of the shell and the mantle becomes the dorsal surface of the animal.|$|E
50|$|Oxygyrus keraudreni (along with Atlanta peronii) attains {{the largest}} size (shell {{diameter}} to 10 mm) among the Atlantidae. Body coloration is light bluish-purple, with the color darkening with age. The larval shell is calcareous and displays a distinctive pattern of zigzag-shaped spiral ridges that are evenly spaced {{and cover the}} shell surface. The teleoconch is composed of <b>conchiolin,</b> a transparent cartilaginous material, and its surface lacks sculpture. With growth the teleoconch overgrows the protoconch and eventually surrounds it. A shell spire, as seen in all other atlantids, is lacking and the spire region is termed involute. The <b>conchiolin</b> keel is glass-like and has a truncate anterior edge that ends at the shell aperture.|$|E
50|$|In {{habitats}} {{where there}} is not enough calcium carbonate to build a really solid shell, such as on some acidic soils on land, there are still various species of slugs, and also some snails with a thin translucent shell, mostly or entirely composed of the protein <b>conchiolin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The mollusk's mantle (protective membrane) {{deposits}} {{layers of}} calcium carbonate (CaCO3) {{in the form}} of the mineral aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite (polymorphs with the same chemical formula, but different crystal structures) held together by an organic horn-like compound called <b>conchiolin.</b> The combination of aragonite and <b>conchiolin</b> is called nacre, which makes up mother-of-pearl. The commonly held belief that a grain of sand acts as the irritant is in fact rarely the case. Typical stimuli include organic material, parasites, or even damage that displaces mantle tissue to another part of the mollusk's body. These small particles or organisms gain entry when the shell valves are open for feeding or respiration. In cultured pearls, the irritant is typically an introduced piece of the mantle epithelium, with or without a spherical bead (beaded or beadless cultured pearls).|$|E
50|$|A well-equipped gem testing {{laboratory}} can distinguish natural pearls from cultured pearls by using gemological X-ray equipment {{to examine the}} center of a pearl. With X-rays it is possible to see the growth rings of the pearl, where the layers of calcium carbonate are separated by thin layers of <b>conchiolin.</b> The differentiation of natural pearls from non-beaded cultured pearls can be very difficult without the use of this X-ray technique.|$|E
50|$|The word corneous is {{also often}} used to {{describe}} the operculum of a snail, a gastropod mollusc. Not all gastropods have opercula, but in the great majority of those that do have one, the operculum is corneous. (However in several genera within a few families including the marine Naticidae and the terrestrial Pomatiidae, the operculum is primarily calcareous, in other words mostly made of calcium carbonate.) Corneous opercula are made out of the protein <b>conchiolin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} it is not {{possible}} to find samples that are free of recrystallization, acid washes of increasing strength, followed by dating part of the sample after each wash, can be used: the dates obtained from each sample will vary with the degree of contamination, but when the contaminated layers are removed, consecutive measurements will be consistent with each other. It is also possible to test <b>conchiolin,</b> which is an organic protein found in shell, but this only constitutes 1-2% of shell material.|$|E
50|$|A pearl {{is formed}} when the mantle tissue is injured by a parasite, {{an attack of}} a fish or another event that damages the {{external}} fragile rim of the shell of a mollusk shell bivalve or gastropod. In response, the mantle tissue of the mollusk secretes nacre into the pearl sac, a cyst that forms during the healing process. Chemically speaking, this is calcium carbonate and a fibrous protein called <b>conchiolin.</b> As the nacre builds up in layers of minute aragonite tablets, it fills the growing pearl sac and eventually forms a pearl.|$|E
50|$|These hairs {{can reach}} varying densities (up to 20 per squaremilimetre) and lengths (up to three millimetres). In some cases hardly visible, they confer an almost furry {{impression}} to the shell in others. These semi-rigid structures {{are part of}} the periostracum, a thin protein layer (<b>conchiolin)</b> secreted by the snail to cover the calcareous shell. Building hairs requires the snail to have specialised glandular tissue and complex strategies to form them. Consequently, this trait can be assumed to be costly and should thus present a selective advantage to its bearers in order to be conserved.|$|E

50|$|Protatlanta rotundata differs {{considerably}} from {{the type of}} the genus, Protatlanta souleyeti. Not only does the adult shell in Protatlanta rotundata reach a diameter that is roughly five times that of Protatlanta souleyeti, but the morphology of its protoconch and {{the shape of the}} fully grown shell are utterly different. Also, as both species occur together in the Pangasinan samples, Protatlanta rotundata can certainly not be considered to be the ancestor species. The presence of a subperipheral belt much the same as in Protatlanta souleyeti, on the other hand, demonstrates that a <b>conchiolin</b> keel has been present in this species.|$|E
50|$|Recent Atlantidae, in {{the present}} concept, {{comprise}} three genera, two of which, Oxygyrus Benson, 1835, and Protatlanta Tesch, 1908, are considered monospecific. In Protatlanta, however, a few additional fossil species have been described. Both genera are characterised by partially uncalcified (<b>conchiolin)</b> shell portions. Additional fossil genera considered to belong in the Atlantidae are Bellerophina dâ€™Orbigny, 1843 (Cretaceous), Eoatlanta Cossmann, 1888 (Paleocene-Eocene) and Mioatlanta di Geronimo, 1974 (Miocene). Only few Atlanta species are known from the fossil record, the oldest one being Atlanta arenularia Gougerot & Braillon, 1965 is from the Bartonian of the Paris Basin, which differs considerably from typical Atlanta by its cornucopia shape.|$|E

50|$|Most molluscs, {{including}} land snails, have a shell {{which is}} part of their anatomy since the larval stage, and which grows with them in size by the process of secreting calcium carbonate along the open edge and on the inner side for extra strength. Although some land snails create shells that are almost entirely formed from the protein <b>conchiolin,</b> most land snails need a good supply of calcium in their diet and environment to produce a strong shell. A lack of calcium, or low pH in their surroundings, can result in thin, cracked, or perforated shells. Usually a snail can repair damage to its shell over time if its living conditions improve, but severe damage can be fatal.When retracted into their shells, many snails with gills (including some terrestrial species) are able to protect themselves with a door-like anatomical structure called an operculum.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite.

The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
50|$|In this species, {{the sides}} of the snail's foot are {{extremely}} unusual, in that they are armoured with hundreds of iron-mineralised sclerites; these are composed of iron sulfides greigite and pyrite. Each sclerite has a soft epithelial tissue core, a <b>conchiolin</b> cover, and an uppermost layer containing pyrite and greigite. Prior to the discovery of the scaly-foot gastropod, it was thought that the only extant molluscs possessing scale-like structures were in the classes Caudofoveata, Solenogastres and Polyplacophora. Sclerites are not homologous to a gastropod operculum. The sclerites of scaly-foot gastropods are also not homologous to the sclerites found in chitons (Polyplacophora). It has been hypothesized that the sclerites of Cambrian halwaxiids such as Halkieria may potentially be more analogous to the sclerites of this snail than are the sclerites of chitons or aplacophorans. As recently as 2015, detailed morphological analysis for testing this hypothesis had not been carried out.|$|E
