40|$|Mixed fruit-vegetable {{cropping}} systems are a promising way of ensuring environmentally sustainable agricultural production systems {{in response to}} the challenge of being able to fulfill local market requirements. Indeed, they combine productions and they make a better use of biodiversity. These agroforestry systems are based on a complex set of interactions modifying the utilization of light, water and nutrients. Thus, designing such a system must optimize the use of these resources: by maximizing positive interactions (facilitation) and minimizing negative ones (competition). To attain these objectives, the system’s design has to include the spatial and temporal dimensions, taking into account the evolution of above- and belowground interactions over a time horizon. For that, we define the Mixed Fruit-Vegetable Crop Allocation Problem (MFVCAP) using a discrete representation of the land and the interactions between vegetable crops and fruit trees. First, we give a direct formulation as a binary quadratic program (BQP). Then we reformulate the problem using a Benders decomposition approach. The master problem has 0 / 1 binary variables and deals with tree positioning. The subproblem deals with <b>crop</b> <b>quantities.</b> The BQP objective function becomes linear in the continuous subproblem by exploiting the fact that it depends only on the quantity of crops assigned to land units having shade, root, or nothing. This problem decomposition allows us to reformulate the MFVCAP into a Mixed Integer linear Program (MIP). The detailed spatial-temporal crop allocation plan is easy to obtain after solving the MIP. Experimental results show the efficiency of our approach compared to a direct solving of the original BQP formulation...|$|E

During that period, Qingdao and Dalian were chosen as sites for urban reclaimed water used for agriculture irrigation pilots. In 2008, there was 16.6 billion m 3 of reclaimed water, comprising 8 % of total urban wastewater emissions. Of this, 4.8 billion m 3 reclaimed water was used for agricultural irrigation, some 28.9 % of the total amount. Although Reuse of Urban Recycling Water—Quality of Farmland Irrigation Water and other related rules set standards for urban recycling water used in agricultural irrigation, the recycled water still had {{a negative effect on}} agriculture production.

40|$|Accurate {{localisation}} of crop remains highly challenging in unstructured environments such as farms. Many of {{the developed}} systems still rely {{on the use of}} hand selected features for crop identification and often neglect the estimation of <b>crop</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality, which is key to assigning labor during farming processes. To alleviate these limitations we present a robotic vision system that can accurately estimate {{the quantity and quality of}} sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L), a key horticultural crop. This system consists of three parts: detection, quality estimation, and tracking. Efficient detection is achieved using the FasterRCNN framework. Quality is then estimated in the same framework by learning a parallel layer which we show experimentally results in superior performance than treating quality as extra classes in the traditional Faster-RCNN framework. Evaluation of these two techniques outlines the improved performance of the parallel layer, where we achieve an F 1 score of 77. 3 for the parallel technique yet only 72. 5 for the best scoring (red) of the multi-class implementation. To track the crop we present a tracking via detection approach, which uses the FasterRCNN with parallel layers, that is also a vision-only solution. This approach is cheap to implement as it only requires a camera and in experiments across 2 days we show that our proposed system can accurately estimate the number of sweet pepper present, within 4. 1 % of the ground truth...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{prices for}} energy, fertiliser and feed concentrates, {{it is becoming}} increasingly important for farmers to produce high quality feed while minimising costs. For a Swedish farm, costs for machinery make up about 25 % of the production costs. The economic consequences of performing a field operation at non-optimal time are called timeliness costs. They are caused by reductions in crop value and can be reduced by increasing machine capacity. To improve the basis for optimal selection of field machinery in agriculture, methods were developed and applied for calculation of timeliness costs in terms of <b>crop</b> quality and <b>quantity</b> losses at non-optimum operation times. Timeliness costs for grain that accounted for <b>crop</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality losses at delayed sowing and harvesting were higher per kg for organic grain than for conventional. The main differences in timeliness costs resulted from two counteracting factors – lower yields and higher product prices in organic production. Higher timeliness costs resulted in a larger combine harvester with higher capacity being economically optimal for the organic system. A method was developed for valuing forage for milk production with respect to crop yield increases and feed value decreases due to delayed time of harvesting. The results showed significantly higher timeliness cost factors in € per ha and day for the first cut compared with regrowth. Timeliness cost factors also varied greatly between years. Harvesting costs in terms of timeliness were calculated for different machinery systems and capacities. Harvesting costs decreased with increasing forage area up to a certain threshold area, beyond which decreasing machine costs were outweighed by increasing timeliness costs due to longer duration of harvest. Using machine contractors or machine cooperatives decreased harvesting costs, particularly for small forage areas, due to increased annual use of the machines. However, to avoid high timeliness costs delays in harvesting must be avoided. Forage was also valued in terms of biogas production by accounting for changes in yield and methane production with varying cutting date. Timeliness costs were small as long as harvesting was not delayed. Matching capacity to requirements is important in avoiding costly overcapacity and minimising costs...|$|R

40|$|Climate change {{presents}} {{a range of}} challenges for animal agriculture in Australia. Livestock production {{will be affected by}} changes in temperature and water availability through impacts on pasture and forage <b>crop</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality, feed-grain production and price, and disease and pest distributions. This paper provides an overview of these impacts and the broader effects on landscape functionality, with a focus on recent research on effects of increasing temperature, changing rainfall patterns, and increased climate variability on animal health, growth, and reproduction, including through heat stress, and potential adaptation strategies. The rate of adoption of adaptation strategies by livestock producers will depend on perceptions of the uncertainty in projected climate and regional-scale impacts and associated risk. However, management changes adopted by farmers in parts of Australia during recent extended drought and associated heatwaves, trends consistent with long-term predicted climate patterns, provide some insights into the capacity for practical adaptation strategies. Animal production systems will also be significantly affected by climate change policy and national targets to address greenhouse gas emissions, since livestock are estimated to contribute ~ 10 % of Australia’s total emissions and 8 – 11 % of global emissions, with additional farm emissions associated with activities such as feed production. More than two-thirds of emissions are attributed to ruminant animals. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities facing livestock industries in Australia in adapting to and mitigating climate change. It examines the research needed to better define practical options to reduce the emissions intensity of livestock products, enhance adaptation opportunities, and support the continued contribution of animal agriculture to Australia’s economy, environment, and regional communities...|$|R

40|$|As {{energy crop}} {{production}} on European croplands expands, driven by accelerating consumption of bioenergy, {{there is a}} pressing need to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with this production. The present study considers on-going yield increases {{as a means of}} boosting agricultural output which results in a limited need to convert nature areas and grasslands to additional cropland. For nine land-use variants, the study evaluates cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, net organic carbon fluxes from the soil, and abated emissions achieved by replacing fossil fuels for transport with biofuels. The main finding is that, in European agriculture, it is possible to combine large-scale biomass production with food production sustained at current levels, with limited direct or indirect land-use changes and while accomplishing significant net greenhouse gas mitigation. Maintaining the current (business as usual) agricultural system results in 4. 9 GtCO 2 -eq. of cumulative emissions by 2030. Intensifi ed food production and energy crop production on freed cropland combined with mitigation measure implementation signifi cantly reduces cumulative emissions for the annual crop groups of oil, starch and sugarbeet to 1. 9, 1. 5 and 2. 1 GtCO 2 -eq., respectively. By 2030, perennial energy crop production can mitigate cumulative emissions to a large extent, reaching negative emissions (i. e. net sequestration) for grass and wood crops of – 3. 3 and – 4. 5 GtCO 2 -eq., respectively. For the variants compared to the baseline, nitrous oxide emissions will increase modestly due to higher fertilizer-application rates, though at improved effi ciencies per unit <b>crop</b> <b>quantity</b> produced. Emission mitigation results partly from the temporary increase in SOC sequestration though mainly from replacement of fossil resources by biomass resources.

I found differences in primary dormancy among populations of S. nigrum collected on two dates and in different locations. Fresh seeds of S. nigrum were conditionally dormant and germinated at higher alternating temperatures and in light, while seeds of S. physalifolum were deeply dormant. Seed dormancy is reduced during autumn, winter and early spring in seeds buried in the soil. The rate of dormancy release and induction is low at lower temperatures and increases as the temperature rises. High temperatures cause short-lasting breakage of dormancy followed by induction. Short-lasting dormancy induction in spring is likely to delay emergence of the species. Seedling emergence of both species showed a bi- or three-modal pattern during an extended period in late spring and early summer. This enables the species to survive natural catastrophes or escape weed control operations. This information can be used to maximize the efficacy of weed management strategies by timing weed control tactics to coincide with seedling flushes. Dormancy is mainly induced during summer due to higher temperatures. This prevents seedlings from emerging too late and being killed by frost in autumn before reproduction...|$|R
