500|$|At {{least five}} {{species have been}} given {{scientific}} names honoring Colbert. In 2008 a species of <b>California</b> <b>trapdoor</b> <b>spider</b> was named Aptostichus stephencolberti. The spider was named for Colbert after he reported on his television series that Jason Bond, a {{professor of biology at}} East Carolina University, had named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after the Canadian rock star Neil Young, and began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him. On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, [...] "And all I had to do was shamelessly beg on national television." [...] Other species named for Colbert include a species of Venezuelan diving beetle named Agaporomorphus colberti and a Chilean stonefly named Diamphipnoa colberti, both formally described in 2008. On his 45th birthday, Colbert was sent a framed print of his eponymous beetle by the biologists who named it. In 2014, a species of parasitic wasp from Ecuador, Aleiodes colberti, was named for Colbert, along with newly described species named for celebrities Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Ellen DeGeneres, and Shakira, and in 2016 a rove beetle, Sonoma colberti, was named after Colbert's on-screen persona.|$|E
