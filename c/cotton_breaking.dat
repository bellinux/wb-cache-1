40|$|Abstract. The surface {{modification}} process for cotton fabric which was oxidized first, and then crosslinked with collagen was studied. The optimum oxidation process was as follows: concentration of sodium periodate 0. 6 g/L, time 2. 5 h, temperature 40 ˚C, ratio {{of water and}} cotton fabric was 100 : 1. The method for {{surface modification}} of cotton fabric was determined from comparative analysis, and the optimum process: collagen solution concentration 6 %, glutaraldehyde concentration 5 %, reaction 40 min at 30 ˚C, ratio of water and cotton fabric was 100 : 1. Compared with original <b>cotton</b> fabric，the <b>breaking</b> strength and elongation of collagen modified cotton fabric decreased, while the dyeing percentage with acid dyes was increased and this means the surface of modified cotton fabric {{was covered with a}} large component of collagen...|$|R
50|$|Wrinkles form {{in cotton}} fabrics {{due to the}} free {{hydroxyl}} groups. Cotton {{is a form of}} cellulose chains linked to form firm three-dimensional structures that offer both tensile strength and flexibility due to their carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bond based backbone. Since cellulose is composed of glucose units, cyclic carbohydrate molecules, cellulose has free hydroxyl groups (-OH) projecting from each monomeric subunit. These hydroxyl groups tend form hydrogen-bonds to neighboring hydroxyl groups. When the fabric is stressed either by heat or pressure, the original hydrogen bonds in the <b>cotton</b> fabric <b>break</b> and reform with nearby atoms at random. This re-forming of the hydrogen bonds, known as cross linking, is the reason for wrinkles, or creases, in the fabric. DMEU works to prevent these wrinkles by covalently bonding to two free hydroxyl groups in the fabric through a dehydration reaction that is not as easily broken as the hydrogen bond before treatment.|$|R
25|$|Kathy and {{her husband}} Pete Beale (Peter Dean) are financially stable. Kathy works as a barmaid in The Queen Victoria pub with her best friend, Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), whilst helping Pete on their fruit and veg stall. Kathy feels she has put her troubled past behind her but Nick <b>Cotton</b> (John Altman) <b>breaks</b> into Dr Harold Legg's (Leonard Fenton) surgery and steals Kathy's medical records. He discovers that she gave a child, Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), the product of rape when Kathy was 14, up for adoption. Nick uses this to {{blackmail}} her, which eventually forces her to tell Pete her secret and he reacts badly.|$|R
5|$|Crompton's damp climate {{provided}} the ideal conditions for cotton spinning {{to be carried}} out without the <b>cotton</b> drying and <b>breaking,</b> and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market. When suitable land in nearby Oldham (then the largest and most productive mill town in the world) had become scarce in the 1860s, there was a mill building boom in Shaw and Crompton, giving rise to the area as major mill town. The local townscape became dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills, and its former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a single town around these factories. Shaw and Crompton railway station and a goods yard was opened in 1863, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Royton had begun to encroach upon the township's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Oldham, Lees and Chadderton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.|$|R
40|$|How can the {{elongation}} {{measurement of}} the high volume instrument (HVI) be improved? A paper index card is clamped by the HVI breaker system and {{used to measure the}} system deflection as a function of load. This measured response is then used to correct the stress-strain response of <b>cotton</b> bundle <b>breaks.</b> The elongation of the cotton fibers {{at the peak of the}} curve is calculated from the corrected curve. A test group of 18 cottons was measured and compared to Mantis ® single-fiber data. The USDA crop samples from 1990 to 1994 were also measured using the modified HVI method, and the new results compared to standard HVI measurements. The modified analysis of the stress-strain curve based on the index card deflection produced a measurement for elongation that was more precise and had a lower standard deviation, compared to standard measurements on the HVI. Comparisons with simulated curves generated from Mantis® single-fiber data showed similar levels of elongation. However, both the modified HVI and Mantis® results were almost double stelometer elongation values. Correlations with stelometer data give a slope of approximately one with an offset of approximately 5 %. In all cases when measurements made on the 1990 to 1994 USDA crop samples were incorporated as predictors in yarn models, the new HVI elongation measurement proved to be a better predictor of yarn properties than were stelometer elongation data. Cotton fiber elongation (extensibility, elongation at breaking load) is one of the least utilized measurements from the high volume instrument (HVI) ...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to joining Kingdom Come, Stag {{played in}} L.A. based bands Population 5, and WWIII; along with future Kingdom Come bandmate, Johnny B. Frank, a former {{keyboard}} player for Josie <b>Cotton.</b> Stag's big <b>break</b> {{in the music}} industry came shortly after his good friend Johnny B. Frank was chosen to play in Lenny Wolf's new band Kingdom Come. Wolf had asked Frank if he knew any blues guitarists and Frank recommended Stag. At the audition, Wolf asked Stag to improvise a solo for their upcoming single, [...] "What Love Can Be," [...] which resulted in Stag landing the lead guitar duties for Kingdom Come. The band's debut album Kingdom Come quickly climbed the billboard charts peaking at number 12, with worldwide sales greatly exceeding one million copies. Kingdom Come were one of five bands selected (Scorpions, Metallica, Van Halen, and Dokken, the others) to appear on the Monsters of Rock Tour 1988. Of the several tour dates included a stop in Stag's hometown of Pittsburgh, where the band played in front of over 30,000 people at the Three Rivers Stadium. The band capped off a busy 1988 with a show headlined by Bon Jovi in Tokyo on December 31.|$|R
40|$|The {{conservation}} of historic tapestries {{is a complex}} and highly skilled task. Tapestries now being woven will need conservation in years to come. Can we, by understanding the properties of these contemporary works, assist the conservators of the future? The recreation of the Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries being undertaken by the West Dean Tapestry Studio offers {{a unique opportunity to}} access the materials being used and to create a body of data on their initial properties. This study uses tensile testing of the warp and weft materials to determine their maximum load at break, extension at maximum load, and specific stress (tenacity). Wool weft yarns from two different sources and of two thicknesses were examined. These wools were dyed ‘in house’ and the effect of the different dyes used was also assessed. These parameters all showed some significant (P < 0. 05) differences. Cotton warp yarns of differing thickness and a gold thread were also tested. The comparison of how <b>cotton</b> and wool <b>break</b> demonstrates that when a tapestry is put under sufficient stress the cotton will snap but the wool may only stretch. However, this could often be beyond its recovery range resulting in a failure to return to shape...|$|R

Together with Oldham, at its peak the area was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.Supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861-65, leading to the formation of the Royton Local Board of Health in 1863, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality. On 26 November 1884 an explosive device containing gunpowder was detonated in Royton Town Hall, in a cellar underneath the offices of Royton's local board. An anonymous communication was received by the supposed bomber, stating that he intended the explosion for the Royton School Board because children are not allowed to work at the age of 10 years, and because he wanted the abolition of the Factory Acts. There were no fatalities caused by the explosion, and damage to the building was restricted to smoke damage and shattered windows, doors and woodwork. The Great Depression, and First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline in Royton. However, in as late the 1950s, 80% of Royton's population was employed in the textile mills. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns increased during the mid-20th century, Royton's textile sector declined gradually to a halt; cotton spinning reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Less than a dozen mills are still standing in Royton, the majority of which are now used for light engineering or as distribution centres.|$|R
