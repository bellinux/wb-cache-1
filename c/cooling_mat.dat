6000|$|There {{was nothing}} to be done. Times were changed. So changed that, when a Spanish frigate {{appeared}} before the island and a demand was sent to the Sultan to deliver Omar and his companions, Babalatchi was not surprised to hear {{that they were going to}} be made the victims of political expediency. But from that sane appreciation of danger to tame submission was a very long step. And then began Omar's second flight. It began arms in hand, for the little band had to fight in the night on the beach for the possession of the small canoes in which those that survived got away at last. The story of that escape lives in the hearts of brave men even to this day. They talk of Babalatchi and of the strong woman who carried her blind father through the surf under the fire of the warship from the north. The companions of that piratical and son-less Aeneas are dead now, but their ghosts wander over the waters and the islands at night--after the manner of ghosts--and haunt the fires by which sit armed men, as is meet for the spirits of fearless warriors who died in battle. There they may hear the story of their own deeds, of their own courage, suffering and death, on the lips of living men. That story is told in many places. On the <b>cool</b> <b>mats</b> in breezy verandahs of Rajahs' houses it is alluded to disdainfully by impassive statesmen, but amongst armed men that throng the courtyards it is a tale which stills the murmur of voices and the tinkle of anklets; arrests the passage of the siri-vessel, and fixes the eyes in absorbed gaze.

40|$|Realistic {{prediction}} of asphalt temperatures {{as a function}} of time during paving is essential for optimizing compaction operations. Continued compaction after the asphalt lift has dropped below a critical threshold temperature may result in particle breakage and degradation of the material properties. To address this issue, this study evaluates the feasibility of using Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) based Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to measure HMA temperatures via wireless sensors during paving. The survivability and temperature measurement capabilities of the SAW RFID sensors are demonstrated in the field. The measured asphalt cooling curves (temperature versus time) are compared with predictions from previously developed theoretical models for <b>mat</b> <b>cooling.</b> The prediction accuracy of these models is improved via a field calibration procedure using measured temperatures from the SAW RFID sensors. The predictions from the calibrated theoretical model are reasonable and agree well with the measured temperatures in the field...|$|R
60|$|A little {{apart in}} the main avenue of Rotoava, in a low hut of leaves that opened on a small enclosure, like a pigsty on a pen, an old man dwelt solitary with his aged wife. Perhaps they were too old to migrate with the others; perhaps they were too poor, and had no {{possessions}} to dispute. At least they had remained behind; and it thus befell that they were invited to my feast. I dare say {{it was quite a}} piece of politics in the pigsty whether to come or not to come, and the husband long swithered between curiosity and age, till curiosity conquered, and they came, {{and in the midst of}} that last merry-making death tapped him on the shoulder. For some days, when the sky was bright and the wind <b>cool,</b> his <b>mat</b> would be spread in the main highway of the village, and he was to be seen lying there inert, a mere handful of man, his wife inertly seated by his head. They seemed to have outgrown alike our needs and faculties; they neither spoke nor listened; they suffered us to pass without a glance; the wife did not fan, she seemed not to attend upon her husband, and the two poor antiques sat juxtaposed under the high canopy of palms, the human tragedy reduced to its bare elements, a sight beyond pathos, stirring a thrill of curiosity. And yet there was one touch of the pathetic haunted me: that so much youth and expectation should have run in these starved veins, and the man should have squandered all his lees of life on a pleasure party.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Mid-Pliocene low-latitude Pacific faunal (planktic foraminifer) {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} (SST) estimates are normally {{based upon the}} Modern Analog Technique (MAT). In the Eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP), where upwelling of <b>cool</b> water predominates, <b>MAT</b> {{can be used to}} discern both cooling and warming in Neogene records. SST today is ~ 30 °C in the western equatorial Pacific (WEP) warm pool, the upper limit of the modern calibration data, and past warming above that level is difficult to assess using faunal methods. Mid-Pliocene fossil samples from the WEP have been analyzed using several variations of MAT with different outcomes and associated levels of confidence. While SST above ~ 30 °C in the WEP during the mid-Pliocene cannot be ruled out due to the limitations of the method, temperatures this warm seem unlikely. In addition to the mid-Pliocene, planktic foraminifer assemblages from the coretop, last glacial maximum, last interglacial and the penultimate glacial (Marine Isotope Stage 6) show striking similarity to each other which sug-gests little to no change in the region between times of global climate extremes. There is generally good agreement between the Mg/Ca paleothermometer and MAT derived faunal SST estimates. Both suggest stability of the WEP warm pool...|$|R
40|$|Aim Leaf area index (LAI) {{is one of}} the key {{variables}} {{related to}} carbon, water and nutrient cycles in terrestrial ecosystems, but its global distribution patterns remain poorly understood. We evaluated the dependence of LAI on mean annual temperature (MAT) and wetness index (WI; a ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) for three plant functional types (PFTs: deciduous broadleaf, DB; evergreen conifer, EC; evergreen broadleaf, EB) at the global scale. Location Global. Methods We developed a new global database of unprecedented size (2606 published values) of field-observed LAI (site-specific maximum) values for vegetation of woody species. To maximize the generic applicability of our analysis, we standardized the definition of LAI, and corrected or excluded potentially erroneous data obtained from indirect optical methods. Results The global dependence of LAI on MAT showed a reverse S-shaped pattern, in which LAI peaked at around 8. 9 and 25. 0 °C and was lowest at around - 10. 0 and 18. 8 °C. The dependence on WI followed a saturation curve levelling off at around logWI = 0. 30. LAI for evergreen forests increased linearly with increasing WI, but that for DB showed a curvilinear pattern saturating at log WI = 0. 03. EC forests had higher LAI values than those of DB forests under <b>cool</b> conditions (<b>MAT</b> = 8. 9 °C), but similar values under temperate conditions (MAT = 8. 9 – 18. 8 °C). Main conclusions This analysis of global LAI-climate relationships supports the general belief that temperature limits LAI under cool conditions whereas water availability plays a predominant role under other conditions. We also found that these patterns differed significantly between PFTs, suggesting that the LAI of different PFTs may respond differently to climate change. Our study provides a broad empirical basis for predicting the global distribution of LAI and for analysing the effects of global climate change on vegetation structure and function...|$|R
40|$|We use D/H and 18 O/ 16 O ratios {{to explore}} the age of kaolins on the Fennoscandian Shield. Sub-Cretaceous kaolins in {{southern}} Scandinavia have isotopic compositions indicative of weathering under warm mean annual temperatures (MATs) of > 15 °C. Deep kaolins on the shield surface in Finland previously also have been regarded as products of humid tropical weathering of Mesoproterozoic to Eocene age. New oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios indicate, however, weathering by <b>cool</b> groundwater under <b>MATs</b> of 13 – 15 °C. Isotope ratios are also not consistent with deep (> 1 km) burial by cover rocks, indicating that a very old age for the weathering is unlikely. Palaeotemperatures are below Cretaceous MATs, yet substantially above Plio-Pleistocene MATs. Comparisons with palaeotemperatures in N Europe and around the Arctic Ocean indicate that the Finnish kaolins developed on the shield surface in the Palaeogene or, alternatively, Miocene. Deep weathering was selectively developed in highly fractured shield rocks and took place in response to latest Cretaceous and Palaeogene uplift and after stripping of Palaeozoic cover rocks. The cool kaolins in Finland indicate that previous routine attributions of kaolinitic weathering products in the geological record to humid tropical environments should be closely scrutinised...|$|R
40|$|One {{method to}} {{determine}} past climate {{has been the}} use of leaf morphological characteristics of fossil leaves quantified using modern climate and canopy leaf characteristics. Fossil assemblages are composed of abscised leaves, and climate may be more accurately determined by using leaves from leaf litter instead of the canopy. To better understand whether taphonomic processes {{make a difference in}} this relationship, a north-central Florida woodland was sampled to determine the morphologically based climate estimates from these leaves. Leaves from woody, dicotyledonous plants were collected and identified, then compared using presence/absence data and analyzed using several linear regression equations and the CLAMP data set. Although the majority of standing vegetation was reflected in leaf litter, some inconsistencies were observed, which may reflect plant community structure or sampling technique. Mean annual temperature (MAT) and growing season precipitation (GSP) were estimated from leaf litter morphological characters and living leaves. Overall, values for MAT estimated from litter and living leaves were <b>cooler</b> than actual <b>MATs,</b> although several accurate and high estimates were obtained depending on the predictive method used. Estimated GSP values were higher than actual GSPs. Statistically, no difference was observed between MAT and GSP estimates derived from leaf litter vs. estimates derived from living leaves, with one exception.

6000|$|To {{his great}} {{surprise}} {{she took the}} news very quietly, giving only him and Lingard a furtive glance, and saying not a word. This, however, did not prevent her the next day from jumping into the river and swimming after the boat in which Lingard was carrying away the nurse with the screaming child. Almayer had to give chase with his whale-boat and drag her in by the hair {{in the midst of}} cries and curses enough to make heaven fall. Yet after two days spent in wailing, she returned to her former mode of life, chewing betel-nut, and sitting all day amongst her women in stupefied idleness. She aged very rapidly after that, and only roused herself from her apathy to acknowledge by a scathing remark or an insulting exclamation the accidental presence of her husband. He had built for her a riverside hut in the compound where she dwelt in perfect seclusion. Lakamba's visits had ceased when, by a convenient decree of Providence and the help of a little scientific manipulation, the old ruler of Sambir departed this life. Lakamba reigned in his stead now, having been well served by his Arab friends with the Dutch authorities. Syed Abdulla was the great man and trader of the Pantai. Almayer lay ruined and helpless under the close-meshed net of their intrigues, owing his life only to his supposed knowledge of Lingard's valuable secret. Lingard had disappeared. He wrote once from Singapore saying the child was well, and under the care of a Mrs. Vinck, and that he himself was going to Europe {{to raise money for the}} great enterprise. [...] "He was coming back soon. There would be no difficulties," [...] he wrote; [...] "people would rush in with their money." [...] Evidently they did not, for there was only one letter more from him saying he was ill, had found no relation living, but little else besides. Then came a complete silence. Europe had swallowed up the Rajah Laut apparently, and Almayer looked vainly westward for a ray of light out of the gloom of his shattered hopes. Years passed, and the rare letters from Mrs. Vinck, later on from the girl herself, were the only thing to be looked to to make life bearable amongst the triumphant savagery of the river. Almayer lived now alone, having even ceased to visit his debtors who would not pay, sure of Lakamba's protection. The faithful Sumatrese Ali cooked his rice and made his coffee, for he dared not trust any one else, and least of all his wife. He killed time wandering sadly in the overgrown paths round the house, visiting the ruined godowns where a few brass guns covered with verdigris and only a few broken cases of mouldering Manchester goods reminded him of the good early times when all this was full of life and merchandise, and he overlooked a busy scene on the river bank, his little daughter by his side. Now the up-country canoes glided past the little rotten wharf of Lingard and Co., to paddle up the Pantai branch, and cluster round the new jetty belonging to Abdulla. Not that they loved Abdulla, but they dared not trade with the man whose star had set. Had they done so they knew there was no mercy to be expected from Arab or Rajah; no rice to be got on credit in the times of scarcity from either; and Almayer could not help them, having at times hardly enough for himself. Almayer, in his isolation and despair, often envied his near neighbour the Chinaman, Jim- Eng, whom he could see stretched on a pile of <b>cool</b> <b>mats,</b> a wooden pillow under his head, an opium pipe in his nerveless fingers. He did not seek, however, consolation in opium--perhaps it was too expensive--perhaps his white man's pride saved him from that degradation; but most likely it was the thought of his little daughter in the far-off Straits Settlements. He heard from her oftener since Abdulla bought a steamer, which ran now between Singapore and the Pantai settlement every three months or so. Almayer felt himself nearer his daughter. He longed to see her, and planned a voyage to Singapore, but put off his departure from year to year, always expecting some favourable turn of fortune. He did not want to meet her with empty hands and with no words of hope on his lips. He could not take her back into that savage life to which he was condemned himself. He was also a little afraid of her. What would she think of him? He reckoned the years. A grown woman. A civilised woman, young and hopeful; while he felt old and hopeless, and very much like those savages round him. He asked himself what was going to be her future. He could not answer that question yet, and he dared not face her. And yet he longed after her. He hesitated for years.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} glacial {{termination}} atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 atm) rose about 100 ppm and atmospheric radiocarbon activity (Δ 14 C) concurrently dropped by about ca. 400 ‰. Global warming likely triggered large-scale thawing of permafrost soils {{in the northern}} hemisphere resulting in release of 14 C-depleted carbon which {{may have contributed to}} the changes in CO 2 atm and Δ 14 C 1. However, the timing and duration of the thawing as well as regional differences regarding these points are poorly understood. In order to unravel the evolution of permafrost decomposition and its role within the glacial-interglacial climate change a profound understanding of the deglacial carbon-turnover and temperature development in subarctic and arctic regions are of great importance. Working with two sediment cores from the continental margin off Kamchatka Peninsula, western Bering Sea (WBS, site SO 201 - 2 - 114 KL) & Northwest Pacific (NW Pacific, site SO 201 - 2 - 12 KL) we establish Glacial to Holocene records in sea surface temperature (SST) and mean air temperature (MAT) using the TEXL 86 (SST) and CBT/MBT (MAT) temperature proxies that are based on marine and terrigenous biomarkers (Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers). The hydrogen isotopic composition (δD) of plant-wax derived lipid biomarkers (long-chain n-alkanes and long-chain n-fatty acids) is another tool for reconstructing air temperature but can also provide information of the provenance of terrigenous organic matter (OM). The radiocarbon activity of the lipid biomarkers is applied to reconstruct changes in terrestrial residence times of terrigenous OM. Our records in SST and CBT/MBT-based MAT are interpreted as summer temperatures. From the Bølling/Allerød interstadial (B/A) to the present they show temperature fluctuations similar to Greenland ice core records including a warming at the onset of the B/A and a cooling during the Younger Dryas (YD) followed by a warming into the Preboreal (PB) suggesting an atmospheric coupling between N-Atlantic and N-Pacific, East Siberian/Kamchatka temperature development. However, during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS 1) where WBS SST and Kamchatka <b>MAT</b> <b>cool</b> down synchronously with Greenland temperatures, the NW-Pacific SST rises gradually and seems to be decoupled from the N-Atlantic. Since the gradual warming trend and the subsequent synchronization with Greenland ice core data during B/A is known from SST records from the Gulf of Alaska 2 (GOA) surface conditions in the NW Pacific likely are controlled by the Alaskan Stream overprinting the atmospheric effect and the influence of the East Kamchatka Current. Asynchronous development of our TEXL 86 record and the GOA records during the Holocene indicate that the AS weakenes over the deglaciation. For the time-span of the Last Glacial Maximum to the onset of the B/A interstadial, the CBT/MBT temperature proxy may be seasonally biased as it produces improbably high summer temperatures that level Holocene conditions. In contrast to the CBT/MBT-based temperatures the δD of n-fatty acids does not show clear stadial-interstadial fluctuations and remains on a stable level during the deglaciation instead. During the Holocene, δD increases progressively, which may have resulted from a gradual warming trend. Comparing the radiocarbon activity of the n-fatty acids to the Δ 14 C-signature of the atmosphere at the time of deposition the dimension of the terrestrial residence time prior to the deposition (ΔΔ 14 C) can be estimated. High ΔΔ 14 C values during deglaciation indicate that the plat-wax biomarkers are strongly pre-aged which may bias the δD-temperature record. Gradually decreasing ΔΔ 14 C imply declining terrestrial residence times from late glacial to late Holocene and argue for major changes in the relative contribution of weakly and strongly pre-aged OM. Possible sources for strongly pre-aged OM include permafrost decomposition and the congruent mobilization of 14 C-depleted carbon but also the erosion of basal tills from the North-American or Kamchatka ice sheets that bear OM dating back to times prior to the glaciation. The n-C 25 /n-C 25 +n-C 27 ratio, an indicator for the relative contribution of sphagnum spp. 3, is on a stable level over most parts of the deglaciation indicating a constant composition of the vegetation and/or a constant carbon source. Between 16. 5 - 14. 6 kaBP the record shows a sharp excursions towards higher values congruent with a sharp increase in the δD of n-alkanes that is not evident in the δD of n-fatty acids. Coevally, lowered CPI-values (carbon preference index) point to a major contribution of fossil carbon at that time. Thus, our sites may be subject to a change in the carbon source. It coincides with melting events of the N-American ice sheets 4 which may indicate that large amounts of OM from eastern Beringia accumulated in the WBS/NW Pacific during HS 1. 1. S. A. Zimov, E. A.
