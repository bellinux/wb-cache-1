50|$|In 1989, the European Endangered Species Programme for the {{hyacinth}} macaw was founded {{as a result}} of concerns about the status of the wild population and the lack of successful breeding in captivity. Breeding in captivity still remains difficult, being that hand-reared {{hyacinth macaw}} offspring have demonstrated to have higher mortality rates, especially within the first month of life. Additionally, they have a higher incidence of acute crop stasis than other macaw species due, in part, to their specific dietary requirements. The hyacinth macaw is protected by law in Brazil and Bolivia, and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the CITES. Appendix I has banned exporting the bird in all countries of origin, and several studies and conservational initiatives have been taken. The Hyacinth Macaw Project in the Caiman Ecological Refuge, located in the Pantanal, has employed artificial nests and <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> techniques, along with effectively raising awareness among cattle ranchers. Many ranch owners in the Pantanal and Gerais, to protect the birds, no longer allow trappers on their properties.|$|E
40|$|A {{cost-benefit}} analysis using deterministic and stochastic modelling {{was conducted to}} identify the net benefits for households that adopt (1) vaccination of individual birds against Newcastle disease (ND) or (2) improved management of chick rearing by providing coops {{for the protection of}} chicks from predation and chick starter feed inside a creep feeder to support chicks 2 ̆ 7 nutrition in village chicken flocks in Myanmar. Partial budgeting was used to assess the additional costs and benefits associated with each of the two intervendons tested relative to neither strategy. In the deterministic model, over the first 3 years after the introduction of the interventions, the cumulative sum of the net differences from neither strategy was 13, 189 Kyat for ND vaccination and 77, 645 Kyat for improved <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> (effective exchange rate in 2005 : 1000 Kyat= 1 US). Both interventions were also profitable after discounting over a 10 -year period; Net Present Values for ND vaccination and improved <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> were 30, 791 and 167, 825 Kyat, respectively. The Benefit-Cost Ratio for ND vaccination was very high (28. 8). This was lower for improved <b>chick</b> <b>management,</b> due to greater costs of the intervention, but still favourable at 4. 7. Using both interventions concurrently yielded a Net Present Value of 470, 543 Kyat and a Benefit-Cost Ratio of 11. 2 over the 10 -year period in the deterministic model. Using the stochastic model, for the first 3 years following the introduction of the interventions, the mean cumulative sums of the net difference were similar to those values obtained from the deterministic model. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the cumulative net differences were strongly influenced by grower bird sale income, particularly under improved <b>chick</b> <b>management.</b> The effects of the strategies on odds of households selling and consuming birds after 7 months, and numbers of birds being sold or consumed after this period also influenced profitability. Cost variations for equipment used under improved <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> were not markedly associated with profitability. Net Present Values and Benefit-Cost Ratios discounted over a 10 -year period were also similar to the deterministic model when mean values obtained through stochastic modelling were used. In summary, the study showed that ND vaccination and improved <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> can improve the viability and profitability of village chicken production in Myanmar. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

30|$|A serious {{limitation}} {{in rural}} {{development is the}} lack of available capital on which to develop a base of economic activity (Swanson et al. 1997). For successful adoption, interventions promoted have to be affordable for farmers. In our project most village chicken farmers could afford the equipment promoted. However, in the beginning of our extension program farmers were able to purchase <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> equipment from the project at subsidized prices to encourage its use. If larger investments are required to adopt interventions, credit opportunities for farmers need to be explored.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{fisheries}} generate {{large volumes}} of fishery waste and it is often assumed that this additional food is beneficial to populations of marine top-predators. We challenge this concept via a detailed study of foraging Cape gannets Morus capensis and of their feeding environment in the Benguela upwelling zone. The natural prey of Cape gannets (pelagic fishes) is depleted and birds now feed extensively on fishery wastes. These are beneficial to non-breeding birds, which show reduced feeding effort and high survival. By contrast, breeding gannets double their diving effort {{in an attempt to}} provision their chicks predominantly with high-quality, live pelagic fishes. Owing to a scarcity of this resource, they fail and most chicks die. Our study supports the junk-food hypothesis for Cape gannets since it shows that non-breeding birds can survive when complementing their diet with fishery wastes, but that they struggle to reproduce if live prey is scarce. This is due to the negative impact of low-quality fishery wastes on the growth patterns of gannet <b>chicks.</b> Marine <b>management</b> policies should not assume that fishery waste is generally beneficial to scavenging seabirds and that an abundance of this artificial resource will automatically inflate their populations...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 A {{preliminary}} {{study was conducted}} to establish baseline data for emu artificial egg incubation and emu <b>chick</b> growth and <b>management.</b> Three experiments examined factors affecting hatchability of emu eggs that occur prior to and during artificial incubation.

The six treatments among the three incubation experiments consisted of two AVN incubators with temperatures maintained at 36. 0 C and 35. 8 C, and four Jamesway 252 incubators maintained at 36. 0 C, 36. 6 C, 36. 5 C, and 36. 7 C. Three subsequent experiments involved six treatments with hatched chicks to test the effects of diet and pen size on chick weight gain, and growth of the beak, middle toe, and tarsometatarsus up to eight and ten weeks of age. Sand, grass clippings, and pine shavings substrates were also tested. Analysis of duration of egg storage indicated that an increase in pre-incubation storage time was associated with a decrease in hatchability. The highest percent hatch (63. 8...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} identified Newcastle {{disease and}} poor management of chicks (birds younger than 6 weeks of age) as major constraints to village chicken production in Myanmar. Based on these findings, controlled trials {{were conducted in}} 124 randomly selected households in nine villages in Myanmar {{over a period of}} 12 months to evaluate strategies to enhance survival of village chickens. Two intervention strategies were assessed: Newcastle disease vaccination using the thermostable 1 - 2 vaccine and changes to the management of chick rearing (confinement and supplementary feeding). These interventions were applied in two trials: (1) a randomised controlled trial to compare 1 - 2 vaccination, altered <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> and no intervention (apart from placebo treatment) at household level and (2) nested within this trial, a double-blinded controlled trial at bird-level to compare serological titres between 1 - 2 vaccinated and placebo-treated birds both between and within households. Outcomes measured in the first trial were crude incidence rate of mortality, proportional mortality rate for deaths due to disease stratified by age group of birds and mortality attributed to Newcastle disease, number of sales, income from sale of birds, consumption of birds and hatching of birds...|$|E
30|$|Farmer {{workshops}} {{were the}} major tool {{to deliver the}} extension messages on improving village chicken health and {{on the use of}} the intervention methods. These workshops were conducted in common spiritual or communal places (e.g. in monasteries, in the house of the village head person, in schools or in village offices) from June until September 2007 in 47 villages in three different divisions of Myanmar (Yangon, Bago, Mandalay Divisions). Women and children as the main poultry keepers were the main target in the workshops. Training of trainers resulted in training of 14 field veterinarians and 47 village head people to deliver the extension messages on village chicken health and improved chick husbandry. Overall a total of 166 workshops were conducted with 3, 969 trainees attending (representing about 50 % of the 9, 157 village households in the 47 villages). Farmers who had positive experiences with the interventions in the field studies were invited to report on their experiences. Farmers could purchase the extension equipment (bamboo coops, creep feeders, chick starter feed) used in the intervention studies. During the trainings sessions a total of 1750 complete sets of extension equipment for improved <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> were sold to farmers. Workshop participation was encouraged through lotteries in which participants could win some of the extension equipment. Village personnel who had significant association with poultry issues were identified to conduct these workshops in the future.|$|E
30|$|These {{issues were}} then {{addressed}} in a 12 -month intervention study with different interventions or treatments being applied to randomly selected flocks (Henning et al. 2009). In this study we compared the profitability for households {{of the use of}} Newcastle disease vaccination (Treatment 1 [*]=[*]TR 1) with improved chick rearing management (TR 3) to neither strategy (TR 2) in an average sized flock of village chickens. Vaccination of individual birds against ND (TR 1) was conducted using the thermostable live I- 2 ND vaccine produced by LBVD. ND vaccine was administered in eye drops, by veterinarians from the Myanmar LBVD. Improved management of chicks (TR 3) included the provision of both coops (for the protection of chicks from predation) and chick starter feed inside a creep feeder (to support chicks’ nutrition). The equipment for the confinement, the feeds, and the vaccinations were provided free of charge to participants during the randomised controlled trial, which was carried out from July 2004 until June 2005. Assuming costs to be incurred if farmers implement I- 2 ND vaccination or improved <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> themselves we modelled the income from the sale of chickens under the three treatments {{and we were able to}} show that the group of farmers who introduced changes to the management of young chicks had an significant increase in the number of birds sold after a period of six months resulting in additional income from the sale of birds (Henning et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to inves-tigate the morphological development of the small in-testine of African ostrich chicks and to examine the changes in the number of goblet cells therein by observ-ing the gross anatomy and performing histochemistry and morphometry. The BW; length, height, and width of the villi; muscle thickness; depth of the crypts; and number of goblet cells in the intestinal villi and crypts were measured on neonatal d 1, 45, 90, and 334. Our results revealed that the weights of the duodenum, je-junum, and ileum (relative to the BW) peaked on d 90, 45, and 45, respectively, and tended to decline thereaf-ter. The villus height and width and muscle thickness in the small intestine were positively correlated with the age of the birds. The ratio of the villus height to the crypt depth differed among the segments of the small intestine and at the different time points. The number of goblet cells in the intestinal villi and crypts increased rapidly up to postnatal d 45 and then decreased rap-idly between d 45 and 90. The number of goblet cells in the villi was greatest in the jejunum on d 1 and in the ileum on d 45, whereas that in the crypt was great-est in the ileum on d 1 and 90 and in the duodenum on d 45. These results suggest that the small intestine develops gradually from postnatal d 1 to 90 and that the period up to postnatal d 45 is marked by significant developmental changes in the parameters reflective of the digestive capacity, such as the weight, length, and surface area of the intestine and the number of goblet cells. Therefore, in reared African ostrich <b>chicks,</b> feed <b>management</b> should be enhanced between postnatal...|$|R
40|$|Chick {{survival}} {{during the}} first three weeks of life is a critical stage in the demography of Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido), but little information is available. Biologists often estimate brood success using periodic flushes of radio-marked females, but it is impossible to determine mortality factors if chicks are not radio-marked. We used sutures to attach 0. 5 -g transmitters to 1 - to 2 -day-old chicks in Johnson County, Nebraska, during 2008. Our objectives were to (1) assess causes of mortality of 0 - to 21 -day-old chicks, (2) estimate daily survival probability for 0 - to 21 -day-old chicks, and (3) evaluate the effect of applying transmitters with suture attachment to chicks. We monitored a total of 221 prairie chicken chicks from 20 broods. We radio-marked 27 chicks from 10 broods of radio-marked females (one to five chicks per brood). The chicks were located twice per day to ensure that they were within a 10 -m radius of the female. Our limited sample showed a weak effect of radio-marking on the survival of prairie chicken chicks (β= – 0. 54; SE= 0. 33). Forty-two (19 %; 95 % CI: ± 5 %) of the 221 chicks in our sample survived to day 21, confirming low rates of productivity observed in hunter wing surveys and brood flushes of radio-marked females in a concurrent study. All radio-marked chicks in our sample died (13 % exposure; 87 % predators) before 21 days of age. Survival of chicks increased with age, and survival decreased during periods with high precipitation. Daily and 21 -day survival rate estimates for all chicks in our sample were 0. 926 (95 % CI: 0. 915 – 0. 937) and 0. 193 (95 % CI; 0. 155 – 0. 255), respectively.

40|$|The {{scavenging}} village {{chicken is}} important to millions of smallholders in Ethiopia, as in other less-economically developed countries, for its contribution to the economic, nutritional and social well-being of farmers, especially women and children. Infectious diseases are frequently cited as the greatest constraint to village chicken production, and in Ethiopia, most mortality is attributed to seasonal outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND). This study conducted four cross-sectional surveys over an 18 -month period in two geographically distinct regions of Ethiopia, to examine a range of bacterial, viral and parasitic infections in randomly-selected village chickens, and {{to look at their}} 6 -month survival rate. The two chicken populations of the different regions were found to be different in terms of their population dynamics and phenotypic characteristics, and these may be driven by farmer demands, which are dictated by the local economic and cultural value placed on specific qualities in the chickens. Over the course of the study, no large outbreaks were observed in the eight villages which took part in the study, and only 9 out of 1280 birds (0. 7 %) were found to be serologically positive for ND. However, {{even in the absence of}} large outbreaks, around 20 % of the birds in the study were reported to have died of disease within the 6 -month follow-up period, and a further 13 % lost to predation. Both location and seasonal variation influenced a bird’s fate, as did farmer decisions, such as choosing birds with specific characteristics to sell or eat. Rather than large outbreaks, the rainy season appeared to be associated with increased small-scale losses, and a variety of signs were described, suggesting several pathogens may be involved. No single infection measured at the time of sampling was a good predictor of subsequent death from disease; instead different pathogens appeared to be important in each region, and reduced the probability of survival through a variety of mechanisms. Positive correlations between Pasteurella and Salmonella, and between Marek’s disease and parasitic diseases were identified, but fewer birds than expected were identified with pathogens from both these groups, perhaps suggesting a decreased chance of survival for co-infected birds. Strong seasonal variation in prevalence was not observed for any of the infections in the study, suggesting that seasonal rises in disease mortality are unlikely to be attributable to a single infection, but other factors may play a role, including an increased probability of co-infection. This makes it difficult to prioritise control strategies for individual diseases; instead development programmes may find broad-based strategies, such as improving hygiene and <b>chick</b> <b>management</b> may be more beneficial to minimise the small-scale losses. Programmes also need to be tailored to local needs rather than assuming a blanket strategy will work equally well for all farmers or regions. Any development strategies to control single diseases should consider potential impacts on non-target infections, due to the existence of multiple interactions between pathogens in this system...|$|E
