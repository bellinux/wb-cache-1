25|$|Once {{the negotiators}} had been agreed upon, {{the two sides}} moved to {{designate}} foreign guarantor countries. Cuba, host to previous encounters, was a logical choice, while Norway {{was chosen as the}} second guarantor country for its active role in international <b>conflict</b> <b>mediation.</b> Additionally, two facilitator or 'accompanying countries' were also designated. The FARC chose Venezuela, while the Colombian government chose Chile. Exploratory meetings continued in Havana in February 2012, with limited social exchanges between the two negotiating teams to preserve the confidentiality of the talks. By August 2012, nearly ten preparatory rounds had taken place, with each round lasting between four and eight days for a total of approximately 65 encounters between both sides.

25|$|One {{example of}} {{sustainable}} mining practice is Barrick Gold Corporation's Lagunas Norte mine. Barrick has taken active steps towards preventing and addressing conflict with rural communities living near the mine site. Firstly, it {{makes use of}} a communication team and a community-relation team, each made up of ten national citizens with expertise in fields such as anthropology, socially, and <b>conflict</b> <b>mediation.</b> The teams collaborate with local authorities and community members to assess their needs, address conflict, and manage development programs. Barrick employs a 'Community Grievance Management Resolution Procedures' mechanism that allows it to monitor community discontent by providing space for any person or group to submit a grievance at any time. When grievances are identified, Barrick tracks them and works to redress the associated issues. In addition, Barrick practices social licensing by regulating the environmental impacts generated by its mining operations. It has cleaned up abandoned mine sites, implemented a water management system, worked to restore soil conditions, and established a ranch {{for the purpose of}} herding and livestock activity. Through this model, Barrick carries out sustainable mining operations while successfully managing corporate-community conflict.|$|E

Adkins (1999) described the development of one such intervention, [...] an organizational health center (OHC) at a California industrial complex. The OHC helped to improve both organizational and individual health as well as help workers manage job stress. Innovations included labor-management partnerships, suicide risk reduction, <b>conflict</b> <b>mediation,</b> and occupational mental health support. OHC practitioners also coordinated their services with previously underutilized local community services in the same city, thus reducing redundancy in service delivery.|$|E

For example, mediation might {{be defined as a}} journey or the peeling of layers from an onion. This study was a qualitative content analysis of 85 Florida family court mediators’ conflict metaphors, couched in relevant theories, providing insight into their experiences. A statewide questionnaire resulted in predominantly negative metaphors for <b>conflict</b> and <b>mediation</b> parties, and positive metaphors for mediation and mediators.
