40|$|INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS The {{financial}} crisis {{that started in}} mid- 1997 in Southeast Asia has resulted in massive currency depreciations {{in a number of}} emerging market economies in Asia (Table VIII. 1). Given the increasing importance of these economies in world trade, this has raised the issue of whether this could lead to a major redistribution of <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gains</b> and losses across OECD and non-OECD countries, resulting in substantial current-account adjustment. In the past, potential <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gains</b> deriving from nominal exchange rate depreciations have often tended to be eroded by rising inflation. 1 Nevertheless, there is a widespread sentiment that recent developments might have reinforced the absolute cost advantage that these economies might already enjoy relative to OECD countries, making them even more competitive internationally. 2 Several emerging market economies in Asia have experienced massive exchange rate depreciations… Table VIII. 1.

40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industry, {{pressures}} persist on organisations {{to master}} and profit from the energy and allied environmental challenges facing the world. This can be achieved through enhanced operational efficiency, responsiveness, resilience and reliability characteristic of an agile organisation. These issues as well as the role of clusters as a strategy for economic exploitation of oil and gas resources are explored in this paper. Further, the paper looks at the diffusion of agility in {{the oil and gas}} industry and examines, empirically, the agility advantage, <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gain</b> and performance benefits of cluster members over non-members. Our results suggest that clusters enhance and enable higher levels of agile practices. However, whilst prior studies seem to suggest that clusters have positive impacts on competitiveness and performance, our findings indicate that there is no strong empirical basis to make a direct link between clusters and competitiveness, at least in {{the oil and gas industry}}. It follows from this that the universality of the attribution of competitiveness to clusters as espoused by the proponents of cluster theory is questionable and empirical evidence certainly does not support their position in the context of the oil and gas clusters...|$|R
40|$|The central idea of {{the paper}} {{emphasizes}} Romania’s competitive advantages in the EU {{and there are two}} analysis levels herein: the correct identification of Romania’s competitive advantages and the oportunities to value them. The paper aims at achieving a competitiveness analysis of the Romanian economy during 2006 - 2009. The Romanian economy’s integration within the European Union does not only mean a mere inclusion or accession into/to the Community, but it also represents the belonging to a strongly competitive area. Since the Union has mainly aimed at becoming the most competitive economy at world level, Romania has to face a double challenge: redefining its competitiveness and reducing the current gaps between its economy and the average level of the main EU social and economic indices. Redefining competitiveness is actually redefining competitiveness determiners. Reaching the convergence goal is based on the Romanian economy’s sustainable competitive advantages. The essential concern is their proper identification, as they are the result of a strategic vision. Taking account of these principles, Romania’s EU accession is acquiring new traits. Is there a <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gain</b> or is there a certain loss right from the moment of the accession?...|$|R
40|$|Studies on why {{small and}} medium {{enterprises}} (SMEs) engage in pro-environmental behavior suggest that managers’ environmental responsibility plays a relatively greater role than competitiveness and legitimacy-seeking.

However, especially proactive firms are also characterized by expectations of <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gains.</b> The authors thus emphasize the role of institutional context and potential interaction effects between these drivers in explaining the reasons why SMEs engage in pro-environmental behavior in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{macroeconomic}} impacts of increasing {{competition in the}} non-tradable goods and labour markets in Portugal. We lean on evidence that the maintenance of low competition in these markets {{may have contributed to}} the recent poor performance of the Portuguese economy. The analysis is performed using PESSOA, a dynamic general equilibrium model for a small-open economy integrated in a monetary union, featuring Blanchard-Yaari households, a multi-sectoral production structure and a number of nominal and real rigidities. We conclude that measures aimed at increasing competition in the Portuguese non-tradable goods and labour markets could induce important international <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gains</b> and be valuable instruments in promoting necessary adjustments within the monetary union framework. However, in the short run, real interest rates are likely to increase temporarily, driving consumption and output temporarily downwards. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to explain how the {{introduction}} of new technologies from strategic sectors such as the aeronautics-aerospace, may influence the competitiveness at regional level. The analysis involves both European and Italian level. According to the traditional Pavitt’s taxonomy, the aeronautics-aerospace sector can be defined as a knowledge-science based sector. The EU looks at the aeronautics-aerospace like a leading sector in building the society of knowledge and information and a potential tool of <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gain</b> in the global market. It is well-known that technological innovation included into the aeronautics-aerospace activities may be suitable to many other sectors, so that it produces a technological fertilization in economic fields sometimes far under the production point of view. This is possible because aeronautics and aerospace activities are technologically integrated as well as available for many applications. Indeed it is interesting to note that the aeronautics-aerospace sector is meaningfully structured in poles at regional level in several EU member states, so that we can sustain that industrial districts formed by aeronautics-aerospace science and application could represent an interesting evolution of numerous knowledge-based areas into the future EU, and they could contribute to induce more connective and connecting companies thanks to an over-national market and well-distributed activities at regional level. At the actual state of worldwide competitiveness, the aeronautics-aerospace sector is able to increase local competitiveness and development...|$|R
40|$|As {{economic}} internationalization advances, {{the question}} of how firms cope with increasing pressure for <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gains</b> momentum. While scholars agree that firms need a competitive advantage, they debate whether firms exploit the comparative advantage of their economy and converge on that strategy facilitated by national institutions. `No', argue strategic management proponents of the resource-based view. `Yes', claim contributors to the competitiveness literature. The author's micro-level studies of these opposing views do not find evidence for a strong, widespread convergence by the firms in one economy to the same institutionally supported strategy. The discrepancies between these findings and the analyses of the competitiveness literature are attributed to differences in the indicators employed to measure corporate strategies. Whenever macro-level indicators are used, the related loss of information on micro-level variety entails that convergence effects are more pronounced — possibly exaggerated...|$|E

The population of the research is the ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System) certified manufacturing companies in Sri Lanka. Data was collected through a survey done involving all the ISO 14001 certified manufacturing companies where environment management representatives of the firms were targeted through online questionnaires. A four point likert scale was used to obtain responses. Exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze data regarding the five variables. The research concludes with a statistically proven result that greening the inbound, production and outbound functions of a supply chain individually as well as collectively leads to improved economic performance while competitiveness can be improved by greening the inbound function of a supply chain.

It also demonstrates the inadequate simplification entailed in an a priori exclusion of relative prices in external equilibrium equation. Not taking these two aspects into consideration may give rise to an erroneous confirmation of Thirlwall's Law, especially if, as in the Spanish case, both effects offset each other. Finally, if the aim is to analyse long-term relationships between variables, it would seem advisable to use procedures, such as cointegration, with variables in levels. ...|$|E

We {{find that the}} provinces in the Northeast and Coastal regions have strong advantages in the manufacturing sector, while the Primary sector, Construction and Real estate sectors have better cost competitiveness in the Interior and West regions. The decrease of relative unit labour cost (RULC) is mainly due to the faster growth rates of relative labour productivity (RLP) than {{the growth rate of}} relative nominal labour costs (RNLC) in most cases. A decomposition analysis shows that there are much more cost <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gains,</b> as well as relative decrease of nominal labour costs and labour productivity improvement during the period 1978 - 1995 than the years afterwards. We find the fast convergence of RULC is consistent with the fast converging RLP among provinces with static wages, suggesting the importance of institutional factors such as rigid wage setting in Chinese labour markets. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of exchange rate adjustments depends critically {{on the extent}} to which depreciations "pass through" to inflation, an effect that is known as exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). In particular, if an exchange rate depreciation does not result in a lasting change in relative prices, namely a real depreciation, it will not provide the desirable <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gains.</b> This paper looks at the question of pass-through and its determinants for the group of countries whose central banks are members of the Financial Stability and Development (FSD) network. All of these countries experienced large terms of trade shocks and large depreciations in the past couple of years. The findings are that ERPT in the FSD countries is moderate and has become lower over time, in line with the international experience. The pass-through moderation has benefitted from the adoption of floating exchange rates and especially an increase in monetary policy credibility. Despite the relatively lower ERPT in the past two decades, the exchange rate continues to be a large determinant of inflation in several countries...|$|E

Constant market share method applied on FAO export data, for the 1991 to 2003 period, indicates that Brazilian agricultural export increased more than the potential rate, due to expressive <b>competitiveness</b> <b>gains.</b> After the exchange regime change, in 1999, the competitiveness increase was partly neutralized by growth share of products whose world demand was in decline. Exports value decomposition showed that the volume effect predominates, fact more evident after the flotation exchange adoption, when the price effect was negative. Even discounting the real exchange depreciation effect, the international prices change was unfavourable to the Brazilian agriculture. The flexibility effect negative sign during all the period indicates great participation of products in disagreement with the offer law, fact worsened recently, when most of the products whose exports increased in volume had falling prices in the international market. The manufactured export decline and the largest basic products trade growth indicated a tendency to agribusiness deindustrialization. agricultural export, deindustrialization, constant market share, Agribusiness, F 31,...|$|E
