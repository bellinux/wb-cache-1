40|$|A {{high-temperature}} superconductor (HTS) {{was used}} on {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) receiver coils to improve image quality because of its intrinsic low electrical resistivity [1], [2]. Typical HTS coils are surface coils made of HTS thin-film wafers. Their applications are severely limited by {{the field of view}} (FOV) of the surface coil configuration, and the improvement in image quality by HTS coil is also reduced as the ratio of sample noise to coil noise increases. Therefore, previous HTS coils are usually used to image small in vitro samples, small animals, or peripheral human anatomies [3]-[5]. We used large-size HTS coils (2. 5 -, 3. 5 -, and 5. 5 -in mean diameter) to enhance the FOV and we evaluated their performance through phantom and human MR images. Comparisons were made among HTS surface coils, copper surface coils, and cool copper surface coils in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity profile of the images. A theoretical model prediction was also used to compare against the experimental result. We then selected several human body parts, including the wrist, feet, and head, to illustrate the advantage of HTS coil over copper coil when used in human imaging. The results show an SNR gain of 200 % for 5. 5 -in HTS coil versus same size copper coils, while for 2. 5 - and 3. 5 -in coils it is 250 %. We also address the various factors that affect the performance of large size HTS coils, including the coil-to-sample spacing due to cryogenic probe and the <b>coil-loading</b> effect. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) {{can provide}} in vivo {{metabolite}} concentrations in standard concentration units if a reliable reference signal is available. For 1 H MRS {{in the human}} brain, typically the signal from the tissue water is used as the (internal) reference signal. However, a concentration determination based on the tissue water signal most often requires a reliable estimate of the water concentration present in the investigated tissue. Especially in clinically interesting cases, this estimation might be difficult. To avoid assumptions about {{the water in the}} investigated tissue, the Electric REference To access In vivo Concentrations (ERETIC) method has been proposed. In this approach, the metabolite signal is compared with a reference signal acquired in a phantom and potential <b>coil-loading</b> differences are corrected using a synthetic reference signal. The aim of this study, conducted with a transceiver quadrature head coil, was to increase the accuracy of the ERETIC method by correcting the influence of spatial B 1 inhomogeneities and to simplify the quantification with ERETIC by incorporating an automatic phase correction for the ERETIC signal. Transmit field (B 1 +) differences are minimized with a volume-selective power optimization, whereas reception sensitivity changes are corrected using contrast-minimized images of the brain and by adapting the voxel location in the phantom measurement closely to the position measured in vivo. By applying the proposed B 1 correction scheme, the mean metabolite concentrations determined with ERETIC in 21 healthy subjects at three different positions agree with concentrations derived with the tissue water signal as reference. In addition, brain water concentrations determined with ERETIC were in agreement with estimations derived using tissue segmentation and literature values for relative water densities. Based on the results, the ERETIC method presented here is a valid tool to derive in vivo metabolite concentration, with potential advantages compared with internal water referencing in diseased tissue...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The paper {{discusses}} {{aspects of}} a novel impedance matrix compressing technique and applies the technique to a <b>coil-loaded</b> monopole. The technique can {{reduce the number of}} variables required for modeling of structures with curvatures and structures with electrically small features. The {{reduction in the number of}} unknowns is accomplished by a logical aggregation/grouping of the individual wire segments into equivalent continuous wires. A single composite basis function is applied over several wire segments. This decouples the number of unknowns from the number of geometrical segments. Aggregation of small features aims a reduction in the impedance matrix’s condition number. The example of <b>coil-loaded</b> antenna has shown that the proposed novel algorithm achieves better accuracy with fewer unknowns than the traditional formulation of the method of moments. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Method of Moments (MoM) is {{a general}} method for solving linear problems, {{including}} electromagnetic problems, such as radiation and scattering of electromagnetic waves. The applications of the method include analysis and design of antennas and scatterers and electromagnetic compatibility. This work develops several new extensions to the traditional framework of the method of moments, addressing memory savings, problem conditioning, and acceleration of computations. The MoM’s groundwork in this thesis {{is based on the}} works by Professor B. M. Kolundzija. The theory from his books and papers was implemented in a Matlab programming code, within the thin-wire kernel. Several new features, core to this thesis, were then devised, including an improvement to the condition number of impedance matrix, analytical computation of radiation pattern, and piecewise-linearly interpolating multiple domain basis functions (MDBF). This work includes a study into new possibilities to minimize the impedance matrix’s condition number with non-to-little computational overhead. The approach devised involves an appropriate selection of a common/reference wire at a junction with multiple wires attached. It is shown that the choice is frequency dependent. Several solutions with different degrees of optimality and complexity are introduced. A proposed simplistic method ensures that the maximum condition number is never encountered. On the other extreme, another new but more computationally demanding method minimizes the condition number. The technique proposed has demonstrated an order of magnitude reduction in the condition number. The work also proposed a novel method for an accelerated computation of radiation patterns. The method is based on analytical techniques. At low frequencies, the method employs Taylor’s expansion of the oscillating exponential term. At higher frequencies, the method uses integration by parts. Estimates for errors are derived and used to establish the boundary between the Taylor's expansion and the integration by parts. At this boundary, the method has a limitation on the best achievable accuracy. However, this limit is found to be sufficient for most practical applications. The speed and accuracy of a Matlab realization of the method were found matching commercial software, indicating further acceleration potential through coding in a lower level programming language. The bulk of this thesis is on the realisation of multiple domain basis functions (MDBF). MDBF are be defined over a chain of several wire segments. The proposed extension to the traditional MoM decouples the requirements for the mesh of the geometrical model from the requirements for the representation of current distribution. This separation permits to treat curved structures more efficiently, as well as also extends the boundaries of the thin wire approximation. The presented treatment of the problem includes the development and testing of several original automatic algorithms for generating appropriate meshes of chains of wires. The concept of linearly interpolated MDBFs is developed, implemented and tested on piecewise linear (PWL) and piecewise sinusoidal (PWS) MDBFs. Several examples ranging from a short monopole to a resonant <b>coil-loaded</b> antenna were used to illustrate the techniques devised. The application of the technique to the latter example has shown an order of magnitude improvement in the number of the unknowns, as compared to a traditional MoM formulation. This translates into two orders of magnitude in memory savings. Furthermore, a theoretical basis for applying higher order polynomial basis functions to chains of wire segments has been developed, and can be readily extended onto other shapes of basic geometrical element than wire segments. An estimate for computational complexity associated with the higher order hierarchical polynomial basis functions has been derived, quantifying the available potential for a {{reduction in the number of}} unknowns. A composition of these individual improvements covers the wide spectrum of a MoM based solution to a multitude of practical problems. It is expected to provide a next step in the reduction of the time and other resources required to solve large problems, towards a numerical electromagnetic synthesis of antennas.
