25|$|Mild to {{moderate}} fires burn {{in the forest}} understory, removing small trees and herbaceous groundcover. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns {{of the trees and}} kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active <b>crown</b> <b>fire).</b> High-severity fire creates complex early seral forest habitat, or snag forest with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil. Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as climate and topography {{play an important role in}} determining fire severity and fire extent. Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.|$|E

30|$|Fire {{regimes in}} Sierra Nevada forests are altered by human {{activities}} in several ways. Fire seasons are extended by human-caused ignitions {{during periods of}} time when lightning strikes are negligible or absent. Fire durations are shortened and fire return intervals increased as fire suppression efforts extinguish many fires when they are still small. As a result, most fires are smaller in size, but those fires that do escape control become much larger than would occur naturally because {{of the increase in}} fuel loading (Running 2006). These large fires burn with greater intensity and have large patches of severe effects. Although surface fires are still common, active <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> and independent <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> have begun to appear. Independent <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> have been extremely rare in the Sierra Nevada in the past (van Wagtendonk and Fites-Kaufman 2006).|$|R

40|$|The fuel {{characteristics}} {{that influence the}} initiation and spread of wildfires were measured in Keteleeria fortune forest (FT 1), Pinus yunnanensis forest (FT 2), P. yunnanensis and Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco mixed forest (FT 3), P. yunnanensis Franch and K. fortunei (Murr.) Carr mixed forest (FT 4), Tsuga chinensis forest (FT 5), and P. orientalis forest (FT 6) in southwest Sichuan Province, China. We compared vertical distributions of four fuel classes (active fuel, fine fuel, medium fuel and thick fuel) in the same vertical strata and in different spatial layers, and analyzed the fire potential (surface fire, passive and active <b>crown</b> <b>fires)</b> of the six forest types (FT). We then classified the six forest types into different groups depending on their wildfire potential. By using the pattern of forest wildfire types that burnt the most number of forests, we identified four fire susceptibility groups. The first two groups had the lowest susceptibility of active <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> but they differed {{in the proportion of}} surface and passive <b>crown</b> <b>fires.</b> The third group was positioned in the middle between types with low and extremely high fire susceptibility; while the fourth group had the highest susceptibility of active <b>crown</b> <b>fires.</b> The results of this study will not only contribute to the prediction of fire behavior, but also will be invaluable for use in forestry management...|$|R

5|$|The {{fires in}} Yellowstone left {{a mosaic of}} areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> that in many places obliterated entire forests. <b>Crown</b> <b>fires</b> accounted for about 41percent of all the area that burned. Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|R

30|$|Woodlands co-dominated by Ashe juniper {{were part}} of the pre-settlement {{vegetation}} of the Edwards Plateau, although their location and extent is debated (Amos and Gehlbach 1988, Diamond 1995, Wills 2005, Murray et al. 2012). Our results suggest that decades must have passed between <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> in woodlands where Ashe juniper was dominant, and that the oldest woodlands are likely in fire-protected sites (mesic canyons or rocky areas with low fuel loads). Furthermore, repeated <b>crown</b> <b>fires,</b> at least at the interval observed here, do not appear to limit the distribution of other woody species. Thus, repeated fire could shift the community from an oak-juniper woodland to an oak-dominated shrubland, but such fires are unlikely to convert woodlands on shallow soils into oak savannas.|$|R

30|$|Fire {{seasonality}} {{is defined}} as a combination of the date a fire starts and its duration. Fire return interval is the length of time between fires at a specific point on the landscape and can be expressed as a mean, median, minimum, or maximum. Other measures related to fire return interval include fire rotation, which is the time necessary for fire to burn an area equivalent to the total area of an ecosystem (Heinselman 1978), and fire frequency, which is the inverse of fire return interval. Fire size is the area burned by the fire, and spatial complexity {{is defined as}} the variability in the patchiness and gradient structure of the burned area. Fireline intensity is the rate of energy release per unit of fire flaming front. Although other measures of fire intensity, such as reaction intensity, might be better related to fire effects, fireline intensity can be visualized through its relationship with flame length (Byram 1959) and the burning index, an estimate of potential flame length and fireline intensity (Deeming et al. 1977). Fireline intensity is also the measure of fire magnitude that is most commonly understood and used by fire behavior analysts. Fire severity is defined as the magnitude of the effect that a fire has on the environment (van Wagtendonk 2006). It is commonly measured using remote sensing indexes, but other methods such as field surveys of fire effects are also used (Key 2006, Key and Benson 2004). Fire type describes the vegetation and fuel layers through which a fire propagates and includes ground fires, surface <b>fires,</b> and <b>crown</b> <b>fires.</b> Van Wagner (1977) defined three phases of crown fires: passive <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> torch individual trees or groups of trees, active <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> spread through the crowns in conjunction with a surface <b>fire,</b> and independent <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> spread far ahead of or {{in the absence of a}} surface fire.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on {{spatially}} segregated multiple crown fuel matrices that model the crowns of discrete shrubs. The influence of the horizontal crown separation distance between crown fuel matrices on the transition process from surface <b>fires</b> to <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> and on the rate of spread of surface fires in chaparral fuels is investigated experimentally and numerically. The experiments are carried out in a 1. 20 m width × 1. 20 m height × 7. 4 m length, open-roof wind tunnel to ensure that flame-generated buoyancy effects are not suppressed. The surface fire is initiated in a fuel bed comprised of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx) excelsior that is evenly distributed over an area of 0. 8 m width × 2. 8 m length to a depth of 0. 10 m. Crown fuel matrices comprised of live chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) held in place by two 0. 6 m length × 0. 3 m height × 0. 8 m width wire mesh baskets, at a height of 0. 35 m {{from the surface of the}} fuel bed. Crown separation distances (CSD) investigated range from 0. 1 m to 0. 3 m. At a CSD of 0. 1 m, as the fire front approaches and ignites the downwind crown fuel matrix, the surface <b>fire</b> and upwind <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> are merged into a single fire. Following ignition of the downwind crown fuel, a single merged fire, comprising the surface and two <b>crown</b> <b>fires,</b> results. At larger crown separation distances of 0. 2 m and 0. 3 m, the surface and upwind <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> are segregated, appearing as two distinct fire fronts, with the ignition of the downstream crown fuel matrix occurring earlier in time for the lower CSD case. In addition, a Particle Image Velocimetry system is utilized to investigate the influence of CSD on the flow field between adjacent crown fuel matrices...|$|R
30|$|Three of {{the papers}} in this issue are entirely unique in some respects. Mallek and Lombardo et al. used tree rings to record fires in two {{ecosystems}} that had no previous fire history studies. The third paper includes the longest tree-ring reconstruction of fire history in the world (Swetnam et al.). Mallek’s study in McNab cypress (Hesperocyparis macnabiana [A. Murray bis] Battel) contends with the challenging problem of reconstructing fire history using tree rings in a forest type that apparently sustained primarily stand-replacing <b>crown</b> <b>fires.</b> Fire scarred trees are rare or absent in this case, so the primary lines of evidence are based on tree ages, field observations, and documentary records. Mallek shows that most stands were even-aged and originated following past <b>crown</b> <b>fires.</b> Although some stand-replacing fire regimes in North America {{seem to have been}} less affected by twentieth century fire suppression than surface fire regimes, both Mallek and Lombardo et al. do detect some apparent changes. In Mallek’s McNab cypress study, he found fewer stand-replacing events in the twentieth century than occurred earlier.|$|R

5000|$|Crown, canopy, or aerial fires burn {{suspended}} {{material at}} the canopy level, such as tall trees, vines, and mosses. The ignition of a <b>crown</b> <b>fire,</b> termed crowning, {{is dependent on}} the density of the suspended material, canopy height, canopy continuity, sufficient surface and ladder fires, vegetation moisture content, and weather conditions during the blaze. Stand-replacing fires lit by humans can spread into the Amazon rain forest, damaging ecosystems not particularly suited for heat or arid conditions.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to recognise that our findings and those of Wardell-Johnson (2000) relate to fires within the lowest decile of potential fire intensity recorded in tall eucalypt forest (Cruz et al. 2012).

30|$|Extensive even-aged {{stands of}} ponderosa pine can {{probably}} {{be accounted for}} by the past occurrence of severe <b>crown</b> <b>fires,</b> by severe epidemics of tree-killing insects such as the defoliating white-pine butterfly (Neophasia menapia Felder), or by the occurrence of extensive windthrows caused by cyclonic winds. Subsequent to the insect killings or the windthrows, fires of great intensity often occurred.|$|R

50|$|The tree is {{extremely}} vulnerable to fire, and is damaged by even low-intensity burns. The resinous bark {{is capable of}} igniting quickly, and a <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> will almost certainly kill the tree. However, populations of Pinus longaeva {{are known to be}} extremely resilient, and as a primary succession species, it is believed that populations of the tree would reestablish itself quickly after a fire. That said, large-scale fires are extremely uncommon where the species grows, and are not {{a major factor in the}} species' long-term viability.|$|E
50|$|Fire {{regimes are}} {{characterized}} {{based on their}} frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality. Fire frequency is the average time a fire burns in a given area. Fire intensity {{is the amount of}} heat released over time. Fire extent is the size and spatial similarities of the burning. Fire types or fire spread include ground fire, surface fire, and <b>crown</b> <b>fire.</b> Ground fires use glowing combustion to burn organic matter in the soil. Surface fires burn leaf litter, fallen branches, and ground plants. Crown fires burn through to the top layer of tree foliage. Seasonality is the period of time during the year that the fuels of a specific ecosystem can ignite.|$|E
50|$|When a brushland, woodland, or {{forested area}} is not {{impacted}} by fire {{for a long}} period, large quantities of flammable leaves, branches and other organic matter tend to accumulate {{on the forest floor}} and above in brush thickets. When a forest fire eventually does occur, the increased fuel creates a <b>crown</b> <b>fire,</b> which destroys all vegetation and affects surface soil chemistry. Frequent small 'natural' ground fires prevent the accumulation of fuel and allow large, slow-growing vegetation (e.g. trees) to survive. There is increasing use of controlled burns directed by skilled firefighters, and allowing wildland fires not causing human harm or threat to burn out.|$|E
40|$|In 2013, {{there was}} an {{estimated}} 9, 900 wildland fires that claimed more than 577, 000 acres of land.

Being able to understand fires using laboratory models can better prepare individuals to combat or use fires. Our research focused on chaparral <b>crown</b> <b>fires.</b> Chaparral is a shrub community that blankets 5 % of California land. As a result, it becomes key fuel sources for wildfires. By using chaparral to model <b>crown</b> <b>fires,</b> {{our goal is to}} develop a model that can be deployed for evacuation planning or firefighting in the event of these fires. Laboratory experiments were conducted at the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station. We utilized a wind tunnel equipped with cameras for visualization, arrays of thermocouples, and an in-house developed MATLAB script to analyze experiments. By controlling wind tunnel velocity, fuel moisture content and fuel geometry, we have quantified the fires by their flame heights, flame velocities and fuel consumption rates. Experiments were conducted inside the wind tunnel, with a raised platform for modeling <b>crown</b> <b>fires.</b> Results showed that wind velocity significantly enhances fire intensity and creates a far more destructive flame relative to one without wind. Also, depending on other variables, torching, incomplete burns, or spotting were observed in our experiments. Finally, results were used to validate a Computational Fluid Dynamics program that simulates fires...|$|R
40|$|Bark is a {{vital and}} very visible part of woody plants, yet only {{recently}} has bark characteristics started to be considered as key traits structuring communities and biomes. Bark thickness is very variable among woody plants, and I hypothesize that fire is a key factor selecting for a thick bark, and thus, at the global scale, {{a significant proportion of}} the variability in bark thickness is explained by the variability in fire regimes. Previous research has focused on the importance of bark thickness mainly in surface-fire regimes; here I generalize this idea and present a conceptual framework to explain how the different drivers that affect fire intensity have shaped bark thickness, in conjunction with other plant traits. I first review methods used to study bark thickness and then provide examples of bark thickness patterns {{from a wide range of}} ecosystems subject to different fire regimes (understorey fires, grass-fuelled surface <b>fires,</b> grass-fuelled <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> and infrequent fires). There are some fire regimes that select for thick barks, while some only in the base of the trunk (e. g. understorey fires), others select for a thick bark on the whole plant (e. g. grass-fuelled <b>crown</b> <b>fires).</b> There are also fire regimes in which allocating resources to a thick bark is not adaptive (e. g. woody-fulled <b>crown</b> <b>fires).</b> Fire regime can explain a large proportion of the variability of bark thickness at the global scale, and thus, this trait varies across ecosystems in a predictable manner; however, the current paucity of data limits a fully accurate analysis. © 2014 The Authors.
