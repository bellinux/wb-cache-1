5000|$|Larvae {{of several}} true weevils (Curculionidae) of the {{subfamily}} Lixinae also feed on Centaurea. Some genera [...] - [...] such as Larinus whose larval food is flowerheads [...] - [...] have many species especially adapted to particular knapweeds or starthistle {{and are used}} in biological control too. These include the yellow starthistle flower weevil (L. curtus) for yellow starthistle, lesser knapweed flower weevil (L. minutus) for diffuse knapweed and blunt knapweed flower weevil (L. obtusus) for spotted knapweed. Broad-nosed seedhead weevil (Bangasternus fausti) larvae eat diffuse, spotted and squarrose knapweed (C. virgata ssp. squarrosa), while those of the yellow starthistle <b>bud</b> <b>weevil</b> (B. orientalis) {{do not seem to}} live on anything other than yellow starthistle and occasionally purple starthistle (C. calcitrapa). But perhaps most efficient in destroying developing yellow starthistle seedheads is the larva of the yellow starthistle hairy weevil (Eustenopus villosus). Knapweed root weevil (Cyphocleonus achates) larvae bore into the roots of spotted and to a lesser extentely diffuse knapweed, sometimes killing off the entire plant.|$|R
40|$|Plant {{architectural}} {{characteristics are}} under strong genetic regulation. Economically important traits for forage {{crops such as}} biomass yield, ground cover and persistence can be improved by selecting for particular aerial architectural characteristics. Here, we present an easily applicable method for the spatiotemporal description of branching patterns in red clover (Trifolium pratense) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), {{two of the most}} important forage crops in Europe. A detailed analysis of genotypes with contrasting branching phenotypes demonstrates that in these species different factors are the main determinants of shoot branching characteristics. In red <b>clover,</b> <b>bud</b> outgrowth {{and to a lesser extent}} bud formation explain inter-genotype branching differences. In perennial ryegrass, differences in the capacity to form new buds determined largely the differences between forage and turf types. However,when a set of four forage types was compared in a separate experiment, variation in quantity and pace of bud formation and bud outgrowth explained the differences in aerial architecture. In both crops, branching patterns are likely determined by several processes, and highly branched phenotypes can result from the formation of more buds, an increased probability of bud outgrowth, or a combination of these processes. Furthermore, the presence of more buds is partly caused by more bud outgrowth...|$|R
40|$|Lentil {{is one of}} the world’s most {{important}} food plants and is particularly so in North Africa and South Asia and parts of North America, Europe and Australia. Consequently the crop is exposed to a broad spectrum of insect species {{in a wide variety of}} locations. The management of insect pests of the crop is crucial to optimizing production. The major insect pests of lentil in the field are aphids (Aphis craccivora & Acyrthosiphonpisum), leaf weevils (Sitona spp.), Lygus bugs, (Lygusspp.), and the Cutworm, (Agrotis ipsilon). Several other insect species are considered as minor field pests which are also noteworthy and include Thrips (Thrips, Kakothrips, & Frankiniella), <b>Bud</b> <b>weevils</b> (Apionarrogans), the pea moth, (Cydia nigricana), pod borers, (Helicoverpa armigera & Heliothis spp.), Lima-bean pod borer, (Etiella zinckenella), root aphids (Smynthurodes betae) and leaf miners (Liriomyza spp. and Phytomyza spp.). The most serious and frequently encountered insect pests of the stored grain are Bruchus ervi and B. lentis with Callosobruchus chinensis and C. maculatus also widespread. This chapter describes the morphology, lifecycle and crop damage caused by each of the insects pest species on lentil and provides detailed descriptions of management options for each species with references for each recommended action. For most insect species the use of pesticides is the primary management option. However, for some species, there are known sources of host plant resistance, as well as other integrated pest management options including biological control (e. g., beneficial insect predators and biological pesticides) and cultural practices, that can be used to help manage the pests and where known these are also described...|$|R
40|$|The clover seed weevils Apion fulvipes Geoffroy, 1785 and Apion trifolii L., 1768 (Coleoptera: Apionidae) cause major {{losses to}} seed {{production}} of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), respectively. Clover is important as animal forage and {{an alternative to}} inorganic fertilizers. Because clover is mainly pollinated by bees, the use of insecticides in management of these weevils is discouraged. To gain basic knowledge for development of alternative management strategies, we investigated weevil field abundance over two growing seasons, as well as feeding and olfactory host preferences by A. fulvipes and A. trifolii. Field trap catches in southern Sweden revealed that white clover was dominated by A. fulvipes and red clover by A. trifolii. For both weevil species, female catches were positively correlated {{to the number of}} <b>clover</b> <b>buds</b> and flowers in the field. In feeding and olfactory bioassays, females of A. fulvipes and A. trifolii showed a preference for T. repens and T. pratense, respectively. However, the feeding preference was lost when the antennae were removed, indicating a significant role of olfaction in host choice. Male weevils of both species did not show clear olfactory or feeding preferences for host plant species. The field study and laboratory bioassays demonstrate that, at least for female weevils, olfaction is important for selection of host plants. We discuss these novel results in the context of managing these important pests of clover by exploiting olfaction and behavioral attraction to host plant volatiles...|$|R
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{performed}} a pest categorisation of the strawberry <b>bud</b> <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus signatus Say, (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), for the EU. A. signatus is a well-defined and distinguishable species, recognised as a pest of strawberry (Fragaria) fruit production in eastern North America {{where it is}} also a pest of Rubus. There are reports of A. signatus associated with non-rosaceous plants such as Mentha, Nepeta, Rhododendron and Solidago although whether such plants are true hosts is uncertain. This pest categorisation focuses on Fragaria and Rubus as hosts. Anthonomus signatus is not known to occur in the EU. It is listed in Annex IIAI of Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. The international trade in Fragaria and Rubus plants for planting provides a potential pathway to introduce A. signatus from North America. Considering climatic similarities between North America and the EU, the thermal biology of A. signatus and host distribution in the EU, A. signatus has the potential to establish within the EU. There would be one generation per year, as in North America. As a pest of field grown Fragaria and Rubus, A. signatus would not be expected to establish in EU glasshouses. In North America, adults clip developing buds, preventing fruit development and reducing yield. Losses are variable and depend on the cultivars attacked. Severe crop losses have been reported. However, some Fragaria cultivars can compensate the loss of buds, e. g. by increasing the weight of fruits developing on remaining buds. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of introduction of A. signatus from North America. All criteria assessed by EFSA for consideration as a potential Union quarantine pest are met. As A. signatus is not known to occur in the EU, this criterion assessed by EFSA to consider it as a Union regulated non-quarantine pest is not met...|$|R
40|$|The host {{specificity}} of many weevils makes them ideal biological control agents of weeds. A flower <b>bud</b> <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus tenebrosus Boheman, {{is currently being}} investigated as a biological control agent of tropical soda apple, Solanum viarum Dunal, an invasive weed that is spreading {{throughout much of the}} southeast United States. An efficient rearing system was developed for A. tenebrosus. This system allowed us to rear more than 30 generations in the laboratory with 7 to 8 generations occurring per year. Under these conditions, the egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages of the weevil were completed in 4. 2 +- 0. 9, 10. 7 +- 1. 9, 5. 2 +- 1. 2, and 20. 4 +- 8. 3 days, respectively. Feeding and oviposition on artificial diets also was evaluated. An artificial diet suitable for adult A. tenebrosus was formulated by modifying an existing boll weevil (A. grandis Boheman) diet. The influence of diet components on feeding and oviposition of A. tenebrosus was investigated. Ten existing Anthonomus spp. diets were evaluated for diet presentation (color, shape, and texture), protein content, host plant material, and levels of carbohydrates, lipids, sterols, solasodine, proline, bee pollen, and anti-oxidation agents. The formation of cone shaped diet capsules and the addition of sucrose, host plant material, lipids, and proline elicited marked feeding responses. However, oviposition was and continues to be a problem on the diet. We also examined whether larvae of A. tenebrosus could be reared on the same diet. Unfortunately, larval survivorship on the diet was poor. The adult diet did not provide sufficient nutrients or feeding stimulants for complete larval development. Additional research is needed to improve the production of these weevils on an artificial diet...|$|R
40|$|Red clover is {{a highly}} productive, protein-rich fodder crop, with more “bypass” {{proteins}} and more digestible fibres than alfalfa providing more energy dense forage to lactating dairy cows diets. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of inoculation of three red clover cultivars with two strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, as well as the effect of cutting them in two different maturity stages on yield and chemical composition. Delaying harvest time of red <b>clover</b> from early <b>budding</b> to early flowering increased DM yield in two out of three cultivars in the sowing year, and in all three cultivars in the last year of study. An increase in relative proportion of stem in total DM yield, and a reduction in the relative proportion of leaf and flowers in all three years of research was observed. Cutting of red clover in the early budding stage resulted in 15. 4 % more crude protein content than in the early flowering, whereas differences in neutral and acid detergent fibre were not significant. Red clover cultivars showed significant variation in all traits, while inoculation had no significant effect on any trait of red clover...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of food item availability on boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, feeding and reproduction {{was determined by}} providing different numbers of cotton squares (flower <b>buds)</b> to individual <b>weevils.</b> Squares were replaced daily after a 5 -d feeding and mating conditioning period. The number of lifetime punctures produced by boll weevil females and males increased with square availability. The total number of punctures caused by boll weevil females was 2. 7 -fold higher than that caused by males. Fecundity was significantly higher in the 10 : 1, 15 : 1, and 20 : 1 (squares:female) treatments than in the 1 : 1 treatment. The relationship between eggs laid per day and the square to female ratio significantly changed {{over the life of}} the female, with the largest differences among treatments occurring in the first 3 wk of adulthood. Survival of weevil progeny to adulthood was about two-fold higher in the 10 : 1, 15 : 1, and 20 : 1 treatments than in the 1 : 1 and 5 : 1 treatments. When each boll weevil female was provided 10, 15, or 20 cotton squares per day, estimates of a population growth index (percent of immatures surviving to adulthood divided by immature development time) and the exponential rate of increase (rm) were significantly higher than for those provided only one or five squares per day. Boll weevil populations maintained at a square:weevil ratio of 10 : 1 or above will increase 3 ̆e 60 -fold each generation (Ro), a rate significantly higher than that exhibited under 5 : 1 or 1 : 1 square:female regimens. These data show that daily provision of 10 squares per female provides sufficient resources to elicit a maximal oviposition response in the laboratory. Our results also will be useful in predicting changes in boll weevil populations relative to crop phenology and starting population density...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} growing is increasing world-wide, but knowledge concerning best practice is generally empirical rather than field-based. This thesis extends knowledge concerning best practice in Swedish organic strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa (Duch)) production, which is usually based on a two-year crop. A series of four field experiments were conducted at Rånna Experimental Station (58 ° 27 ’N, 13 ° 51 ’E) on the strawberry cultivars ‘Honeoye’, ‘Cavendish’ and ‘Korona’. Specific objectives were to investigate: the effects of different organic fertilisers combined with degradable plastic mulch on plant establishment, yield and nitrogen mineralisation in soil; the efficiency of biological pest control using a predatory mite against strawberry mites (Phytonemus pallidus); innate within-field dispersal capacity of strawberry mite; the effects of pyrethrum combined with fleece covering on damage by strawberry blossom weevil (Anthonomus rubi). Plant establishment measured as fruit yield was improved by 60 % when degradable plastic mulch was used, probably through more flowers being initiated. Additional applications of organic fertiliser during the cropping period {{had little effect on}} yield. Biological control using the predatory mite Neoseiulus cucumeris reduced strawberry mite populations by up to 50 % but there was no increase in yield. It was difficult to draw clear conclusions from the strawberry mite dispersal pilot study, but mites tended to move more easily along planted rows than between rows. Pyrethrum alone had no visible effect on flower bud damage by strawberry blossom weevil but when combined with fleece covering it reduced the number of ‘Honeoye’ <b>buds</b> damaged by <b>weevils</b> by approximately 10 %. This was followed by a corresponding increase in cultivar yield. Similar effects were not recorded in the other cultivar examined. The study identified the following practical consequences for organic strawberry production: • Choice of pest-resistant cultivars is extremely important for success. • Use of clean plants and an efficient predatory species is essential in controlling mite infestations. • Use of degradable plastic mulching is recommended. • Fleece covering is recommended for protecting some cultivars against strawberry blossom weevils. • Only an initial starter fertilisation is required. • Use of pyrethrum is not recommended...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene (C 2 H 4) {{biosynthesis}} {{has been}} investigated during leaf ontogeny in white clover (Triforium repens L. cv. Glassland challenge, genotype 10 F) with a particular emphasis on {{the production of the}} hormone in the apex and newly initiated leaves (designated as leaves 1 and 2). In these developing tissues, a relatively higher rate (5 to 6 -fold) of ethylene production (0. 5 to 0. 9 nL C 2 H 4 gFwt- 1 hr- 1) was associated with a higher accumulation (1. 5 -fold) of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC), when compared with mature green leaves. Genes encoding the ethylene biosynthetic enzymes, ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) have been cloned to characterise ethylene biosynthesis at the molecular level. The partial protein-coding regions of ACS genes have been cloned using reverse transcriptase-dependent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with degenerate nested primers using cDNA templates from RNA isolated either the apex or leaf 2. These ACS genes were identified and designated as TRACS 1, TRACS 2 and TRACS 3. TRACS 1 (680 bp) is 72 % and 64 % homologous to TRACS 2 (674 bp) and TRACS 3 (704 bp), respectively, and TRACS 2 and TRACS 3 are 63 % homologous, in terms of nucleotide sequence. TRACS 1 shows highest homology with PS-ACS 2, an ACS cloned from etiolated pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings which is induced by IAA and wounding. TRACS 2 shows highest homology with MI-ACS 1, an ACS cloned from mature mango (Mangifera indica) fruit. TRACO 3 shows highest homology with VR-ACS 7, an ACS cloned from etiolated hypocotyls of mung bean (Vigna radiata) and also PS-ACS 1, an ACS cloned from etiolated pea seedlings which is induced by IAA, but not by wounding. The TRACS 3 gene was expressed as a 1. 95 kb transcript mainly in the apex and newly initiated leaves as determined by northern analysis. TRACS 1 has not been detected in the tissues examined. The expression of TRACS 2 has not been determined. Three ACO genes, comprising ca. 1100 bp of the protein-coding region and 3 '-untranslated region (3 '-UTR) have been cloned using a combination of RT-PCR and 3 '-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3 '-RACE), and designated as TRACO 1, TRACO 2 and TRACO 3. Comparison of a 813 bp protein-coding region of TRACO 1, generated by RT-PCR using degenerate primers on cDNA templates from RNA isolated from the apex shows 77 % and 75 % homology to the protein-coding region sequences of TRACO 2 (804 bp) and TRACO 3 (816 bp), respectively, generated by RT-PCR using degenerate primers on cDNA templates from RNA isolated from leaf 2. The TRACO 2 and TRACO 3 protein-coding region sequences show 84 % homology. The technique of 3 '-RACE generated 3 '-UTR sequences of 301 bp (TRACO 1), 250 bp (TRACO 2), and 92 bp (TRACO 3) each amplified using mRNA extracted from the apex. The 92 bp 3 '-UTR of TRACO 3 {{has been shown to be}} a truncated version of a 324 bp sequence amplified from TRACO 3 expressed in senescent leaf tissue of white clover (Dr. D. Hunter, IMBS, Massey University, personal communication), and it is this full-length version that was used in further experiments. The 3 '-UTR sequences of the three ACO genes are more divergent, when compared with the protein-coding regions, showing 61 %, 55 %, and 59 % homology between TRACO 1 and TRACO 2, TRACO 1 and full-length TRACO 3, and TRACO 2 and full-length TRACO 3, respectively. Using these 3 '-UTR sequences as gene-specific probes, Southern analysis revealed that the three ACO genes are encoded by distinct genes in the white clover genome. Northern analysis, using either protein-coding regions or 3 '-UTRs as probes, determined that the TRACO 1 gene was expressed as a 1. 35 kb transcript almost exclusively in the apex and the TRACO 2 gene was expressed as a 1. 35 kb transcript mainly in newly initiated leaves and mature green leaves, with maximum expression in newly initiated leaves. This pattern of gene expression coincides with the high rate of ethylene production from the apex and newly initiated leaves in white clover. The apex tissue-specific TRACO 1 gene was also detected in axillary buds, and the mature leaf-associated TRACO 2 gene was expressed in other mature vegetative tissues, including internodes, nodes and petioles. Both TRACO 1 and TRACO 2 genes are highly expressed in roots. TRACO 3 gene expression was not detected in apex and mature green leaf tissues examined using the 3 '-UTR gene-specific probe, but two transcripts (1. 17 kb and 1. 35 kb) were visualised using the protein-coding region probe and with an extended exposure time. ACO enzyme activity, in vitro, was highest in just fully expanded mature green leaves (leaf 3 and leaf 4) during leaf ontogeny in white <b>clover.</b> Apex, axillary <b>bud</b> and floral bud tissues show a relatively higher enzyme activity, when compared with mature nodes and internode tissues, but lower than that measured in petiole tissue. Highest activity of ACO, in vitro, has been detected in root extracts. Polyclonal antibodies, raised against the TRACO 1 gene product expressed in E. coli, recognised a high molecular weight (ca. 205 kD) protein complex with highest accumulation in the apex. This complex was also detected in axillary bud, floral bud, and leaf 1 tissue. Immunoaffinity-based purification of the ca. 205 kD protein was carried out to obtain sufficient protein for amino acid sequencing. However, no sequence was obtained. Polyclonal antibodies, raised against the TRACO 2 gene product in E. coil, recognised ACO protein (ca. 36 kD) in newly initiated leaves and mature green leaves as well as petioles and roots. This recognition pattern coincides with ACO enzyme activity, in vitro, as well as TRACO 2 gene expression in the tissue. Expression of the TRACO 2 and TRACO 3 genes has been characterised in response to a combination of wounding, ethylene, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), and 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) treatments using mature green leaves. Expression of TRACO 2 gene is enhanced in response to ethylene and IAA. Ethylene-induced TRACO 2 gene expression was not blocked by 1 -MCP. Expression of TRACO 3 was induced in response to wounding in mature green leaves. Wound-induced TRACO 3 gene expression was not induced by the ethylene produced in the leaf tissue, indicating ethylene-independent ACO expression in the wounded leaves. Induction of either TRACO 2 by IAA treatment or TRACO 3 by wounding was delayed with AVG treatment of mature green tissue, suggesting that changes in ACS activity in the tissue is associated with induction of ACO gene expression...|$|R
