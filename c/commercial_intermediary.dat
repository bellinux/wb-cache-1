40|$|One {{aspect of}} the old ideological {{heritage}} that Soviet proponents of transition to a market system must overcome is the common association of trade or commercial activity with "speculation. " The latter term, in the Soviet public mind, is commonly identified with the activities of <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> or middlemen. The opening article in our current issue, "The Market: Trade? Speculation?" by V. Mashits and Ia. Chernysheva, illustrates how some of the current economic literature is attempting to counter this view. The authors elaborate the argument that in a market economy the activities of <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> (>i>torgovo-posrednicheskaia deiatel'nost'>/i>) provide indispensable signals in guiding the production and marketing decisions of enterprises. Speculation, for Mashits and Chernysheva, or at least speculation in its "wild" forms, is a problem associated not with the market as such but with "undeveloped, unorganized, monopolized markets. " Thus every step by Soviet society toward "modern market structures" would represent movement away from "wild" forms of speculation. Soviet society suffers not from the activity of middlemen but from the fact that, having been driven underground, such activity becomes "a game without rules. " The significance of this defense of <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> is heightened by its appearance in >i>Kommunist>/i>, a principal theoretical organ of the party's Central Committee. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{commercial}} intermediation is {{a complex}} juridical operation which includes a different number of juridical relationships that takes place between contractual partners either on a national or international level. These partners bare different naming due to their different set of rights and obligations set forth by the law or by the parties, and it is from this that the classification of the intermediation can be set forth. The commercial intermediation represents the activity that one person executes either in the name and on behalf of another person, or using its own name but on behalf of another person, or, finally, using its own name but on behalf of acting towards a common goal with the person who mandated her (the principal), in relation with who it is either a proxy or an independent intermediary, only negotiating or both negotiating and binding the principal. The purpose of the paper is to strictly define and set in order the various variations of the juridical operation that is the commercial intermediation, presented both {{in the light of}} the actual legal framework and also by reference to the New Civil Code.

40|$|The {{revocation}} of {{an agent}} frequently {{raises the question}} of the legal basis for the right to indemnity by agent so revoked. The existence of such a right as well as the determination of the amount of the indemnity depend {{on the nature of the}} relationship between the agent and his client. In the case of an independent agent, this relationship is of a special nature. His function differs from that of a servant and that of an independent trader, who are both currently called agents. The indépendant agent deals with third parties for a client, but does not himself supply the goods and services in which he trades. The indépendant agent, to whom is recognized the status of <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediary,</b> has a function which is characterized by his own obligational contents. He brings to the execution of his work the duties of a professional. He is subject to an obligation of diligence and, because of his professional status, incurs a certain liability towards the third party he deals with. The qualification of mandate, often given to his contract, cannot take into account the extensive obligations imposed on the agent, particularly the fact that he makes a profession of his agency and that he has a special interest in the success of the affair he négociâtes. The reference to rules of a civil nature in matters that relate to business creates some confusion. The nature of the relationship between the agent and his client is challenged by the notion of common interest which grants to the agent a right to keep up the contract and maintain goodwill. The proposition of the Civil Code Revision Office for the revision of the legal categories has the advantage of giving new definitions to contracts which are characterized by the autonomy of the obligee in the execution. In the case of the independent agent, it will favour a qualification more adequate of the relationship between him and his client. The revocation of the agent would then be treated like the revocation in other contracts in which work is done in the interest of the other party...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, the Chinese {{government}} replaced strict control over outmigration with measures of ‘infrastructural governance’. Instead of dictating who can and who cannot leave, the state manages migration by influencing the sociotechnical conditions of mobility, for instance by defining what responsibilities <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> should shoulder and what training a migrant should receive before departure. This article unpacks infrastructural governance {{by examining the}} working of ‘base’, or jidi in Chinese. A base is a tight cluster {{of public and private}} institutions in a labour source place, designated by the government as an important player in the recruitment of migrant workers. The base manages migration by conditioning the activities that lead to migration, such as how people choose destinations, make payments, and deal with uncertainties in preparing for migration. The base also works on migrants’ relations with family members, village cadres and fellow migrants in order to shape their mobilities. The ethnographic research on the base shows that, infrastructural governance regulates migration effectively, but makes migration more complicated and more costly for the migrants.

The first Sharia-compliant bank {{was established in}} Egypt in 1963, yet {{it is only in}} the 1970 s that Islamic finance started to develop in its current form, through the creation of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). Today, the Islamic financial market extends far beyond just Muslim countries, even though the Persian Gulf region and Southeast Asia are now the hubs of this ever-growing economy. The Islamic market represents close to dollars 1 trillion (1, 000 billion dollars) invested throughout the world (Divanna & Hancock, 2013). Islamic finance is classified as an ethical form of banking since it is based, at least in theory, on a series of principles that aim to restore the balance between the risks assumed by the capital provider and the borrowers. The introduction of the Riba, which somewhat covers the Western understanding of interest, is the fundamental principle for Islamic banks. Other rules also limit operations in these banks: profit and loss must be shared; uncertainty (Gharar) is prohibited, as are investments in business fields considered to be illicit. Consequently, the principles of operation of the Islamic financial system are markedly different from those of the traditional system. Islamic banks have a role in financial intermediation, but this intermediation is achieved differently, as all operations are dependent on an underlying asset. The bank plays a part as <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediary</b> between sellers and buyers, like in murabahah or ijarah-wal-iqtina operations. It can also this ever-growing economy.

The bank plays a part as <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediary</b> between sellers and buyers, like in murabahah or ijarah-wal-iqtina operations. It can also act as a commercial partner, as in mudarabah and musharakah contracts. In this respect, the traditional approach of banking intermediation is ineffective, because in Islamic financial institutions, the asset does not comprise loans with predetermined revenue but the bank’s contribution to the financing (musharakah and mudarabah) or sales with a profit margin (murabahah, ijarah, etc.). Different operating principles require specific prudential, financial or accounting standards. Various international regulation organizations deal with the standard setting of the rules of Islamic finance, such as the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) or the IDB. The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) is responsible for producing accounting standards for Islamic financial institutions (IFAS). These standards intend to take into account specific financial and moral principles applicable to Islamic banks. This study intends to verify if this really is the case. In : this book about Organizational Change and Global Standardization: Solutions to Standards and Norms Overwhelming Organizations takes an organizational change approach to the overflow of standards and norms, looking at how to deal effectively and ethically with four kinds of standards and norms businesses face when they go global: (1) accounting & finance (2) international & world trade,(3) social and (4) safety & quality & environment. It is part of a larger problem faced by not only business, but every sort of organization - how to live with the epidemic of standards and norms, often in conflict, many just unnecessary, and a few that are quite helpful and important. There are good reasons to have International Standards Organization (ISO), International Labor Organization (ILO), World Trade Organization (WTO), North Atlantic Treaty Association (NAFTA), International accounting Standards Boards (IASB), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)), and many more standard-setting organizations issuing, auditing, proposing codes of ethics, and certifying standards and norms. However, there are important, poorly understood organizational change consequences to the contagion of standards and norms. This volume brings together a unique group of authors who are working on a pragmatic way for organizations to deal with an overflow of standards and norms that are often at heads, ambiguous, or simply created to produce more work for a burgeoning standards setting industry. The aim of Organizational Change and Global Standardization is to stimulate a critical analysis within the framework of analytical and pragmatic approach to an overwhelming bureaucratization of the managed and organized global activities...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} a {{study of}} agrarian change in one highland, ex-hacienda locality in the Cochabamba region of Bolivia and documents a process of agricultural intensification and crop specialisation amongst small producers. The thesis demonstrates that. Since the Agrarian Reform, a process of commoditization has transformed the locality, leading to its incorporation into the regional economy as a major producer of potatoes. It examines {{the role played by}} a dynamic sector of truck operators and <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in stimulating this process. The thesis reconstructs the emergence of the hacienda, and the forms of production which co-existed on the estate. It documents the implementation of the Agrarian Reform and the distribution of land titles to ex-labour-rent tenants which consolidated the pattern of usufruct holdings and consequently formalised inequality between households. The contemporary situation is characterised by an intensive farming system which places considerable demands upon local environmental resources. The thesis conducts a detailed analysis of the existing pattern of land ownership, labour relationships and the distribution of other productive resources, to demonstrate that access to the means of production, control over the production process and disposal of the fruits of labour are highly uneven between households. However, inequality in the control over agricultural operations, besides the movement of labour from poor to rich households, do not by themselves provide sufficient evidence of differentiation between units. The thesis examines other dimensions which {{play a vital role in}} determining the social and economic trajectory of households. These include the role played by non-agricultural economic activities and the organisational structure of households. The thesis demonstrates the value of moving beyond the boundaries that conventionally define the analysis of household production, in order to examine dynamics within the domestic unit.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{two important}} features of many copyright fair use cases: transformative use and commercial intermediation. While {{the issue of}} transformative use has arisen in many fair use cases, {{there is a lack}} of consistency and clear guidance on the meaning of “transformativeness” and how the degree of transformativeness is to be assessed. Additionally, in analyzing commercial use, courts have largely failed to appreciate the distinctive role played by “commercial intermediaries” in facilitating socially beneficial uses of copyrighted works. This Article advances economically grounded proposals for improving the way in which courts analyze transformative use and commercial intermediation. First, courts should focus on the economic effects of transformation instead of employing a purely conceptual analysis. In particular, courts should ascertain any complementary or substitutive effects as well as the cost and innovative-efficiency implications of the use: the more transformative the use, the more it tends to minimize market harm to the copyright owner and maximize social benefits such as transaction-cost economies and follow-on innovation. Second, courts should view <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> favorably insofar as they facilitate educational or other beneficial fair uses of copyrighted works through cost-efficient production or substantial innovative investments. In other words, courts should view the commercial use in context and recognize that commercial uses may nonetheless produce social benefits that substantially outweigh any harm caused to copyright owners. This Article uses the 2013 Google Books decision as a primary case study, supplemented by related cases from the United States and abroad, to illustrate these arguments, concluding that the court’s decision to uphold Google’s fair use defense for Google Books is well-supported by the complementary relationship between Google Books and copyrighted books, Google’s substantial investments in promoting productive uses of books through Google Books, and transaction-cost and innovative-incentive considerations. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{seeks to}} develop an {{alternative}} conceptual framework through which to understand international finance. It then applies this framework {{to the case of}} China’s recent official foreign exchange accumulation. One view of international financial relations suggests an agenda of state-to-state financial relations, especially in terms of financial power relations between nations (Andrews et. al. 2006). Another view suggests that finance, while being globally mobile, expresses clear national characteristics such that the aggregation of financial transactions will tell a coherent national story, such as a story of mercantile policy rooted in national trade and payments imbalances (Goldstein 2004). This thesis develops an explanatory critique of these approaches, and suggests an alternative theoretical approach to understanding international financial relations. It does this by augmenting a theory of international financial intermediation — understood as a socially determined, value-chain driven process of cross-border and crosscurrency financial transformation by and through international financial intermediary institutions(Scholtens and Van Wensveen 2003) — with a strategic relational approach to state policy. This framework is then applied with a view to understanding the development of a process of official foreign exchange accumulation by China’s monetary authorities. It seeks to account for why Chinese official reserve accumulation has predominately taken the form of US dollar assets, and to explain recent pressures and responses by China’s authorities to their official US dollar ‘liquidity dilemma’. This thesis argues that the recent pattern and level of China’s foreign exchange accumulation is primarily a secondary by-product of other foreign exchange, monetary and financial risk-mitigation objectives which operate {{in the context of a}} rising structural surplus and rising inflows of foreign exchange liquidity. Finally, despite the popular view, this pattern of recent official reserve accumulation has been a relatively durable two-way international financial intermediary relationship. China’s authorities will continue to accumulate US government debt securities unless they decide to ‘float’ the exchange rate. Even then, while the cross-border intermediaries would change — from official to <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> — the pattern of international asset accumulation is likely to continue...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} charts {{the social}} interactions, work experiences, and routes traveled by Asian workers {{within and between}} the colonial Philippines and Mexico between 1571 and 1720. Residents of early colonial Mexico called these workers chinos. Most free chinos were Filipinos, but enslaved chinos had origins all over Asia. Chinos crossed the Pacific on the Manila galleons, which sailed between the Philippines and Mexico. These ships facilitated the exchange of American products, mostly silver, for Asian products, primarily textiles. This study explores the social and spatial mobility of chinos to show how trade between and within the Americas and Asia opened {{a new chapter in}} the social history of the early modern world. This project expands the study of Latin American history in three ways. First, it analyzes the ways in which chinos, especially Filipinos, created and sustained colonial Mexico as part of a Pacific world, advancing scholarship that already celebrates Mexico as part of an Atlantic world. Next, this work develops the study of economic history by comparing the ways that chinos shaped and connected different regions of colonial Mexico by employing Southeast Asian labor organization and technology. Thirdly, this dissertation refines studies of ethnicity by considering the ways that chinos, especially free laborers, represented themselves as members of a new corporate group in colonial Mexico, and appropriated the ethnic category of "indio," originally established for indigenous people in the Americas. They used these categories to claim resources from the colonial state, to form social networks, and to create bases for collective action. This work advances the field of early modern global and world history. It analyzes the Philippines and Pacific New Spain as arenas of cross-cultural interaction, labor, migration, and production in their own right, rather than as mere <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> mediating between East Asia and the Americas. Finally, this work considers the ways that the long history of interactions between Island Southeast Asia and the rest of Asia shaped the mobility of chinos, while also situating their trans-Pacific interactions within the institutions of the global tributary empire of the Spanish Habsburgs...|$|R

These were through engaging in long term sexual liaisons with white men, bearing mulatto children, and becoming the <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> between the two communities. These roles meant that slave women filtered information, culture, and money {{back and forth between the}} two communities. Gender was an important determinant in the experience of a slave, Slave women were subject not only to exhaustive work routines and punishment, but also to sexual exploitation and the extra burden of reproduction. Gender also played a role in the opportunities a slave had to escape from the field. Field slaves were assigned work in a largely genderless way, however, positions of authority, such as driver, were reserved for male slaves. Slave occupations away from the field were also gender biased, with women working in the house and as marketers, and men pursuing the trades. This bias was based on white gender assumptions, and effectively limited the ability of women to escape from the field. The sexual exploitation of slave women was common in Jamaica. While most women gained nothing from sexual liaisons with white men, a small number were able to turn their exploitation to their advantage, and gain an improved lifestyle and position. Slave women played an important role within the slave community. As bearers of tradition they had an important role in the preservation and retention of a separate slave culture with African influences. Slave women were the primary care givers to children, however, Thistlewood's diary suggests that slave men were also important in the upbringing of the children. The experiences of Thistlewood and those he mentions in his diary give us an ideal place to centre wider debates concerning the nature of slave and master interaction, and the role and position slave women played...|$|R

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 {{initiated}} the Nanban trade period, with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the arquebus, European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this <b>commercial</b> vacuum as <b>intermediaries</b> between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk. However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.|$|R

40|$|We {{combine the}} income and capital {{accounts}} of financial <b>intermediaries</b> (<b>commercial</b> banks) and of non-financial firms and households {{to obtain a}} full accounting {{of the value of}} services provided by commercial banks to both depositors and borrowers. We track the payments for such services and find no missing items that need to be imputed for. So-called imputation turns out to be integration of the accounts of financial institutions with their borrowers and depositors. We also find that a large fraction of banking services are purely intermediate and thus that the net value-added, after integration, of the commercial banking sector in the total value-added of the economy is small. We also isolate terms that should be in the national accounts to represent the burden of risk-bearing by equity holders (an entry for apparent profits of firms).
