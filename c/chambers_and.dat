5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James <b>Chambers</b> <b>and</b> three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to gamble during this session of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between <b>Chambers</b> <b>and</b> Rowan. The exact nature of the argument is not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E

5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart <b>chambers</b> <b>and</b> valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving <b>chambers,</b> <b>and</b> two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its <b>chambers</b> <b>and</b> ensures blood flows {{in the correct}} direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but {{toward the end of the}} ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of <b>chamber</b> <b>and</b> propellant feed temperatures on the starting characteristics of hydrogen peroxide thrust chambers. Start delay times for two types of thrust chamber designs in the 1 - to 24 -pound-thrust range were obtained over a range of <b>chamber</b> <b>and</b> propellant feed temperatures from 30 to 100 F. Start delay times obtained during the first minute of catalyst bed life and again after 6 minutes of total accumulated running time are presented as a function of <b>chamber</b> <b>and</b> propellant feed temperatures. The initial cold-start delay time of the hydrogen peroxide thrust chambers investigated was approximately 0. 150 second to attain 90 percent of steady-state chamber pressure at <b>chamber</b> <b>and</b> propellant feed temperatures of 70 F and above. Both thrust chamber designs could be started at <b>chamber</b> <b>and</b> propellant feed temperatures as low as 30 F; start delay times did, however, generally increase at low temperatures. When the chamber was at an elevated temperature from a preceding firing, the start delay time was reduced to approximately 0. 050 second, indicating a marked effect of chamber temperature at constant propellant feed temperatures. Accumulated run time affected the starting characteristics only when both the <b>chamber</b> <b>and</b> propellant feed temperatures were at reduced levels.
