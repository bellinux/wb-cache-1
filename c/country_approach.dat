If you are fan of Jim Croce, this contemporary <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> to his material may win you over, although it will undoubtedly lack {{the appeal of the}} music as delivered by its original author. If you are a fan of neither, this is not a disc you will want to own." ...|$|E
50|$|In August 1996, Albany Broadcasting (forerunner to today's Pamal Broadcasting) {{purchased}} WCDA, put the WPTR {{calls the}} company retained from their sale of 1540 AM, and relaunched the station under a classic-heavy <b>country</b> <b>approach.</b> After 18 months of struggling ratings, the station relaunched on November 3, 1997 as New country Power Country 96.3 after {{a weekend of}} Halloween-related stunting. The relaunch {{had no effect on}} its ratings as the station languished {{at the bottom of the}} ratings even with rights to Siena College men's basketball and New York Yankees baseball.|$|E
5000|$|The {{show was}} {{presented}} as two self-contained sets. [...] Hill would perform first, followed by a short intermission and then McGraw would take the stage. In a sense Hill was still an opening act for McGraw, as the applause generally indicated {{that the majority of}} the audience was clearly there to see McGraw. [...] The couple's music was very different at this stage of their careers, as Hill was exploring pop, techno and programmed drums, and 1960s retro sounds, while McGraw stuck to his more mainstream <b>country</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E

50|$|Production of {{food crops}} {{does not meet}} Senegal's needs. The {{production}} of major staple food crops covers barely 30% of consumption needs. Only in years of favorable rainfall does the <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> self-sufficiency in millet and sorghum, the basic staples with rice. The livestock population includes approximately 3.1 million cattle and 8.7 million sheep and goats. Cattle are reared extensively and on a small-scale basis. Poultry production has increased and has great potential for growth. Despite a significant livestock population, Senegal remains a net importer of meat, especially sheep (live) during major holidays and religious events.|$|E
5000|$|After album rock station KILT-FM flipped {{to country}} in 1981, the station saw fierce {{competition}} throughout the 1980s and early 1990s from the KILT combo. More competition came when KKBQ switched from easy country to a top 40 <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> in 1992. KIKK became KILT's sister station in late 1993, and KIKK struggled trying different {{variations on the}} format, including going from mainstream country to a more current-heavy approach in September 1994, then going {{head to head with}} KKBQ as [...] "Young Country 95.7" [...] by early 1997, and eventually rebranding as just [...] "95.7 KIKK-FM" [...] by September 2000.|$|E
5000|$|Rice, millet and sorghum are {{the main}} {{subsistence}} food crops for Senegal's rural population. Corn and fonio are also important cereal crops. Production of cereal food crops, such as rice, millet, corn and sorghum - which is often grown in rotation with peanuts - does not meet Senegal's needs. Only in years of good rainfall does the <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> self-sufficiency in millet, corn, sorghum and fonio, the main staples in rural areas. Local production increased significantly in the early 2000s following the government's decision to subsidise fertilizer [...] and encourage corn production, and thus reduce reliance upon peanuts.|$|E

40|$|This paper conceptually and empirically {{examines}} sourcing food aid, {{comparing the}} approaches {{promoted by the}} U. S. {{with those of the}} United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU). In the recipient <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> (RCA) promoted by the UN and the EU, Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) suggests that RCA provides faster aid with less transaction costs. In the donor <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> (DCA) practiced by the U. S., the Resource-Based View (RBV) suggests that the superior resources of a donor country assure higher quality, safer, and a plentiful food supply. Using a comparative case analysis with actual data provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), we provide evidence that RCA and DCA as practiced in reality are both sub-optimal. Improved sourcing and transportation options computed through quantitative methods can offer significant benefits over both approaches. We propose a contingency approach that reduces landed costs of food aid by giving governmental relief organizations more flexibility in RCA vs. DCA sourcing, which can be justified by Resource Dependency Theory (RDT). Our findings contribute to the decision-making and policy discussion about the efficiency of governmental food aid programs...|$|E
40|$|Augmented reality creates new {{affordances}} for shopping-related interactions {{because it}} allows consumers to experience a product {{within the context of}} their choice and in a customized way before making a purchasing decision. There is a need to evaluate the potential of this technology and its features in order to integrate it strategically into e- and m-commerce activities. Given that technologies are now developing on a global scale, research should take a multiple <b>country</b> <b>approach.</b> The present study provides qualitative cross-country insights into four European nations and provides guidelines on how to conduct Q-investigations within comparative settings. The results suggest that both divergence and convergence phenomena occur calling for a differentiated approach to target users and to the development of applications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{adopts a}} host <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> to empirically test {{the factors that}} attract {{international}} counterfeiting to European Union. Our empirical tests show that countries’ attractiveness to international counterfeiters is closed linked to corruption. Another finding is that economic development (measured by GDP per capita) is inversely associated with international counterfeiting. Therefore, counterfeiting {{must be seen as}} a public policy issue that affects society as a whole and that needs intervention from both nation-states and international authorities. Other key partners are brand owners, who need to have their own intellectual property protection in place and develop anti-counterfeiting tactics to prevent or reduce trademark counterfeiting. Global mutual cooperation between international companies is also important to lobby governments and politicians in general to ensure more effective enforcement of IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) laws and alert users and consumers about fakes.

40|$|The {{existence}} of systems of indigenous knowledge depend greatly on the {{existence of}} indigenous languages. Processes of language revitalisation seek to uphold indigenous knowledge by restoring endangered indigenous languages. Historical processes of colonisation and globalisation in Chile and Aotearoa New Zealand have impacted and threatened each country's indigenous language. This dissertation describes language revitalisation processes of te reo Maori in Aotearoa New Zealand and Mapudungun in Chile in order to further understand the implications of language on effectively revitalising indigenous culture and knowledge. The research and analysis presented implements comparative methodology through the use of case studies, direct observations, primary and secondary data sources. In an effort to evaluate and compare outcomes of indigenous language revitalisation schemes of te reo Maori in Aotearoa New Zealand and Mapudungun in Chile, this thesis focuses on case studies in the context of how education programmes in each <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> indigenous language revitalisation...|$|E
40|$|Many {{observers}} {{focus on}} the Central Bank balance sheet in order {{to point out the}} excess of liquidity in the banking system as a failure to finance the economy, while banks may also decide to voluntarily hold liquidity above the level required in order to maximize their profit in an uncertain environment. In this paper, we tried to address excess reserves in the CEMAC banking system by looking {{from the point of view}} of commercial banks. By minimising the cost function of each commercial bank, we derived the optimal level of excess liquidity desired by it and consequently for the entire banking system. The result we obtained does not support the existence of excess liquidity in the banking system; furthermore, it approved the <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> implemented by the Central Bank concerning the required reserve coefficient. It is also helpful for the central bank in improving its liquidity supply to the banking system by anticipating the demands of liquidity by commercial banks during open market operations...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the evolution of}} the competition law in Ukraine starting from 1991 until early 2005. This evolution has been closely linked with the creation and transformation of the country, and reflects stages of thinking of economic development and economic policies in general. Until recently, it has also been a typical example of the CIS <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> to the protection of competition. The text starts from the account of the achievements of different stages of Ukraine’s transformation. Then follows the description of subsequent laws governing competition policy in Ukraine and an analysis of factors behind the evolution of competition policy. The paper is focused on changes that happened in the competition law in Ukraine in 2001, primarily because it was the first, after the creation of anti-monopoly law and the competition office, important step marking the introduction of modern competition regulations. Subsequent parts of the study are devoted to the role of international cooperation and to the enforcement and the effectiveness of actions of Anti-Monopoly Committee.

40|$|This article {{looks at}} the law {{applicable}} to copyright infringement on the Internet. In order to do {{so we need to}} look first of all at the rules concerning the applicable law for copyright infringement in general. Here the starting point is the Berne Convention. Its provisions give an indication of the direction in which this debate is going, but we will see that they merely provide starting points. We then move on to the approach in Europe under the Rome II Regulation and here more details become clear. Essentially, the existing rule boils down to a lex loci protectionis approach, which is in conformity with the starting point that is found in the Berne Convention. It is however doubtful whether such a country by <b>country</b> <b>approach</b> can work well in an Internet context and suggestions are made to improve the legal framework by adding a rule for ubiquitous infringement and a de minimis rule. Finally, we also briefly look at the issues surrounding the cross-border portability of online content services and the impact that the current focus on these may have in terms of the choice of law...|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} a {{comparison}} study of how the United States of America and the Republic of Ireland park services manage health and safety in their National Parks. The project looks at the legislation of both countries, how the National Parks approach safety for both employees and visitors and how the two park service’s record incidents. By comparing the two <b>countries</b> <b>approach</b> to health and safety at National Parks {{it should be possible}} to discern if one country has a system that is working better than the other country’s. It then may be possible to use that country’s system as a template for the other country. By analyzing both systems it may be possible to identify issues in the current procedures in health and safety that need to be reassessed. Also, on an international scale the different park services may use this study to adapt their health and safety programme. It was found that the two <b>countries</b> <b>approach</b> health and safety in national parks was in a similar fashion and that the two park services had a system where there was nationallevel guidelines, duties and procedures set in place, but the main health and safety decisions were left up to the individual park managers. This approach leads to variations in how the different parks within the same <b>country</b> <b>approached</b> health and safety. In both countries safety issues are being reexamined at the park services and safety guidelines are being revised. This is mainly due to recent changes in safety legislation. Both of the countries national parks had a low percentage of injuries. However, both of the park services’ methods of recording visitor numbers and incidents mean that the data on injuries area not accurate. It is recommended that both countries’ park services improve their recording system so that they are informed as to where to focus their resources...|$|R
