25|$|Dressed in {{a version}} of the Sarong Kebaya {{designed}} by Pierre Balmain in 1968, the uniform of the Singapore Girl has remained largely unchanged. Stewards previously wore light-blue business jackets and grey trousers. Since June 2008, this has been redesigned by Christophe Galibert, artistic Director of Balmain Uniformes. The new steward's uniform now features a single-breasted navy blue suit (jacket and trousers), a sky blue shirt and different coloured striped ties. The tie colours differentiates the four ranks of cabin crew: inflight supervisor, <b>chief</b> <b>steward(ess),</b> leading steward(ess), and steward(ess).|$|E
2500|$|An {{official}} from Greek Ministry of National Defence {{said the}} plane had entered Greek air space at 14:58 (UTC). The pilots transmitted the hijack squawk code twice at 14:55 (UTC), while the aircraft was cruising about 25kilometres (15mi) north of Thessaloniki. Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato reported that the hijacker slipped into the cockpit with a package {{which could have been}} a bomb when flight attendants opened the cockpit door, and the pilots acted according to the international rules in the matter and did what the hijacker wanted. The flight's captain reported in Istanbul that [...] "while the <b>chief</b> <b>stewardess</b> entered the cockpit to ask if we needed anything, the terrorist entered by force. I tried to push him out but he was a big man and I failed to stop him". The captain {{went on to say that}} the hijacker said he had three friends and they had explosives. He wanted to go Rome to speak with the Pope, and Italian Minister of the Interior Giuliano Amato reported that, the hijacker added there are other hijackers on another unspecified plane, [...] "would blow that plane up if the missive didn't get to the pope". The captain reported to the air-traffic controller in Thessaloniki that [...] "he had two undesirables who wished to go to Italy to see the Pope and to give him a message". Four Greek F-16 fighter jets took off and accompanied the plane until it left Greek airspace. Once in Italian airspace, two Italian F-16s intercepted, escorted, and forced it to land in Brindisi Airport in Brindisi. The airline spokesman said that Greek officials had alerted their Italian counterparts about the hijacking incident.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally women sailed as [...] "merchant seamen" [...] aboard ocean liners {{and larger}} {{passenger}} carrying vessels usually as <b>Chief</b> <b>Stewardesses,</b> Stewardesses or Assistant Stewardesses but also {{working in the}} Laundries and in Nursing (as Nursing Sisters), in child care roles and as Assistants in the on-board shops until the reduction in passenger traffic removed all but a tiny number. Approaching 50 died when their ships were attacked and sunk during World War II. One example was Lily (or Lillie) Ann Green, a Stewardess awarded a King's Commendation for Brave Conduct for her bravery when the ss."Andalucia Star" [...] was torpedoed and sunk off West Africa in 1942.|$|R

50|$|The series {{followed}} the cabin crew at the fictional airline, Air Scotia, {{flying out of}} Prestwick Airport. The crew consisted of the camp, alcohol-loving, narcissistic and vindictive steward, Sebastian; his sex-obsessed colleague Steve; their up-tight, antagonistic <b>chief</b> <b>stewardess,</b> Shona Spurtle; and the eccentric pilot, Captain Hilary Duff.|$|E

50|$|The Antonov AN-24 was leased from Gomelavia {{to operate}} flight 602, captained by highly {{experienced}} Belarusian pilot Matochko Anatoli. The aircraft went missing exactly ten minutes after {{take off from}} Jaffna Airport. The Belarusian crew consisted of Lysaivanov Siarhei (co-pilot), Kozlov Sergei (navigator) and Anapryienka Siarhei (flight engineer). The Lion Air cabin crew were Dharshini Gunasekera (<b>chief</b> <b>stewardess)</b> and Chrishan Nelson (steward) and Vijitha (labourer).|$|E

Some of the first employees were pilots John Schurman (Canadian), Hans Steinbacher & Pim Sierks (Dutch), <b>Chief</b> <b>Stewardess</b> Willy Holmes-Spoelder and her stewardesses: Senior Stewardess Wil Dammers and six carefully selected and trained young women.|$|E
50|$|Vernon Demerest (Dean Martin) is a TGA captain {{scheduled}} to be the checkride captain for the airline to evaluate Captain Anson Harris (Barry Nelson) during its Flight 2 to Rome. TGA's flagship service, named The Golden Argosy, is being operated by a Boeing 707. Although Demerest is married to Bakersfeld's sister, Sarah (Barbara Hale), he is secretly {{having an affair with}} Gwen Meighen (Jacqueline Bisset), <b>chief</b> <b>stewardess</b> on the flight, who informs him before takeoff that she is pregnant with his child.|$|E

50|$|But on one cruise, a moonquake causes an {{underground}} cavern to collapse, upsetting the equilibrium. As the Dust-cruiser Selene passes over, it sinks about 15 metres {{below the surface}} of the dust, hiding the vessel from view, and trapping it beneath the dust. Immediately there are potentially fatal problems for the crew and passengers inside. The sunken Selene has a limited air supply, there is no way for heat generated to escape, communications are impossible, and no one else is sure where Selene has been lost. As precious time begins to run out and the Selene heats up and the air becomes unbreathable, young Captain Pat Harris and his <b>chief</b> <b>stewardess</b> Sue Wilkins try to keep the passengers occupied and psychologically stable while waiting to be rescued. They are helped by a retired space ship captain and explorer, Commodore Hansteen, who is initially traveling incognito.|$|E
