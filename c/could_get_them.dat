25|$|In 2002, Brazil staged the world's first 100% {{electronic}} election {{with over}} 90% of results in within 2 hours. The system is particularly {{suited to a}} country with relatively high illiteracy rates, since it flashes up {{a photograph of the}} candidate before a vote is confirmed.

25|$|In 1929, when California and {{the rest}} of the country plunged into the Great Depression, CSEA was put to the test. Workers became {{plentiful}} and jobs grew scarce. For classified employees (known at the time simply as “non-certificated” workers), the Depression meant an increase in their workday to 12 hours per day, six days a week with wages as low as taxpayers <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> It wasn’t long before impoverished school districts began trimming budgets and classified jobs.|$|E

25|$|In his writings, Tolkien {{depicted}} hobbits as fond of an unadventurous, bucolic {{and simple}} life of farming, eating, and socializing, although capable of defending their homes courageously if the need arises. They would enjoy six meals a day, if they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> They were {{often described as}} enjoying simple food, though {{this seems to be}} of an Oxfordshire style, such as cake, bread, meat, potatoes, ale and tea. They claim to have invented the art of smoking pipe-weed, and according to The Hobbit and The Return of The King it can be found all over Middle-earth.|$|E

As he nears Baker, California, a highway patrolman pulls him over for speeding, and advises him to sleep at a nearby rest stop. Duke instead heads to a payphone and calls Gonzo, learning {{that he has a}} suite in his name at the Flamingo Las Vegas so he can cover a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Duke checks into his suite, only to be met by an LSD-tripping Gonzo, and a young girl by the name of Lucy he has brought with him. Gonzo explains that Lucy has come to Las Vegas to meet Barbra Streisand, and that he gave her LSD on the plane not realizing she had never taken it before.

25|$|The Third Test {{began at}} Chennai on 18 March with high {{expectations}} of a hard-fought series decider. Australia won the toss {{for the third time}} and elected to bat. Hayden batted through the first day for an eventual total of 203, but the rest of Australia's team contributed little to the total of 391. Again, Harbhajan Singh was the destroyer, taking 7–133. India pushed to 501 on the back of Tendulkar's 126. Australia ended day 4 at 241/7, a precarious lead of 131 runs. Early on day 5, Harbhajan again ran through the Australian tail, taking 8–84 and his series tally to an astounding 32 wickets, leaving Australia all out for 264. India had a target of 155 to chase, and plenty of time to do it. The only question was whether Australia's bowlers <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> out first. In 42 nail-biting overs, India steadily lost wickets, sinking to 135/7, a tantalising 20 runs short of victory, but in dire danger of losing their last batsmen before they could score them. The 8th wicket fell at 151, 4 runs short of victory, and it was left to wicket-keeper Sameer Dighe and Harbhajan Singh to see out the end. Harbhajan Singh scored the winning runs past point and sealed the game and an incredible comeback series victory for India. The series victory for India meant that Australia had still not won a series in India for over 30 years.|$|E

His first real job was for {{publishing}} tycoon William Randolph Hearst's organization in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Chicago. He moved to Cleveland in 1913, {{when he was in his}} mid-twenties, to be circulation manager for the Cleveland News. It was a time when circulation battles over newsstands and street corners often turned violent. He started with the News on a $10,000 salary ($ in today's dollars) and was charged with organizing the paper's newsboys. [...] "This meant choosing strong young men comfortable fighting with fists, clubs, knives, chains and, when they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>them,</b> handguns," [...] author Ted Schwarz wrote. [...] "They were the business equivalent of the street gang, and McBride's salary depended on how well he organized his newsboys to avoid losing their corners to one or more violent rivals." ...|$|E

Despite Park’s reservations about Leigh-Mallory’s Big Wing, he ordered {{that it was time}} for it to be tested.

2500|$|The {{restaurant}} also {{instituted a}} [...] "back waiter" [...] system.

The back waiter system was created so that waiters continued to wait on tables rather than spending time in the kitchen waiting for orders to be filled. The Omelet Room {{did not make the}} transition to the new location (as national health campaigns against high cholesterol had reduced demand for foods heavy in eggs). Instead, the basement contained a large private dining room.|$|E
