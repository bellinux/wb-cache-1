40|$|How do humans use {{predictive}} {{contextual information}} to facilitate visual search? How are consistently paired scenic objects and positions learned {{and used to}} more efficiently guide search in familiar scenes? For example, a certain combination of objects can define a context for a kitchen and trigger a more efficient search for a typical object, such as a sink, in that context. A neural model, ARTSCENE Search, is developed to illustrate the neural mechanisms of such memory-based contextual learning and guidance, and to explain challenging behavioral data on positive/negative, spatial/object, and local/distant global cueing effects during visual search. The model proposes how global scene layout at a first glance rapidly forms a hypothesis about the target location. This hypothesis is then incrementally refined by enhancing target-like objects in space as a scene is scanned with saccadic eye movements. The model clarifies the functional roles of neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging data in visual search for a desired goal object. In particular, the model simulates the interactive dynamics of spatial and object contextual cueing in the cortical What and Where streams starting from early visual areas through medial temporal lobe to prefrontal cortex.

The observation that <b>cell</b> <b>area</b> and force generally increase with substrate rigidity suggests that <b>cell</b> <b>area</b> is dictated mechanically, by means of a force-balance between the cell and the substrate. A simple mechanical model, corroborated by experimental measurements of <b>cell</b> <b>area</b> and force is presented to analyze the temporal force balance between the cell and the substrate during spreading. The cell is modeled as a thin elastic disc that is actively pulled by lamellipodia protrusions at the cell front.

Time-resolved, traction force microscopy, combined with measurements of <b>cell</b> <b>area</b> are performed to investigate the simultaneous variations of cell size and force.

We consider ensemble simulations of tessellations generated by points whose regular positions are perturbed through a Gaussian noise controlled by the parameter alpha. We study the number of sides, the area, and the perimeter of the Voronoi cells. For alpha> 0, hexagons are the most common class of cells, and 2 -parameter gamma distributions describe well the statistics of the geometrical characteristics. The symmetry break due to noise destroys the square tessellation, whereas the honeycomb hexagonal tessellation is very stable and all Voronoi cells are hexagon for small but finite noise with alpha 2, results converge to those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The properties of n-sided cells change with alpha until the Poisson-Voronoi limit is reached for alpha> 2.

40|$|AbstractCytoplasmic {{streaming}} in Characean internodes enables rapid intracellular transport and facilitates interactions between spatially remote cell regions. Cyclosis-mediated distant interactions might be particularly noticeable under nonuniform illumination, {{in the vicinity}} of light–shade borders where metabolites are transported between functionally distinct cell regions. In support of this notion, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters assessed on a microscopic area of Chara corallina internodal <b>cells</b> (<b>area</b> of inspection, AOI) responded to illumination of nearby regions in asymmetric manner depending on the vector of cytoplasmic streaming. When a beam of white light was applied through a 400 -μm optic fiber upstream of AOI with regard to the direction of cytoplasmic streaming, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) developed after a lag period in AOI exposed to moderate intensity light. Conversely, no NPQ was induced in the same cell area when the beam position was shifted to an equal distance downstream of AOI. Light–response curves for the efficiency of photosystem II electron transport in chloroplasts differed markedly depending on the illumination pattern (whole-cell versus small area illumination) but these differences were eliminated after the inhibition of cytoplasmic streaming with cytochalasin B. Localized illumination promoted chloroplast fluorescence responses to electrical plasmalemma excitation at high light intensities, which contrasts to the requirement of low to moderate irradiances for observation of the stimulus–response coupling under whole-cell illumination. The results indicate that different photosynthetic capacities of chloroplasts under general and localized illumination are related to lateral transport of nonevenly distributed cytoplasmic components between the cell parts with dominant photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism...|$|E

40|$|Growth {{of human}} {{connective}} tissue progenitor cells (CTPs) was characterized on smooth and microtextured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces. Human bone marrow derived cells were cultured for nine days under conditions promoting osteoblastic differentiation on Smooth PDMS and PDMS Channel microtextures (11 μm high, 45 μm wide channels, and separated by 5 μm wide ridges). Glass tissue culture dish surfaces {{were used as}} controls. Cell numbers per colony, cell density within colonies, alignment of <b>cells,</b> <b>area</b> of colonies, and colony shapes were determined {{as a function of}} substrate surface topography. An alkaline phosphatase stain was used as a marker for osteoblastic phenotype. CTPs attached, proliferated, and differentiated on all surfaces with cell process lengths of up to 80 μm. Cells on the Smooth PDMS and control surfaces spread and proliferated as colonies in proximity to other cells and migrated in random directions creating colonies that covered significantly larger areas (0. 96 and 1. 05 mm 2, respectively) than colonies formed on PDMS Channel textures (0. 64 mm 2). In contrast, cells on PDMS Channel textures spread, proliferated, aligned along the channel axis, and created colonies that were more dense, and with lengths of longest colony axes that were significantly longer (3252 μm) than those on the Smooth PDMS (1265 μm) and control surfaces (1319 μm). Cells on PDMS Channel textures were aligned at an angle of 14. 44 ° relative to the channel axis, and the resulting colonies exhibited a significantly higher aspect ratio (13. 72) compared to Smooth PDMS (1. 57) and control surfaces (1. 51).

40|$|The {{circuit of}} {{recurring}} inhibition between motor neurons and Renshaw {{cells in the}} spinal cord {{has been known for}} around 70 years, though no determined function has been outlined as of yet. Renshaw cells are thought {{to be part of the}} central pattern generator in the spinal cord establishing them as an important part of the animal’s locomotive properties. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of Renshaw cells in locomotion with the help of optogenetics and electrophysiology. Halorhodopsin was inserted into the genome of mice and driven to expression with Cre recombinase in Renshaw cells. The spinal cord of P 3 mice was extracted and by inducing fictive locomotion with appropriate neurotransmitters we could inhibit the Renshaw cells in action with a green laser, opening the halorhodopsin channels for Cl- ions. In previous experiments where the ability of Renshaw cells to release inhibitory neurotransmitters was inactivated, no effect was observed in either behavioral experiments or electrophysiological experiments. In a system where the effect of Renshaw cells was knocked out acutely with optogenetics there was no discernible change in fictive locomotion cycle length, frequency or amplitude. Nor was there an effect on alternation. The access of light to the Renshaw <b>cells</b> <b>area</b> might have been limited during the experiment considering the angle of light delivery and strength of the laser. Furthermore, the maturity of Renshaw cells at P 3, the exclusive ability of the marker used to target Renshaw cells and the observed nature of neonatal inhibitory neurons acting as excitatory neurons could all be called into question about whether they contributed to these results or not. ...|$|E
40|$|A special {{architecture}} for photovoltaic {{generation of}} electricity has been studied for a mission to Mercury This paper deals with solar panel design primary concerns, {{with regards to the}} harsh Hermian thermal and radiation environment and to the need for great amounts of power for electric propulsion. Due to the large difference between the power required on cruise with respect to the one on operation orbit, a power surplus would occur during the latter phase if the same photovoltaic generator was used. A novel concept of a combined system of photovoltaic generators together with Fresnel lens solar concentrators is proposed. In particular, linear solar concentrators are used for the cruise phase to provide the high power required for electric propulsion, with reduced solar <b>cells</b> <b>area.</b> Then, before the spacecraft reaches Mercury, solar concentrators are jettisoned leaving on the panels the solar cells, separated by gaps covered by suitable Optical Solar Reflectors: spacing between them will increase heat dissipation, allowing to keep the solar array at safe temperature levels despite the harsh Mercury environment. Specific models were developed to lead several thermal and radiation analyses in order to compute the necessary design parameters. Firstly, the remaining factors for solar cell performance were evaluated on the basis of published radiation models. Secondly, a thermal model was developed in order to study thermal loads. The thermal model was integrated with the radiation one, {{in order to determine the}} overall EOL electric parameters. Furthermore a specific model was adopted to comprehend the effects of solar concentrators on panel performance and temperature. The effect of several parameters on solar array was discussed with reference to both cruise and on-orbit phases, providing design solutions to maximize electric performance in the operative mission environment...|$|E
