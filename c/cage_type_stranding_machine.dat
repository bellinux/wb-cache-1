40|$|In {{posterior}} lumbar interbody fusion, cage migrations {{and lower}} fusion rates compared to autologous bone graft {{used in the}} anterior lumbar interbody fusion procedure are documented. Anatomical and biomechanical data {{have shown that the}} cage positioning and <b>cage</b> <b>type</b> seem to play an important role. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the impact of cage positioning and <b>cage</b> <b>type</b> on <b>cage</b> migration and fusion. We created a grid system for the endplates to analyze different cage positions. To analyze the influence of the <b>cage</b> <b>type,</b> we compared “closed” box titanium cages with “open” box titanium cages. This study included 40 patients with 80 implanted cages. After pedicle screw fixation, 23 patients were treated with a “closed box” cage and 17 patients with an “open box” cage. The follow-up period averaged 25  months. Twenty cages (25 %) showed a migration into one vertebral endplate of < 3  mm and four cages (5 %) showed a migration of ≥ 3  mm. Cage migration was highest in the medio-medial position (84. 6 %), followed by the postero-lateral (42. 9 %), and the postero-medial (16 %) cage position. Closed box cages had a significantly higher migration rate than open box cages, but fusion rates did not differ. In conclusion, cage positioning and <b>cage</b> <b>type</b> influence <b>cage</b> migration. The medio-medial cage position showed the highest migration rate. Regarding the <b>cage</b> <b>type,</b> open box <b>cages</b> seem to be associated with lower migration rates compared to closed box cages.

40|$|Defining the {{physical}} suitability {{of an area}} for marine cage fish farming is of great importance, as each <b>cage</b> <b>type</b> has its own engineering tolerance levels and is designed {{to cope with a}} certain range of environmental conditions. Currently, there are no definitive, objective methods used to evaluate the suitability of coastal and offshore sites with respect to {{the physical}} limits of the location and the engineering design of a specific <b>cage</b> <b>type.</b> This study developed models which incorporate physical environmental parameters and cage engineering design within a GIS (graphical information system) environment, providing a valuable decision support tool for farmers, regulators and policy makers. The Western Isles of Scotland, UK, were selected as a study area due to the wide range of coastal and offshore environments. In addition, we selected 4 <b>cage</b> <b>types</b> designed for different wave exposure conditions (sheltered, moderately exposed, exposed and offshore).

While Tube <b>Type</b> <b>strands</b> had smaller magnetizations and thus better stabilities {{in the low}} field region, their 12 T non-Cu Jcs were somewhat smaller {{than those of the}} RIT strands. Microstructures were investigated in order to find out the reasons for the difference in non-Cu Jc values. Their grain size and stoichiometry were found to be comparable, leading to similar layer Jcs. Accordingly it was determined that the lower A 15 area fraction rather than the quality of A 15 layer was the cause of the discrepancy in non-Cu Jc. Subsequently, the area utilizations of subelements were investigated. While for a RIT strand the fine grain (FG) A 15 area occupies ~ 60 % of a subelement, for a Tube <b>Type</b> <b>strand</b> it is no more than 40 %. Further analysis indicates that the low FG area fraction in a Tube <b>Type</b> <b>strand</b> is attributed to its much larger unreacted Nb area fraction.

The authors compared the concentrations of ammonia and carbon dioxide produced by mice housed in two types of static isolator cages: a newly introduced disposable cage and a conventional reusable cage. Female mice were housed in three disposable and three reusable cages (n = 5 per cage). After 7 d, groups that were housed in disposable cages were rehoused in fresh reusable cages and vice versa. Intracage carbon dioxide, ammonia, temperature and relative humidity were measured daily. Overall, {{there were no significant}} differences in carbon dioxide or ammonia concentrations between the <b>cage</b> <b>types.</b> Within 30 min of placing mice in cages, carbon dioxide concentrations rose to more than 10, 000 ppm in both <b>cage</b> <b>types</b> and rarely dropped below 8, 000 ppm during both phases of the study. Ammonia concentrations rose slowly until day 4 and then began to rise rapidly. The maximum average ammonia concentration was 710 ppm. There was a highly significant relationship between increasing levels of humidity and ammonia production in the disposable cages (r = 0. 88). For the reusable cages, the correlation was not as strong (r = 0. 68). Both <b>cage</b> <b>types</b> were similar in their ability to dissipate carbon dioxide and ammonia.

40|$|Abstract Background In the EU {{conventional}} cages for {{laying hens}} are forbidden beginning in January 2012, however concerns about a higher transmission rate of Salmonella in alternative cages {{systems have been}} raised. The extent to which cage systems may affect the intestinal microbiota of laying hens is not known, and different microbiota may demonstrate different resistance towards colonization with Salmonella. To investigate this, ileal and caecal samples from two experimental studies where laying hens were inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis and housed in different systems (conventional cage, furnished cage or aviary), were compared using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP). The distribution of genera in the microbiota in caecum was furthermore described by next generation sequencing of 16 S rDNA libraries. Results Hens in the same <b>cage</b> <b>type</b> developed similar T-RFLP fingerprints of the ileal and caecal microbiota, and these could be separated from layers in the other <b>cages</b> <b>types.</b> No {{significant difference in the}} fingerprint profiles could be observed between Salmonella positive and negative samples from same cage. By deep sequencing of 16 S rDNA libraries from caecum, 197 different Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) were identified, and 195 and 196 OTU respectively, were found in hens in aviary and furnished cages, but only 178 OTU of these were recovered from conventional cages. The ratio between the dominating phyla or families and genera in the microbiota remained fairly constant throughout the study. Faecalibacterium and Butyricimonas were the most prevalent genera found in the caecal microbiota of layers irrespective of the <b>cage</b> <b>type.</b> Conclusions Hens confined in the same cage group tend to develop similar microbiota in their ileum and caecum possibly due to isolation, while differences in the microbiota between cages may be caused by environmental or individual bird factors. Although the <b>cages</b> <b>type</b> had influence on composition of the microbiota in the layers by promoting higher diversity in furnished and aviary systems, we did not observe differences in colonization and excretion pattern of Salmonella from these groups. We suggest, that differences in group size and exposure to a more faecally contaminated environment in the alternative systems may explain the observed differences in diversity of the caecal microbiota. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} it was {{investigated}} how laboratory rats use the space {{available to them}} in standard cages and if they spatially separate their behaviours. In addition, the effects of enlarging the floor surface area and of adding structure to the cage on the successful spatial separation of behaviours was studied. We performed differentiated investigations {{on the use of}} cage space in six different <b>cage</b> <b>types,</b> in which we analyzed the distribution of behaviours and objects on the cage floor. 18 female Wistar rats between 4 and 21 weeks of age were housed and examined in stable groups of three animals per <b>cage</b> <b>type.</b> The experiment was repeated three times, so that a total of 54 animals was used. The six <b>cage</b> <b>types</b> differed in floor and / or wall area. We used modified standard cages of the Macrolon® type III (about 800 cm²) and IV (about 1800 cm²) and a custom designed cage referred to as "type V" (3800 cm²). We also enriched cages of all three sizes with an opaque plastic dividing wall positioned {{in the middle of the}} cage. Using video tapes and the picture analysing system "DOTFINDER", we determined the spatial distribution of the animals on the cage floor during the entire dark period (12 hours). Further, we determined the spatial distribution of ten defined behavioural patterns for individual animals by scoring selected 15 minute segments of video recordings (focal animal sampling, continuous recording), and using photographs we established the distribution of fecal pellets. In additional experiments we examined the spatial distribution of urine, cellulose paper and food pellets on the cage floor. The animals in all <b>types</b> of <b>cages</b> stayed near the walls, and especially in size IV and V cages they remained largely in the corners. The behavioural patterns "resting" "comfort behaviour", "exploration", "digging", "rearing", "play" and "other social behaviour" all primarily occured here. Only "locomotion" was distributed over the whole cage floor area. The majority of the dark period the animals stayed under the food hopper. In all <b>cage</b> <b>types</b> the fecal pellets, urine and food pellets were deposited pimarily near the walls. The most differentiated distribution of behaviours occurred in the cages of size V. Here, for example, the animals spatially separated the areas used for defecation from their main living areas. In the cages of size III, in contrast, the animals did not succeed in separating most of the behavioural patterns. The areas where the most fecal pellets were found were identical to the main living and resting areas. The cages of size IV showed intermediate results. No areas used exclusively for resting were found in any <b>cage</b> <b>type.</b> In the <b>cages</b> of size V the additional plastic dividing wall made the central area more usable, especially for depositing feces, urine and food pellets. For nearly all behaviours the rats preferred structured places (corners, walls, the niche under the food hopper). Thus, the animals showed which areas in the cages were usable to them and that structure is critical to their choice of location. The principle of performing behaviours in suitable places had priority over the principle of spatially separating different behaviours. Therefore, in the cages without sufficient suitable places, the animals were apparently forced to perform different behavioural patterns in the same location. In the cages of the size V, particularly in <b>cage</b> <b>type</b> V with dividing wall, the animals probably had more suitable places available to them, due to the greater wall area, so that they were better able to spatially separate the different behaviours and were thereby able to achieve the best "specific space use". Using the successful spatial separation of different behaviours, especially of the main living and defecation areas, as the evaluation criterion, cage sizes III and IV appear to be inadequate. Through appropriate structuring of the cage floor area, however, it should be possible to increase the usable space for the animals and thereby to allow the spatial separation of behaviours even within a restricted cage space...|$|R

Cage height was highly significant both years, with much less acute (i. e., short-term exposure) mortality at ground-level compared with 1. 5 m. In 2011, acute mortality was less at ground-level (mean = 3. 2 %, median = 0 %) compared to 1. 5 m (mean = 85. 2 %, median = 100 %). <b>Cage</b> <b>type</b> also was highly significant, with less mortality in covered cages compared to uncovered cages. Mortality by cage height and <b>cage</b> <b>type</b> was as follows: ground level, covered cage (mean = 2. 8 %, median = 0. 1 %); ground level, uncovered cage (mean = 41. 9 %, median = 9. 6 %); 1. 5 m, covered cage (mean = 6. 8 %, median = 0 %); 1. 5 m, uncovered cage (mean = 83. 7 %, median = 100 %). Results suggest that acute mortality to non-target insects may vary considerably based on their height and their ability to directly intercept the insecticide as the aerosol passes through the area being sprayed...|$|R
40|$|Ringtail is a {{pathologic}} {{condition of}} laboratory rodents characterized by annular constrictions of the tail. Traditionally, it {{is classified as}} an environmental disorder caused by low relative humidity, but other factors (temperature, dietary deficiencies, genetic susceptibility, and <b>caging</b> <b>type)</b> have also been proposed. Twenty litters of mice with ringtail lesions occurred from September 2010 to August 2013 in a facility located in the northern Italy. Mice were maintained under controlled environ-mental conditions and fed a standard diet. Retrospective analysis of environmental data (relative humidity, temperature) was carried out. Gross, histopathologic, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy examination of tails and limbs was per-formed. The incidence of ringtail was 0. 075 % (20 / 26 800) of all weaned litters over the 3 -year period of examination. Tempera-ture and relative humidity remained within accepted limits in all cases except one. We observed annular constrictions in tail, digits of pes, crus, and antebrachium in 116 (100. 0 %), 47 (40. 5 %), 11 (9. 5 %), and 2 (1. 7 %) of 116 affected mice, respectively. Histologic and ultrastructural examination revealed abnormal keratin desquamation and presence of a keratin ring encircling the tail, causing progressive strangulation of the growing tail with subsequent compression and ulceration of underlying soft tissues, resulting in circulatory changes (edema, hyperemia, thrombosis, hemorrhages), ischemic necrosis, and eventually auto-amputation distal to the constriction. On {{the basis of our}} findings, we suggest a disorder of cornification as the primary lesion of ringtail in mice. The cause of these cases, however, remained undetermined, even though traditional etiologic factors (relative humidity, temperature, diet, <b>caging</b> <b>type)</b> were reasonably excluded.

40|$|In-field {{measures}} of physical spray concentration do not tend to correlate well with caged insect mortality data. This is {{partly due to}} the reduced penetration of the spray into the cage. Spray penetration is hindered by the structure of the cage. Wind tunnel studies were conducted to investigate the accuracy of those calculations developed to correct for filtration levels in caged mosquito bioassays. Zenivex E 20 (Etofenprox) was applied at rates ranging from an LD 10 to an LD 90. Three <b>cage</b> <b>types</b> were used, each with different penetration levels. The dose approaching the cage was converted to the dose entering the cage using cage penetration data from previous research. The penetration conversion factor returned a data set that directly correlated dose with mosquito mortality (R 2 = = 0. 918). The mortality percent was a function of the dose within the <b>cage.</b> The mesh <b>type</b> acted as a regulator. Although the conversion factor was effective, the differences between cages was not always significant due to within-group variation...|$|R
