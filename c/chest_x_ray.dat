50|$|Stable {{patients}} will be evaluated with CT, ultrasound, <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> as the institution's protocol specifies. When this initial survey is negative, patient {{can be observed}} with conservative management. In many cases, chest tubes are required due to concomitant lesions in the pleural cavity. If possible lesions are found (for example, a missile track near the trachea or esophagus, or pneumomediastinum) further investigation will follow with oesophagography, esophagoscopy, angiography, bronchoscopy as needed to rule out or confirm such a lesion, and decide whether surgical repair is warranted.|$|E
5000|$|Previously every stable {{patient that}} {{suffered}} a TMGSW received extensive evaluation that included chest radiography, oesophagography, esophagoscopy, angiography, bronchoscopy, cardiac ultrasound.

Subsequently other studies demonstrated the use of CT as a screening tool for stable patients who suffered TMGSW is a reliable tool for ruling out, diagnosing and avoiding missed injuries. For example Stassen et al. showed data of 22 stable patients who were screened with CT, <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> and abdominal ultrasound; seven patients showed a positive CT scan and required additional evaluation, and of these seven patients, three required surgical management. Additionally the work of Burack et al., whose evaluation of stable patients with penetrating injuries to the mediastinum — this time including stab wounds — relied mostly on CT and ultrasound, showed similar results. The work of Ibirogba et al. did so as well. Recent data suggests that the use of CT scan with some additional noninvasive techniques, such as ultrasound and chest roentgenogram are reliable screening tools to decide whether patients need further evaluation.|$|E

Aim: To define clinical variables associated {{with the presence of}} pneumonia in adult patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms to the emergency department. Material and methods: Prospective study carried out in the emergency department from the Catholic University Hospital in Santiago, Chile. Three hundred twenty-five patients (53 ± 22 years) presenting fever or acute respiratory symptoms were included. After obtaining a clinical history and physical examination, the physician established a tentative diagnosis. Subsequently, a definitive diagnosis was made with the <b>chest</b> <b>X</b> <b>rays.</b> Results: Thirty-four percent of the patients had pneumonia. The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia before X-ray examination was variable among emergency physicians (positive likelihood ratio: 1. 5 - 4. 8) and showed only moderate sensitivity (79 %) and specificity (66 %). The clinical variables significantly associated with the presence of pneumonia were: advanced age (over 75 years), cardiovascular disease, fever, chills, sputum production, orthopnea, altered mental status, cyanosis, dullness on percussion, bronchial breath sounds, crackles, any abnormal vital sign (heart rate ³ 100 beats/min, respiratory rate ³ 20 breaths/min or temperature ³ 38 °C) and oxygen saturation below 90 % breathing air. Conclusions: Clinical judgment prior to observation of <b>chest</b> <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> had moderate sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pneumonia.

30|$|Respiratory {{failure is}} one of the most common and {{critical}} problems in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). The accurate precise assessment of respiratory failure and precise diagnoses of lung diseases are key issues in PICUs. Assessments by <b>chest</b> <b>X</b> <b>rays</b> (CXR) are common and prevalent for determining the reasons for respiratory failure in children. However, CXRs can be misread. Some patients may require chest Computed Tomography (CCT). CCT is essential for finding the abnormal region. However, in the PICU, the number of children who need CCT is small, and the risk of transporting unstable patients and the possibilities of malignancies are problematic. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has proven useful for detecting lung abnormalities in adults, but its usefulness is not clear in children.|$|R

40|$|Medical imaging market {{consists}} of several billion tests per year worldwide. Out of these, {{at least one}} third are cardiovascular procedures. Keeping in mind that each test represents a cost, often a risk, and a diagnostic hypothesis, we can agree that every unnecessary and unjustifiable test is one test too many. Small individual costs, risks, and wastes multiplied by billions of examinations per year represent an important population, society and environmental burden. Unfortunately, the appropriateness of cardiac imaging is extra-ordinarily low {{and there is little}} awareness in patients and physicians of differential costs, radiological doses, and long term risks of different imaging modalities. For a resting cardiac imaging test, being the average cost (not charges) of an echocardiogram equal to 1 (as a cost comparator), the cost of a CT is 3. 1 x, of a SPECT 3. 27 x, of a Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance imaging 5. 51 x, of a PET 14. 03 x, and of a right and left heart catheterization 19. 96 x. For stress cardiac imaging, compared with the treadmill exercise test equal to 1 (as a cost comparator), the cost of stress echocardiography is 2. 1 x and of a stress SPECT scintigraphy is 5. 7 x. Biohazards and downstream long-term costs linked to radiation-induced oncogenesis should also be considered. The radiation exposure is absent in echo and magnetic resonance, and corresponds to 500 <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> for a sestamibi cardiac stress scan and to 1150 <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> for a thallium scan. The corresponding extra-risk in a lifetime of fatal cancer is 1 in 2000 exposed patients for a sestamibi stress and 1 in 1000 for a thallium scan. Increased awareness of economic, biologic, and environmental costs of cardiac imaging will hopefully lead to greater appropriateness, wisdom and prudence from both the prescriber and the practitioner. In this way, the sustainability of cardiac imaging will eventually improve...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Methicillin {{resistant}} Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{infection is}} increasingly found {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF).  AIMS—To determine whether MRSA infection has a deleterious effect on the clinical status of children with CF.  METHODS—Children with MRSA in respiratory cultures during a seven year period were identified and compared with controls matched for age, sex, and respiratory function. Respiratory function tests, anthropometric data, Shwachman-Kulczycki score, Northern <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> score, intravenous and nebulised antibiotic therapy, and steroid therapy were compared one year before and one year after MRSA infection.  RESULTS—From a clinic population of 300, 10 children had positive sputum or cough swab cultures for MRSA. Prevalence rose from 0 in 1992 - 1994 to 7 in 1998. Eighteen controls were identified. Children with MRSA showed significant worsening of height standard deviation scores and required twice as many courses of intravenous antibiotics as controls after one year. They had significantly worse <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> scores {{at the time of}} the first MRSA isolate and one year later, but showed no increase in the rate of decline in <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> appearance. There was a trend towards lower FEV 1 and FEF 25 - 75 in children with MRSA. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to change in weight, body mass index, or Shwachman score. There was no significant difference in prior use of steroids or nebulised antibiotics.  CONCLUSION—MRSA infection in children with CF does not significantly affect respiratory function, but may have an adverse effect on growth. Children with MRSA require significantly more courses of intravenous antibiotics and have a worse <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> appearance than controls. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of non-malignant <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> abnormalities in cases of mesothelioma 184 cases of mesothelioma (72 pleural and 112 peritoneal) which had occurred in a cohort of asbestos insulation workers followed up since 1967 were studied. <b>Chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> films of satisfactory quality, on which {{the presence or absence}} of non-malignant radiological changes indicating interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or pleural fibrosis or both, could be assessed with a high degree of certainty were available. In some cases (20 % for pleural mesothelioma, 11. 6 % for peritoneal mesothelioma) non-malignant radiological changes were not radiologically detectable. Parenchymal interstitial fibrosis (small irregular opacities) only was found in a proportion of cases (25. 4 % of pleural mesotheliomas, 12. 5 % of peritoneal mesotheliomas). Pleural fibrosis only was detected in 17 % of cases of pleural mesothelioma and 27 % of cases of peritoneal mesothelioma. Most patients had both parenchymal and pleural fibrosis. Although these results tend to indicate that in peritoneal mesothelioma the proportion of pleural fibrosis is significantly higher, these findings might have been due to the fact that in most cases of pleural mesothelioma non-malignant changes were interpreted in one hemithorax only. In 46 cases (21 pleural, 25 peritoneal) in which sufficient lung tissue was available histopathology of lung parenchyma indicated the presence of interstitial fibrosis; in 20 (43. 5 %) of these the <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> film had been read as negative. Thus the absence of radiologically detectable small opacities on the <b>chest</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> film does not exclude the existence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in cases of mesothelioma among insulation workers. With lower levels of exposure (such as in family contacts of asbestos workers) it is conceivable that mesothelioma might occur in the absence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis...|$|E
