40|$|Managers often must assess {{singular}} strategic options. Four {{studies of}} such assessments demonstrate a <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> effect: Focal managerial options often are favored in an evidentially unjustifiable manner. Study 1 concerns new product development, and demonstrates that a prototype {{that has become}} focal tends to be judged overly favorably, and is chosen for launch with unwarranted enthusiasm. Study 2 shows that this <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> effect generalizes to judgments and decisions about general strategy. Study 3 focuses on the information search patterns underlying the effect, and Study 4 replicates the <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> effect among experienced executives, and demonstrates the utility of a debiasing procedure.

40|$|In {{scholarly}} {{debate on}} the gravity and prevalence of <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> in criminal investigation procedures, one relevant issue has, thus far, been insufficiently explored; specifically, how have police forces responded to the apparent increased focus on the phenomenon of <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> in criminal investigations? The present article examines this question through providing a narrative history {{of the effects of}} administrative oversight policies developed in response to a certain serious crime in the Netherlands and which was designed to better prevent the assumed problem of <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> in major criminal investigations. In addition, we conducted group interviews with major criminal investigation teams so as to bring into focus their perception of the effectiveness of this policy. We concluded that the adopted policy had failed to give balanced consideration to the polarity between efficacy (raising the number of solved crimes) and precaution (prevention of errors in criminal investigations). Additionally, based on the interviews, we concluded that the policy did not significantly improve efficiency or eliminate <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> from working its way into the investigation process...|$|R

40|$|In {{the crisis}} {{management}} environment, <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> {{is a set}} of bias in decision makers’ cognitive process which often leads to incorrect understanding of the real crisis situation, biased perception of information, and improper decisions. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> phenomenon is a consequence of both the challenges in the task and the natural limitation in a human being’s cognitive process. An information assistant system is proposed with the purpose of preventing <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision.</b> The system serves as a platform for monitoring the on-going crisis event. All information goes through the system before arrives at the user. The system enhances the data quality, reduces the data quantity and presents the crisis information in a manner that prevents or repairs the user’s cognitive overload. While working with such a system, the users (crisis managers) are expected to be more likely to stay aware of the actual situation, stay open minded to possibilities, and make proper decisions...|$|R

Impairing {{the useful}} {{field of view}} in natural scenes: <b>Tunnel</b> <b>vision</b> versus general interference. Journal of Vision, 16 (2), 25. doi: 10. 1167 / 16. 2. 7 A {{fundamental}} issue in visual attention {{is the relationship between}} the useful field of view (UFOV), the region of visual space where information is encoded within a single fixation, and eccentricity. A common assumption is that impairing attentional resources reduces the size of the UFOV (i. e., <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision).</b> However, most research has not accounted for eccentricity-dependent changes in spatial resolution, potentially conflating fixed visual properties with flexible changes in visual attention. Williams (1988, 1989) argued that foveal loads are necessary {{to reduce the size of}} the UFOV, producing <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision.</b> Without a foveal load, it is argued that the attentional decrement is constant across the visual field (i. e., general interference). However, other research asserts that auditory working memory (WM) loads produce <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision.</b> To date, foveal versus auditory WM loads have not been compared to determine if they differentially change the size of the UFOV. In two experiments, we tested the effects of a foveal (rotated L vs. T discrimination) task and an auditory WM (N-back) task on an extrafoveal (Gabor) discrimination task. Gabor patches were scaled for size and processing time to produce equal performance across the visual field under single-task conditions, thus removing the confound of eccentricity-dependent differences in visual sensitivity. The results showed that although both foveal and auditory loads reduced Gabor orientation sensitivity, only the foveal load interacted with retinal eccentricity to produce <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision,</b> clearly demonstrating task-specific changes to the form of the UFOV. This has theoretical implications for understanding the UFOV...|$|R
