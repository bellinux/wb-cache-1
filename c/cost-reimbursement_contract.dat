40|$|Due to the {{fundamental}} role of asymmetric information in economic relations, during the past decades contracts have flourished and dedicated to how the information asymmetry and incentives induce strategic behavior among economic agents {{in a number of}} directions. One branch of contracts focuses on bilateral contract between one principal and one agent, in which the agent?s hidden information and hidden action lead to the adverse selection and moral hazard problems, respectively. There is a simple and widely used menu of contracts, which consists of two types of contracts: the fixed-price contract in which the payment is fixed regardless of the realized cost, and the <b>cost-reimbursement</b> <b>contract</b> in which the payment equals the realized cost. By allowing for a more reasonable property that the optimal effort is monotone in the agent?s type, we show that the performance of the optimal FPCR contract relies crucially on the cost function: when the marginal is relatively large, the gain of the optimal FPCR menu is very close to the fully optimal contract. Otherwise the optimal FPCR menu behaves arbitrarily close to a <b>cost-reimbursement</b> <b>contract.</b> To quantify the renegotiation cost without commitment in a two-period setting, we nonparametrically identify and estimate the model primitives, including the agent?s cost function and disutility function of effort, the distribution of innate, agents? bargaining power and the intertemporal preference. The empirical evidence shows that the nonlinearity of agents? cost function implies different empirical results about the distribution of welfare gains between firms and taxpayers. The second branch of bilateral contracts between one principal and multiple agents emphasizes the externalities generated by the dependence of one agent?s payoff on other agents? contracts, while the first branch of contracts involves no externalities due to the setting of one principal and one agent. To quantify the payment effect of bargaining power, I nonparametrically identify and estimate the model primitives, including the manufacturer?s cost function, the hospitals? payoff function, the joint distribution of hospitals? payoff-shocks, and hospitals? bargaining power. And, we conduct counterfactual analysis of the effect of the bargaining power on the price...|$|E
40|$|Many supply {{contracts}} {{between the state}} and private agents in a developing country are cost-re-imbursement variety and are rolled out under weak and unreliable governance. The latter has to be provided for through higher supply cost. The state in turn can lower the contract cost by providing verifiable credible commitments of its intentions. We show using a modified the Laffont-Tirole <b>cost-reimbursement</b> <b>contract</b> model that the more reliable is the state in respect to the delivery of its contractual obligations, the lower the cost of contracts to the state and society. We argue that the various actions taken by the Philippine government before the privatization of the water service in Metro Manila in 1997, viz., the substantial increase in the tariff, the reduction in the labor complement by 30 % and the outsourcing of the dispute resolution mechanism to an international appeals panel, induced entry and aggressive bidding by the contenders that dramatically reduced the cost to the public of the water services concession contract in Metro Manila, Philippines...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an extremely}} simple {{formulation of the}} Laffont-Tirole principal agent model of cost-based procurement and regulation which is suitable for applied uses by restricting the principal to using a two item menu where one item is a <b>cost-reimbursement</b> <b>contract</b> and the other item is a fixed price contract. Menus of this form are called fixed-price-cost-reimbursement (FPCR) menus. In the case where the agent’s utility is quadratic and the agent’s type is distributed uniformly, it is shown that the optimal FPCR menu always captures at least {{three quarters of the}} gain that the optimal complex menu achieves. Therefore, at least for the uniform quadratic case, extremely simple menus with low informational requirements perform nearly as well as the fully optimal complex menu. In an influential paper, Laffont and Tirole (1986) formulated a principal agent model of cost-based procurement and regulation and showed that the principal can implement the optimal mechanism by offering the agent a menu consisting of a continuum of linear contracts. Two 1 related problems with applying this theory in practice have been that the economic logic and th...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to propose a {{solution}} to the principal-agent problem arising in construction contracts. The inability to write complete and enforceable contracts gives the contractor the opportunity to earn by cheating. The ultimate method to deal with this problem is to design a contractual mechanism that would stop a self-interested contractor from taking benefit resulting from any post contractual opportunism. According to this method, the contractor must simultaneously enter into a <b>cost-reimbursement</b> <b>contract</b> and buy a call option for the work to be performed. This combination acts as if the owner enters into a costreimbursement contract and a fixed price contract with an exclusive right of choosing which contract to apply when the actual cost is known. The owner’s advantage lies in the power of preventing the contractor from behaving inefficiently. The contractor’s advantage lies in the possibility to demonstrate good faith and to make a credible promise without relying on reputation typically enjoyed by the already established contractors.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "DOD's rationale for waiving WSARA's competitive prototyping requirement for CAPS covered both bases provided in the statute; however, DOD did not provide complete information about {{the potential benefits of}} competitive prototyping or support for its conclusion that prototyping would result in schedule delays. In the waiver, DOD found reasonable the Air Force's conclusion that the additional $ 49 million cost of producing competing prototypes exceeded the negligible expected life-cycle benefits because minimal opportunities exist to increase CAPS technological and design maturity through competitive prototyping. The Air Force's conclusions about CAPS technical and design risk are supported by its market research, but its cost-benefit analysis was incomplete because neither the waiver nor the business case analysis supporting it provided an estimated dollar value for the expected benefits. Further, the Air Force's cost estimate of competitively prototyping CAPS was based on a program office estimate, which has not been independently reviewed by DOD's Office of Cost Assessment and Performance Evaluation. DOD also did not provide support in the waiver for its conclusion that implementing competitive prototyping will delay EPS's initial operational capability and result in DOD being unable to meet critical national security objectives. Finally, the CAPS acquisition strategy anticipates the use of a <b>cost-reimbursement</b> <b>contract</b> for designing and building the system; however it may be difficult for DOD to meet the requirements for justifying the use of a cost-type contract for development, given the low design and development risk described in the waiver. ...|$|E

40|$|Public Performance & Management ReviewThe {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] cost economics is used to produce a conceptual framework that helps explain public-sector contract decisions. When a product is easy to specify, easy to produce, {{and there is a}} thick market of buyers and sellers, fixed-price contracts are more likely; when a product is difficult to produce, difficult to specify, and the market has few buyers and sellers, cost- reimbursement contracts are more likely. These arguments were tested with five years of data (FY 2004 – 2008) drawn from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), the most comprehensive and largely untapped database on federal contracting practices. Over 2, 000 Defense Department contracts were examined, charting contract type (i. e., fixed-price vs. cost-reimbursement) across simple and complex products. The results confirm conventional wisdom about public sector procurement practice, at least within the Defense Department: product characteristics and market conditions drive the use of fixed-price and <b>cost-reimbursement</b> <b>contracts.</b> This research lays the foundation for research on contract outcomes by identifying factors that drive the use of different contract types and producing unique measures of product characteris- tics that are not currently available in the literature.

The audit disclosed that over 50 % of the work under six of the <b>cost-reimbursement</b> <b>contracts</b> examined was recurring and could have been estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy making the work suitable for fixed-price contracting. The report made recommendations to the Head of Procurement and the Administrator, EIA. These recommendations were to comply with procurement regulations by identifying recurring tasks that were susceptible to fixed-price contracting, preparing definitive statements of work that would permit fixed-price contracting, and awarding fixed-price contracts. Procurement recognized the benefits of fixed-price contracting and agreed to work closely with the EIA to identify work susceptible to fixed-price contracting. These efforts resulted in the award of two labor hour contracts but no firm-fixed-price contracts. The purpose of this followup audit was to review Procurement and EIA actions to develop definitive work statements for recurring tasks that are suitable for firm-fixed-price contracts.

40|$|This study explores five {{elements}} {{pertaining to}} {{sound financial management}} in {{institutions of higher education}} as related to Government negotiated research contracting. The research tested the feasibility of five hypotheses presented as elements to be investigated in the study. Responses to a mail questionnaire were analyzed and final audit reports were examined. The data obtained were used as evidence to support the contention that sound financial management in universities as related to research negotiated contracting is important and can be improved through these five elements: 1. Financial management aids in developing the climate in which research can best be performed. It has been shown that research is performed in almost all the institutions of higher education. However, it is believed that the institutions would greatly enhance and improve the climate if they utilize management advisory services and provides staff training for their financial management personnel. 2. Universities and Government have a common interest in assuring the conservation of public funds. This can be accomplished by the universities having the capability of furnishing the Government with timely and accurate financial reports, accounting for the stewardship of the research funds, and by maintaining the financial accounts in such a manner as to readily reflect the segregated costs applicable to each research project. It would be a great improvement to the common interest of the university and the Government if all universities had their accounting firm review and approve their indirect cost proposals. The Government should then be able to accept the proposal if certified by the university 2 ̆ 7 s accounting firm to be reliable enough to use for negotiating the indirect cost rate without an audit by Government auditors. 3. Government financial policies and regulations, as they pertain to universities, are provided to encourage maximum realization of research. The representatives of universities and Government have worked together and made great progress in formulating procedures and methods for improving the financial aspects of research contracting. Some of the methods and procedures which provide evidence of the mutual endeavor are; (1) the use allowance in lieu of depreciation is acceptable under Office of Management and Budget Circular A- 21 and the American Council on Education; (2) the procedure for testing title of research property is clearly established by Office of Management and Budget Circular A- 101 which aids in administering and closing the research contract without undue delay; and (3) the policy of one Government agency performing audit of direct and indirect costs, as well as negotiating indirect cost rates for a single university (OMB Circular A- 88) greatly improves the uniformity of mutually accepted cost principles by universities and Government. 4. Mutual financial responsibility of universities and Government as related to research contracts is essential. Personnel of both contractual entities are making a concerted effort to recover indirect costs of university research through an equitable method and to provide a method of advancing funds through the letter-of-credit which alleviates the need of the university to use its own funds. It is believed that more emphasis should be placed on the review or research cost budgets by the financial management of the university. 5. Audit functions of Government audit agencies regarding the auditing of research contracts at universities could be performed by the institution 2 ̆ 7 s external auditors. Most universities have their accounting records audited by either independent accounting firms or by state or some independent audit group. These auditors are external auditors and have a professional integrity to maintain, therefore the audit performed by them and the financial reports issued should be acceptable to any interested party provided the reports contain an unqualified auditor’s opinion. The finalization of the research contracts could be handled more expeditiously if the Government would accept the verification by external university auditors of the total costs incurred under <b>cost-reimbursement</b> <b>contracts.</b> This paper emphasizes the importance of sound financial management in educational institutions as related to Government research contracting and how it can be improved.
