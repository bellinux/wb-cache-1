5000|$|Although {{research}} suggests that even low levels of lead in the body may be harmful to children, {{it is unlikely that}} chocolate consumption in small amounts causes lead poisoning. Some studies have shown that lead may bind to <b>cocoa</b> <b>shells</b> and contamination may occur during the manufacturing process. One study showed the mean lead level in milk chocolate candy bars was 0.027 µg lead per gram of candy; another study found that some chocolate purchased at U.S. supermarkets contained up to 0.965 µg per gram, close to the international (voluntary) standard limit for lead in cocoa powder or beans, which is 1 µg of lead per gram. In 2006, the U.S. FDA lowered by one-fifth the amount of lead permissible in candy, but compliance is only voluntary. Studies concluded that [...] "children, who are big consumers of chocolates, may be at risk of exceeding the daily limit of lead; whereas one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.

40|$|Batch {{trials were}} carried out to {{determine}} the methane potential yields of some typical organic wastes generated {{in the region of}} Cantabria (Spain) : <b>cocoa</b> <b>shell,</b> cheese whey and sludges from dairy industry. Anaerobic co-digestion trials of these wastes with dairy manure were also investigated in batch at 35 ˚C. Cheese whey obtained similar methane yields than dairy manure, between 17. 5 and 19. 3 L CH 4 kg− 1 cheese whey compared with 18. 0 L CH 4 kg− 1 manure. Methane yields of various sludge samples collected from wastewater treatment facilities of dairy industries were influenced by its origin. Sludge samples from fat separation devices were the most productive in terms of specific methane yields compared with biological sludge from an aerobic reactor. Sludge samples from fat separator reached specific methane productivities of 350 and 388 L CH 4 kg− 1 VS (10. 5 and 24. 1 L CH 4 kg− 1 sludge), whereas biological sludge yielded 125 L CH 4 kg− 1 VS (12. 6 L CH 4 kg− 1 sludge). The methane potential of sludge samples was influenced by solids content. <b>Cocoa</b> <b>shell</b> resulted to be an interesting waste for anaerobic digestion due to its high VS content, yielding 195 L CH 4 kg− 1 <b>cocoa</b> <b>shell.</b> It is a waste that can considerably improve methane yields in anaerobic co-digestion with dairy manure. However, at proportions of 10 % <b>cocoa</b> <b>shell,</b> the process was hindered by hydrolysis of particulate matter. Anaerobic digestion at higher temperatures (thermophilic range) could be a better option for this kind of waste.

The n values ranged from 1. 10 to 2. 98, indicating that the adsorbate molecules interacted in an inclined position on the adsorbent surface and aggregate in solution. The study {{of the total number of}} the formed layers (1 Â +Â L 2) showed that the steric hindrance is the dominant factor. The description of the adsorbateâadsorbent interactions by calculation of the adsorption energy indicated that the process occurred by physisorption in nature, since the values were lower than 40 Â kJÂ molâ 1.

Three lignocellulosic materials were separately pretreated with NMMO at 120 C for 3 h. Subsequently, batch biomethane production tests were performed under mesophilic (37 C – 2 C) conditions, {{also with the}} untreated feedstocks, to provide methane production baseline data. Pretreatment was particularly effective for rice straw, with an 82...|$|R
40|$|Nutritional {{evaluation}} of some agro-industrial byproducts available in Samoa [dry brewers' grains (DBG), <b>cocoa</b> <b>shell</b> (CS), <b>cocoa</b> dust (CD) and desiccated coconut waste meal (DCWM) ] available in Samoa {{was carried out}} usingboth the in viva and in vitro techniques. In the in vivo study 24 Anglo-nubian goats were offered by-products with other feed ingredients to compound four different diets. The goats were randomly allocated to 4 diets {{on the basis of}} liveweight (18. 7 - 0. 3 kg). The ADF content of the byproducts followed a similar trend to NDF. The byproducts have a high content of organic matter (91. 0 - 95. 4 %). Gross energy (GE) content was higher in DCWM (25. 1 MJ/kg DM), closely followed by CD (23. 2 MJ/kg DM). Concentrate intake was significantly different (p 0. 05). CP digestibility followed a similar pattern to DM digestibility. The digestibility of NDF and ADF was influenced {{by the nature of the}} diets. The digestibility of OM and GE were best (p DBG>CD>CS. In conclusion, the results obtained suggest that all the byproducts can contribute to ruminant livestock diets without adverse effects on feed intake, growth rate and apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients...|$|R

The Duchy also took other local land including St. Mary Island (modern day Banjul) and Fort Jillifree. The Duchy's colonies exported sugar, tobacco, coffee, cotton, ginger, indigo, rum, <b>cocoa,</b> tortoise <b>shells,</b> tropical birds and their feathers.

40|$|Investigation into clean {{energies}} {{has been}} focused on finding an alternative to fossil fuels in order to reduce global warming {{while at the same time}} satisfying the world’s energy needs. Biomass gasification is seen as a promising thermochemical conversion technology as it allows useful gaseous products to be obtained from low-energy-density solid fuels. Air–steam mixtures are the most commonly used gasification agents. The gasification performances of several biomass samples and their mixtures were compared. One softwood (pine) and one hardwood (chestnut), their torrefied counterparts, and other Spanish-based biomass wastes such as almond shell, olive stone, grape and olive pomaces or <b>cocoa</b> <b>shell</b> were tested, and their behaviors at several different stoichiometric ratios (SR) and steam/air ratios (S/A) were compared. The optimum SR was found to be in the 0. 2 – 0. 3 range for S/A = 75 / 25. At these conditions a syngas stream with 35 % of H 2 + CO and a gas yield of 2 L gas/g fuel were obtained, which represents a cold-gas efficiency of almost 50 %. The torrefaction process does not significantly affect the quality of the product syngas. Some of the obtained chars were analyzed to assess their use as precursors for catalysts, combustion fuel or for agricultural purposes such as soil amendment...|$|R
30|$|Activated carbon is {{carbonaceous}} material that has highly developed porosity, internal surface area, and relatively high mechanical strength. They are extensively {{used as an}} adsorbent in wastewater and gaseous pollutant removal. Due to these features, the demand for activated carbon is increasing day by day. The activated carbon can be produced {{from a variety of}} natural and synthetic substances. The ligno-cellulosic material is the most commonly used precursor for the synthesis of activated carbon. The composition of the ligno-cellulosic materials determines to some extent, the porosity development of the produced activated carbons (Valente Nabais et al. 2013). The production of activated carbon from agricultural by-products has received much attention from the scientific community as they are renewable, low-cost and environmentally friendly materials (Okman et al. 2014). A large number of agricultural by-products, such as date stone (Danish et al. 2014 b), Acacia mangium wood (Danish et al. 2011), <b>cocoa</b> <b>shell</b> (Ahmad et al. 2012), waste tea (Auta and Hameed 2011), coffee husks (Oliveira et al. 2009), pomegranate wood (Ghaedi et al. 2015), mahogany sawdust (Malik 2003), rice husk (Malik 2003), corn cob (Sych et al. 2012), and other materials have been successfully used for the production of low-cost activated carbon.|$|R
