50|$|In 2005, {{the term}} Ajax was coined, and {{applications}} like Gmail {{started to make}} their <b>client</b> <b>sides</b> more and more interactive. A web page script is able to contact the server for storing/retrieving data without downloading an entire web page.|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{the quality}} of cloud {{computing}} provision from the client's {{point of view is}} important {{in order to ensure that}} the service conforms to the level specified in the service level agreement (SLA). With a view to avoid SLA violation, the main parameters should be determined in the agreement and then used to evaluate the fulfillment of the SLA terms at the <b>client's</b> <b>side.</b> Current studies in cloud monitoring only handle monitoring the provider resources with little or no consideration to the <b>client's</b> <b>side.</b> This paper presents MonSLAR, a User-centric middleware for Monitoring SLA for Restful services in SaaS cloud computing environments. MonSLAR uses a distributed architecture that allows SLA parameters and the monitored data to be embedded in the requests and responses of the REST protocol...|$|R
25|$|The <b>client</b> <b>side</b> of the DNS {{is called}} a DNS {{resolver}}. A resolver is responsible for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately lead to a full resolution (translation) of the resource sought, e.g., translation of a domain name into an IP address. An individual DNS query may be either non-recursive, recursive, or iterative, {{or a combination of}} these.|$|E
25|$|In a {{networked}} {{environment with}} a print server running Windows Vista, documents will be rendered on the client machine, {{rather than on}} the server, using a feature known as <b>Client</b> <b>Side</b> Rendering. The rendered intermediate form will just be transferred to the server to be printed without additional processing, making print servers more scalable by offloading rendering computation to clients.|$|E
25|$|As the JavaScript {{code was}} also {{processing}} user input and rendering {{it in the}} web page content, a new sub-class of reflected XSS attacks started to appear that was called DOM-based cross-site scripting. In a DOM-based XSS attack, the malicious data does not touch the web server. Rather, it is being reflected by the JavaScript code, fully on the <b>client</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

A sober companion works [...] "full-time" [...] {{with the}} client: full work days, nights, weekends or extended periods where {{the coach is}} by the <b>client's</b> <b>side</b> 24 hours a day. Some recovery coach roles have evolved from a travel or sober escort to a Long Term Recovery Coach or Sober Companion. A Long Term Recovery Coach or Sober Companion works [...] "full-time" [...] with the client: full work days, nights, weekends or extended periods where the coach is by the <b>client's</b> <b>side</b> 24 hours a day. This long term option can begin with treatment discharge, the client's first day or weekend home and may develop into a coaching relationship that continues for several weeks, months or longer.|$|R
40|$|Offshore-outsourced {{software}} development (OOSD) projects involvemultifaceted risks throughout the project execution, {{as they are}} handed over tothird-party organizations and thus are exposed to more risks than in domesticoutsourcing or captive offshoring. We concentrate on failed OOSD projects inthis paper and analyze the unique aspects of such projects at the team level thatlead to failures. Using the grounded theory approach, we conducted semistructuredinterviews with 19 project managers involved in OOSD projectfailures from the vendor and <b>client</b> <b>sides,</b> who are based in India or Switzerland. We developed a set of propositions regarding multiple teams in the OOSDproject context to explain failures. Integration of inter-organizational offshoreand onshore teams from the vendor and <b>client</b> <b>sides</b> was found to beindispensable in avoiding project failures. Six categories of unique aspects thatlead to OOSD project failures were identified and discussed in this exploratorywork...|$|R

25|$|Sometimes, if {{part of the}} {{software}} generating the CAPTCHA is client-side (the validation is done on a server but the text that the user is required to identify is rendered on the <b>client</b> <b>side),</b> then users can modify the client to display the un-rendered text. Some CAPTCHA systems use MD5 hashes stored client-side, which may leave the CAPTCHA vulnerable to a brute-force attack.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{processor}} manufacturers {{are taking advantage}} of the 'extra space' that the transistor shrinkage provides to add specialized processing units to deal with features such as graphics, video, and cryptography. For one example, Intel's Parallel JavaScript extension not only adds support for multiple cores, but also for the other non-general processing features of their chips, as part of the migration in <b>client</b> <b>side</b> scripting toward HTML5.|$|E
25|$|Even {{when the}} {{original}} client PXE firmware has been written by Intel and always provided at no cost as a linkable IA32 object code format module included in their Product Development Kit (PDK), the open source world has produced over the years non-standard derivative projects like gPXE/iPXE offering their own ROMs. While Intel based ROMs have always been rock solid implementing the <b>client</b> <b>side</b> of the PXE standard some people were willing to trade extra features for stability and PXE standard conformance.|$|E
40|$|Continually and {{impressive}} amplification of internet technologies {{development and implementation}} enables the creation of productive, efficient, useful and interactive web applications. The contribution briefly characterizes SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), WS (Web Service) and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) technology and illustrates advantages of AJAX and WS integration on application example for interactive selection {{of one or more}} minerals according to actually chosen selection criteria. Contribution presents three created web services (service for creating of web page’s select list based on given database table content, service for selection of one or a group of minerals according to specified criteria from the group of database tables, and service for correct depiction of chemical formulas on web page). The application makes use of two web services on the server side and one web service plus Ajax technology on the <b>client’s</b> <b>side.</b> Application’s <b>client’s</b> <b>side</b> presents integration of these web services in a dynamic way by means of Ajax technology {{and at the same time}} it is a mashup demonstration...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{protocol}} for efficient streaming of 3 -D animations over losssy channels. In {{order to improve}} the expected quality on the <b>client's</b> <b>side,</b> we first transmit a crude model of the 3 -D mesh, of its texture, and of its immediate evolution. We endow this data with significant error-protection against transmission error. Then we transmit a series of upgrades that refine {{the accuracy of the}} model and/or of the animation. These are encoded with lower levels of error protection that is proportional to their impact {{on the quality of the}} upgraded animation. We propose the following types of upgrade chunks: selection of a subset of vertices, adjustments of the accuracy of the positions of the selected vertices, connectivity refinements, motion adjustments of the selected subset of vertices, adjustments of the accuracy of the texture coordinates of the selected vertices, and upgrade of the quality of the texture. Finally, given the allocated bit-budget, we determine the optimal number of both source and channel coding bits assigned for each chunk to maximize the animation quality on the <b>client's</b> <b>side.</b> The optimization takes into account both the bandwidth and the error characteristics of the channel...|$|R
25|$|The PXE {{environment}} {{relies on}} a combination of industry-standard Internet protocols, namely UDP/IP, DHCP and TFTP. These protocols have been selected because they are easily implemented in the client's NIC firmware, resulting in standardized small-footprint PXE ROMs. Standardization, small size of PXE firmware images and their low use of resources are some of the primary design goals, allowing the <b>client</b> <b>side</b> of the PXE standard to be identically implemented {{on a wide variety of}} systems, ranging from powerful client computers to resource-limited single-board computers (SBC) and system-on-a-chip (SoC) computers.|$|E
25|$|If an {{autonomous}} system (AS) exists on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate trafﬁc on the entry and exit {{segments of the}} path and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict a set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during path selection algorithm on <b>client</b> <b>side.</b> In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between client and destination.|$|E
25|$|SQL Native Client is {{the native}} <b>client</b> <b>side</b> data access library for Microsoft SQL Server, version 2005 onwards. It {{natively}} implements {{support for the}} SQL Server features including the Tabular Data Stream implementation, support for mirrored SQL Server databases, full support for all data types supported by SQL Server, asynchronous operations, query notifications, encryption support, as well as receiving multiple result sets in a single database session. SQL Native Client is used under the hood by SQL Server plug-ins for other data access technologies, including ADO or OLE DB. The SQL Native Client can also be directly used, bypassing the generic data access layers.|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} work {{deals with}} the phenomenon of abortive treatment termination at patients with pathologic gambling diagnosis. Retention in treatment and its termination in scheduled term is an important indicator of treatment efficiency which increases expectancy towards further positive development. Abortive treatment termination is a treatment complication, a complex situation affected by factors at <b>client's</b> <b>side</b> as well as factors and possibilities {{at the side of}} the facility and therapists. The aim of the work is to provide complex information on these factors and monitor the factors at <b>client's</b> <b>side.</b> It should detect significant differences between people able to finish whole treatment and those who terminate the treatment abortively. The following important factors were selected: dual diagnoses, clients' debts, social support and clients' delinquency. Gathered data were subjected to quantitative analysis. The set includes both male and female patients who started institutional treatment in Brno in 2001 - 2010. The analysis relates to individual hospitalisations. We keep to total amount of 209 hospitalisations. We established four hypotheses. When assessing them, significant relation was detected between treatment retention and personality and behaviour disorder of adults, retention and delinquency, [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Windows Vista onwards, Terminal Services also {{includes}} a multi-party desktop sharing capability known as Windows Desktop Sharing. Unlike Terminal Services, which creates a new user session for every RDP connection, Windows Desktop Sharing can host the remote session {{in the context of}} the currently logged in user without creating a new session, and make the Desktop, or a subset of it, available over RDP. Windows Desktop Sharing can be used to share the entire desktop, a specific region, or a particular application. Windows Desktop Sharing can also be used to share multi-monitor desktops. When sharing applications individually (rather than the entire desktop), the windows are managed (whether they are minimized or maximized) independently at the server and the <b>client</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
