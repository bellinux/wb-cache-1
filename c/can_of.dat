5|$|On March18, 1980, the NY47 {{designation}} {{was eliminated}} and split into four other routes. From NY104 in Greece to I-490, NY47 became NY390. The section from I-490 south to NY383 was designated {{as part of}} I-390; however, it would not connect to the existing portion of I-390 south of Rochester until 1981, when the interchange between I-390 and I-590 was completed. The segment of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue north to the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms became part of I-590, which continued southwest along the freeway to Winton Road.

5|$|The four-lane I-590 becomes NY590 upon passing under I-490 at the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms on {{the eastern}} edge of Rochester. It heads {{northeast}} into Brighton and through the remainder of the interchange, passing under the ramp connecting I-490 west to I-590 south, the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision, and the ramps from NY590 south to I-490 in succession before widening to six lanes and turning northward ahead of a diamond interchange with Blossom Road, once designated as NY286A. Between Blossom Road and NY286 (Browncroft Boulevard), NY590 slowly turns to the northwest, passing through densely populated neighborhoods located adjacent to the Rochester–Brighton boundary. It reaches the city line and reenters Rochester upon meeting NY286.|$|E
5|$|The freeway travels due north {{along this}} stretch, flanked {{on both sides}} by {{residential}} neighborhoods separated from I-590 only by sound barriers. Not far {{to the north of}} the intersection with NY31 is exit3, a partial diamond interchange for Elmwood Avenue permitting access from I-590 south and to I-590 north. Prior to 1980, NY47 entered the freeway at this point and followed both I-590 and NY590 north to Sea Breeze. Another partial interchange with Highland Avenue follows at exit4—making the two connections that exit3 omits—before I-590 enters the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms, a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490. North of the ramps leading to I-490, I-590 descends northeastward into a cut and passes below both I-490 and NY96 as it becomes NY590, which continues onward toward Sea Breeze.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} I-590 between Winton Road and the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms was {{originally}} {{constructed in the}} 1960s and designated as part of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue northward. In the late 1970s, I-590 was proposed as a designation for the entire southern half of the Outer Loop. Ultimately, it was cut back to its current western terminus at the then-proposed I-390. I-590 was officially assigned in 1980 following the elimination of NY47, and the last segment of the freeway between Winton Road and I-390 was completed by the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} NY590 between the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms and NY104 {{is part of}} the northeastern {{quadrant}} of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways that form a beltway around the city of Rochester. At NY104, the Outer Loop turns west to follow NY104 through Irondequoit. The Sea Breeze Expressway was built in stages from the 1950s to the 1960s and carried various designations until 1970, when the entirety of the Rochester – Sea Breeze highway was designated as part of NY47. It was redesignated as NY590 in 1980. In the late 2000s, the section of NY590 north of Titus Avenue was reconfigured into a two-lane road named Sea Breeze Drive, and NY590 was truncated to end at Titus Avenue.|$|E
