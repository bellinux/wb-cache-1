The <b>core-sheath</b> bico fiber, including such varieties as PE/PP, PE/PET and CoPET/PET are used as bonding fibers for hygiene and medical nonwovens. A cross-sectional morphology of bicomponent fibers can be classified into four main types:”core-sheath”,”side-by-side”,”pie-wedge” and “islands in the sea”.

However, only slightly over 100 polymers can be electrospun into nanofibers under ambient temperature, thus considerably limiting the potential applications of multiple-fluid electrospinning in creating novel nanostructures and functional nanoproducts. A reasonable selection of temperature of the working fluids can be a useful tool for nanofabrication through electrospinning processes. First, some semicrystalline polymers (such as polyethylene and polypropylene) are dissolved in solvents only at an elevated temperature. Elevated temperature electrospinning creates new types of polymer nanofibers [4]. Second, elevated temperature logically decreases the viscosity of polymer solutions but exerts minimal influence on physical entanglements, which particularly benefit the formation of electrospun nanofibers from polymer species with ultra-high molecular weights [16]. Third, numerous functional nanofibers are created by adding a guest active ingredient into a host filament-forming polymer matrix, whereas numerous ingredients, such as numerous poorly water-soluble drugs, exhibit temperature-dependent solubility [17]. Thus, elevated temperature electrospinning has the potential to expand the capability of electrospinning to generate new functional nanofibers and nanostructures.|$|E

They are resilient and have less efficiency {{to return to their}} normal shapes after experiencing mechanical deformations. Moreover, when placed inside the yarn as core component (in case of <b>core-sheath</b> or plied yarns), the mechanical/tensile properties of these metallic filaments drape over the properties of the textile component (Vasile et al. 2011). Since, the core component’s mechanical/tensile properties in any hybrid yarn structure dominates the yarn’s mechanical/tensile properties (Pl et al. 2015), therefore incorporating the metallic filaments as core deteriorate the mechanical/tensile properties of textile yarns and ultimately the fabrics’.|$|E
40|$|Conductive <b>core-sheath</b> TiO 2 -PEDOT nanocables were {{prepared}} using electrospun TiO 2 nanofibers as template, followed by vapor phase polymerization of EDOT. Various techniques {{were employed to}} characterize the sample. The results reveal that the TiO 2 core has an average diameter of ~ 78 nm while the PEDOT sheath has a uniform thickness of ~ 6 nm. The as-prepared TiO 2 -PEDOT nanocables display a fast and reversible response to gaseous NO 2 and NH 3 with a limit of detection as low as 7 ppb and 675 ppb (S/N= 3), respectively. This study provides a route for the synthesis of conductive nanostructures which show excellent performance for sensing applications...|$|E

Taking advantages of the <b>core-sheath</b> structure of unconventional spun yarns, we have developed a yarn modification process and applied it to singles yarns spun by rotor spinning. Torque free singles yarns have been produced from 100 % cotton fibers. The spirality of resultant single jersey knit fabrics has been greatly reduced or, in some cases, completely eliminated. Properties and performance characteristics of both parent and modified yarns {{as well as their}} resultant fabrics have been evaluated including the yarn tensile properties, surface properties, handle, air permeability, burst strength, and piling resistance of the fabrics.

40|$|A {{martensitic}} NiTi {{shape memory}} alloy was processed successfully by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) for one pass at room temperature using a <b>core–sheath</b> billet design. The annealing behavior and shape memory effect of the ECAP specimens were studied followed by post-deformation annealing (PDA) at 673 K for various times. The recrystallization and structural evolution during annealing were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, dilatometry, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and microhardness measurements. The {{results indicate that the}} shape memory effect improves by PDA after ECAP processing. Annealing for 10 min gives a good shape memory effect which leads to a maximum in recoverable strain of 6. 9 pct upon heating where this is more than a 25 pct improvement compared with the initial state...|$|E
40|$|A drug {{delivery}} system {{is designed to provide}} a therapeutic agent in the needed amount,at the right time and to the proper location in the body in a manner that optimizes the efficacy,increases compliance and minimizes side effects. In order to study the encapsulation of therapeutic protein within polymeric nanofiber for controlled release using co-axial electrospinning method,a number of main processing parameters were taken into considerations which are formulation of drug loading,polymer and protein concentration and solution flow rate. Polymeric {{drug delivery}} device was developed via electrospinning technique using biodegradable Polymer A. Co-axial electrospinning configuration was used to encapsulate various mixtures of Drug 0066,Drug 0360 and also Polymer B as support into the electrospun nanofibers. Using the configuration,two separate solutions flowed through two different capillaries and electrospun through co-axial nozzle configuration setup. The electrified jet will undergo stretching, leading to formation of long and thin thread. When the liquid jet is continuously elongated, the solvent will evaporate. The grounded collector will attract the charged fiber. The morphology of the electrospun nanofibers were analyzed using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy(TEM). The hydrophilicity of electrospun nanofibers were determined using Surface Contact Angle machine. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry(FT-IR) was used to detect the organic group of the electrospun nanofibers. In vitro release studies were conducted to evaluate sustained release potential of the <b>core-sheath</b> structure composite nanofiber. The results showed that the TEM images clearly proved the core/shell structure of nanofibers for the encapsulation of Drug 0066 /Drug 0350 within Polymer A. SEM also showed there was an arch appeared within the nanofiber. The present study would provide a basis for further design and optimization of processing conditions to control the nanostructure of <b>core-sheath</b> composite nanofibers and ultimately achieve desired release kinetics of bioactive proteins(e. g., growth factors) for practical tissue engineering applications...|$|E

In this study, ENSs were developed to deliver multiple biomolecules by loading them into the <b>core-sheath</b> structure and/or by conjugating them to the nanofiber surfaces. In this work, poly(L-lactide) -poly(ethylene glycol) -NH 2 and poly(L-lactide) were emulsion electrospun into nanofibers with a <b>core-sheath</b> structure. A model drug, tetracycline hydrochloride, was loaded within the nanofibers. Amino and carboxyl reactive groups were then activated on the fiber surfaces using saturated water vapor exposure and base hydrolysis, respectively. These reactive groups allowed {{the surface of the}} ENS to be functionalized with two other bioactive molecules, fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumins, which were used as model proteins. The ENSs were shown to retain their antimicrobial capacity after two functionalization reactions, indicating that multifunctional nanofibers can potentially be developed into functional wound dressings or periodontal membranes or used in more complicated tissue systems where multiple growth factors and anti-infection precautions are critical for the successful implantation and regeneration of tissues.
