His probation officer found that Straffen {{did not understand the}} difference between right and wrong, or the meaning of probation. The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in Sambourne.|$|E

40|$|Three {{exploratory}} {{studies in}} the field of the services for maladjusted, children are described, in this volume. The first study is based on data obtained from <b>child</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>clinics</b> in those boroughs constituting the Outer London area. Initially the data is presented as rates of referral of children to the- thirty clinics concerned. An examination of these figures is then carried out in terms of the age and sex of the children and the source of referral. Further refinements of this and other data collected about these areas enables the second stage of this study to progress. A causal analysis is carried out which seeks to explain why it is that the rates of referral to <b>child</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>clinics</b> and maladjusted schools vary from one area to another. The concept of social ethos is used as an independent variable and the number of clinic staff available as an intervening variable. The second study addresses itself to the problem of why it is that some families who are referred to <b>child</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>clinics</b> co-operate with the clinics while others do not. An explanatory model based upon both sociological and psychological approaches is developed. This is tested using the techniques of causal analysis.

25|$|During {{the first}} six months of World War II, Bowlby worked at a clinic in Canonbury in the child {{psychiatry}} unit. Later on in the war, Bowlby became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he conducted research on psychological methods of officer selection (which contributed to the creation of War Office Selection Boards) and where he came into contact with members of the Tavistock Clinic. Alongside his job in the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bowlby explained that he also worked for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) during the months of May and June in 1940 where he dealt with tragic war neurosis cases. Additionally, the children that were being treated at the Canonbury clinic were evacuated to the <b>child</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>clinic</b> in Cambridge, due to the air raids from the War. Bowlby explained in an interview that he spent time going back and forth from Cambridge to London, where he would see patients in private. From this experience, Bowlby was able to work with several children at Cambridge that were evacuated from London and separated from their families and nannies. This actually extended his research interested on separation that he was focused on pre-war.|$|E
500|$|Bowlby, who, {{unlike most}} psychoanalysts, had direct {{experience}} {{of working with}} deprived children through {{his work at the}} London <b>Child</b> <b>Guidance</b> <b>Clinic,</b> called for more investigation of children's early lives in a paper published in 1940. He proposed that two environmental factors were paramount in early childhood. The first was death of the mother, or prolonged separation from her. The second was the mother's emotional attitude towards her child. This was followed by a study on forty–four juvenile thieves collected through the Clinic. There were many problematic parental behaviours in the samples but Bowlby was looking at one environmental factor that was easy to document, namely prolonged early separations of child and mother. Of the forty-four thieves, fourteen fell into the category which Bowlby characterised as being of an [...] "affectionless character". Of these fourteen, twelve had suffered prolonged maternal separations as opposed to only two of the control group.|$|E
2500|$|Because of his {{previous}} work with maladapted and delinquent children, he {{became interested in the}} development of children and began work at the <b>Child</b> <b>Guidance</b> <b>Clinic</b> in London, which was also known as the East London <b>Child</b> <b>Guidance</b> <b>Clinic.</b> [...] Located in Islington, it was founded by the Jewish Health Organisation in 1927 and was the first children's psychiatric facility in the UK and possibly Europe. His interest was probably increased by a variety of wartime events involving separation of young children from familiar people. These included the rescue of Jewish children by the Kindertransport arrangements, the evacuation of children from London to keep them safe from air raids, and the use of group nurseries to allow mothers of young children to contribute to the war effort. Bowlby was interested from the beginning of his career in the problem of separation, the wartime work of Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingham on evacuees, and the work of René Spitz with orphans. By the late 1950s, he had accumulated a body of observational and theoretical work to indicate the fundamental importance for human development of attachment from birth.|$|E

2500|$|Lightner Witmer {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} as {{the founder of}} school psychology. Witmer was a student of both Wilhelm Wundt and James Mckeen Cattell. While Wundt believed that psychology should deal with the average or typical performance, Cattell's teachings emphasized individual differences. Witmer followed Cattell's teachings and focused on learning about each individual child's needs. Witmer opened the first psychological and <b>child</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>clinic</b> in 1896 at the University of Pennsylvania. Witmer's goal was to prepare psychologists to help educators solve children's learning problems, specifically those with individual differences. Witmer became an advocate for these special children. He was not focused on their deficits per se, but rather helping them overcome them, {{by looking at the}} individual's positive progress rather than all they still could not achieve. Witmer stated that his clinic helped [...] "to discover mental and moral defects and to treat the child {{in such a way that}} these defects may be overcome or rendered harmless through the development of other mental and moral traits". He strongly believed that active clinical interventions could help to improve the lives of the individual children.|$|E

25|$|As debates {{regarding}} the deteriorating role of American asylums and psychiatry amplified {{around the turn}} of the century, new reformation arose. With the founding of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, acute treatment centers like psychopathic hospitals, psychiatric dispensaries and <b>child</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>clinics</b> were created. Beginning with the State Care Act in New York, states began assuming full financial control for the mentally ill, in an effort to compensate for the deprivations of asylums. Between 1903 and 1950, the number of patients in state mental hospitals went from 150,000 to 512,000. Morrissey recognizes that despite persistent problem of chronic mental illness, these state mental hospitals were able to provide a minimal level of care.|$|R

Central concepts as used in the study, were broadly defined. Chapter 2 is mainly a review of relevant literature and deals with the aim and functioning of Guidance Services I Education Aid Services in general, with specific reference to the organization and administration of such services and the nature of guidance programmes in the United States of America, Britain and West Germany. Different approaches to Guidance and the principles of Guidance Services were reviewed. The training and qualifications of Guidance personnel in the • above-mentioned countries were also investigated. The aim of this review was to set criterion on which the Education Aid Service of the TED could be judged in chapter 5. The origin and development of the Education Aid Service of the TED since its modest inception in 1914 is described in chapter 3. This was outlined in four clearly distinguishable stages, viz. the origin and development of the Psychological Service, the development of the Vocational Guidance Service, the amalgamation of these two services in 1955 and the inception of the present Education Aid Service in 1983. The aims and policy, organization and administration as well as personnel aspects of the Transvaal Education Aid Service of the present day were investigated in chapter 4.

40|$|Female {{violence}} {{has long been}} eclipsed in public discourses and representations by male misuse of force. This appears to be true {{especially in the case}} of youth behaviour: whereas brutality in boys was constitutive of their rising manliness, violence in girls was supposed to be impossible, hidden or pathological. In accordance with their social status as subordinates belonging to the so-called “private sphere”, young women were not viewed as threatening social order. The rise of <b>Child</b> <b>Guidance</b> institutions in the juvenile justice system triggered a new perception of female violence. Violence on the part of girls was considered highly gender-specific; as such it entered the aetiology of deviant behaviour, under the category of “behaviour trouble”.
