5|$|She {{also took}} steps to ensure {{possession}} of land to the genuine people taking strong view on encroachment of land allotted to members of scheduled castes and tribes. In 2010, 5596 people belonging to the SC and ST <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> allotted 1054.879 hectares of agriculture land. In a special drive 74 FIRs were filed and 88 people were arrested for illegal occupation from agricultural land.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E

5|$|According to estimates, around 77,980 Armenians {{lived in}} the US by 1919. An {{unprecedented}} number of Armenians entered the country in 1920, but the Immigration Act of 1924 that restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe barred many other Armenians from emigrating to the US. Most of the post-World War I immigrants were women and children, {{in contrast to the}} prewar immigration, which was predominantly young and male. Like Italians, for whom this practice was known as campanilismo, Armenian <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> often formed by people from the same village or town in the Ottoman Empire. This practice almost entirely disappeared after World War II.|$|E
5|$|Because Eastern European Romani <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> less {{organised}} than Jewish communities, Porajmos was {{not well}} documented. There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long {{wanted to make a}} documentary on this less well-known subject, but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani made it difficult.|$|E
5|$|Catholic <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> already {{established}} in Greece since the 13th century (Athens, Cyclades, Chios, Crete). Jewish communities also {{existed in the}} country, those arriving after the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492) joining the earlier Romaniotes, Jews who had been living there since the times of Apostle Paul. Muslim families were still living in Greece during Otto's reign, since hostility was mainly against the Ottoman state and its depressive mechanisms and not against Muslim people.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>community</b> <b>is</b> {{judged on}} their {{capacity}} to improve the community in these categories. <b>Communities</b> <b>are</b> awarded a Bloom Rating based on its achievements from one to five.

5|$|During the 19th century, the {{watershed}} {{became part of}} a rancho. In 1966, the creek was dammed to form Laguna Niguel Lake, while the surrounding hills were leveled as residential <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> constructed in the area following the '60s and '70s. The creek's basin eventually {{became part of the}} cities of Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, and a small portion in San Juan Capistrano. Increasing urban runoff in the 1960s caused most of the flow in the creek to be unnatural. The creek has since been channelized along most of its length to prevent floods from inundating the roads and houses that now line much of its banks.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Yusuf Pasha's request, the Ottoman government sent its instructions to Rhodes, where {{they arrived at}} the end of April. The government would set up an official investigatory commission before which representatives of the Jewish and Greek <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> ordered to present their evidence. In mid-May, the government sent orders to release the six remaining Jewish prisoners. On May 21, they were ceremoniously called before the court (shura) and freed under the guarantees of the elders of the Jewish community.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> {{unable to}} access produce {{that the majority}} of Britain would such as peppers or aubergines. Artisan Welsh produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and Welsh wine was of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical Welsh foods were going through a revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, Welsh organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear in supermarkets. Other modern Welsh characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering salty butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E

40|$|Within China six Early Viséan rugose coral <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> recognized, {{they are}} : 1) the Siphonophyllia {{community}}, 2) the cool water Gangamophyllum community, 3) the Thysanophyllum community, 4) the Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites community, 5) the island Humboldtia community and 6) {{the cold water}} Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma community. In northwest China, the Siphonophyllia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> distributed along the northern margin of the Tarim-Qaidam Oldland. The Gangamophyllum <b>community</b> <b>was</b> widespread north of the region occupied by the Siphonophyllia community, including north Tianshan, central Tianshan and east Junggar. In South China there were three rugose coral communities. The Thysanophyllum community occurs on {{the margin of the}} Upper Yangtze Oldland. The Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites <b>community</b> <b>was</b> confined to the southern and western part of the region occupied by the Thysanophyllum community. These two communities merge into each other without a distinct boundary. The Humboldtia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> found only in the Baoshan area. The Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma <b>community</b> <b>is</b> found in Xainza and Himalaya of Tibet. The distribution of the six Early Viséan rugose coral <b>communities</b> <b>was</b> controlled by the palaeogeographical background. The Gangamophyllum community occurs along the southern margin of the Siberia Oldland, while the Siphonophyllia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> distributed along the northern margin of Tarim-Qaidam Oldland. The Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma <b>community</b> <b>is</b> confined to the northern margin of the Gondwana Oldland. In the wide southern and western margin of Yangtze Oldland the distribution of the Thysanophyllum and the Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites <b>communities</b> <b>was</b> controlled by the bathymetry. The Humboldtia community probably lived in island seas far from the Yangtze Oldland...|$|R
5|$|In the {{municipality}} of Atlamajalcingo, a woman died after {{a collapse of}} a dwelling. In Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero, four people perished. Numerous trees were downed and power outages were reported. Additionally, the nearby Cerrito Rico dam nearly overflowed its banks. In the Tecpan municipality, four rivers overflowed their banks and six people died because of landslides. Many mountainous <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> isolated, thus making in difficult to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have been prevented. According to one account, two master planned <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{settlement}} {{was taking place}} in Poland since very early times. In 1264, Duke Bolesław the Pious of Greater Poland granted the privileges of the Statute of Kalisz, which specified {{a broad range of}} freedoms of religious practices, movement, and trading for the Jews. It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment and exclusion. The act exempted the Jews from enslavement or serfdom and was the foundation of future Jewish prosperity in the Polish kingdom; it was later followed by many other comparable legal pronouncements. Following a series of expulsions of Jews from Western Europe, Jewish <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> established in Kraków, Kalisz and elsewhere in western and southern Poland in the 13th century. Another series of <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> established at Lviv, Brest-Litovsk and Grodno further east in the 14th century. King Casimir received Jewish refugees from Germany in 1349, which assisted the acceleration of a Jewish expansion in Poland that was to continue until World War II. German urban and rural settlements were another long-lasting ethnic feature.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2007, the <b>community</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} as being [...] "approximately 750 houses". The <b>community</b> <b>was</b> originally created to provide low-income housing ...|$|R

5|$|Jews also {{spread across}} Europe during the period. <b>Communities</b> <b>were</b> {{established}} in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries, but Spanish Jews, long settled in Spain under the Muslims, came under Christian rule and increasing pressure {{to convert to}} Christianity. Most Jews were confined to the cities, as they {{were not allowed to}} own land or be peasants. Besides the Jews, there were other non-Christians on the edges of Europe—pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the caste system and these <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.|$|E
5|$|On 26 August 1929, {{during the}} 1929 Palestine riots the kibbutz was {{attacked}} by an Arab mob equipped with firearms. The villagers and Arab policemen managed to fend away the rioters. British policemen told the kibbutz to evacuate and promised to take care for their property and the kibbutz left the following day. On 28 August, Arab rioters burned the kibbutz's barn, uprooted trees, stole corn from the fields and vandalized two gravestones in the kibbutz's cemetery. It {{was the only time}} in the history of the kibbutz it was abandoned and during the riots 16 other Jewish <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> evacuated.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the Blue Cross Foundation {{found that}} there are four types of <b>communities</b> that can <b>be</b> {{identified}} based on their risk of uninsurance: entrenched-risk, unexpected-risk, resilient, and low-risk. Entrenched-risk <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that have {{a high concentration of}} foreign-born denizens, and therefore {{are less likely to be}} eligible for Medicare. Unexpected-risk communities have high uninsurance but were not expected to based on their geographical locations, like Cape Cod or Boston. Resilient <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that <b>were</b> expected to have high uninsurance but did not, like Worcester and north and south of Boston. Finally, low-risk <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that have high rate of insurance and were expected to have high rates of insurance based on their characteristics.|$|R

5|$|Postwar {{redevelopment}} and anti-Victorianism {{resulted in}} the loss of dozens of Victorian buildings like New Street station and the old Central Library, often replaced by brutalist architecture. Sir Herbert Manzoni, City Engineer and Surveyor of Birmingham from 1935 until 1963, believed conservation of old buildings was sentimental and that the city did not have any of worth anyway. In inner-city areas too, much Victorian housing was demolished and redeveloped. Existing <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> relocated to tower block estates like Castle Vale.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds {{from the}} {{hurricane}} downed trees and power lines throughout southern Oaxaca. The storm temporarily isolated Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca and a navy base thereby cutting off communications {{from the rest}} of Mexico. In Huatulco, the winds blew down antennas at the local television station and destroyed at least 30cardboard houses. A community near the airport of the city was hit hard, with several people left homeless. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused severe flooding in portions of Oaxaca and neighboring Chiapas. A total of about 500entire <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> destroyed in Oaxaca; the areas worst affected were Zapotecos, Chatino, and Mixtecos.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{community}} in England continued to provide essential money-lending and banking services that were otherwise {{banned by the}} usury laws, and grew in the 12th century by Jewish immigrants fleeing the fighting around Rouen. The Jewish community spread beyond London to eleven major English cities, primarily the major trading hubs in the east of England with functioning mints, all with suitable castles for protection of the often persecuted Jewish minority. By {{the time of the}} Anarchy and the reign of Stephen, the <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> flourishing and providing financial loans to the king.|$|E
