25|$|Agents, while bounded in structure, {{draw upon}} their {{knowledge}} of that structural context when they act. However, actions are constrained by agents' inherent capabilities and their understandings of available actions and external limitations. Practical consciousness and discursive consciousness inform these abilities. Practical consciousness is the knowledgeability that an agent brings to the tasks required by everyday life, which is so integrated as to be hardly noticed. Reflexive monitoring occurs {{at the level of}} practical consciousness. Discursive consciousness is the ability to verbally express knowledge. Alongside practical and discursive consciousness, Giddens recognizes actors as having reflexive, <b>contextual</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and that habitual, widespread use of knowledgeability makes structures become institutionalized.|$|E

40|$|Public policy assumptions, which view “the public” as passive consumers, {{are deeply}} flawed. “The public” are, in fact, active citizens, who {{constitute}} the innovation {{end of the}} seamless web of relationships, running from research and development laboratory to shop, hospital or farm, or local neighborhood. “The public” do not receive the impact of technology; they are the impact, in that they determine with gene technology (GT) developers and sellers {{what happens to the}} technology in our society. In doing so, they, or more rightly we, exercise particular, <b>contextual</b> <b>knowledges</b> and actions. We suggest that it is the ignorance of this aspect of innovation in policy processes that produces the distrust and resentment that we found in our interviews with “publics” interested in gene technology. This is consistent with Beck’s description of the deep structural states of risk and fear in modern advanced societies with respect to new technologies, such as gene technology. Only policy processes that recognize the particular, local, and <b>contextual</b> <b>knowledges</b> of “the public,” which co-construct innovation, can achieve deep, social structural consideration of gene technology. And only such a deep consideration can avoid the polarized attitudes and deep suspicions that we have seen arise in places such as Britain. Such consideration needs the type of processes that involve active consultation and inclusion of “the public” in government and commercial innovation, the so-called deliberative and inclusionary processes (DIPs), such as consensus conferences and citizen juries. We suggest some measures that could be tried in Australia, which would take us further down the path of participation toward technological citizenship...|$|R

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} generated {{to capture the}} relationship between vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension ability: instrumen-tal and knowledge. While the former considers <b>contextual</b> vocabulary <b>knowledge,</b> i. e., knowing {{the meaning of the}} words used in a text, as the necessary and sufficient condition for comprehending that text, the latter holds it necessary but not sufficient. This study was conducted to test the instrumental hypothesis. The disclosed vocabulary section of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) was adopted as a measure of global vocabulary knowledge, i. e., knowing the meaning of the words unrelated to the text of TOEFL’s reading comprehension section, which was used as a measure of reading comprehension ability. For measuring <b>contextual</b> vocabulary <b>knowledge,</b> another vocabulary test was constructed on the words used in the text of the reading comprehension test. The administration of the contextual vocabulary, global vocabulary, and reading comprehension tests to 64 non-native speakers (NNSs) and 123 native speakers (NSs) showed that although NSs scored significantly higher than NNSs on all tests, the performance of both NNSs and NSs on the contextual vocabulary tests was the best predictor of their performance on the reading comprehension test.

40|$|Abstract. The {{detection}} and extraction of complex anatomical structures usually involves a trade-off between {{the complexity of}} local feature extraction and classification, and the complexity and performance of the subsequent structural inference {{from the viewpoint of}} combinatorial optimization.

We present an efficient method for part-based localization of anatomical structures which embeds <b>contextual</b> shape <b>knowledge</b> in a probabilistic graphical model.

However, these attempts are focused towards identification and inclusion of <b>contextual</b> scientific <b>knowledge</b> in the curricula and very little is understood about the attributes knowledge, skill and competence necessary to successfully undertake N&N research. Identification of these attributes is important so that the <b>contextual</b> scientific <b>knowledge</b> can be embedded in the curricula more effectively. Also, it is uncertain whether this growing research area requires researchers that have studied specialised undergraduate or postgraduate N&N programmes or traditional science and engineering disciplines. In other words, is N&N research multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary or will it develop into a unique discipline is not clear. To address this question, this qualitative study will examine the postgraduate researchers’ experiences of researching in N&N area. Studying how the researchers understand, interpret and describe their experiences, we can achieve a new; or; at the very least a wider understanding of what N&N research is; and how the postgraduate researchers use their education and training to research in this area. This in turn will inform the curriculum development at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels and address the issues of whether we should have specialised undergraduate N&N programmes or simply different distinct science and engineering disciplines coming together...|$|R

50|$|The {{difficulties}} of establishing common ground, especially in using telecommunications technology, can {{give rise to}} dispositional rather than situational attribution. This tendency {{is known as the}} “actor-observer effect”. What this means is that people often attribute their own behavior to situational causes, while observers attribute the actor’s behavior to the personality or disposition of the actor. For example, an actor’s common reason to be late is due to the situational reason, traffic. Observers’ lack of <b>contextual</b> <b>knowledge</b> about the traffic, i.e. common ground, leads to them attributing the lateness due to ignorance or laziness on the actor’s part. This tendency towards dispositional attribution is especially magnified when the stakes are higher and the situation is more complex. When observers are relatively calm, the tendency towards dispositional attribution is less strong.|$|E
