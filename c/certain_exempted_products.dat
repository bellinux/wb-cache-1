40|$|The {{treatment}} and selection of special products is a sensitive subject {{because of the}} divergent conditions and needs of developing countries. Some countries have negligible tariff bindings while others have high tariff bindings. The {{results of this study}} demonstrate that countries with high tariff bindings may rely too heavily on a few commodities to achieve their food security, livelihood and rural development objectives while others with low tariff bindings may face broad economic onsequences that impact those objectives. The case studies conducted highlight the need for some countries to be able to <b>exempt</b> <b>certain</b> <b>products</b> from any cuts. An effective special product designation is an important negotiating objective for many developing countries and this may be contingent upon exemption from cuts for some products.

Some states further limited the sale of paregoric, or banned over-the-counter sales entirely.
