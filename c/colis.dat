[...] This concentration of glucose used supports a maximum population of 500 million cells of the ancestor in a 10 mL culture, though the maximum now varies among the evolved populations.

M??todos: Foram estudados 2 hospitais municipais do Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil. Definiram-se como acidentes de tr??nsito os eventos: atropelamentos, <b>colis??es</b> e outros acidentes de tr??nsito. A coleta de dados referiu-se ao atendimento dos meses de maio (Hospital 1) e junho (Hospital 2) de 1996 e foi realizada por 7 equipes que se revesaram em plant??es de 12 horas ao longo de todo per??odo estudado, perfazendo 24 horas/dia de coleta. As causas declaradas pelos pacientes ou, na impossibilidade deste, pelo socorrista ou acompanhante, foram a fonte de classifica????o dos eventos. Resultados: Foram atendidos 320 casos no Hospital 1 e 290 no Hospital 2. Em ambos os hospitais, os homens foram os mais atingidos (69, 3 por cento) e a faixa et??ria mais afetada foi a de 20 a 39 anos (60, 5 por cento no Hospital 1 e 47, 5 por cento no Hospital 2). Dos 610 casos, a maioria foi devido a atropelamentos (49, 3 por cento), seguidos pelas <b>colis??es</b> (35, 6 por cento) e outros acidentes (15, 1 por cento). Conclus??es: A an??lise da distribui????o dos casos e do tipo de atendimento demandado corrobora a sugest??o de uma melhor organiza????o das equipes, maior rigor no registro hospitalar e os aspectos que deveriam ser mais enfatizados nas campanhas de preven????o. Introduction Morbidity due {{to motor}} vehicle {{accidents}} was analysed in a descriptive study based on reports of hospitals {{with the objective}} to characterize their victims, types of injuries, and the health care provided. Methods The study {{was carried out in}} two municipal hospitals of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Motor vehicle accidents were defined as a run over, a collision, and ???other traffic accidents???. Data was collected from cases seen in May (Hospital 1) and June (Hospital 2) of 1996 by 7 teams that alternated in shifts of 12 hours, covering the collection 24 hours per day. The events were classified according to the victim or, when it was impossible, to the person who helped them or accompanied them to the hospital. Results In the study period, 320 cases were seen in Hospital 1 and 290 in Hospital 2. Most of the victims were men (69. 3 %) in both of hospitals and the most affected group was young adults between 20 to 39 years (60. 5 % in Hospital 1 and 47. 5 % in Hospital 2). Of all 610 cases, the main cause of injury was run overs (49. 3 %), followed by collisions (35. 6 %), and ???other traffic accidents??? (15. 1 %). Conclusions The analysis of the cases distributions and the type of care required corroborates with the need of a better organization of hospital care teams, more completeness of hospital reports and emphasis on some aspects in prevention campaigns...|$|R

Quando ocorre uma colis?o, normalmente o ve?culo espacial fica totalmente danificado e destru?do, portanto, garantir ao sat?lite o desvio da colis?o, preservar? o objetivo da miss?o. Neste estudo, veremos como um ve?culo espacial pode executar uma manobra evasiva, atrav?s do sistema propulsor, sob o efeito da for?a de arrasto atmosf?rico, cuja efici?ncia ser? estabelecida atrav?s das configura??es dos par?metros tecnol?gicos, sendo estes, a quantidade de combust?vel do ve?culo espacial e a capacidade de ejetar propelente pelo sistema propulsor. O objetivo da manobra evasiva ? evitar a colis?o, mas, mantendo o ve?culo em sua ?rbita nominal. A princ?pio foi encontrado um conjunto de condi??es iniciais de colis?o com o ve?culo espacial sob o efeito da for?a gravitacional da Terra, para garantir que haveria a colis?o entre os objetos e, a partir disto, foi aplicada a for?a de propuls?o, depois considerando somente o efeito do arrasto atmosf?rico sobre os objetos e logo ap?s, o ve?culo espacial e o detrito foram postos sob o efeito de ambas da for?a de propuls?o e do arrasto atmosf?rico, juntas. Em busca da manobra mais econ?mica, do ponto de vista do consumo de combust?vel, foram executadas manobras com tempo de acionamento de propuls?o menor, e em diferentes momentos da trajet?ria do ve?culo e tamb?m por tempos aleat?rios de acionamento de for?a de propuls?o. As manobras foram determinadas atrav?s de simula??es num?ricas para cada modelo matem?tico das perturba??es adicionadas ? din?mica orbital sob o efeito da for?a gravitacional. In this {{research}} we studied evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions {{in an environment}} with debris, enabling missions to the space. When a collision occurs, usually the space vehicle is completely damaged and destroyed, thus ensuring that the satellite avoids this collision will preserve {{the objective of the}} mission. In this study, we will see how a space vehicle can perform an evasive maneuver through thedriveline under the effect of the atmospheric drag force, whose efficiency will be established through the settings of technological parameters, which are the amount of fuel in the space vehicle and the ability to eject the propellant through the propulsion system. The purpose of the evasive maneuver is to avoid the collision but to keep the vehicle in its nominal orbit. At first we found several initial conditions of collision with the space vehicle under the influence of Earth's gravitational force, to ensure {{that there would be a}} collision between objects, from that on, the propulsion force was applied, after that, considering only the effect of atmospheric drag on the objects and right after the two collisional objects were brought under the effect of both forces, the force of the atmospheric drag and the propulsion together. In search of the most economical maneuver, from the point of view of fuel consumption, maneuvers were performed with lower propulsion drive time, and at different times of the trajectory of the vehicle and also at random times with the use of the propulsion force. The maneuvers were found through numerical simulations for each mathematical model of disturbances added to the orbital dynamics under the influence of the gravitational force...|$|R

Neste trabalho foi feito um estudo das excita??es eletr?nicas da mol?cula isopreno utilizando um espectr?metro de perda de energia de el?trons de baixa resolu??o (0, 8 ? 1, 0 eV FWHM) no Laborat?rio de Impacto de F?tons e El?trons (LIFE-UFRJ). Os espectros de perda de energia de el?trons foram obtidos na faixa de 3 a 100 eV em v?rios ?ngulos de espalhamentos com energia incidente de 1 keV. Os espectros de for?a do oscilador generalizado (FOG) para a mol?cula isopreno foram obtidos pela convers?o de Bethe-Born. O espectro de FOG obtido no ?ngulo de impacto de 2 o foi extrapolado para for?a do oscilador de fotoabsor??o ?tico utilizando a f?rmula {{universal}} de Msezane e Sakmar (1997). As se??es de choque de fotoabsor??o em escala absoluta foram determinadas por meio da polarizabilidade est?tica do isopreno aplicando a regra de soma S(- 2) no espectro de fotoabsor??o. As contribui??es da fotoabsor??o da camada interna acima de 100 eV foram estimadas com o ajuste de uma curva polinomial. Outras regras de somas foram utilizadas para estimar os valores de propriedades f?sicas para o isopreno como a regra de soma S(0) que ? igual ao n?mero de el?trons no alvo (36, 45 u. a., unidades at?micas), a regra de soma logar?tmica L(0) ? o {{stopping power}} da mol?cula (18, 05 u. a.), a regra de soma logar?tmica L(1) ? o efeito straggling referente ?s flutua??es est?ticas do feixe incidente (22, 49 u. a.) e a regra de soma logar?tmica L(2) referente ao deslocamento de Lamb (55, 27 u. a.). O conjunto de espectros de FOG obtidos em diferentes ?ngulos de espalhamento foi apresentado na Superf?cie de Bethe para o isopreno. Duas regi?es se destacaram: uma regi?o dominada pelas regras de sele??o ?pticas de transi??es eletr?nicas dos processos de absor??o, e a outra regi?o, foi observado uma forte depend?ncia angular em que o momento linear dos el?trons incidentes torna-se significativo. A Superf?cie de Bethe e as regras de somas s?o resultados experimentais in?ditos na literatura. Os valores absolutos de se??o de choque e a Superf?cie de Bethe podem contribuir para um entendimento completo das excita??es eletr?nicas da mol?cula isopreno induzidas por <b>colis?es</b> de part?culas carregadas. ? esperado que estes valores absolutos possam ser ?teis como refer?ncias em c?lculos te?ricos e experimentais para o espectro eletr?nico do isopreno. The absolute {{values of the}} photoabsorption cross section of compounds are of great importance {{in the fields of}} physics, chemistry, biology, therapy and related fields. Studies of natural products are also of great importance several areas of science and innovation, however, information related to the values of the photoabsorption cross section in the vacuum ultraviolet region are scarce in the literature. In this paper a study of the electronic excitations of the molecule isoprene using a spectrometer energy loss of electrons from low-resolution (0, 8 ? 1, 0 eV FWHM) at the Laboratory for Photon and Electron Impact (LIFE-UFRJ). The energy loss spectra of electrons were obtained in the range 3 - 100 eV at various angles of scattering with incident energy of 1 keV. The spectra of generalized oscillator strength (GOS) for the isoprene molecule were obtained by the Bethe-Born conversion. The spectrum GOS obtained in the angle of impact 2 o was extrapolated to the strength oscillator photoabsorption optical using the universal formula Msezane and Sakmar (1997). The photoabsorption cross sections on an absolute scale were determined by of the static polarizability of isoprene applying the sum rule S(- 2) in the photoabsorption spectrum. The contributions of the inner layer photoabsorption above 100 eV were estimated from a fit polynomial curve. Other sum rules were used to estimate the values of physical properties isoprene as sum rule S(0) is equal to the number of electrons on the target (36, 45 a. u.), the rule logarithmic L(0) is the stopping power of the molecule (18, 05 a. u.), the rule logarithmic L(1) is related to the effect straggling referring to fluctuations of the incident beam (22, 49 a. u.) and rule logarithmic L(2) for the Lamb shift (55, 27 a. u.). The set of spectra GOS obtained at different scattering angles were presented in Bethe surface to isoprene. Two regions stand out: a region dominated by the optical selection rules for electronic transitions of the absorption, and the other region, we observed a strong angular dependence on the momentum of the incident electrons becomes significant. The Bethe surface and the sum rules are unpublished experimental data in the literature. The absolute values of the cross section and the Bethe surface can contribute to a complete understanding of the electronic excitations of the molecule isoprene induced by collisions of charged particles. It is expected that these absolute valuesmay be useful as references to theoretical calculations and experimental in the electronic spectra of isoprene...|$|R

The public mind is usually caught by any loud declaration in favor of the ruling prejudice, and, after the first brief pause of surprise was past, the determination of the groom was received with a shout of applause that was immediately followed by general, coarse, and deriding laughter.

Justice is {{represented}} as blind, in order that it may be seen she is no respecter of persons: and wert thou an Avoyer, the decree must come. Reflect maturely, therefore, on all the facts, and thou wilt come, in time, to see the impossibility of thine own innocence.

60|$|The buffoon and the pilgrim, {{though of}} a general {{appearance}} likely to excite distrust, presented themselves with the confidence and composure of innocence. Their examination was short, for the account they gave of their movements was clear and connected. Circumstances that were known to the monks, too, greatly aided in producing a conviction {{that they could have}} had no agency in the murder. They had left the valley below some hours before the arrival of Jacques <b>Colis,</b> and they reached the convent, weary and foot-sore, as was usual with all who ascended that long and toilsome path, shortly after the commencement of the storm. Measures had been taken by the local authorities, during the time lost in waiting the arrival of the bailiff and the châtelain, to ascertain all the minute facts which it was supposed would be useful in ferreting out the truth; and the results of these inquiries had also been favorable to these itinerants, whose habits of vagabondism might otherwise very justly have brought them within the pale of suspicion.|$|E
60|$|The {{hour was}} still early when {{all on the}} pass {{assembled}} {{in the place of}} worship. The body of Jacques <b>Colis</b> had been removed to a side chapel, where, covered with a pall, it awaited the mass for the dead. Two large church candles stood lighted {{on the steps of the}} great altar, and the spectators, including Pierre and the muleteers, the servants of the convent, and others of every rank and age, were drawn up in double files in its front. Among the silent spectators appeared Balthazar and his wife, Maso, in truth a prisoner, but with the air of a liberated man, the pilgrim, and Pippo. The good prior was present in his robes, with all of his community. During the moments of suspense which preceded the rites, he discoursed civilly with the châtelain and the bailiff, both of whom returned his courtesies with interest, and in the manner in which it becomes the dignified and honored to respect appearances in the presence of their inferiors. Still the demeanor of most was feverish and excited, as if the occasion were one of compelled gaiety, into which unwelcome and extraordinary circumstances of alloy had thrust themselves unbidden.|$|E
60|$|The {{identity}} of the body as that of Jacques <b>Colis,</b> a small but substantial proprietor of the country of Vaud, was quickly established. To this fact not only several of the travellers could testify, {{but he was also}} known to one of the muleteers, of whom he had engaged a beast to be left at Aoste and, it will also be remembered, he had been seen by Pierre at Martigny, while making his arrangements to puss the mountain. Of the mule there were no other traces than a few natural signs around the building, but which might equally be attributed to the beasts that still awaited the leisure of the travellers. The manner in which the unhappy man had come by his death admitted of no dispute. There were several wounds in the body, and a knife, of the sort then much used by travellers of an ordinary class, was left sticking in his back in a position to render it impossible to attribute the end of the sufferer to suicide. The clothes, too, exhibited proofs of a struggle, for they were torn and soiled, but nothing had been taken away. A little gold was found in the pockets, and though in no great plenty still enough to weaken the first impression that there had also been a robbery.|$|E
60|$|The evasion {{of a few}} lawless blackguards {{from their}} prison was not an event likely long to divert the {{attention}} of the curious from the amusements of the day, especially as it was understood that their confinement would have terminated of itself with the setting sun. But when the fact was communicated to Peter Hofmeister, the sturdy bailiff swore fifty harsh oaths at the impudence of the knaves, at the carelessness of their keepers, and in honor of the good cause of justice in general. After which he incontinently commanded that the runaways should be apprehended. This material part of the process achieved, he moreover, ordered that they should be brought forthwith into his presence, even should he be engaged in the most serious of the ceremonies of the day. The voice of Peter speaking in anger was not likely to be unheard, and the stern mandate had scarcely issued from his lips, when a dozen of the common thief-takers of Vaud set about the affair in good earnest, and with the best possible intentions to effect their object. In the mean time the sports continued, and, as the day drew on, and the hour for the banquet approached, the good people began to collect once more in the great square to witness the closing scenes, and to be present at the nuptial benediction, which was to be pronounced over Jacques <b>Colis</b> and Christine by a real servitor of the altar, as the last and most important of the ceremonies of that eventful day.|$|E
