40|$|Abstract: The {{configurations}} of several Assur kinematic chains (AKCs) are analysed {{with the aid}} of coupler curves. An analysed linkage is dismantled into two constituent linkages. The intersec-tion points of two coupler curves generated by the constituent linkages are the solutions of the dismantling point. All possible {{configurations of}} the linkage can then be obtained with the dis-mantling point being found by solving two coupler curve equations. The coupler curve equations of Watt-I and Stephenson-I six-bar are derived with orders and <b>circularities</b> being emphasized. All three AKCs with seven-link and several AKCs with nine-link and even with 11 -link are analysed. The maximum number of solutions can also be determined easily {{on the basis of the}} orders and <b>circularities</b> of the coupler curves. The chains with prismatic joints included are also considered...|$|R

As it turns out, the task is not trivial; and the analysis of the problem leads to a few surprising conclusions. ...|$|R
25|$|Example 1. The Boolean {{prototype}} is a Boolean algebra, since trivially it satisfies its own laws. It is {{thus the}} prototypical Boolean algebra. We {{did not call}} it that initially {{in order to avoid}} any appearance of <b>circularity</b> in the definition.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} {{there has been}} some dispute as to the best {{definition}} of feedback. According to Ashby (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in the principles of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of <b>circularity</b> of action, which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more practical aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>circularity</b> in Everett's {{measurement}} theory. Under {{the assumptions}} made by Everett, {{there are no}} 'good observations' as defined by him, and since {{his analysis of the}} observational process depends on the latter, it is void of any meaning. The concept of a 'good observation' is the projection postulate in disguise and Everett's analysis simply derives this postulate by having assumed it, without any discussion.|$|E

It bears little relation to the well-crafted 11-tablet epic; the lines {{at the beginning of}} the first tablet are quoted at the end of the 11th tablet, giving it <b>circularity</b> and finality. Tablet 12 is a near copy of an earlier Sumerian tale, a prequel, in which Gilgamesh sends Enkidu to retrieve some objects of his from the Underworld, and he returns in the form of a spirit to relate the nature of the Underworld to Gilgamesh.|$|E
25|$|The Earth's orbit approximates an ellipse. Eccentricity {{measures}} {{the departure of}} this ellipse from <b>circularity.</b> The shape of the Earth's orbit varies between nearly circular (with the lowest eccentricity of 0.000055) and mildly elliptical (highest eccentricity of 0.0679) Its geometric or logarithmic mean is 0.0019. The major component of these variations occurs with a period of 413,000 years (eccentricity variation of ±0.012). Other components have 95,000-year and 125,000-year cycles (with a beat period of 400,000 years). They loosely combine into a 100,000-year cycle (variation of −0.03 to +0.02). The present eccentricity is 0.017 and decreasing.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{circular}} migration {{has been described}} as a triple-win scenario, providing benefits for the host country, the home country, and the migrants themselves. Developed countries allow migrants to enter in order to fill labor shortages, but with the understanding that the settlement is not permanent, distinguishing it from immigration. Developing countries benefit in the sense that they are not truly losing their skilled migrants, as these workers will return after a period of time to continue working. The migrants themselves benefit through the skills they learn abroad, as well as their increase in wages. The form of benefits in this triple-win discourse often take three forms: financial capital, human capital, and social capital. <b>Circularity</b> is the most beneficial whenever migrants move voluntary between locations in the pursuit of different interests, as well as when migrants have positive experiences while abroad, including financial and educational success.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes pernicious <b>circularities</b> {{appear in}} {{definitions}} of fundamental concepts of argumentation theory. For instance, in pragma-dialectical theory, {{the concept of}} a fallacy and that of a critical discussion aiming at resolving a difference of opinion mutually presuppose one another. A similar relationship obtains, in argumentation theory at large, between {{the concept of a}}rgumentation and that of rationality. Again, the concept of an argumentative dialogue presupposes a concept of statement. Yet, statementhood is sometimes claimed to be determined by a locution’s function in dialogue. Similarly, for the concepts of proof and argument. Are these <b>circularities</b> really objectionable? Are they resolvable? If they are not, how can we live with them? It will be argued that some of these problems can be neglected some of the time, but not all of them all of the time. Though there may be no royal road towards resolution, several strategies can be applied. But sometimes patience is what is needed...|$|R
40|$|Arguments in {{structured}} argumentation {{are usually}} defined as trees, and extensions as sets of such tree-based arguments with various properties {{depending on the}} particular argumentation semantics. However, these arguments and extensions may have redundancies as well as <b>circularities,</b> which are conceptually and computationally undesirable. Focusing on the specific case of Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA), we propose novel notions of arguments and admissible/grounded extensions, both {{defined in terms of}} graphs. We show that this avoids the redundancies and <b>circularities</b> of standard accounts, and set out the relationship to standard tree-based arguments and admissible/grounded extensions (as sets of arguments). We also define new notions of graph-based admissible/grounded dispute derivations for ABA, for determining whether specific sentences hold under the admissible/grounded semantics. We show that these new derivations are superior with respect to standard dispute derivations in that they are complete in general, rather than solely for restricted classes of ABA frameworks. Finally, we present several experiments comparing the implementation of graph-based admissible/grounded dispute derivations with implementations of standard dispute derivations, suggesting that the graph-based approach is computationally advantageous.

25|$|Current {{migration}} policy rarely {{takes into account}} circular migration, instead mainly focusing on the dichotomous concepts of “permanent” and “temporary.” In contrast to temporary migration, circular migration allows the worker to simultaneously be engaged with both the home and host countries. Furthermore, it typically involves both return to the country of origin and repeated moves to the destination country. In many ways, being connected to both places provides an advantage for the migrant worker, {{because they do not}} have to make a definitive choice to stay in one. This allows for the maximization of capabilities, a concept articulated by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. By working in a high-income location with better earnings and spending in low-income, low-cost countries, the migrant worker is able to realize the best capabilities for both themselves and their families. <b>Circularity</b> also allows for the maintenance of traditions, citizenship, and family, an important part of human capabilities.|$|E
500|$|The Vaisheshika and Shaivism school scholar Vyomashiva {{criticized the}} Anekantavada {{doctrine}} because, according to him, it makes all moral life and spiritual pursuits for moksha meaningless.

In other words, states Vyomashiva, this doctrine leads to a paradox and <b>circularity.</b>|$|E
500|$|Good slotted {{lines are}} {{precision}} made instruments. [...] They {{need to be}} because mechanical defects can affect accuracy. [...] Some of the mechanical issues {{that are relevant to}} this include backlash of the vernier, concentricity of the inner and outer conductor, <b>circularity</b> of the outer conductor, centrality and straightness of the inner conductor, variations in cross-section, and the ability of the carriage to maintain a constant probe depth. [...] Issues with probe tuning and disturbances to the field have already been discussed, but the insulated spacers holding the centre conductor in place can also disturb the field. [...] Consequently, these are made as discrete as is compatible with mechanical strength. [...] However, the greatest source of inaccuracy is usually not the slotted line itself, but the characteristics of the detector diode.|$|E

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) is being driven by the rapid {{development}} of the micro manufacturing processes. Laser beam machining {{is one of the}} micro manufacturing processes which can shape almost all ranges of engineering materials. In this study, the effect of laser power on the quality of drilled micro holes using Cu 50 Zr 50 amorphous alloys foils is experimentally investigated. It indicates that both entrance and exit <b>circularities</b> diameters increase with laser power. The <b>circularities</b> of the holes at the entry and the exit are in the range of 0. 893 to 0. 997. The taper of drilled holes increases quickly to a stable value with the increase of laser power from 60 to 110 W, then decreases quickly when the laser power becomes larger than 170 W. The micro holes with a diameter of 400 to 1200 μm are manufactured successfully by laser drilling processes. The formation mechanism {{of the quality of the}} laser drilled hole is analyzed based on the laser beam and the properties of amorphous alloys foils...|$|R

A notation, called BOBJ, appropriate for our style of behavioral specification is also sketched. Finally, everything is conducted in a general framework that in a sense is the gcd of previous behavioral frameworks...|$|R
500|$|Philosophers and non-philosophers {{differ in}} their intuitions about what {{consciousness}} is. While most people have a strong intuition {{for the existence of}} what they refer to as consciousness, skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions. [...] Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of [...] "consciousness" [...] we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings. [...] More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve <b>circularity</b> or fuzziness.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} almost universally well {{received}} by the music press upon release, with Jon Landau in the newly launched Rolling Stone magazine noting that [...] "When the Byrds get it together on record they are consistently brilliant." [...] Landau went on to praise the Byrds' musical eclecticism, before stating: [...] "Their music is possessed by a never-ending <b>circularity</b> and a rich, child-like quality. It has a timelessness to it, {{not in the sense}} that you think their music will always be valid, but in the sense that it is capable of forcing you to suspend consciousness of time altogether." [...] Crawdaddy! magazine was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, with Sandy Pearlman describing it as [...] "enchantingly beautiful". Pete Johnson, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, summed up the album as [...] "11 good songs spiked with electronic music, strings, brass, natural and supernatural voices, and the familiar thick texture of McGuinn's guitar playing".|$|E
500|$|Waugh {{had decided}} {{in the summer of}} 1955 that he would sell Piers Court. By October 1956 the sale had been {{completed}} and he had acquired a new home in the Somerset village of Combe Florey. While the chaos of the move went on around him, Waugh worked on the novel; in November he moved to his pre-war bolthole, the Easton Court Hotel at Chagford, where he hoped to finish the book. As the date for the libel case against Nancy Spain and the Express approached, Waugh was involved in a second libel action, against the author and journalist Rebecca West and Pan Books, an additional distraction that delayed the novel's completion. In January 1957 Waugh rewrote the ending, creating a <b>circularity</b> with a return to the words that introduce the novel, and also gave the book its subtitle, [...] "A Conversation Piece". Waugh did not explain his choice of wording for the subtitle, but David Wykes in his literary biography believes it is an ironic reference to the traditional British paintings of families and friends in social gatherings; in this case the [...] "conversation" [...] is with enemies, not friends. The main title is an echo of George Meredith's Victorian novel The Ordeal of Richard Feverel. By the end of January 1957 the book was in the publishers' hands.|$|E
40|$|The {{cumulative}} hierarchy {{conception of}} set, {{which is based}} on the conception that sets are inductively generated from "former" sets, is generally considered a good way to create a set conception that seems safe from contradictions. This imposes two restrictions on sets. One is a "limitation of size," and the other is the rejection of non-well-founded sets. Quine's NF system of axioms, does not have any of the two restrictions, but it has a formal restriction on allowed formulas in its comprehension axiom schema, which reflects a similar notion of elements being prior to sets. Here we suggest that a possible reason for set antinomies is the tension between our perception of sets as entities formed from elements by an imaginary aggregation operator, and our wish to regard sets as existing "at once. " A new approach to sets as totalities is presented based on a notion of "concurrent aggregation," which instead of avoiding "viscous circles," acknowledges the inherent <b>circularities</b> of some predicates, and provides a way to characterize and investigate these <b>circularities.</b> Comment: Changes: Mainly a different exposition of the the notions of replacement and complete totalitie...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} misconceptions of the multi-variate interaction-information measure Q, {{which several}} authors have reinvented since its proposal by McGill (1954), {{giving it a}} variety of names and interpretations. McGill’s measure claimed to quantify {{the amount of information}} of interactions among three or more variables in complex systems. In (Krippendorff, 1980), I raised doubts about the validity of Q and its relatives. The chief problem that Q-measures fail to recognize is that complex interactions tend to involve <b>circularities</b> and the probability distributions characterizing such <b>circularities</b> cannot be obtained by products of probabilities, which underlie information theory as far as developed by Shannon (Shannon 2 ̆ 6 Weaver, 1949). I argued that Q-measures are mere arithmetic artifacts, and proposed an algorithmic solution to measuring the amount of information in the interactions within complex systems, now widely accepted. The paper responds to Leydesdorff’s (2009) “Interaction information: Linear and nonlinear interpretations,” published {{in the current issue of}} this journal and preceding discussions of these issues on the Cybernetics Discussion Group CYBCOM and personal correspondence involving Jakulin (2009). It prefers to rely on demonstrations with numerical data over abstract interpretations of mathematical forms that can so easily entrap scholars into believing that they measure something real without considering evidence to the contrary...|$|R
