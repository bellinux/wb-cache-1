50|$|In the 1990s, Klaus {{promoted}} renewed {{oil and gas}} {{agreements between}} the Czech Republic and Russia, and opposed Czech attempts to develop other energy sources, including {{the construction of a}} pipeline between the Czech Republic and Germany. According to former <b>Czech</b> <b>secret</b> <b>service</b> directors, he was warned by the secret service of Russian organized crime spreading into the Czech economy. In one scheme, oil was imported to the Czech Republic as heating oil and re-sold as diesel, creating huge profits for Russian businessman Semion Mogilevich, alleged to be a key figure in the Russian mafia.|$|E
50|$|Only one person, former German (Sudeten German) Helmut Gaensel, {{claims that}} he {{possesses}} the original documents about the contents and has exact knowledge of the location where this alleged treasure is hidden. He says that he received these documents, additional information and a specific area map from Emil Klein, the former SS general in command. Mr. Gaensel worked for the <b>Czech</b> and other <b>secret</b> <b>services</b> and was involved in matters connected with this treasure. In 1964, he arranged the release of Klein from the KZ Valdice prison in Czechoslovakia. During the 1970s, and as late as 1989, there were some attempts to recover the Štěchovice treasure {{under the control of}} the Ministries of Interior and Defence. The last efforts were carried out before the revolution by the foreign trade company Omnipol, which traded mainly in weapons. In 1992, Gaensel bought the relevant property and signed an exclusive agreement with the Czech authorities to obtain the sole rights to unveil the treasure.|$|R

5000|$|During the Clinton {{impeachment}} trial in 1998, while Merletti was Director of the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service,</b> Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr's prosecutors requested that numerous <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> agents testify {{in the investigation}} of President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. [...] "Merletti argued strongly against this, saying [...] "As law enforcement officers, <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> agents would proactively report any crime that they witnessed, however, <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> agents assigned to the Presidential Protective Detail should not be subpoenaed as part of a 'fishing expedition.' It is my firm belief, as Director of the United States <b>Secret</b> <b>Service,</b> that using <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> protective personnel as witnesses concerning non-criminal activities of a President will substantially undermine, if not destroy, the relationship of trust and confidence that must exist between the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> and the President in order for the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> to successfully fulfill its mission. If our Presidents do not have complete trust in the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> personnel who protect them, they may push away the Service's [...] "protective envelope," [...] thereby making them more vulnerable to assassination." ...|$|R

50|$|When the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> was established, {{its head}} {{was called the}} Chief of the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service.</b> In 1965, the title was changed to the Director of the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service,</b> four years into the term of James Joseph Rowley (1961-1973). The longest serving head of the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> was William H. Moran, who served under five presidents from 1917 to 1936.|$|R
5000|$|On May 22, Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson {{ruled that}} since the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> {{employees}} {{are part of the}} federal law enforcement establishment sworn to assist in criminal investigations, they must testify. [...] The <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> appealed her decision and the case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court where the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> lost in a split decision. Scores of <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> agents then testified before Starr's Independent Counsel. In the end, Starr and his Independent Counsel were frustrated to learn that the rumor and innuendo that they had been led to believe regarding the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service's</b> involvement with the Lewinsky issue was totally unfounded. The Independent Counsel remarked that the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> turned out to be [...] "a dry well." [...] Merletti felt vindicated and remarked, [...] "It was the fight that mattered, future Presidents would have faith in the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service's</b> motto of being 'Worthy of trust and confidence'."
