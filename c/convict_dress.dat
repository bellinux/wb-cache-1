60|$|Everything {{about my}} tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in style; our very dress makes us grotesque. We are the zanies of sorrow. We are clowns whose hearts are broken. We are {{specially}} designed {{to appeal to}} the sense of humour. On November 13th, 1895, I was brought down here from London. From two o'clock till half-past two on that day I had to stand on the centre platform of Clapham Junction in <b>convict</b> <b>dress,</b> and handcuffed, for the world to look at. I had been taken out of the hospital ward without a moment's notice being given to me. Of all possible objects I was the most grotesque. When people saw me they laughed. Each train as it came up swelled the audience. Nothing could exceed their amusement. That was, of course, before they knew who I was. As soon as they had been informed they laughed still more. For half an hour I stood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob.|$|E

She first had Qi arrested and treated her like a <b>convict</b> (<b>dressed</b> in prison garb, head shaved, and in stocks). She then summoned Liu Ruyi to the capital Chang'an in an attempt that was initially resisted by Liu Ruyi's chief of staff Zhou Chang (周昌), whom she respected because {{he was one of}} the officials who insisted on Liu Ying being the rightful heir. Instead of directly moving against Zhou Chang and Liu Ruyi, though, Lü Zhi circumvented Zhou by first summoning him to Chang'an, and then summoning Liu Ruyi. She then consummated her plot to put Qi and Liu Ruyi to death, which was documented in Volume 9 of the historical text Records of the Grand Historian as follows: ...|$|R

The situation and plan of the level, accurately determined on their expense, show the possibility of creating such a channel, {{as well as its}} great possible benefit on commerce, factories, manufactures ... and the benefit on the land quality in such a beautiful province.“ They had received the license to build the channel and formed an association with the base capital of 800,000 forints in 1792. The association was called The privileged Hungarian shipping society. The work started in spring of 1793 under the supervision of József Kiss. [...] In the meantime, the government had been troubled by serious war problems. The construction continued albeit slowly. The number of engaged workers is not known, although it is known that there weren't enough of them. There was possibly about 2000 at the start, and fewer later on. Instead of the promised 4000 soldiers, the monarchy sent two regiments from Baja with the leadership of their officers to construct barracks, and with the aid of instruments scan the transverse profiles of the foundation pits for locks and channel sections. The same job was appointed to the Slovak soldiers who arrived in Bačko Gradište. Later on, when about 500 shackled convicts were brought to the site, they were required to guard and fiercely force them to work. Since the <b>convicts</b> were poorly <b>dressed</b> and badly fed, their performance was low, so they were pulled back some time later. Confronted with the need for more workers, József Kiss was forced to place notices around the monarchy offering good payment. Difficulties came up already {{during the first year of}} works on the Monoštor lock. High water pressure of the Danube caused water to flow in the working pit and create sludge. Freshly built slopes frequently collapsed, and the biggest of problems was caused by the underground streams.|$|R

The definitive publisher-authenticated version History Workshop Journal, 2001, 52, pp. 152 - 174 is available online at: [URL] article explores the issue of clothing in India's penal settlements. From the late eighteenth to the mid twentieth centuries, the British transported {{tens of thousands of}} Indian convicts overseas to penal settlements in Southeast Asia, Mauritius and the Andaman Islands. Removed from their supposedly criminal networks and put to work, convict offenders were apparently rehabilitated whilst conveniently satisfying colonial labour demands. The organization of the penal settlements relied on a division of convicts. According to skills, behaviour and proportion of sentence served, convicts could rise through the ranks of the penal hierarchy and be transferred from hard labour to preferred work tasks or positions of authority over their fellow countrymen and women. The most immediately visible marker of convict status was dress. By the mid nineteenth century, a complex system of uniform clothing had evolved, delineating how long convicts had been in the penal settlements and how they were employed there; later, clothing was further adapted to indicate categories of crime. Initially, the evolution of <b>convict</b> <b>dress</b> was informed by developments in the Australian penal settlements. Later, and more significantly, initiatives on prison dress in India became important. However, as we shall see, the development of penal clothing in the Indian convict settlements overseas also had an agenda of its own. [Taken from introduction]Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|E
