Our study did not show any clear increase of chromosomal damage in exposed nurses as compared to controls. However, CA in control nurses were significantly increased (p = 0. 05) with respect to <b>control</b> <b>clerks.</b> The results of baseline urinary excretion of thioethers were statistically higher (p less than 0. 02) in exposed subjects than in <b>control</b> <b>clerks...</b>|$|R
