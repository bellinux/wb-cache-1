Copolymers containing N-ethyl- 4 -vinylpyridinium bromide units and relatively small numbers of either N-dodecyl- 4 -vinylpyridinium bromide or N-cetyl- 4 -vinylpyridinium bromide units were used as amphiphilic polycations.

The formation of copolymer-surfactant complexes in dilute solution was established, and the complexation behavior was shown to depend upon the copolymer to surfactant concentration ratio in the mixture.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} employed {{to determine the}} solubility mechanisms of HrO in silicate melts. In melts that have a threp-dimensional network structure (e. g., melts on the join NarO-AlrOr-SiOr), water reacts with bridging oxygens to form two OH groups per broken oxygen bond. At the same time some of the three-dimensional network is broken down to <b>chain</b> <b>units,</b> accompanied by the expulsion of Al 3 * from tetrahedral coordination. In melts that have nonbridging oxygen (NBO), water reacts with both nonbridging oxygen and net-work modifiers (e. 9., Na*) to form Si-OH bonds and M(OH) or M(OH), complexes. The an-hydrous portion of the network becomes more polymerized. The formation of <b>chain</b> <b>units</b> {{at the expense of}} three-dimensional network units in melts implies that the liquidus boundaries involving pyroxenes and silica minerals or feldspar min-erals shift to higher silica contents. Liquidus fields of silica minerals or feldspar minerals are depressed relative to those of pyroxene minerals.

Similar logic can be used to explain the formation of partial melts of andesitic bulk composition from hydrous pe-ridotite in the upper mantle. We propose that trace-element crystal-liquid partition coefficients involving highly polym-erized melts will decrease with increasing water content because of the formation of the less polymerized <b>chain</b> <b>units</b> in the melt. Partition coefficients involving less polymerized melts (e. 9., picrite and komatiite) may increase because the degree of polymerization of the melt is increased as a result of dissolved water...|$|R

Among all possible configurations of benzene around the <b>chain</b> <b>unit,</b> two configurations, {{referred to as the}} parallel and perpendicular configurations, are found to lead to the lowest energy of interaction. The potential prevailing at the parallel configuration is calculated to be more favorable by 1. 2 kcal/mol. Depending on the relative occurrence of these two competing configurations, new energy values are assigned to each rotational isomeric state of the chain structural unit. Configura-tion-dependent properties such as characteristic ratio, dipole ratio, and their temperature dependence are computed. The reduction in the dipole moment induced by the coupling of benzene with the chlorophenyl group is also included in the calculations. In general, satisfactory agreement with previous experimental measurements is achieved except for the positive temperature coefficient of dipole ratio reported at high temperature...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{approach}} for {{the configuration of}} global networks is developed, to face new challenges posed by Industrie 4. 0 and an increasing globalization. Industrie 4. 0 leads to higher autonomy and self-organization of single supply chain processes. Globalization causes an increasing fragmentation und worldwide scattering of supply <b>chain</b> <b>units.</b> Until now, decisions for configuration are often enforced by strategic directions on a network level. However, {{the arrangement of the}} network structure takes place on a more and more detailed planning level with individual goals. Global network goals and consequences on other supply <b>chain</b> <b>units</b> are neglected. To face these challenges, a new approach is developed to enable a configuration on a more detailed planning level considering global goals on a network level. Structural decisions are made on a detailed level with regard to their impacts and contribution to global network goals. This requires consistent structural decisions between nework-, site- and process-level, which are ensured by an integrative top-down-bottom-up approach. Furthermore, the cause-and-effects-relationships between global network goals and single location factors as well as influencing factors are defined to achieve an objective and comprehensible identification of the relevant factors and their contribution to global goals. Based on that, a goal-oriented adjustment of these factors can be made by selecting effective structural measures. Altogether, the subjectiveness of structural decisions can be reduced. To consider interdependencies between supply <b>chain</b> <b>units</b> and network effects, the structural decisions in this approach are made on a holistic level considering the impacts on the complete network. Therefore, all network partners and corresponding processes along the order flow, from supplier to end customer, are considered in structural decisions. The approach is based on a continuous decision making process, so that relevant changes are detected in advance and structural adjustments can be made proactively. The development of the single steps of the approach is oriented towards an implementation in a logistics assistance system, which supports the user during the complete decision process...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} is an {{extension}} of the cooperative kinematics (CK) approach (Bahar, I.; Erman, B.; Monnerie, L. Macromolecules 1992, 25, 6309), which has been demonstrated to give an efficient and realistic account of the mechanism of local relaxational processes in polyethylene (PE). In the present work, the effects of (i) departure from tetrahedral backbone geometry and (ii) differences in torsional potentials of backbone bonds are addressed by considering cis- and trans-polybutadiene (PBD) chains. The method is based on the minimization of the atomic displacements of <b>chain</b> <b>units</b> and the torsional energy changes, succeeding the isomerization of a given bond. In contrast to the highly localized response of PE to bond rotational jumps, in which the strongest coupling between rotational motions was observed between second neighboring bonds, the coupling in PBD is shown to involve longer chain segments, embodying the strongly correlated torsions of third or fourth neighboring bonds along the chain. The mechanism of motion is unique for each type of rotating bond for cis and trans structures: In trans-PBD, strong counterrotations are encountered at the second neighboring bonds separated by a double bond, whereas in cis-PBD, the same pair of bonds undergoes coupled corotations. Orientational and translational motions of <b>chain</b> <b>units</b> located between successive double bonds are significantly affected by nonbonded intramolecular interactions in cis-PBD, while this effect is not seen in the trans structure.

A wormlike chain model is applied to capture the behavior of the collagen microfibrils. On the macrolevel, the network of collagen chains is represented by a transversely isotropic eight <b>chain</b> <b>unit</b> cell introducing one characteristic material axis. Biomechanically induced remodeling is captured by allowing for a continuous reorientation of the predominant unit cell axis driven by a biomechanical stimulus. To this end, we adopt the gradual alignment of the unit cell axis with the direction of maximum principal strain. The evolution of the unit cell axis' orientation is governed by a first-order rate equation. For the temporal discretization of the remodeling rate equation, we suggest an exponential update scheme of Euler-Rodrigues type. For the spatial discretization, a finite element strategy is applied which introduces the current individual cell orientation as an internal variable on the integration point level. Selected model problems are analyzed to illustrate the basic features of the new model.

Three types of EPM <b>chain</b> <b>units</b> with different mobility were detected in the ionomers and in the ionomer precursor, which can be attributed to <b>chain</b> <b>units</b> with low mobility forming aggregates surrounded by an interfacial layer, EPM network chains interconnecting these aggregates, and network imperfections such as dangling ends and chain loops. When the the degree of neutralization is increased, the average dimension of the immobilized aggregate remains almost constant, while the thickness of the interfacial layer with restricted mobility slightly increases. The size of the aggregates in MAn-g-EPM ionomers is significantly larger compared to other ionomers, and as a consequence, the number of acid groups within an aggregate is also larger. At 50 % neutralization, the number of aggregates suddenly decreases.
