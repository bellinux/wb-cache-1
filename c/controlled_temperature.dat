25|$|The {{winemaker}} can {{soak the}} skins of white grapes and practice maceration if {{the quality of}} the grapes is good. Pre-fermentation Maceration is generally performed at a <b>controlled</b> <b>temperature</b> to delay the onset of fermentation. This technique improves the extraction of varietal aromas and their precursors which are mainly located in the skin. Acidity decreases as does the ratio of Colloids (large pectin type molecules) and aging potential. To be implemented, this process requires a perfect de-stalking, moderate crushing and sulphite to protect the wort from oxidation. The duration (typically 5 to 18 hours at 18°C) depends on the variety, the temperature of maceration, the maturity of the grape, and {{the quality of the}} soil.|$|E
25|$|Although {{a number}} of {{artificial}} garnets were successfully grown, only two became important as diamond simulants. The first was yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG; Y3Al5O12) in the late 1960s. It was (and still is) produced by the Czochralski, or crystal-pulling, process, which involves growth from the melt. An iridium crucible surrounded by an inert atmosphere is used, wherein yttrium oxide and aluminium oxide are melted and mixed together at a carefully <b>controlled</b> <b>temperature</b> near 1980nbsp&°C. A small seed crystal {{is attached to a}} rod, which is lowered over the crucible until the crystal contacts the surface of the melted mixture. The seed crystal acts as a site of nucleation; the temperature is kept steady at a point where the surface of the mixture is just below the melting point. The rod is slowly and continuously rotated and retracted, and the pulled mixture crystallizes as it exits the crucible, forming a single crystal {{in the form of a}} cylindrical boule. The crystal's purity is extremely high, and it typically measures 5nbsp&cm (2nbsp&inches) in diameter and 20nbsp&cm (8nbsp&inches) in length, and weighs 9,000 carats (1.75nbsp&kg).|$|E
25|$|Though {{perfectly}} black materials do not exist, {{in practice}} a black surface can be accurately approximated. As to its material interior, {{a body of}} condensed matter, liquid, solid, or plasma, with a definite interface with its surroundings, is completely black to radiation if it is completely opaque. That means that it absorbs all of the radiation that penetrates the interface of the body with its surroundings, and enters the body. This is not too difficult to achieve in practice. On the other hand, a perfectly black interface is not found in nature. A perfectly black interface reflects no radiation, but transmits all that falls on it, from either side. The best practical way to make an effectively black interface is to simulate an 'interface' by a small {{hole in the wall}} of a large cavity in a completely opaque rigid body of material that does not reflect perfectly at any frequency, with its walls at a <b>controlled</b> <b>temperature.</b> Beyond these requirements, the component material of the walls is unrestricted. Radiation entering the hole has almost no possibility of escaping the cavity without being absorbed by multiple impacts with its walls.|$|E

As an alternative with respect to <b>controlling</b> <b>temperature</b> through analogue methods, National Instrument DAQPad- 6015 can perform this very universal important task (in <b>controlling</b> <b>temperature).</b> This choice provides a special and hi-tech perspective because it has built-in feature that standout itself in between other controller.

500|$|Open pan {{evaporation}} {{methods have}} been streamlined since colonial days, but remain basically unchanged. Sap must first be collected and boiled down to obtain pure syrup without chemical agents or preservatives. Maple syrup is made by boiling between 20 and 50 volumes of sap (depending on its concentration) over an open fire until 1 volume of syrup is obtained, usually at a temperature [...] over the boiling point of water. As the boiling point of water varies with changes in air pressure the correct value for pure water is determined {{at the place where}} the syrup is being produced, each time evaporation is begun and periodically throughout the day. Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more <b>controlled</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During {{the curing}} period, {{concrete}} is ideally maintained at <b>controlled</b> <b>temperature</b> and humidity. To ensure full hydration during curing, concrete slabs are often sprayed with [...] "curing compounds" [...] {{that create a}} water-retaining film over the concrete. [...] Typical films are made of wax or related hydrophobic compounds. [...] After the concrete is sufficiently cured, the film is allowed to abrade from the concrete through normal use.|$|E
2500|$|Oils are {{extracted}} from nuts, seeds, olives, grains or legumes by extraction using industrial chemicals or by mechanical processes.

2500|$|Nuclear fusion {{is unlike}} nuclear fission: fusion {{requires}} extremely precise and <b>controlled</b> <b>temperature,</b> pressure and magnetic field parameters for any net energy to be produced. If a reactor suffers damage or loses {{even a small}} degree of required control, fusion reactions and heat generation would rapidly cease. Additionally, fusion reactors contain relatively small amounts of fuel, enough to [...] "burn" [...] for minutes, or in some cases, microseconds. Unless they are actively refueled, the reactions will quickly end. Therefore, fusion reactors are considered immune from catastrophic meltdown.|$|E
2500|$|Next, {{the leaves}} are {{oxidized}} under <b>controlled</b> <b>temperature</b> and humidity. (This process is also called [...] "fermentation", which is a misnomer since no actual fermentation takes place. Polyphenol oxidase is the enzyme active in the process.) The level of oxidation determines the type (or [...] "colour") of the tea; with fully oxidised becoming black tea, low oxidised becoming green tea, and partially oxidised making up the various levels of oolong tea. This can {{be done on the}} floor in batches or on a conveyor bed with air flow for proper oxidation and temperature control. Since oxidation begins at the rolling stage itself, the time between these stages is also a crucial factor in the quality of the tea; however, fast processing of the tea leaves through continuous methods can effectively make this a separate step. The oxidisation has an important effect on the taste of the end product, but the amount of oxidisation is not an indication of quality. Tea producers match oxidisation levels to the teas they produce to give the desired end characteristics.|$|E

The World Cup is always held in the European off-season in June and July and during this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar is in excess of 40°C (104°F), with the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30°C (86°F). Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, responded saying [...] "the event has to be organised in June or July. We {{will have to take}} the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with <b>controlled</b> <b>temperature</b> is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well." [...] The first five proposed stadiums are planned to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the upper tiers of the stadiums will be dis-assembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.|$|E
