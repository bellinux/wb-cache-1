40|$|The {{env gene}} {{fragment}} of an Italian strain of <b>Caprine</b> <b>Arthritis</b> <b>Encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV) coding for the hydrophilic region of transmembrane protein was amplified, cloned and expressed in prokaryotic system as fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase. Sequence analysis revealed 63 to 66 % amino acid homology, {{when compared with}} three ovine lentiviruses and 83 % when compared with one caprine lentivirus. The recombinant transmembrane protein was efficiently expressed, purified under denaturing conditions and used as antigen in western blotting and ELISA. Sera from clinically diseased goats strongly reacted in western blotting and naturally infected animals seroconverted between 20 and 33 weeks of age. An indirect ELISA performed with this antigen showed improved sensitivity in comparison with agar gel immunodiffusion test.

40|$|The {{etiologic}} {{agent of the}} acquired immune deficiency syndrome, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III), has recently been shown to morphologically resemble and share sequence homology with visna virus, a pathogenic lentivirus. Molecular hybridization, heteroduplex mapping, and DNA sequence analyses were used to compare HTLV-III to other lentiviruses of domestic animals, including visna, <b>caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> and equine infectious anemia viruses.

In addition, a closer relationship was found between visna and <b>caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> viruses than for any of the other lentiviruses studied. These results, along with nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, have been used in a comprehensive effort to derive a systematic relationship for lentiviruses and to provide further evidence for classifying HTLV-III with the Lentivirinae subfamily of retroviruses.

The above findings raise the possibility that HTLV-III-infected monocyte/macrophages may serve as a vehicle for the dissemination of virus to target organs and as a reservoir for viral persistence, as has been shown for other lentiviruses including visna virus and <b>caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus...|$|R
40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) is a T-lymphotropic retrovirus associated with immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections in cats. The discovery of FIV {{provides an opportunity}} {{for the development of a}} small animal model for AIDS. To initiate the molecular and biological characterization of FIV, cDNA clones were synthesized and used to isolate a proviral clone of FIV. Molecular cross-hybridization analysis of FIV with five lentiviruses revealed that nucleotide-sequence similarities exist between FIV and these lentiviruses in the gag-pol genes. However, nucleotide-sequence similarities were not seen upon comparison of the FIV long terminal repeat sequence with known viral sequences. Common antigenic determinants appeared to be shared by FIV, <b>caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, and visna virus as shown by serological cross-reactivity of rabbit antibodies to <b>caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus and visna virus with the putative FIV core protein p 28. These studies demonstrated that FIV is a member of the lentivirus subfamily and is distantly related to the AIDS lentiviruses of primates. Importantly, progeny virions of our molecular clone were infectious for experimentally inoculated cats. The availability of an infectious molecular clone will make possible a detailed dissection of the molecular pathogenesis of FIV, which may facilitate the development of vaccine and therapeutic strategies for AIDS...|$|R

The <b>caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV), a lentivirus; infects its hosts for life. Although most infections are subclinical, {{a minority of}} animals develops progressive, untreatable disease syndromes including polyarthritis in adults and encephalomyelitis in kids. This virus also causes indurative mastitis, resulting in decreased milk production. CAEV infections decrease lifetime productivity in dairy goats, particularly when the prevalence of infection is high within a herd. In addition, CAEV is a barrier to the exportation of goats from countries where it is endemic, including the United States. CAEV {{is closely related to}} the maedi-visna virus (MVV), which is found most often in sheep. Although documented cases of natural cross-species transmission are currently rare, CAEV can infect sheep and MVV can infect goats.

Abstract - In {{order to determine}} the serological prevalence of CAE in the Microregion of Juazeiro, Bahia, 693 serum samples of goat were collected from 46 farms from different locations in eight counties that make up this region (Campo Alegre de Lourdes, Casa Nova, Curaçá, Juazeiro, Pilão Arcado, Remanso, Sento Sé and Sobradinho). The samples were tested by agar gel immunodifusion (AGID) and the seroprevalence obtained was 0. 87 % (6 / 693). The low prevalence obtained was due to production features. The predominant system is the extensive one, with a presence of native, crossbred and mongrel animals, aiming at the production of meat and skin, with low productivity and technification. 2011 IX Congresso Brasileiro Buiatria, outubro de 2011, Goiânia, Goiás, Brasil...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe cytokines TNFα and IFNγ have {{previously}} {{been shown to}} activate <b>caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV) transcription. Increased viral titers correlate with increased lesion severity. Therefore, TNFα and IFNγ may augment the <b>caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> lesion by increasing viral titers.

A set of U 3 deletion mutants was generated and used to establish stably integrated, U 937 -based cell lines. These cell lines were utilized to define the required promoter sequences for cytokine-induced transcriptional activation. Here we have identified a novel 17 nucleotide TNF-activated site within the U 3 region 70  bp repeat which is both required and sufficient in a minimal construct for TNFα-induced CAEV transcriptional activation. In contrast to the results of previous studies with IFNγ, we found that multiple sequences within the U 3 region 70  bp repeat were required for IFNγ-activation of the CAEV promoter.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV) Vif {{protein is}} {{necessary}} for a productive infection of susceptible goat cells. The vif gene is conserved among all primate and most nonprimate lentiviruses. However, previous reports demonstrated that, in their respective host cells, primate Vif deleted lentiviruses could not be complemented by nonprimate Vif proteins, suggesting that species-specific restrictions between Vif and the virus-producing cells may modulate the Vif function on viral infectivity. Here we bring further support to this hypothesis since we show that CAEV Vif, when expressed in goat cells, is able to increase the infectivity of Vif deleted human immunodeficiency type- 1 virus and of murine leukemia virus. Moreover, we demonstrate in vitro interactions between different Vif proteins and NC domains of heterologous Gag precursors, supporting the notion that species specificity of lentiviral infection is not due to molecular interactions between Vif and viral components...|$|R
40|$|<b>Caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV) {{has been}} {{reported}} in different countries worldwide, based on serological and molecular detection. In Argentina, the prevalence of CAEV infections is increasing, with goats showing symptoms associated mostly with cachexia and arthritis. Although in Argentina the virus has been detected by serology, it has never been isolated or characterized. Thus, the objectives of this work were to isolate and analyze the nucleotide sequences of the gag gene of Argentine CAEV strains and compare them with those of other SRLVs previously reported. Nucleotide sequence comparison showed homology with CAEV-Co, the CAEV prototype. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Argentine strains clustered with genotype B, subtype B 1. Because the molecular characterization of the gag region is suitable for phylogenetic studies and may be applied to monitor the control of SRLV, molecularly characterizing the Argentine CAEV strains may help develop a proper plan of eradication of CAEV infections...|$|R

The lymph nodes proved to be an important virus reservoir, with moderate virus replication relative to what is reported for lentiviruses of primates. Mammary gland and milk cells were preferred sites of viral replication. The viral load varied significantly between animals, which points to an important role of the genetic background.
