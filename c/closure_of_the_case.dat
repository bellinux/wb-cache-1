50|$|During the anti-corruption movement, Bedi faced {{controversy}} {{when some}} newspapers questioned discrepancies in her past travel expenses between 2006 and 2011. In 2009, for example, Bedi was invited as {{the keynote speaker}} at a conference arranged by Aviation Industry Employees Guild.

Bedi's travel agent Flywell, invoiced her hosts business class fare for air tickets, but arranged Bedi to travel in economy class. Between 2006 and 2011, there were several discrepancies in travel-related expense statements, as well as instances where she travelled {{at no cost to}} her hosts for a cause. In these cases, Bedi stated she did not personally receive or incur the disputed difference, only India Vision Foundation did, an NGO she headed. In November 2011, the Delhi Police, under directions of the additional chief metropolitan magistrate, registered an FIR - police case for cognizable offense - against Bedi for allegedly misappropriating funds through Indian Vision Foundation and other NGOs.

40|$|This mixed- method {{research}} analyses how {{media in}} the case study of the disappeared Amarildo de Souza is {{an indicator of the}} perceived police legitimacy in Brazil. The methodology utilised for analyses was copied from the research of Sela-Shayovitz and provided the following four indicators for police legitimacy: trust in police, police performance, interpersonal treatment and procedural-justice process (2015). By categorizing quotes, sentences and comments within the positive or negative side of these indicators, the affect media has on framing police legitimacy could be established towards the three selected timeframes. The analysed secondary sources include academic articles, as well as online newspapers, documentaries, and social media pages relating to the campaign Where is Amarildo? and the favela Rocinha. The research displayed that the first hypothesis, which assumed that the disappearance of Amarildo displays a predominantly negative coverage and leads to diminished police legitimacy, is partly true. Subsequently, the second hypothesis was that the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in February 2016 could display a mainly positive indication of police legitimacy due to the established sense of justice. It can be concluded that this assumption is false in relation to the mainstream media and partly true in relation to the grass root voices. Furthermore, the research displayed that the hypotheses that the indicators interpersonal treatment and procedural-justice process are the main indicators of police legitimacy was false.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis by Jonathan Stern and Katja Yafimava of Gazpromâs March 2017 competition commitments {{in respect of}} gas sales to Central and Eastern Europe, concludes that the concerns expressed by DG COMP in respect of territorial restrictions, pricing, and infrastructure issues have been addressed, both in form and in substance. Acceptance of these commitments would provide insurance against future abuse by Gazprom of its dominant position in these countries. Most importantly, Gazprom has henceforth agreed to charge average weighted import border prices and/or prices at relevant generally accepted liquid hubs in Continental Europe instead of alternative fuel (oil-linked) prices. This means that if the commitments are accepted, buyers in these countries {{will be able to}} buy Russian gas at hub prices before interconnections have been established with these hubs (potentially up to three years hence). The acceptance by Gazprom of competitive, defined as liquid hub, prices has much wider significance, as it signals the end of alternative fuel pricing for gas in EU countries. DG COMPs market test of the commitments elicited a generally positive response with the exception of Polandâs PGNiG which expressed deep dissatisfaction on virtually all issues, in particular the lack of any fine or obligation for Gazprom to pay compensation for its past behaviour. The study suggests that the most likely outcome is the acceptance by DG COMP of the commitments (with minor amendments) and <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with a settlement. Should some member states, specifically Poland, attempt to derail the settlement, causing the case to be referred to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), the commitments are still likely to be implemented but legal proceedings could drag on for several more years...|$|E

40|$|This is an expository {{paper about}} self-adjoint {{extensions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Laplacian on R^d, initially defined on functions supported {{away from a}} point. Let L be the Laplacian with domain smooth functions with compact support away from the origin.

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis was to {{research}} <b>the</b> regulatory framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek tax audit procedure and its application by the tax authorities under a constitutional aspect, {{in order to}} propose a constitutional “model” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax audit. For this purpose, the constitutional and institutional framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax procedure {{as well as the}} tax audit procedure was examined. Then, the constitutional rules and principles that should apply for <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regulatory framework and during <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax audit were examined. The thesis shows that the current tax audit procedure introduces several constitutional issues. More specifically, <b>the</b> regulatory framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax audit does not agree with <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> good legislation. Furthermore, the tax administration knows almost no strategic planning nor is it stuffed with capable civil servants, which are constantly educated and valuated. In addition, the ambiguous regulatory framework of preventive, temporary and supplementary tax audit may cause contradictions and phenomena <b>of</b> arbitrariness against <b>the</b> tax payers. The same applies for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methods for <b>the</b> simplification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax audit procedure, such as <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> computed values and <b>the</b> automated <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax <b>cases.</b> Questions are also raised in connection with <b>the</b> constitutionality <b>of</b> measures, such as <b>the</b> prolonging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute <b>of</b> limitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State to issue tax assessments acts. Moreover, <b>the</b> classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax sanctions as administrative sanctions, though some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> have <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> penal sanctions, has as a result that the taxpayers are not entitled to fundamental defend rights. Furthermore, <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> tax secrecy is violated by <b>the</b> numerous exemptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> said secrecy. Anti-constitutional limitations are also introduced as far as <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> hearing and <b>the</b> access right are concerned. Finally, the one-dimensional superiority recognised in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public revenue interest indirectly causes many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitutional problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax audit procedure. ...|$|R
