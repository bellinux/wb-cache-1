This increase in expenditure has been driven by technical developments in equipment design, matched by the introduction of novel clinical practices, examinations and procedures. The radiation protection implications of these developments have to be assessed. The SENTINEL co-ordination action covered radiation protection, safety and related issues that arise from these technical and clinical developments. SENTINEL covered 90 % of patient examinations in European Radiology, 60 % of the collective dose from medical sources and approximately 50 % of the collective dose to European citizens from man-made sources. The SENTINEL <b>co-ordination</b> <b>actions</b> 'main' objective was to address the safety and efficacy issues which are common to all digital diagnostic imaging systems, including nuclear medicine.

40|$|Between 2004 and 2007, 19 European {{organizations}} representing 12 Member States {{worked together}} in a coordination action called SHAPE-RISK (sharing experience on risk management (health, safety and environment) to design future industrial systems). <b>Co-ordination</b> <b>Actions</b> are multi-partner actions intended to promote and support the networking and co-ordination of research. They cover the definition, organisation and management of joint or common initiatives, as well as activities such as the organisation of conferences, meetings, the carrying out of studies, exchanges of personnel, the exchange and dissemination of good practice, and setting up common information systems and expert groups. The project was coordinated by INERIS (Institut National de l'Environnement Industriel et des Risques). The overall objective of the SHAPE-RISK project was to optimize the efficiency of integrated risk management {{in the context of}} the sustainable development of the European process industry. In this initiative, risk management was related to the environment (referring to the IPPC Directive), major accident hazards (referring to the SEVESO II Directive), and occupational health and safety (referring to the Directive on the safety and health of workers at work, and in particular the ATEX Directives). The main results of the project were recommendations organised in four categories : - Regulatory issues : creation of a meta-directive define the principles to implement an integrated risk management; - Technical issues : creation of a European "one-stop shop" to support integrated risk management; - Human and organisational issues: improve safety management by working on human performance; - Risk Communication and governance: take into account the risk perception in the risk decision making process. Based on these results and other work performed at international level such as the projects of IRGC, the iNTeg-Risk project was developed. The papers will present the main results of SHAPE-RISK and their use in the design of the iNTeg-Risk project...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 25 July 2014 Examining Board: Professor Hans-Wolfgang Micklitz, European University Institute; Professor Giorgio Monti, European University Institute; Professor Christopher Hodges, University of Oxford; Professor Norbert Reich, University of Bremen. In 1998 the European Union {{adopted a}} new self-standing {{instrument}} of collective enforcement - the Action for Injunction. Until then, {{the main focus}} was on {{the improvement of the}} position of the individual consumer through the adoption of substantive consumer law directives. The Injunction Directive provides for a general framework on consumer law enforcement in national and cross-border litigation. Qualified entities, public agencies and/or consumer organisations, are granted legal standing. National courts are bound to mutually respect the standing of EU wide registered qualified entities. Outside these clear-cut rules on the mutual recognition of standing, the Injunction Directive remains largely silent. The implementation into 28 Member States swiftly revealed the rather limited harmonising effect. The thesis investigates and explains how despite the legally approved diversity, the Injunction Directive contains the potential to turn diversity into convergence. The key to understanding the potential is the thesis of dualism of enforcement measures. Read together with the Annex the Injunction Directive establishes the deep interconnection between collective and individual enforcement, of substantive and procedural enforcement, of judicial and administrative enforcement. The different levels and means of enforcement should not be regarded separately but should always be looked at in their interplay, in their mutual institutional design and their mutual impact. Evidence for convergence {{can be found in the}} Invitel judgment of the ECJ and in the practice of consumer organisations via <b>co-ordination</b> <b>actions</b> across borders by which they overcome the boundaries of collective vs. individual or judicial vs. administrative enforcement. Regulation 2006 / 2004 re-adjusts the dualistic structure of enforcement in favour of public bodies and promotes convergence through para-legal means, through new modes of enforcement, through co-operation and co-ordination outside courts and in open interaction between administrative bodies, to which consumer organisations are admitted on approval only...|$|E
