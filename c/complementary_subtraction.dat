40|$|Problem statement: A hybrid {{technique}} combining subcarrier multiplexed and Spectral Amplitude Coding-Optical Code Division Multiple Access (SAC-OCDMA) deploying the Khazani-Syed {{code was}} proposed. It was proposed as {{a mean of}} increasing {{the maximum number of}} simultaneous active users by increasing the subcarrier and/or the SAC-OCDMA code word. Multiple Access Interference (MAI) is the most dominant cause of performance degradation in SACOCDMA systems. Approach: A decoding technique which was simple and easy to build named Spectral Direct Decoding (SDD) technique was proposed for the hybrid system of subcarrier SACOCDMA. Results: The comparison between the <b>complementary</b> <b>subtraction</b> and proposed SDD techniques for hybrid subcarrier SAC-OCDMA system in terms of cost performance was presented here. Results showed that the cost performance of the SDD technique offers a significant improvement over the <b>complementary</b> <b>subtraction</b> detection technique.

40|$|The insect {{brain is}} the center of {{developmental}} control, from which ecdysone governs brain morphogenesis and regulates gene expression cascades associated with molting and metamorphosis. In order to identify the 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E) -inducible genes responsible for molting and metamorphosis, we constructed a 20 E-induced <b>subtraction</b> <b>complementary</b> DNA library from the fifth instar larval brain of the silkworm Bombyx mori. We isolated 10 genes, designated as bombeil- 1 to bombeil- 10, three of which did not show any sequence similarity to previously identified Bombyx genes. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that all of these bombeil messenger RNAs were exclusively located in two pairs of lateral neurosecretory cells in the larval brain, known as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) -producing cells. RNA-interference knockdown targeting bombeil- 2 resulted in larval-pupal molt defects, and adult wing and leg malformations. These results, together with the cell-specific co-localization of bombeil transcripts with PTTH, suggest that bombeil genes play important roles during larval-pupal-adult development. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a class of}} normal play partizan games, called <b>Complementary</b> <b>Subtraction.</b> Let $A$ denote your favorite set of positive integers. This is Left's subtraction set, whereas Right subtracts numbers not in $A$. The Golden Nugget Subtraction Game has the $A$ and $B$ sequences, from Wythoff's game, as the two <b>complementary</b> <b>subtraction</b> sets. As {{a function of the}} heap size, the maximum size of the canonical forms grows quickly. However, the value of the heap is either a number or, in reduced canonical form, a switch. We find the switches by using properties of the Fibonacci word and standard Fibonacci representations of integers. Moreover, these switches are invariant under shifts by certain Fibonacci numbers. The values that are numbers, however, are distinct, and we find a polynomial time bit characterization for them, via the ternary Fibonacci representation. Comment: 28 page...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} genes upregulated in the heart in human patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUNDHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disease caused by mutations in contractile sarcomeric proteins. The molecular basis of diverse clinical and pathologic phenotypes in HCM remains unknown. METHODSWe performed polymerase chain reaction-select <b>complementary</b> DNA <b>subtraction</b> between normal hearts and hearts with HCM and screened subtracted libraries by Southern blotting. We sequenced the differentially expressed clones and performed Northern blotting to detect increased expression levels. RESULTSWe screened 288 independent clones, and 76 clones had less than twofold increase in the signal intensity and were considered upregulated. Sequence analysis identified 36 genes including those encoding the markers of pressure overload-induced (“secondary”) cardiac hypertrophy, cytoskeletal proteins, protein synthesis, redox system, ion channels and those with unknown function. Northern blotting confirmed increased expression of skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA 1), myosin light chain 2 a (MLC 2 a), GTP-binding protein Gs-alpha subunit (GNAS 1), NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDUFB 10), voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC 1), four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 1 (FHL 1) (also known as SLIM 1), sarcosin (SARCOSIN) and heat shock 70 kD protein 8 (HSPA 8) by less than twofold. Expression levels of ACTA 1, MLC 2 aand GNAS 1 were increased in six additional and FHL 1 in four additional hearts with HCM. CONCLUSIONSA diverse array of genes is upregulated in the heart in human patients with HCM, which could account for the diversity of clinical and pathologic phenotypes. Markers of secondary hypertrophy are also upregulated, suggesting commonality of pathways involved in HCM and the acquired forms of cardiac hypertrophy. Elucidation of the role of differentially expressed genes in HCM could provide for new therapeutic targets...|$|R
50|$|The {{debate over}} the primacy of Schickard or Pascal's calculating inventions is dealt with more {{comprehensively}} in Schickard versus Pascal: An Empty Debate? Here it is sufficient {{to note that the}} two machines were essentially different in that Pascal's machine was designed primarily for addition and (with the use of <b>complementary</b> numbers) for <b>subtraction.</b> The adding machine in Schickard's design may have jammed in the unusual case of a carry being required across too many dials, but it could smoothly subtract by reversing the motion of the input dials, {{in a way that was}} not possible in the Pascaline. (Experiments with replicas show that in the event of a jam when a carry is attempted across more than (say) three dials, it is obvious to the operator who may intervene to assist the machine to perform the additional carries. This is not as efficient as with the Pascaline, but it is not a fatal deficiency.) The Schickard adding machine also has provision for an audible warning when an output was too large for the available dials. This was not provided for in the Pascaline.|$|R
40|$|Follicular papilla (FP) cells, but {{not their}} closely related dermal fibroblasts, can {{maintain}} hair growth suggesting cell type-specific molecular signals. To define the molecular {{differences between these}} two cell types, we generated a <b>subtraction</b> <b>complementary</b> DNA (cDNA) library highly enriched in FP-specific cDNA. Differential screening identified FP- 1 as the most abundant cDNA sequence in this subtraction library. FP- 1 message RNA is highly abundant in cultured rat vibrissa FP cells, can be detected at very low levels in the stomach and the ovary, and is undetectable in cultured dermal fibroblasts and in 16 rat non-follicular tissues. The full-length, 2. 3 kb FP- 1 cDNA encodes a protein of 549 amino acids harboring a signal peptide, collagen triple helix repeats, and an olfactomedin-like domain. Monospecific rabbit antibodies to FP- 1 recognize in cultured FP cells a single ∼ 72 kDa glycoprotein with a ∼ 60 kDa protein core. FP- 1 protein is expressed in vivo in a hair cycle-dependent manner, {{as it can be}} detected in FP during anagen, but not in catagen and telogen phases of the hair cycle. FP- 1 is presumably a highly specific extracellular matrix protein synthesized by FP cells and may be involved in the organization of FP during certain phases of normal or pathological hair growth...|$|R
40|$|Future Internet {{consists}} of {{a wide spectrum of}} applications with different bit rates and quality of service (QoS) requirements. Prioritizing the services is essential to ensure that the delivery of information is at its best. Existing technologies have demonstrated how service differentiation techniques can be implemented in optical networks using data link and network layer operations. However, a physical layer approach can further improve system performance at a prescribed received signal quality by applying control at the bit level. This paper proposes a coding algorithm to support optical domain service differentiation using spectral amplitude coding techniques within an optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) scenario. A particular user or service has a varying weight applied to obtain the desired signal quality. The properties of the new code are compared with other OCDMA codes proposed for service differentiation. In addition, a mathematical model is developed for performance evaluation of the proposed code using two different detection techniques, namely direct decoding and <b>complementary</b> <b>subtraction...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{detection}} technique named AND subtraction {{which is based}} on subtraction technique is proposed for a hybrid system of subcarrier multiplexed (SCM) spectral-amplitude-coding optical code division multiple access (SAC-OCDMA) of a point-to-point link. Spectral-amplitude-coding OCDMA is used because of its ability to cancel the multiple access interference (MAI) when code sequences with fixed in-phase cross correlation are used. On the other hand, the SCM scheme is able to enhance the channel data rate of OCDMA systems. This hybrid system is proposed for the purpose of combining the advantages of both techniques. As a result, the hybrid system is robust against interference and is much more spectrally efficient. A new code structure for spectral-amplitude-coding OCDMA system based on double weight (DW) code family is employed. The experimental simulation results of the hybrid system using the new proposed AND subtraction {{detection technique}} are compared to the hybrid system using <b>complementary</b> <b>subtraction</b> detection technique. The results show that the hybrid system using the proposed new AND subtraction detection technique improve the system performance significantly...|$|E
40|$|Optical code {{division}} multiple access system (OCDMA) has been gaining importance with increasing demands of high speed and large capacity for communication in optical networks. OCDMA system is totally asynchronous, that does not require any clock signals for synchronization in the network. Therefore, OCDMA provide a network that is simpler and offers the potential for scalability to higher levels of connectivity. OCDMA encoding /decoding process also provides a level of security directly implemented in the physical layer. Using OCDMA technique high spectral efficiency is achieved, hence fiber bandwidth is used very efficiently with throughput in excess of Tbit/s. Among several kinds of OCDMA systems, spectra amplitude coding (SAC) scheme attracts increasing interest because multiple access interference (MAI) can be eliminated and preserve the orthogonality between users in the system. This paper presents comparison of three important SAC-OCDMA detection techniques, namely- Direct detection, <b>Complementary</b> <b>subtraction</b> and AND subtraction. The design of encoder and decoder modules for SAC-OCDMA system used in this paper is based on Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs). Here conventional single mode fiber (SMF) is used as the transmission link and the performance metric studied is Quality factor (Q) in multiple access environments of various user systems for these three detection techniques. Finally Effect of increasing number of fiber distance on the direct detection technique using NRZ and RZ data formats have been studied. Simulated results show that AND subtraction technique gives better Quality-factor (Q) than the complementary subtractio...|$|E

ADAM 8 was one of the 50 genes identified. ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) peptides are membrane-bound proteins that can act as cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion molecules, degrade the extracellular matrix, and play a role in tissue morphogenesis, Addition of antisense (AS) S-oligonucleotides for ADAM 8 (1 - 10 nM) to mouse bone marrow cultures treated with 10 (- 9) Ri 1, 25 -dihgdroxyvitamin D- 3 [1, 25 (OH) (2) D- 3] significantly inhibited OCL formation compared with treatment with the control S-oligonucleotide, Furthermore, conditioned media from 293 cells transiently transfected with a secretable form of the ADAM 8 cDNA increased OCL formation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, treatment of OCLs with soluble ADAM 8 conditioned media significantly increased pit formation per dentin slice compared with control OCLs. Time course studies indicated that ADAM 8 increased OCL formation only when it was present during days 4 - 7 of the 7 -day culture period. Structural analysis, using truncated constructs of ADAM 8, showed that the cysteine-rich/disintegrin domain was responsible for its OCL stimulatory activity, Western blot analysis confirmed that the soluble form of ADAM 8 is present in normal marrow cultures, These data suggest that ADAM 8 {{plays an important role in}} OCL formation and acts primarily at the later stages of OCL differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Enchytraeus japonensis is {{a highly}} {{regenerative}} oligochaete annelid that can regenerate a complete individual from a small body fragment in 4 – 5  days. In our previous study, we performed <b>complementary</b> deoxyribonucleic acid <b>subtraction</b> cloning to isolate genes that are upregulated during E. japonensis regeneration and identified glutamine synthetase (gs) {{as one of the}} most abundantly expressed genes during this process. In the present study, we show that the full-length sequence of E. japonensis glutamine synthetase (EjGS), which is the first reported annelid glutamine synthetase, is highly similar to other known class II glutamine synthetases. EjGS shows a 61 – 71 % overall amino acid sequence identity with its counterparts in various other animal species, including Drosophila and mouse. We performed detailed expression analysis by in situ hybridization and reveal that strong gs expression occurs in the blastemal regions of regenerating E. japonensis soon after amputation. gs expression was detectable at the cell layer covering the wound and was found to persist in the epidermal cells during the formation and elongation of the blastema. Furthermore, in the elongated blastema, gs expression was detectable also in the presumptive regions of the brain, ventral nerve cord, and stomodeum. In the fully formed intact head, gs expression was also evident in the prostomium, brain, the anterior end of the ventral nerve cord, the epithelium of buccal and pharyngeal cavities, the pharyngeal pad, and in the esophageal appendages. In intact E. japonensis tails, gs expression was found in the growth zone in actively growing worms but not in full-grown individuals. In the nonblastemal regions of regenerating fragments and in intact worms, gs expression was also detected in the nephridia, chloragocytes, gut epithelium, epidermis, spermatids, and oocytes. These results suggest that EjGS may play roles in regeneration, nerve function, cell proliferation, nitrogenous waste excretion, macromolecule synthesis, and gametogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{new code}} {{structure}} with ideal in-phase cross-correlation for the Spectral-Amplitude-Coding Optical Code-Division Multiple-Access (SAC-CDMA) system called Vectors Combinatorial (VC) code is proposed. VC code is constructed using Euclidian vectors {{and a simple}} algebraic way for any positive integer number based {{on the relationship between}} the number of users N and the weight W. We have also studied the performance of OCDMA systems using a newly proposed Direct Recovery Scheme (DRS) under various link parameters. The impact of the detection techniques and data rate effects on the Multi-User Interference (MUI) is reported using a commercial optical systems simulator, Virtual Instrument Photonic (VPI TM). The VC code is compared mathematically with other codes which use similar techniques. We analyzed and optimized the data rate, fiber length, and channel spacing {{in order to reduce the}} BER effect. A comparison between Complementary and DRS techniques for theoretical and simulation results taken from VPI TM is demonstrated. It is verified that, for a high data rate (higher than 2. 5 Gb/s), even if dispersion compensated devices are not deployed, the BER can be significantly improved when the VC code with desired parameters are selected using DRS technique. Also it is found that as the channel spacing width goes from very narrow to wide, the BER decreases and best performance occurs at a spacing bandwidth between 0. 8 and 1 nm. In addition, we have shown that the proposed new DRS technique utilizing VC code significantly improves the performance compared with the conventional SAC <b>Complementary</b> <b>subtraction</b> technique...|$|E
