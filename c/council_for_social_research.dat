40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} preoperative verbal cognitive ca-pacity in 11 deafened adults who were cochlear implant can-didates and reexamined level of speech understanding after 6 — 8 months ' {{experience with the}} implant. Verbal cognitive performance in the implant group was compared {{in a group of}} normal hearing subjects and in a nonimplanted group of deafened adults. The three groups performed on par with each other with one exception: The individuals in the co-chlear implant group and the nonimplanted group of deaf-ened adults performed significantly worse than those of nor-mal hearing in tasks in which use of internal speech is a key feature (i. e., rhyme judgement and lexical decision tasks). Postoperative observations of the implanted individuals ' level of speech understanding suggest {{that it is possible to}} predict the level of speech understanding by means of a preoperative cognitive assessment. The characteristics of three verbal cog-nitive abilities proved to be critical indicators of 6 — 8 months' postoperative outcome: internal speech functioning, speed of verbal information processing, and working memory capac-ity—the first factor proved the most decisive. We discuss the results with respect to direct versus indirect predictors of outcomes from cochlear implant operations and the effect of auditory deprivation on deafened adults ' capability to process auditory information. A cochlear implantation gives deafened individuals an opportunity to experience some sense of hearing.

40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years a number of {{theories}} have purported to give gerontological researchers a special insight into the aging experi-ence by emphasizing several key issues around which to conduct research and interpret the status of the elderly. Each of these theories has focused on one or two key elements thought to profoundly affect the aging experience. The purpose of this essay is to analyze these theo-retical developments for their specific contributions and identify the theoretical prerequisites of an adequate theory of aging. In so doing, I advance three contentions. First, a special theory of aging is unneces-sary and, perhaps, undesirable; ' Second, no single theory of aging yet proposed provides an adequate account of the aging process, although existing theoretical developments have identified important elements that need to be integrated into a unified theoretical orientation. Finally, I maintain that a synthesis and elaboration of elements drawn from existing theories does provide an adequate framework for the direction and interpretation of research. Prior to my purposefully selective re-view of the theoretical literature in which I analyze {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the competing theories, I will describe and assess the importance of the four elements that emerge from previous theoretical formulations as necessary components of an adequate theoretical approach to the aging process. *This is a revision of the paper that was awarded Second Prize in the Midwest Sociological Society Caroline Rose Paper Competition, 1983.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} the brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) val 66 met polymorphism on change in olfactory function in a large scale, longitudinal population-based sample (n = 836). The subjects were tested on a 13 item force-choice odor identification test on two test occasions over a 5 -year-interval. Sex, education, health-related factors, and semantic ability were controlled for in the statistical analyses. Results showed an interaction effect of age and BDNF val 66 met on olfactory change, such that the magnitude of olfactory decline in the older age cohort (70 – 90 years old at baseline) was larger for the val homozygote carriers than for the met carriers. The older met carriers did not display larger age-related decline in olfactory function compared to the younger group. The BDNF val 66 met polymorphism did not affect the rate of decline in the younger age cohort (45 – 65 years). The findings are discussed {{in the light of the}} proposed roles of BDNF in neural development and maintenance.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether a}} physiological marker of cardiovascular health, pulse pressure (PP), and age magnified {{the effect of}} the functional COMT Val 158 Met (rs 4680) polymorphism on 15 -years cognitive trajectories [episodic memory (EM), visuospatial ability, and semantic memory] using data from 1585 non-demented adults from the Betula study. A multiple-group latent growth curve model was specified to gauge individual differences in change, and average trends therein. The allelic variants showed negligible differences across the cognitive markers in average trends. The older portion of the sample selectively age-magnified the effects of Val 158 Met on EM changes, resulting in greater decline in Val compared to homozygote Met carriers. This effect was attenuated by statistical control for PP. Further, PP moderated the effects of COMT on 15 -years EM trajectories, resulting in greater decline in Val carriers, even after accounting for the confounding effects of sex, education, cardiovascular diseases (diabetes, stroke, and hypertension), and chronological age, controlled for practice gains. The effect was still present after excluding individuals with a history of cardiovascular diseases. The effects of cognitive change were not moderated by any other covariates. This report underscores the importance of addressing synergistic effects in normal cognitive aging, as the addition thereof may place healthy individuals at greater risk for memory decline.

40|$|These {{two volumes}} contain a {{selection}} of the contributions presented during the international conference "Work after 45 ?" on September 22 - 25, 1996 in Stockholm, Sweden. The conference was jointly organized by The National Institute for Working Life and the Department of Sociology, University of Göteborg. The conference dealt with broad issues related to ageing and work, including relationships among ageing, work demands and health. The themes selected and highlighted at the conference concerned issues of ageing at work and, in particular, the impact of social, economic and organizational factors on health and psychological and social functioning. These issues are now {{more important than ever}} due to the ongoing changes in labour markets throughout the world, that carry with them implications for the labour market prospects of the ageing work force. An inter-disciplinary scope was sought in composition of programme sessions, workshops and mini-symposia involving participant researchers active in biomedical, behavioural and social sciences. The selection of presentations for publication was based on a review of all papers, carried out by the international scientific committee commissioned by the organizers. The conference was organized as a blend of plenary sessions, workshops, minisymposia and free paper sessions following a pragmatically composed structure of themes and disciplines. At the outset of editing these proceedings we wanted to follow this structure and the course of the conference programme as it actually materialized. This idea was soon abandoned, however, since it was judged not to provide the reader with a satisfactory framework. In many sessions the papers, as they were actually presented, emphasized aspects which were also dealt with in other sessions, emphasizing the multidiciplinary nature of many contributions. We therefore decided on a simple logic of editing the proceedings with contributions ordered alphabetically by name of first author. We were fortunate to have three key-note lecturers of great distinction participating in the conference, professors Peter F Hjort (Norway), Alan Walker (UK) and Timothy Salthouse (USA). Their three addresses have been included unabridged in the proceedings books, with only a minimum of technical editing. Our thanks are due to all those who participated in the "Work after 45 ?" conference, all who submitted papers to be included in these proceedings, the international scientific committee members reviewing all papers, Gunnar Aronsson (Sweden), Willem J A Goedhard (Netherlands), Juhani Ilmarinen (Finland), Jon Eivind Kolberg (Norway), Jette Nielsen, (Denmark), Clas Håkan Nygård (Finland), Carl N¿rregaard (Denmark), Gunnar Olofsson (Sweden), Per Erik Solem (Norway) and Eskil Wadensjö (Sweden). We also wish to thank the Swedish Council for Work Life Research, the Swedish <b>Council</b> <b>for</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Research,</b> and the Nordic Council of Ministers, for their support. Most important, we thank all those who contributed to the conference for presenting their experiences and views, and subjecting them to scrutiny during exchanges with colleagues. We think that the results of this sharing of knowledge and insights in this research field will be of great practical and political importance and will have direct implications on life at work of the elderly work-force.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} the Koenigswinter {{workshop}} from January 23 to 25, 1995, was to bring together social science experts and MAB representatives interested in promoting the idea that MAB should strengthen the social science perspective in all its project areas and, in particular, with respect to biosphere revers. It was decided to concentrate on (1) content related and on (2) strategic goals. Content related goals include the identification of problems and topics relevant for the functioning of biosphere reserves (e. g. acceptance of biosphere reserves by the local population; problems of management; {{advantages and disadvantages of}} tourist activities). Another area of discussion centers on research strategies that call for cooperation with the natural sciences. Strategic goals include the discussion of appropriate formats of an EUROMAB network on Societal Dimensions, on objectives and concrete future activities in order to establish contacts among researchers and practitioners, to organize workshops on special topics, to develop interdisciplinary and crosscultural research projects.

40|$|As {{advanced}} capitalist economies {{including the}} UK {{have moved from}} being resource-based to knowledge-based, national governments have seized upon knowledge and innovation produced in universities as drivers of economic growth, job creation and social development.

For government, Knowledge Transfer is about the transfer of ideas, research results and skills directly from universities (and other research organisations) to business, government and the wider community.

Evidence generated by both qualitative and quantitative methods is more and more seen to be conflicting, open to many interpretations. The aim of the event was to bring together qualitative researchers in the social sciences, many working in the field of narrative but also a number working with life history and auto/biography, discourse analysis, grounded theory methodology, visual methods and ethnography, to discuss the theoretical foundations of qualitative <b>social</b> <b>research.</b> The discussions addressed narrative itself as an index case for methodological debate; methodological considerations of objectivity and evidence, interpretation and context; appropriate levels of research focus and their interactions; the role of dialogue between disciplines; and the interaction between social science and the wider environment of which it is a part. Questions such as the following were discussed throughout the symposium: Who and what is <b>social</b> <b>research</b> <b>for,</b> and whose voices does it represent? What are social researchers' and participants' interpretative rights over their data and each other? How does thick description and the rich social interpretation it affords relate to the need for precise methods of explanation and generalisable conclusions?

There is increasing evidence that global climate change will alter the spatiotemporal occurrences and abundances of many species at continental scales. This will have implications for efficient conservation of biodiversity. We investigate if the general public in Denmark {{are willing to pay}} for the preservation of birds potentially immigrating and establishing breeding populations due to climate change to the same extent that they are for native species populations currently breeding in Denmark, but potentially emigrating due to climate change. We find that Danish citizens are willing to pay much more for the conservation of birds currently native to Denmark, than for bird species moving into the country - even when they are informed about the potential range shifts associated with climate change. The only exception is when immigrating species populations are under pressure at European level. Furthermore, people believing climate change to be man-made and people more knowledgeable about birds tended to have higher WTP for conservation of native species, relative to other people, whereas their preferences for conserving immigrant species generally resembled those of other people. Conservation investments rely heavily on public funding and hence on public support. Our results suggest that cross-country coordination of conservation efforts under climate change will be challenging in terms of achieving an appropriate balance between cost-effectiveness in adaptation and the concerns of a general public who seem mostly worried about protecting currently-native species.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} how psychological premorbidity affects {{the risk of}} depression in parents who lost a child through suicide. DESIGN: Population-based survey. SETTING: Sweden, between 2009 and 2010. PARTICIPANTS: All parents who lost a child, age 15 - 30, through suicide between 2004 and 2007 according to National population registries. Non-bereaved parents matched for age, sex, living area, marital status, number of children. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: born outside a Nordic country, not Swedish speaking, contact details missing. Participants: 666 of 915 (73 %) suicide-bereaved and 377 of 508 (74 %) non-bereaved parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression measured by the nine-item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9) and study-specific questions to assess psychological premorbidity and experience of the child's presuicidal morbidity. RESULTS: In all, 94 (14 %) suicide-bereaved and 51 (14 %) non-bereaved parents (relative risk 1. 0; 95 % CI 0. 8 to 1. 4) had received their first treatment for psychological problems or {{had been given a}} psychiatric diagnosis more than 10 years earlier. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe depression was 115 (18 %) in suicide-bereaved versus 28 (7 %) in non-bereaved parents (RR 2. 3; 95 % CI 1. 6 to 3. 5). For those without psychological premorbidity, the relative risk was 2. 3 (95 % CI 1. 4 to 3. 6). 339 (51 %) suicide-bereaved parents expressed worry over the child's psychological health during the month preceding the suicide and 259 (39 %) had anticipated the suicide. CONCLUSIONS: In parents who lost a child through suicide in Sweden we did not find a higher prevalence of long-term psychological premorbidity than among parents who had not lost a child; the more than twofold risk of depression among the bereaved can probably be explained by the suicide and the stressful time preceding the suicide.

40|$|The Complementary Panel Survey (CPS) is a {{continuation}} of the work undertaken by the Malawi Poverty Monitoring System (PMS) since 1997. Four rounds of the CPS were conducted between January 2000 and September 2002. The PMS itself was conceived as part of the Government of Malawi's Poverty Alleviation Programme (PAP) launched in 1994. The Policy Framework for PAP articulated the overall objective of the PMS as being to assist the government monitor poverty by collecting and analyzing data relevant to track progress in poverty reduction and to help guide the formulation of poverty alleviation policies and programs. The Malawi National Statistical Office, the National Economic Council (NEC) and the Center <b>for</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Research</b> of the University of Malawi along with the technical assistance of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), a program encompassing the implementation of a regular detailed Integrated Household Survey (IHS) was designed. The resulting Complementary Panel Survey is based on the IHS sample and complementary to the IHS, and the poverty analysis of the data collected by the two survey programs. The IHS was to be conducted every three to five years, while the panel survey twice a year. The final sample size of the CPS in the first round was 758 households. The CPS dataset includes information on education; morbidity; food security and coping strategies; labour and employment; income, expenditures, and transfers. The questionnaire for the fourth round of the CPS was developed explicitly to allow a welfare indicator to be constructed that would be comparable to the welfare indicator developed in the poverty analysis of the 1997 - 98 Integrated Household Survey. This was necessary to allow the IHS data and poverty analysis to be linked to the CPS data in order to undertake an analysis of the dynamics of household welfare in the CPS sample between the IHS and the fourth round.

Arbete och Hälsa 2007; 41 : 1 About 35 % {{of the working}} population in Sweden report that computer use accounts for 50 % {{or more of their}} total working hours. Among employees who work with computers for more than half the working day approximately 40 % of the women and 25 % of the men experience symptoms in the neck and upper extremities {{at least once a week}} during the preceding 3 month. The overall aim of the studies underlying this thesis was to explore possible associations between working technique, perceived exertion, comfort, physical and psychosocial strains, and symptoms of the neck and upper extremities among computer users. Specific research questions addressed were: a) 	Whether working technique was associated with muscle activity, wrist positions and forces applied to the computer mouse, respectively? b) 	Whether working technique was associated with psychological demands, emotional stress and perceived muscle tension, respectively? c) 	Whether there were associations between self-rated perceived exertion and observations of working postures, and between self-rated comfort and observations of workplace layout. d) 	Whether working technique, perceived exertion and comfort, respectively, were associated with neck and upper extremity symptoms/disorders. Results showed that that subjects classified as having a good working technique worked with less muscular load in the forearm (p= 0. 03) and in the trapezius muscle (p= 0. 02) on the mouse operating side compared to subjects classified as having a poor working technique. Subjects who reported high levels of emotional stress worked more often with lifted shoulders compared to subjects who did not report stressful conditions. Subjects who reported high psychological demands and perceived muscular tension, respectively, used poorer working technique than subjects who did not perceive these conditions (demands, p= 0. 03, muscular tension, p= 0. 02). Moreover, the concordance between ratings of comfort and observations of workplace layout was reasonably good concerning the working chair and the keyboard and good regarding the computer screen and the input device. The concordance between ratings of perceived exertion and observations of working postures the results indicated good agreement for all measured body locations. This applies to the group that rated poor comfort and high exertion. Regarding the group with good comfort and low exertion ratings must be supplemented with observation assessment. Furthermore, that high perceived exertion and low comfort were related to an increased incidence of neck, and upper extremity symptoms while poor working technique was not associated with such a risk. It is concluded that working technique is associated with both biomechanical strain (muscular load and wrist positions) and psychological strain (emotional stress and psychological demands), while no associations could be seen between working technique and the incidence of neck and upper extremity symptoms. Furthermore, high perceived exertion and low comfort are associated with the incidence of neck and upper extremity symptoms.
