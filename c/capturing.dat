40|$|We {{present a}} high-efficiency single-cell <b>capture</b> scheme {{utilizing}} herringbone vortices for small assay samples consisting of only tens of cells. In our previous work of hydrodynamic cell <b>capture,</b> the laminar flow with abrupt expansion in a mircowell restricts the <b>capture</b> efficiency by diverting cells {{away from the}} <b>capture</b> site, which results in low <b>capture</b> rate. In this work, we used herringbone vortices to steer cells towards the <b>capture</b> site to facilitate cell <b>capture</b> efficiency. The proposed design achieves ~ 65 % <b>capture</b> efficiency when loading only 20, 40 and 60 MDA-MB- 321 (breast cancer) cells. Compared to the <b>capture</b> efficiency of ~ 35 % without the herringbone, the proposed cell-focusing <b>capture</b> scheme demonstrates the feasibility for small samples analysis...|$|R
