50|$|The {{most common}} and most famous species in the United States is the brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa). It is found in a large area of the Midwest, west to Colorado and the New Mexico state line and east to {{northern}} Georgia. Sporadic records from other locations only represent incidental introductions, not established populations. The brown recluse feeds on whatever small prey is available, and has been observed to prefer scavenging over actively hunting. Other notable members of this genus include the <b>Chilean</b> <b>recluse</b> spider (L. laeta) and the Mediterranean recluse spider (L. rufescens).|$|E

5000|$|Loxosceles laeta, {{commonly}} known as the <b>Chilean</b> <b>Recluse</b> Spider, is generally considered {{to be one of the}} most toxic species in the Loxosceles genus. It has a very wide range, having populations in Guatemala, Panama, Curaçao, Trinidad, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina in South and Central America. In North America, there are populations in Vancouver, Canada, Massachusetts, California, Kansas and Florida. L. laeta can also be found in Finland and Australia. L. laeta has been documented at elevations between 200m and 2340m. [...] This range can probably be attributed to the species ability to last long periods of time without food or water. The laeta is cryptozoic, meaning it lives in dark concealed places. This can often mean piles of wood or brick for the laeta, facilitating more transportation of the species into new areas. Another reason for the laeta’s strong populations is the high fertility rate among its females. Each female can produce up to fifteen egg sacs in its life, with between fifty and one hundred and fifty eggs in each. Loxosceles laeta eggs have a high egg fertility index.|$|E
50|$|Spiders {{known to}} have {{necrotic}} venom occur most notoriously in the family Sicariidae, which includes both the recluse spiders and the six-eyed sand spiders. Spiders in this family possess a known dermonecrotic agent sphingomyelinase D, which is otherwise found only in a few pathogenic bacteria. Some species in this family are more venomous than others; according to one study, the venom of the <b>Chilean</b> <b>recluse</b> and several species of six-eyed sand spider indigenous to southern Africa, contains {{an order of magnitude}} more of this substance than do other sicariid spiders such as the brown recluse. Bites by spiders in this family can produce symptoms ranging from minor localized effects, to severe dermonecrotic lesions, up to and including severe systemic reactions including renal failure, and in some cases, death. Even in the absence of systemic effects, serious bites from sicariid spiders may form a necrotising ulcer that destroys soft tissue and may take months and very rarely years to heal, leaving deep scars. The damaged tissue may become gangrenous and eventually slough away. Initially there may be no pain from a bite, but over time the wound may grow to 10 inches (25 cm) in extreme cases. Bites usually become painful and itchy within two to eight hours, pain and other local effects worsen 12 to 36 hours after the bite, and then necrosis will develop over the next few days.|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe {{rates of}} oxygen {{consumption}} {{and carbon dioxide}} release of primitive hunters and weaver spiders, the <b>Chilean</b> <b>Recluse</b> spider Loxosceles laeta Nicolet (Araneae: Sicariidae) and the Chilean Tiger spider Scytodes globula Nicolet (Araneae: Scytodidae), are analyzed, and their relationship with body mass is studied. The results are compared with the metabolic data available for other spiders. A low metabolic rate is found both for these two species and other primitive hunters and weavers, such as spiders of the families Dysderidae and Plectreuridae. The metabolic rate of this group is lower than in nonprimitive spiders, such as the orb weavers (Araneae: Araneidae). The results reject the proposition of a general relationship for metabolic rate for all land arthropods (related to body mass) and agree with the hypothesis that metabolic rates are affected not only by sex, reproductive and developmental status, but also by ecology and life style, recognizing here, {{at least in the}} araneomorph spiders, a group having low metabolism, comprising the primitive hunters and weaver spiders, and another group comprising the higher metabolic rate web building spiders (e. g. orb weavers).

40|$|In Chile, all {{necrotic}} arachnidism {{is attributed}} to the <b>Chilean</b> <b>recluse</b> spider Loxosceles laeta (Nicolet) (Araneae: Sicariidae). It is predated by the spitting spider Scytodes globula (Nicolet) (Araneae: Scytodidae). The biology {{of each of these}} species is not well known and it is important to clarify their distributions. The aims of this study are to elucidate the variables involved in the niches of both species based on environmental and human footprint variables, and to construct geographic maps that will be useful in estimating potential distributions and in defining a map of estimated risk for loxoscelism in Chile. Loxosceles laeta was found to be associated with high temperatures and low rates of precipitation, whereas although S. globula was also associated with high temperatures, its distribution was associated with a higher level of precipitation. The main variable associated with the distribution of L. laeta was the human footprint (48. 6 %), which suggests that this is a highly invasive species. Similarly to other species, the distribution of L. laeta reaches its southern limit at the Los Lagos region in Chile, which coincides with high levels of precipitation and low temperatures. The potential distribution of L. laeta in Chile corresponds to the distribution of cases of loxoscelism.

40|$|Background: Loxoscelism {{is caused}} by the bite of spider Loxosceles laeta. It can cause a {{cutaneous}} or systemic syndrome. Aim: To determine the epidemiológica! and clinical features of patients bitten by the <b>Chilean</b> <b>recluse</b> spider (Loxosceles laeta). Material and Methods: All communications received at a telephonic orientation center for intoxications during 2005 were analyzed, selecting those who involved patients with symptoms that suggested loxoscelism (i. e., pain, burning sensation, blue area, hematuria, fever or myalgia). These were derived to the emergency room for confirmation of the diagnosis. Forty-eight hours after the initial communication, patients were contacted by phone to find out about the definitive diagnosis. The variables analyzed were: gender, age, geographical location, time since exposure, part of the body involved, clinical signs and definitive diagnosis. Results: Of 2, 831 telephonic consultations with suspected loxoscelism, the diagnosis was confirmed in 287. All of these patients had cutaneous loxoscelism and only 7. 3 % of them developed visceral loxoscelism. Fifty six percent of patients with loxoscelism presented two or more clinical signs. The most common were a blue area, pain and a burning sensation, in 69 %, 58 % and 38 % of patients, respectively. Fifty-one percent of patients developed signs within the first 12 hours. All patients with visceral syndrome presented with hemoglobinuria. No cases of loxoscelism were registered in areas located southern than the Xth region of Chile. There were no fatalities attributed to loxoscelism. Conclusions: Most cases of loxoscelism of this series were cutaneous. The population must be educated about the clinical signs of spider bite to seek early and adequate medical treatmen...|$|E
