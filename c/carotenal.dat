40|$|THE {{means for}} {{standardizing}} and pro-ducing uniform egg yolk color is still of interest, especially {{because of the}} increased demand prevalent for the darker colored yolk products. The pig-ment^) responsible for the yellow color in egg yolks, and in yellow skin as well, are the xanthophylls and related compounds (Peterson et al., 1939; Fritz and Wharton, 1957; Day and Williams, 1958). The latter two goups of workers, among others, report wide variations in xanthophyll availability and utilization from several products. Because of this and the avail-ability of new xanthophyll concentrates (including algae meal and various de-hydrated green meals), and with the potential possibilities of synthetic com-pounds such as / 3 -apo 8 ' <b>carotenal</b> and canthaxanthin (Marusich et al., 1960...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, April 27, 2007. Research completed at the Department of Chemistry, College of Liberal Arts and SciencesCondensation of all-trans-retinal and β-apo- 8 ’-carotenal with 4 -pyridyl acetonitrile monohydrochloride were performed. UV-Visible absorption data in acetonitrile of the condensed ligands show a bathochromic shift in its π→π* transition observed at λmax = 446 and 502 nm from 380 and 458 nm respectively. X-ray data for the pyridyl-retinal ligand showed space group symmetry of P 21 /n. Metal complexes of these ligands were further synthesized. Mass spectrometric analysis for the rhenium (I) complexes showed molecular ion peaks at m/z (ESI) = 811 for the retinal while the <b>carotenal</b> is observed at m/z (FAB) = 943. UV-Visible absorption data of the rhenium (I) complex showed solvatochromic behavior. The λmax of the shortchain was red shifted to 464 nm in acetonitrile and 511 nm in methylene chloride. The λmax of the long-chain was observed at 522 nm in acetonitrile and 612 nm in methylene chloride. UV-Visible absorption data of the platinum (II) complex of the short-chain also showed solvatochromism. It was observed at 458 nm in acetonitrile and 481 nm in dichloromethane. The λmax of the longchain was observed only at 542 nm in dichloromethane. Cyclic voltammetry showed irreversible oxidation peaks for all ligands and metal complexes...|$|E
40|$|A haploid asexual phase predominates {{life cycle}} in Mucorales, but adverse {{extrinsic}} factors along with darkness promote “sexual communication”. Little {{is known about}} the physiological functions of the enzymes and products involved in the sexual phase. We hypothesise that each of the intermediate trisporoid has a specific regulatory function upon the genes linked to sex pheromone production. Real-time quantitative PCR kinetics conducted in Blakeslea trispora (Choanephoraceae), displayed a high transcriptional upregulation during sexual phase for carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene tsp 3. In Mucor circinelloides f. lusitanicus (Mucoraceae), two putative carotenoid cleavage oxygenases (CarS and AcaA) were identified based on phylogeny and amino acid sequence similarity. Unlike Blakeslea, during sex, Mucor had no significant transcriptional up regulation for carotenoid cleavage oxygenases. CrgA, a repressor of carotenogenesis, has no regulatory function on carotenoid cleavage as transcript levels of carS or acaA were on par among wild type Mucor (-) and its crgA mutant. Heterologous co-expression of TSP 3 with β-carotene overproducing plasmid through in vivo enzyme assay and LC-MS analysis led to the identification of β-apo- 12 ’- <b>carotenal,</b> as first apocarotenoid in Blakeslea. Trisporin C stimulated gene transcription in Mucor (-) and had no impact upon Blakeslea. Supplementation of the first C 18 trisporoid, β-apo- 13 -carotenone (D’orenone), entailed a positive feedback regulation on carRP/carRA and acaA/tsp 3 gene expression in Mucor (-) and Blakeslea (+). Our data supports the hypothesis that mode of action of trisporoids varies among genotypes and growth phases which in turn lead to the concept of “specific chemical dialect”. We successfully detected sex hormone and its highly abundant precursor β-carotene in the gametangial phase in M. mucedo (Mucoraceae) by a non-invasive, novel approach of Coherent anti- Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) ...|$|E
40|$|Selected {{examples}} of novel types of carotenoids {{studied in the}} author's laboratory {{during the past three}} years are discussed; including structural elucidation, total synthesis and biosynthetic considerations. Carotenoids of photosynthetic bacteria, particularly the aryl ketone okenone and cross-conjugated <b>carotenals</b> of the rhodopinal series, C 50 -carotenoids of non-photosynthetic bacteria like dehydrogenans-P 439, sarcin-axanthin, bacterioruberin and related compounds and C 45 - and C 50 -carotenoids from Corynebacterium poinsettiae are considered. Glycosidic carotenoids from blue-green algae comprising myxoxanthophyll, oscillaxan-thin and related glycosides and glycosidic carotenoids of bacterial origin are dealt with. Comments on fungal carotenoids are made. From higher plants the structures of lycoxanthin and an apo-carotenoid are treated. Finally carotenoids of lower marine animals, the acetylenic 'asterinsäure' and nor-carotenoids with ring contraction like actinioerythrin and the blue violerythrin are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This theses {{deal with}} the use and {{utilization}} of carotenoids in secondary ornamentation, particularly in birds. Carotenoids {{have an important role}} in animal organisms, and the honesty of carotenoid-based signalization has traditionally been ascribed to anti-oxidant functioning of carotenoids. However, this view has been changed recently showing the potentially harmful effect of carotenoids. The deposition of carotenoids in ornamentation is driven not only by carotenoid intake, but also by physiological processes within the organism. Importantly, when the conditions are suboptimal (and the oxidative stress increases) unstable long aliphatic chains of carotenoids derive into highly reactive non-colorful apo- <b>carotenals.</b> Hence carotenoids may act as classical handicaps, potentially harmful to organism, and this view changes our understanding of honesty of carotenoid-based signalization. The theses focus on summarizing the current knowledge on physiological functions of carotenoids and how they affect secondary coloration, and consist of three chapters. In the first one the basic description of carotenoids is provided, along with an overview of carotenoid classification. The second chapter deals with physiological aspects which affect the carotenoid intake, metabolisation, transport to ornaments, and hypotheses [...] ...|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} with photodiode array UV–Vis detection and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry {{was used to}} analyze sediment samples from the meromictic Ace Lake (Antarctica), {{as well as a}} Pliocene sapropel from the Mediterranean Sea and a Miocene marl from the Vena del Gesso formation (Italy). The Ace Lake samples contained intact chlorobactene, isorenieratene, γ- and β-carotene and two series of carotenoid breakdown products. The first and more abundant series was identified as aryl (φ) -carotenals of increasing chain length (C 13, C 15, C 18, C 20, C 22, C 25, C 27, C 30, and C 32) {{on the basis of their}} UV–Vis and mass spectra. They appear to be formed from chlorobactene through oxidative cleavage of the double bonds of the polyene chain. The minor series (β-carotenals) was also identified, and may be formed from γ-carotene in a similar manner. Intact isorenieratene and the φ-carotenal series were also found in the Mediterranean Sea sapropel. Only a trace of the C 32 φ-carotenal could be detected, suggesting isorenieratene as the predominant source of these φ-carotenals. Additionally, intact β-carotene and C 13 –C 30 β-carotenals were found in the sapropel. The absence of the C 32 β-carotenal strongly suggests these breakdown products are derived from β-carotene. The Vena del Gesso marl contained both intact isorenieratene and the C 13 – C 25 φ-carotenals. The absence of the longer chain length φ-carotenals from this sample may indicate more advanced oxidation of isorenieratene. The <b>carotenals</b> are likely formed during storage of samples and/or extracts under non-ideal conditions, i. e., not frozen and exposed to oxygen although they may also be formed by diagenetic processes. They can be relatively abundant and sometimes be an order of magnitude higher in concentration than the parent carotenoid. Hence, not including the φ-carotenals could lead to an underestimation of the persistence of photic zone euxinia...|$|R
