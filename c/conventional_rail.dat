5|$|Higher-speed rail (HrSR), {{also known}} as {{high-performance}} rail, higher-performance rail, or almost-high-speed rail, is a jargon used to describe inter-city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more than <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> but are not high enough to be called high-speed rail services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to create or expand the high-speed rail networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed rail, or semi-high speed rail instead.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan's rapid {{economic}} growth during {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century led to saturation of highways, <b>conventional</b> <b>rail,</b> and air traffic systems in the western transport corridor, which threatened to impede further growth. The idea of a new high-speed rail line arose in the 1970s, and informal planning began in 1980. In 1987 the executive branch of Taiwan's government, the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Transportation to launch a feasibility study for a high-speed rail line in the western Taiwan corridor, which was completed in 1990. The study found that in a comparison of potential solutions to traffic problems in the corridor, a high-speed rail line would offer the highest transit volume, lowest land use, highest energy savings, and least pollution. In July 1990 the Preparation Office of High Speed Rail (POHSR) was established and a route was selected in 1991. Plans for the THSR were subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan in June 1992 and by Taiwan's legislature, the Legislative Yuan, in 1993.|$|E
50|$|Tramcars {{arrived from}} both {{directions}} along <b>conventional</b> <b>rails</b> on a reserved way running {{parallel to the}} conventional Grimsby District Light Railway, {{though there was no}} physical connection between the two.

50|$|On 3 April 2007 a train {{using both}} power cars of the TGV POS {{trainset}} number 4402 {{set a new}} world speed record for travel on <b>conventional</b> <b>rails.</b> The train reached 574.8 km/h. As {{part of a series}} of increasingly faster runs that culminated in the official record attempt, it set an unofficial speed record of 554.3 km/h on 13 February 2007.|$|R
5|$|The {{high-speed}} trains {{have successfully}} out-competed planes: by August 2008, {{half of the}} air routes between Taipei and the country's western cities had been discontinued, including all connections between cities with THSR stations except for a single daily connection between Taipei and Kaohsiung. Total domestic air traffic {{was expected to be}} halved from 2006 to 2008, and actually fell from 8.6 to 4.9million. In June 2012, officials announced the discontinuation of the last remaining commercial flight between Taipei and Kaohsiung. The share for <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> between Taipei and Kaohsiung fell from 9.71% in 2006 to 2.5% in 2008, while high-speed rail became the most common mode of transport at 50% of all trips by 2008. The opening of THSR led to a 10% reduction of traffic on the parallel expressway in 2007. Despite cheaper ticket prices, long-distance bus companies reported that passenger volumes had fallen by 20 to 30 percent by 2008.|$|E

25|$|To enable {{high-speed}} operation Shinkansen uses a {{range of}} advanced technology compared with <b>conventional</b> <b>rail,</b> achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways {{in the world and}} the importance and advantage of high-speed rail has consequently been reevaluated.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, railway {{networks}} were expanding into areas where lighter traffic was expected. The first cost of conventional railway track was considerable, and cheaper alternatives were sought. The Barlow rail offered this benefit, by avoiding {{the cost of}} sleepers and chairs altogether. Laid directly in the ballast, it required no other ancillary equipment; however the rail itself was significantly heavier and more expensive than <b>conventional</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R
25|$|From {{the above}} {{it is not}} {{possible}} to say whether Transrapid or <b>conventional</b> fast <b>rail</b> track would be cheaper for a particular application.|$|R

25|$|Higher-speed rail {{services}} are intercity rail services that have top speeds higher than conventional intercity trains but the speeds {{are not as}} high as those in the high-speed rail services. These {{services are}} provided after improvements to the <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> infrastructure in order to support trains that can operate safely at higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|Efficiency: <b>Conventional</b> <b>rail</b> is {{probably}} more efficient at lower speeds. But {{due to the lack}} of physical contact between the track and the vehicle, maglev trains experience no rolling resistance, leaving only air resistance and electromagnetic drag, potentially improving power efficiency. Some systems however such as the Central Japan Railway Company SCMaglev use rubber tires at low speeds, reducing efficiency gains.|$|E

Tornado is exempted from portions of the regulations, as are many mainline steam locomotives, such as from {{the need for a}} yellow warning panel, or crumple zones.|$|E
50|$|Holed red {{sandstone}} {{blocks and}} iron spikes {{have been found}} at Benslie showing that the wrought iron rails were {{held in place by}} iron spikes hammered into wood plugs in the stone sleepers. The rail height is much less than a typical modern rail as it was not designed to carry the weight of a locomotive. The rail dimensions are 2.5 in high; 2.75 in wide at the bottom (the foot); 1.5 in wide at the top (the head). The central web is much shorter than that found on <b>conventional</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R

50|$|Potential re-use by <b>conventional</b> UK <b>rail</b> {{operators}} {{was limited}} to its electric trains equipment being unsuitable for general and diesel train operations; the site lacked an overhead crane, turntables, fuelling facilities and it lacked {{a connection to the}} GWML.|$|R
5000|$|It {{does not}} appear any effort was put into vehicle use until the 1950s, when several efforts used Levapad-like {{arrangements}} running on <b>conventional</b> <b>rails</b> {{as a way to}} avoid the hunting problems and provide high-speed service.

The article focuses on cars, based on Ford's prototype [...] "Glideair" [...] vehicle, but quotes Kucher noting [...] "We look upon Glideair as a new form of high-speed land transportation, probably in the field of rail surface travel, for fast trips of distances of up to about 1,000 miles km". A 1960 Popular Mechanics article notes a number of different groups proposing a hovertrain concept.|$|R

25|$|Shinkansen routes are {{completely}} separate from <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> lines (except Mini-shinkansen which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is {{not affected by}} slower local or freight trains, and {{has the capacity to}} operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without road crossings at grade. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and viaducts to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000meters (2,500meters on the oldest Tōkaidō Shinkansen).|$|E
