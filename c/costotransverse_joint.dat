50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{underlying the}} development of costochondritis remains unclear.

40|$|The area {{occupied}} by the intrinsic postvertebral muscles varies in the different region of the back. This is associated with variations in the densities of muscle spindles in successive segments of the three columns of muscle. In the thoracic region, the lateral column has the highest density of spindles, whilst the intermediate and medial columns have steadily less. The attachment of iliocostalis and longissimus thoracis muscles to the ribs is such that contraction of these muscles can produce changes in the <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joints.</b> Conversely, movement in these joints might stimulate stretch receptors in the postvertebral muscles. There is collateral innervation of the <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joints</b> and the postvertebral muscles of the thoracic region by the posterior ramus. The finding of high densities of spindles in the thoracic region would therefore seem to {{support the hypothesis that}} these muscles probably monitor postural activity of the back as well as the rib cage...|$|R
50|$|This <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joint</b> {{is present}} {{in all but the}} {{eleventh}} and twelfth ribs. The first ten ribs have two joints in close proximity posteriorly; the costovertebral joints and the costotranseverse joints. This arrangement restrains the motion of the ribs allowing them to work in a parallel fashion during breathing. If a typical rib had only one joint posteriorly the resultant swivel action would allow a rib to be non-parallel with respect to the neighboring ribs making for a very inefficient breathing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pain {{referral}} {{patterns of}} asymptomatic costotransverse joints {{have not been}} established. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the pain referral patterns of asymptomatic costotransverse joints via provocative intra-articular injection. Methods Eight asymptomatic male volunteers received a combined total of 21 intra-articular <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joint</b> injections. Fluoroscopic imaging was used to identify and isolate each <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joint</b> and guide placement of a 25 gauge, 2. 5 inch spinal needle into the <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joint.</b> Following contrast medium injection, the quality, intensity, and distribution of the resultant pain produced were recorded. Results Of the 21 <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joint</b> injections, 16 (76 %) were classified as being intra-articular via arthrograms taken at the time of injection, and 14 of these injections produced a pain sensation distinctly different from that of needle placement. Average pain produced was 3. 3 / 10 on a 0 – 10 verbal pain scale. Pain was described generally as a deep, dull ache, and pressure sensation. Pain patterns were located superficial to the injected joint, with only the right T 2 injections showing referred pain 2 segments cranially and caudally. No chest wall, upper extremity or pseudovisceral pains were reported. Conclusion This study provides preliminary data of the pain referral patterns of costotransverse joints. Further research is needed to compare these findings with those elicited from symptomatic subjects. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: In vitro {{investigations}} {{have demonstrated the}} importance of the ribcage in stabilising the thoracic spine. Surgical alterations of the ribcage may change load-sharing patterns in the thoracic spine. Computer models are used in this study to explore the effect of surgical disruption of the rib-vertebrae connections on ligament load-sharing in the thoracic spine. Methods: A finite element model of a T 7 - 8 motion segment, including the T 8 rib, was developed using CT-derived spinal anatomy for the Visible Woman. Both the intact motion segment and the motion segment with four successive stages of destabilization (discectomy and removal of right costovertebral joint, right <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joint</b> and left costovertebral joint) were analysed for a 2000 Nmm moment in flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. Joint rotational moments were compared with existing in vitro data and a detailed investigation of the load sharing between the posterior ligaments carried out. Findings: The simulated motion segment demonstrated acceptable agreement with in vitro data at all stages of destabilization. Under lateral bending and axial rotation, the costovertebral joints were of critical importance in resisting applied moments. In comparison to the intact joint, anterior destabilization increases the total moment contributed by the posterior ligaments. Interpretation: Surgical removal of the costovertebral joints may lead to excessive rotational motion in a spinal joint, increasing the risk of overload and damage to the remaining ligaments. The findings of this study are particularly relevant for surgical procedures involving rib head resection, such as some techniques for scoliosis deformity correction...|$|E

40|$|Rheumatoid {{spondylitis}} in {{the early}} prodromal stage may present a complex and obscure clinical picture making diagnosis difficult. It is in this early stage that roentgen examination of the small joints of the spine will often aid in or lead to the correct diagnosis of the disease in which the classical clinical symptoms and roentenographic findings in the sacroiliac fissure have not appeared and may never appear. The changes in these small joints, particularly in the costovertebral and <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joints,</b> are less obvious and require experienced and careful interpretation, but it is to these that the roentgenologist must direct his attention {{if he is to}} be of assistance in early diagnosis.

40|$|Crohn‘s {{disease and}} Ulcerative Colitis), Psoriatic Arthropathy (PsA), and Undifferentiated Spondylitis (uSpA). The axial skeleton, mainly the {{sacroiliac}} joints, the peripheral joints – {{more frequently in}} the lower limbs, and the tendon insertions (enthesis), are particularly prone to an inflammatory process that may involve several targets {{at the same time}} or sequentially. Main symptoms depend on the stage of the disease or the SpA subset under examination, and their overlap is frequent. The most known subset of the SpA is Ankylosing Spondylitis, a chronic systemic inflammatory disease of the axial skeleton whose etiology is still unknown, affecting always the sacroiliac, and usually the apophyseal, costovertebral, and <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joints</b> of the spine. The symptoms begin in late adolescence or early adulthood, and chronic inflammatory back pain and stiffness are the most common and characteristic initial presenting complaints in adult-onset AS. The description in 1973 of a very strong association between HLA-B 27, an immune response gene and AS permitted to consider this disease to have an autoimmune pathogenesis. The association of AS with HLA-B 27 may be 95 % to 99 % according with the majority of authors but this proportion is inferior in Reiter‘s Syndrome and Psoriatic Arthritis...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{develop the}} optimal mode of spine {{evaluation}} with {{magnetic resonance image}} (MRl) in pts with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to study relationship between MR! signs of spinal inflammatory lesions (IL), spondylitis duration and clinical features of AS activity. Material and methods. MRl was performed in 36 pts (22 male, 14 female) fulfilling the modified NY criteria of AS. Median age of pis was 26 years (range 19 - 55), Median AS duration - 8 years (range 1, 8 - 24). 34 (97 %) pts were HLA-B 27 positive. 21 (64 %) pts had high AS activity - median BASDAI 40 (range 10 - 77). 92 % of pts had inflammatory spine pain (VAS> 20 mm) and 61 % of pts had night pain. Median inflammatory pain duration had been defined separately for {{every part of the}} spine assessed by MRl. Median duration of axial pain was 36 months (range: 1 - 240). MR-scanning (Magnetom Symphony, Siemens, 1. 5 T) was performed inTl, T 2 and T 2 -FS (fat signal suppression) modes. IL scoring was done only in 29 pts evaluated in both sagittal and axial planes. We used two scoring methods: 1) individual IL score of the each spine element (vertebral bodies, processes, arches, zygapophyseai, costovertebral and <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joints,</b> ligaments), and 2) separate IL scoring in the vertebral bodies and posterior spinal elements in order "yes/no”. Results. 50 MRl images of different parts of the spine (8 cervical, 30 thoracic and 12 lumbar) have been obtained in 36 pts. Spine IL were found in 35 pts. 26 % of all IL were revealed in axial planes. 3 pts with short AS duration had IL only on axial slices (zygapophyseai lumbar <b>joints,</b> <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joints,</b> processes). IL were revealed more often in thoracic (average score: 7. 1), than in lumbar (3. 7) and cervical (2. 1) spine. In most (26 from 29 pts, 90 %) pts IL were found in painful parts of spine. There was no IL score difference between pts(n= 12) with low (BASDAI 40; n= 17) AS activity. Me and range were 4 (1. 8 - 10. 3) and 6 (4 - 16), respectively; p= 0. 35. There was also no difference in percent of images with IL between pts with short (Me: 4 months, range: 1 - 18; n= 10) and prolonged (Me: 54 months, range: 24 - 180; n= 16) duration of spondylitis (100 % and 94 % of images, respectively). However, pts with early spondylitis had significantly more IL in posterior spinal structures than in vertebral bodies (92. 3 % and 23. 1 % images, respectively; p< 0, 001). Conclusion. Inflammatory MRl lesions are frequently observed in pts with active AS, more often in thoracic spine, and independently of spondylitis duration. Inflammatory MRl lesions in early spondylitis are revealed more often in posterior structures of spine. These results show the necessity to obtain MRl scans for early diagnosis of AS not only in sagittal but also in axial plane...|$|R

40|$|There is much {{evidence}} that ankylosing spondylitis (AS) {{is a disease}} that is also much older than early human civilizations and man as a whole. Until now, the Russia's earliest (14 th c ntury) archaeological finding of such a patient remains a Volga Bulgaria inhabitant suffering with AS during his life. In the Republic of Tatarstan, {{at the site of}} an ancient Bulgar settlement appearing in the early ninth century, archaeologists have discovered an unusual grave: the deceased sitting with his back against the western wall of a tomb pitand having a bronze crosslet under his fingers.  According to a historical source, it was the way of burying Christian hierarchs as pastors sitting on the altar and anticipating the great assize during which the destinies of human souls should be ruled. Anthropological analysis showed that the bones belonged to a 35 – 45 -year-old man who was 158 – 163 cm tall. During the examination of the remains, attention was called to the following features of the spinal structure: ankylosis of the inferior cervical and superior thoracic vertebrae (СV–ThI) and inferior thoracic and lumbar spine (ThIV–LII) predominantly due to ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Facet vertebral <b>joints</b> and <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joints</b> were also ankylosed at the same levels.  The man's neck was fixed in a bent-over position with the head down, the chin touching the breast bone – the socalled soliciting posture. By and large, the vertebral changes are characteristic of late (X-ray stage III) spondylitis.  Spinal and pelvic photos and X-films are given for demonstration. The studies conducted by historical scientists and forensic medical experts suggest that the found remains are most likely to belong to Christian Theodore nicknamed Jerusaleman, also further known as Holy Theodore philosopher Kamsky (Bulgarian), who was mentioned in the Nikon chronicle in 1323. </p...|$|R
40|$|Scoliosis is a {{deformity}} of {{the spine}} that predominately affects adolescent females. Mild scoliotic curves are most vulnerable to progression during the adolescent growth spurt, however, only an unpredictable 15 - 25 % progress to large incapacitating deformities. The present objective was to identify mechanical factors associated with the adolescent growth spurt which are instrumental to curve progression in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). An initially curved and twisted, spatial beam-column model of a spine with a mild scoliosis was developed. The spine was embedded in a three-dimensional elastic medium to represent the ribcage. A finite element model of a ribcage was developed to establish its three-dimensional stiffness {{through a series of}} numerical experiments. Parametric analyses of both the ribcage and spine models were conducted to elucidate a better understanding of this mechanical system. The geometry, material properties and applied loads {{of the spine}} were then systematically changed to simulate both normal and aberrant growth patterns during the adolescent years. The three-dimensional stiffnesses of the ribcage were found to vary significantly with rib level and orientation, and were most sensitive to changes in the gross ribcage geometry and the material properties of the <b>costotransverse</b> <b>joints.</b> The parametric analysis of the whole spine model indicated that the progression of a mild scoliosis was most sensitive to the initial Cobb angle, the spine length, the body weight and the lateral translational stiffness of the ribcage. The progression of a mild scoliotic curve (Cobb angle $<$ 20 $ sp circ$) was found to be small due to mechanical changes associated with the normal adolescent growth spurt in both males and females. For an initial Cobb angle of 30 $ sp circ$, significant progression was predicted for a female during normal growth. The mechanical changes associated with reported aberrant growth patterns could be key factors in the progressio...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose. Determining {{the source}} of a patient’s pain in the upper {{thoracic}} region can be difficult. Costovertebral (CV) and <b>costotransverse</b> (CT) <b>joint</b> hypomobility and active trigger points (TrPs) are possible sources of upper thoracic pain. This case report describes the clinical decision-making process for a patient with posterior upper thoracic pain. Case Description. The patient had a 4 -month history of pain; limited cervical, trunk, and shoulder active range of motion; limited and painful mobility of the right CV/CT joints of ribs 3 through 6; and periscapular TrPs. Interventions included CV/CT joint mobilizations, TrP release, and flexibility and postural exercises. Outcomes. The patient reported intermittent mild discomfort after 7 physical therapy sessions. Examination findings were normal, {{and he was able to}} resume all preinjury activities. Discussion. This case suggests that CV/CT mobilizations and active TrP release may have been beneficial in reducing pain and restoring function in this patient. [Fruth SJ.
