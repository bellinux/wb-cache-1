25|$|The {{official}} meeting of all states {{party to the}} Kyoto Protocol is the Conference of the Parties. It is held every year {{as part of the}} United Nations Climate Change conference, which also serves as the formal meeting of UNFCCC. The first Meetings of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) was held in 2005 in conjunction with the eleventh Conferences of parties to UNFCCC (COP). Also parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol can participate in Protocol-related meetings as observers. The first conference was held in 1995 in Berlin, while the 2013 conference was held in Warsaw. Later <b>COPs</b> <b>were</b> held in Lima, Peru in 2014 and in Paris, France in 2015.|$|E
500|$|In total nine {{episodes of}} Star <b>Cops</b> <b>were</b> made. A tenth episode, titled [...] "Death on the Moon", was planned but {{industrial}} relations difficulties during production led to it being abandoned shortly before recording was to commence. A combination of factors, including conflict between Boucher and producer Evgeny Gridneff and poor scheduling, {{meant that the}} series never found a satisfactory audience and the series was cancelled after one season. In recent years, Star Cops has undergone something of a critical re-appraisal and is generally hailed for being [...] "a pretty good attempt at a moderately realistic [...] "" [...] SF series". Big Finish announced in November 2017 {{that they would be}} releasing new Star Cops audio plays starring some of the surviving original cast members, beginning in 2018.|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} Folie à Deux arrived in stores (December 15), Fall Out Boy had planned on staging an impromptu concert in New York City's Washington Square Park. However, the band did not obtain {{a permit to}} do so. Taking {{inspiration}} from Bob Dylan and similar folk singers from the 1960s, the group {{wanted to do something}} free and spontaneous as a gift to fans. The band and its management argued with the NYPD about allowing the show to go on. In the end, they were told that picking up any instruments would earn them a trip to jail, so the band instead led the audience in a sing-along. Stump sang while Wentz and Trohman played air guitar and Hurley drummed on his knees. Stump later commented in an interview that [...] "Those cops back there—and I have no problem with the cops, trust me—but those <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> like the Grinch. They just took all the presents." ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} beta <b>COP</b> <b>is</b> present on endosomes and is {{required}} for the formation of vesicles which mediate transport from early to late endosomes. Both the association of beta COP to endosomal membranes as well as transport vesicle formation depend on the lumenal pH. We find that epsilon COP, but not gamma <b>COP,</b> <b>is</b> also associated to endosomes, and that this association is also lumenal pH dependent. Our data, thus, indicate that a subset of <b>COPs</b> <b>is</b> part of the mechanism regulating endosomal membrane transport, and that membrane association of these <b>COPs</b> <b>is</b> controlled by the acidic properties of early endosomes, presumably via a trans-membrane pH sensor...|$|R
500|$|Like Berardinelli, USA Todays Mike Clark thought Bale {{performed}} {{the role of}} Batman {{as well as he}} did Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was [...] "frustratingly underdeveloped". Kyle Smith thought Bale exhibited [...] "both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in American Psycho", and that the film works so well because of the realism, stating, [...] "Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath, his rancid city simultaneously invokes early '90s New York, when criminals frolicked to the tune of five murders a day; Serpico New York, when <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> for sale; and today, when psychos seek to kill us all at once rather than one by one." [...] In contrast, Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of [...] "one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all"; she thought Bale, unlike Michael Keaton whom she compared him to, failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask, but that Gary Oldman succeeded in [...] "emotional complexity" [...] where the rest of the movie failed.|$|E
500|$|Musial was {{assigned}} to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm. He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability. During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading [...]379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as [...] "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> coming". According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, [...] "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers {{think of him as a}} coiled rattlesnake." [...] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.|$|E
500|$|The Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department {{arrived to}} free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, {{and a few others}} were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: [...] "I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because {{everybody}} else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill." [...] With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, [...] "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon." [...] His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, [...] "All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously." ...|$|E
40|$|To {{maintain}} a standing posture during various activities, {{the center of}} pressure (<b>COP)</b> must <b>be</b> controlled in a specific area. This region {{was referred to as}} the movable area of <b>COP,</b> and <b>was</b> measured by shifting the center of gravity along the margin of the supporting area. The region was influenced by the supporting condition and the visual condition. Using a force platform we measured COP of 5 normal adults when stationary and the movable area of COP for 30 seconds under 6 conditions (supporting condition : legs 15 cm apart, closed legs together and one leg; visual condition : eyes open and eyes closed). The 3 -D histogram of the distribution of cumulated densities of <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> prepared and was compared with the movable area of COP. The results showed that under an easy standing condition, the movable area of <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> very large, <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> concentrated in the small area, and the densities of <b>COP</b> <b>were</b> high. As the standing condition became more difficult, the movable area of COP decreased, the scatter of COP widened, and the densities of COP decreased. Under very difficult standing conditions, the movable area of <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> almost as large as the area in which <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> scattered. Since the movable area of COP had a close association with the scatter of <b>COP,</b> it <b>was</b> possible to predict the scatter of COP by analyzing the movable area of COP...|$|R

500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around the <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E

He gratefully thanks the Doctor and his companions, and the Doctor bluntly tells him it was totally unintentional. Rory Williams then forces Hitler to hide in a closet, much to his indignation.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1979, Mayor Ed Koch {{asked the}} city's top law {{enforcement}} officials to devise a plan to counteract rising subway violence and to stop insisting that the subways were safer than the streets. Two weeks after Koch's request, top TA <b>cops</b> <b>were</b> publicly requesting Transit Police Chief Sanford Garelik's resignation because they claimed that he {{lost control of the}} fight against subway crime. Finally, on September 11, 1979, Garelik was fired, and replaced with Deputy Chief of Personnel James B. Meehan, reporting directly to City Police Commissioner Robert McGuire. Garelik continued in his role of chief of security for the MTA. By September 1979, around 250 felonies per week (or about 13,000 that year) were being recorded on the subway, making the crime rate the most of any other mass transit network anywhere in the world. Some police officers supposedly could not act upon quality of life crimes, and that they should only look for violent crimes. Among other problems included: ...|$|E
