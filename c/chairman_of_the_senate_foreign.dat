25|$|Cramer said {{achieving}} a Republican-majority Senate {{could result in}} the removal of controversial Democratic Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas as the <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> Relations Committee. He had long opposed the Vietnam War. In response, Chiles noted that if Republicans controlled the Senate, other southern Democrats would also forfeit committee chairmanships earned and long controlled through their seniority.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiative}} {{was named after}} United States Secretary of State George Marshall, {{who served as the}} United States Army Chief of Staff during WWII. The plan had bipartisan support in Washington, where the Republicans controlled Congress and the Democrats controlled the White House with Harry S. Truman as president. The Plan was largely the creation of State Department officials, especially William L. Clayton and George F. Kennan, with help from the Brookings Institution, as requested by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> Relations Committee. Marshall spoke of an urgent need to help the European recovery in his address at Harvard University in June 1947. The purpose of the Marshall Plan was to aid in the economic recovery of nations after WWII and to reduce the influence of communist parties within them. In order to combat the effects of the Marshall Plan, the USSR developed its own economic plan, known as the Molotov Plan. It was not as effective as the Marshall Plan, and in some ways contradictory to Eastern Bloc countries that served alongside the Axis powers in WWII.|$|E
25|$|President Grant was livid at the treaty's {{failure to}} pass the Senate and blamed Sen. Sumner's {{opposition}} for the defeat; Grant having believed Sumner had originally agreed to support the treaty at their January 2, 1870 meeting. Grant then retaliated by firing U.S. Ambassador to Britain, John Lothrop Motley, Sen. Sumner's close friend. Then in March 1871, President Grant having influence in the Senate got his allied Senators to remove Sumner as <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> Relations Committee. President Grant {{was able to get}} Congress to allow an investigation Commission to be sent and make an objective assessment as to whether annexation would be beneficial to both the United States and the Dominican Republic. The Commission, sent in 1871, included civil rights activist Frederick Douglass and reported favorably on the annexation of the Dominican Republic to the United States. The Commission, however, failed to generate enough enthusiasm in the Senate to overcome opposition to Dominican Republic annexation. The whole affair never took into account the wishes of the Dominican people who desired to remain independent.|$|E

25|$|Sumner, {{opposed to}} American imperialism in the Caribbean and fearful that {{annexation}} {{would lead to}} the conquest of the neighboring black republic of Haiti, became convinced that corruption lay behind the treaty, and that men close to the president shared in the corruption. As <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> Relations Committee, Sumner initially withheld his opinion on the treaty on January 18, 1870. Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State, Bancroft Davis, that U.S. Naval ships were being used to protect Báez. Sumner's committee voted against annexation and at Sumner's suggestion and quite possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or the president from embarrassment, the Senate held its debate of the treaty behind closed doors in executive session. Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14, 1870, and May 31, 1870. In closed session, Sumner spoke out against the treaty; warning that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals, noting the chronic rebellion that took place on the island, and the risk that the independence of Haiti, recognized by the United States in 1862, would be lost. Sumner stated that Grant's use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of International law and unconstitutional. Finally, on June 30, 1870 the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the required 2/3 majority for treaty passage.|$|E

[...] He ran for the Republican {{nomination}} for president in 1936, but party regulars were not minded to allow a longtime maverick to head the ticket. In his final years, he felt {{he might be able to}} settle differences in Europe by meeting with Hitler; though he did not go, this has not enhanced his historical reputation. [...] Borah died in 1940; his statue, presented by the state of Idaho in 1947, stands in the National Statuary Hall Collection.|$|E
500|$|In foreign policy, Lincoln's {{main goal}} was to stop {{military}} aid from countries abroad to the Confederacy. Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. At times Seward was too bellicose, so for balance Lincoln stuck a close working relationship with Senator Charles Sumner, the <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> Relations Committee. The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the Trent, {{on the high seas}} and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer James G. Randall has dissected Lincoln's successful techniques: ...|$|E

500|$|The small Republican {{majority}} in the Senate made Irreconcilable votes necessary to Lodge's strategy, and he met with Borah in April 1919, persuading him {{to go along with}} the plan of delay and reservations as the most likely to succeed, as it would allow the initial popular support for Wilson's proposal to diminish. Neither senator really liked or trusted the other, but they formed a wary pact to defeat the treaty. Lodge was also <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> Relations Committee and he delayed the treaty by convening a lengthy series of hearings, presiding over a committee packed with Irreconcilables, including Borah. As these hearings continued in the summer of 1919, Wilson undertook a speaking tour by train to get the public to press the Senate for ratification, a tour that ended in his collapse. [...] In the months that followed, an ailing Wilson refused any compromise.|$|E
500|$|In {{a private}} conference with President Grant, Fish agreed {{to support the}} Santo Domingo {{annexation}} if President Grant sent Congress a non-belligerency statement not {{to get involved with}} the Cuban rebellion against Spain. Charles Sumner, <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> Relations Committee, was against the treaty, believing that Santo Domingo needed to remain independent, and that racism against U.S. black citizens in the South needed to be dealt with in the continental United States. Sumner believed that blacks on Santo Domingo did not share Anglo-American values. [...] On January 10, 1870 Grant submitted the Santo Domingo treaty to the United States Senate. Fish believed Senators would vote for annexation only if statehood was withdrawn; however, President Grant refused this option. [...] The Senate took its time deliberating, and finally rejected the treaty on June 30, 1870. [...] Eighteen Senators led by Charles Sumner defeated the treaty. Pres. Grant, angered at Sumner's refusal to support the treaty, fired Sumner's friend J. Lothrop Motley, Grant's ambassador to England, for disregarding Fish's instructions regarding the Alabama Claims. Grant believed that Sumner had in January 1870 stated his support for the Santo Domingo treaty. Sumner was then deprived of his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1871 by Grant's allies in the Senate.|$|E
