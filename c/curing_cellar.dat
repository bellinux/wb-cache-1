50|$|Lüneberg is a cow's-milk cheese made in {{mountain}} valleys in Vorarlberg in western Austria. Cheesemaking was introduced into this region from Switzerland; copper kettles and Swiss-type presses {{are used to}} make Lüneberg cheese. Milk is coloured with saffron and warmed to around 90 F; enough rennet is added to coagulate in 20 to 30 minutes. The curd is cut into pieces the size of hazelnuts and is heated, while stirring, to 122 F. It is then placed into cloths which are pressed lightly in wooden forms. After 24 hours in the press, during which time the cheeses are turned and the cloths are occasionally changed, the cheeses are taken to a <b>curing</b> <b>cellar.</b> They are salted on the surface, and rubbed and washed occasionally while curing. When ripe, the cheese {{is said to be}} about midway in characteristics between Emmental and Limburger.|$|E
60|$|To give {{an idea of}} {{the numbers}} of fish and the extent of the fishing, in a few words, we may state the fact that, in 1834, one shoal of great depth, and nearly a mile broad, {{extended}} from Hayle River to St. Ives, a distance of two and a half miles. A seine was shot into this mass, and 3,600 hogsheads were carried to the <b>curing</b> <b>cellars.</b> As there are 3,000 pilchards in each hogshead, the catch amounted to nearly eleven million fish! The value of these might be 3 pounds a hogshead, and the clear profit about 1 pound a hogshead, so that it is no wonder we hear of fortunes having been made in a few hauls of the pilchard seines. At the same time, losses are sometimes very heavy, owing to gales arising and breaking or carrying away the nets. Such facts, combined with the uncertainty of the arrival or continuance of the fish on any particular part of the coast, tend to induce that spirit of eager, anxious excitement to which we have referred as being so congenial to Oliver Trembath's state of mind at the time of which we write.|$|R
50|$|The {{families}} that started settling the land {{now known as}} Huckabay worked hard to build buildings and dig wells. A smoke house and a storm cellar were the first two buildings to go up. The smoke house was where the citizens put fresh meat to begin <b>curing.</b> The storm <b>cellar</b> {{was a place of}} storage for fresh fruits and vegetables and protection for families.|$|R
