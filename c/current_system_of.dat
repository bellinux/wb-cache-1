CCC projects included reforestation, campground development of many of the park's trails and campgrounds, trail construction, fire hazard reduction, and fire-fighting work. The CCC built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> park roads.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, the Great War {{had been}} ongoing {{for almost two}} years, during which anarchists had taken part in anti-war {{movements}} across Europe, issuing numerous anti-war statements in anarchist and leftist publications. In February 1915, a statement was issued by an assembly of anarchists from various regions, including England, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, Russia, France, and the Netherlands. The document was signed by such figures as Domela Nieuwenhuis, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Luigi Bertoni, Saul Yanovsky, Harry Kelly, Thomas Keell, Lilian Wolfe, Rudolf Rocker, and George Barrett. It was also endorsed by Errico Malatesta and Alexander Schapiro, two of three secretaries elected to their position at the Anarchist International of 1907. It set out several viewpoints, including that all wars {{were the result of}} the <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> society, and therefore not the blame of any particular government; did not regard a defensive and offensive war as being fundamentally distinctly different; and encouraged all anarchists to support only class conflict and the liberation of oppressed populaces as a means by which to resolve wars between nation-states.|$|E

5|$|Public Act51 of 1951 amended and {{clarified}} the <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> {{jurisdiction over}} {{roads in the}} state. The existing tri-level system was maintained, splitting road jurisdiction between the state, counties and cities, as well as subdividing each level into several classifications. Further legislation redefined the exact distribution, but Act51 {{set up a system}} to distribute road funding from gas taxes from a single funding source, currently the Michigan Transportation Fund. Funding was increased during the 1950s as the fuel taxes were increased. Whereas those revenues during the war dropped to levels barely sufficient to keep existing highways in usable condition, they were increased during the following decade to deal with increasing traffic. The state highway department was also authorized to sell bonds to provide funding for the proposed road improvements.|$|E

The <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> officer ranks and {{insignia}} dates from 1988 and is a revision of the ranks and insignia used from 1955 to 1965. The rank of Hai Jun Yi Ji Shang Jiang (First Class Admiral) was never held and was abolished in 1994. With the official introduction of the Type 07 uniforms all officer insignia are on either shoulders or sleeves depending on the type of uniform used. The <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> enlisted ranks and insignia dates from 1998.|$|E

25|$|The <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> {{financing}} {{water supply}} and sanitation is fragmented through a number of different national and state programs.

30|$|Two of {{the most}} {{troublesome}} and imperative issues identified with inclusions are the foundation of generalized inclusions and the improvement of an iterative calculation. In this article, two <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> variational inclusions were presented and contemplated, which is a broader aim than the numerous <b>current</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> generalized ordered variational inclusions in the literature. An iterative calculation is performed with a weak ARD mapping to an inexact solution <b>of</b> our <b>systems,</b> and the convergence criterion is likewise addressed.|$|R

25|$|This <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> road classification, {{numbering}} {{and network}} management has {{its origins in}} the late 1960s. A 1969 study into road construction and management recommended a reclassification of the road system into national roads (primary and secondary), regional roads (primary and secondary) and county roads. This system, without the division of regional roads into primary and secondary categories, was later adopted.|$|E
25|$|One {{issue that}} complicates finding a {{correctly}} fitting bra is that band and cup sizes are not standardized, but vary considerably from one manufacturer to another, resulting in sizes that only provide an approximate fit.

25|$|The {{interim report}} {{highlighted}} {{a number of}} core issues: that speech, language and communication are not only essential life skills but fundamental human rights; that early identification of problems and intervention is important to avoid social problems later on; and that the <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> treatment is patchy, i.e. {{there is a need}} for services to be continually provided for children and families from an early age.|$|E
50|$|Ji Qiang and Larry Martin have {{continued}} {{to refer to the}} Sauriurae as a valid natural group. However, researchers like Jacques Gauthier (2001) and Julia Clarke (2002) have found that fossils found after Haeckel's time have bridged the gap between long and short-tailed Avialae. In their view, any grouping of avialans with long tails must exclude some of their descendants—making Sauriurae a paraphyletic and, thus, an invalid group under <b>current</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> phylogenetic nomenclature.|$|R

25|$|Other {{individuals}} {{have questioned the}} assumptions that link <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> organ gifting with the equitable distribution of human organs arguing that the voluntary and altruistic donation of organs does not necessarily imply the free transplantation of that organ. In other words, under <b>current</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> healthcare in the U.S., not only are organ donations managed by private {{organizations such as the}} United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), but organ transplantation is provided only to those who can afford it and in rare cases to those who desperately need it.|$|R
