40|$|Seamless {{garments}} {{are popular}} knitted products nowadays. They {{are widely used}} as power stretchable underwear, outerwear and sportswear for which the use of high elastic yarns is indispensable. For seamless garments knitted with circular seamless machines, polyurethane (PU) /polyamide (PA) <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarn</b> is commonly used as the base yarn in a plating fabric to enhance the elasticity of the garment. However, the use of PU/PA <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarn</b> has encountered some problems, such as the difficulty in size control and the ageing of PU elastic yarn. In this study, the polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) /polyester (PET) bi-component filament was used to replace the PU/PA <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarn</b> {{for the development of}} seamless garments due to its excellent extensibility and elastic recovery property. The manufacturing processes, including knitting, pre-treatment, dyeing and finishing, were developed, and the end-use performance of the fabrics, which were respectively produced with the PTT/PET bi-component filament and PU/PA <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarn</b> as the base yarn and PA fiber as the face yarn for seamless garments, was compared based on the five different mechanical and physical properties. The results show that the fabric made of the PTT/PET bi-component filament has much better dimensional stability, much better elastic recovery property and much better wrinkle resistance than those of the fabric made of PU/PA <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarn.</b> It is expected that this study could help us to further exploit the use of the PTT/PET bi-component filament in the development of seamless garments in the future.

40|$|In this study, we {{compared}} fiber trapping of embeddable and locatable spinning (ELS) {{with that of}} sirofil and siro core-spinning with flute pipe air suction. Online pictorial analysis showed that the 3 rd ELS was free of the visual fiber loss during the 1 st ELS, 2 nd ELS, sirofil, and siro core-spinning. This indicated the 3 rd ELS possessed high ability of trapping staple fibers. Weight loss of different yarns proved that the 3 rd ELS had a statistically higher fiber trapping capacity than 1 st ELS, sirofil and siro core-spinning. Yarn visual appearance results showed that filaments failed to be entirely buried in the siro <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarn</b> body due to the staple fiber loss and imperfect filament tension adjustment. Poor trapping and filament fasting of staple fibers might be the reasons for more hairy siro <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarn</b> than other composite yarns. Sirofil and siro <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarn</b> had higher value of coefficient of mass variation per unit yarn length and yarn imperfections than the 3 rd ELS yarn which might be probably due to their irregular fiber loss during the sirofil and siro core-spinning. The fiber loss {{would result in a}} decrease in yarn cross-section fiber utilization; therefore, sirofil, siro core-spun and the 1 st ELS yarn had a statistically lower tensile tenacity than the 3 rd ELS composite yarn. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Design of {{antibacterial}} {{woven fabrics}} was discussed {{in view of}} visual impact and antibacterial activity. Antibacterial yarns {{can be obtained from}} blending and combining of silver-coated fibers. Analysis of manufacturing process and cost shows that core-spinning and sirofil spinning are preferable. <b>Core-spun</b> <b>yarns</b> can be used in filling if silver color is not desired. If silver color is desirable, sirofil yarns can be spaced at regular intervals in filling direction...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} twist, fiber characteristics and core/sheath ratio on the breakage types of <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarns.</b> The core yarns were spun on a modified ring spinning frame with a double-apron drafting system using five twist coefficients (Î±m) : 70, 85, 100, 115, and 130. There were used three different varieties of carded cotton as sheath material and 44 dtex/ 12 filaments nylon textured multifilament as core material. The core/sheath ratio was modified by spinning core yarns of different linear densities (25 tex, 20 tex, and 16. 66 tex. In order to ensure good core coverage, the core ratio did not exceed 30 %...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an insight into}} the mechanism of breakage of <b>core-spun</b> <b>yarns</b> and {{the contribution of the}} components to the yarn breaking strength. The study was made on cotton covered/nylon filament core yarn of 25 tex linear density produced at different twists. The load-extension curves showed three types ofbreakages. At low twist, the fibers slip along the filament core and mainly the filament yarn supports the effort. The breakage of this nature was named high elongation breakage. At medium twist, the sheath destroys first, and then the core filament breakage occurs too. The breakage of this nature was named structural breakage. At high twists, a simultaneous breakage of cotton fibers and nylon multifilament occurs...|$|R
40|$|The present paper envisages the multi-response {{optimization}} {{of certain}} factors like elastane linear density, fabric thread density and weave float on some mechanical, (i. e. stretch %, recovery %) and comfort (i. e. air permeability) properties of bi-stretch woven fabrics, under L 18 orthogonal array in Taguchi design. Fabric samples were produced using elastane <b>core-spun</b> cotton <b>yarns</b> {{both in the}} warp and weft. The elastane linear density, fabric thread density and weave float size were used as predictor variables, while fabric air permeability, stretch and recovery were taken as response variables. Two different elastane linear densities, i. e. 44 dtex and 78 dtex, 3 different thread densities and 3 different weave designs, i. e. 1 / 1 plain, 2 / 2 z-twill and 3 / 3 z-twill were used. The results have been analysed using grey relational analysis for the identification of an optimum level of process factors. Furthermore, using analysis of variance method, significant contributions of predictor variables were determined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper,the 5 {{types of}} fabrics were knitted by plain-plated, 1 + 1 and 1 + 3 float-plated, 1 + 1 and 2 + 2 tuck-plate stitch and density P 6,which {{are made of}} cooldry {{absorption}} and quick-drying polyester yarns as the facing <b>yarn</b> and the <b>core-spun</b> spandex <b>yarn</b> of nylon as the ground yarns. The absorption and quick-drying were tested and analyzed. The significance of influence of fabric textures and stretch on absorption and quick-drying was analyzed by means of two variance analysis. Results show that the influence of texture and stretch on absorption and quick-drying are significant. The absorption and spreading speed and the accumulative one-way transport capacity of 1 + 3 and 1 + 1 float-plated and 2 + 2 tuck-plated fabric are bigger. As the fabric texture is the same, the absorption and spreading speed are smaller and the accumulative one-way transport capacity are worse {{with the increase of}} fabrics stretch. The research results can provide a certain reference for the design & development and choice of seamless underwear...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of elastane linear density, thread density, and weave float on the stretch, recovery, and compression properties of bi-stretch woven fabrics for compression garments. Fabric samples were produced using elastane <b>core-spun</b> cotton <b>yarns</b> both in the warp and weft. The elastane linear density, fabric thread density, and weave float size were used as input variables while fabric contraction, subgarment pressure, fabric stretch, and recovery were taken as response variables. Two different elastane linear densities, i. e. 44 and 78 dtex, two different thread densities, and three different weave designs, i. e. 1 / 1 plain, 2 / 2 z-twill, and 3 / 3 z-twill were used. The results of fabric samples were analyzed in Minitab statistical software. The coefficients of determinations (R-sq values) of the regression equations showed good prediction ability of the developed statistical models. The findings of the study may be helpful in deciding appropriate manufacturing specifications of bi-stretch fabrics to attain specific stretch, recovery, and compression properties...|$|R
