50|$|The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, amended Section 4, Section 6, Section 23, Section 24 and Section 30 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. It revised {{rules on}} <b>coparcenary</b> property, giving {{daughters of the}} {{deceased}} equal rights with sons, and subjecting them to the same liabilities and disabilities. The amendment essentially furthers equal rights {{between males and females}} in the legal system.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} is of ancient origin; as regards goods and chattels {{it was part}} of the ancient customs of London and the province of York, and as regards land descending in <b>coparcenary</b> (under which only one heir can claim an inheritance) it was always part of the common law of England under the name of hotchpot. Land which belongs or would belong to a child as heir need not be brought in to the common fund, even though such land was given during the father's life.|$|E
5000|$|The Hindu bill itself {{received}} much criticism {{and the main}} provisions opposed were those concerning monogamy, divorce, abolition of <b>coparcenaries</b> (women inheriting a shared title) and inheritance to daughters. The first President of the country, Rajendra Prasad, opposed these reforms; others included the Congress party president Vallabhbhai Patel, a few senior members and the Hindu fundamentalist parties. The fundamentalists called it [...] "anti-Hindu" [...] and [...] "anti-Indian"; as a delaying tactic, they demanded a uniform civil code. The women members of the parliament, who previously supported this, in a significant political move reversed their position and backed the Hindu law reform; they feared allying with the fundamentalists would cause a further setback to their rights.|$|R

Before becoming king (amanyanabo), he {{had served as a}} Christian schoolteacher, and in 1889 this helped him in his rise to power. The leading chiefs of Nembe, including Spiff, Samuel Sambo, and Cameroon, were all Christians, and after having ordered the destruction of Juju houses a large part of their reason for choosing Koko as king in succession to King Ockiya was that he was a fellow-Christian. However, there was {{at the same time a}} <b>coparcenary</b> king, the elderly Ebifa, who ruled at Bassambiri and was Commander-in-Chief until his death in 1894.|$|E
5000|$|An {{hereditary}} peer is a peer {{of the realm}} whose dignity may be inherited; those able to inherit it {{are said to be}} [...] "in remainder". Hereditary peerage dignities may be created with writs of summons or by letters patent; the former method is now obsolete. Writs of summons summon an individual to Parliament, in the old feudal tradition, and merely implied the existence or creation of an {{hereditary peer}}age dignity, which is automatically inherited, presumably according to the traditional medieval rules (male-preference primogeniture, similar to the succession of the British crown). Letters patent explicitly create a dignity and specify its course of inheritance (usually agnatic succession, like the Salic Law). Some hereditary titles can pass through and vest in female heirs in a system called <b>coparcenary.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Coparcenary</b> is the {{situation}} in which two or more people inherit a title equally between them as a result of which none can inherit until all but one have renounced their right to the inheritance. This could arise when a title passes through and vests in female heirs {{in the absence of a}} male heir. Before they could inherit, each of the female heirs would be an heir presumptive. After they inherited, since the title could not be held by two people simultaneously, two daughters (without a brother) who inherited in this way would do so as co-parceners. In these circumstances, the title would in fact be held in abeyance until one of them renounced for herself and her successors in favour of the other. In England and Wales, passage of a title in this fashion is effected under the rules laid down in the Law of Property Act 1925.|$|E

The Supreme Court on 13 August 2010 {{in the case}} of Madan Mohan Singh & Ors v. Rajni Kant & Anr. [...] has once again entered the debate on legality of the Live-in Relationship as well as legitimacy of Child born out of such relationship. The Court while dismissing the appeal in the property dispute held that there is a presumption of marriage between those who are in live-in relationship {{for a long time and}} this cannot be termed as 'walking-in and walking-out' relationship. In the case of Bharata Matha & Ors v. R. Vijaya Renganathan & Ors. [...] dealing with the legitimacy of child born out of a live-in relationship and his succession of property rights, the Supreme Court held that child born out of a live-in relationship may be allowed to succeed inheritance in the property of the parents, if any, but doesn't have any claim as against Hindu ancestral <b>coparcenary</b> property.|$|E
40|$|Introduced in the Rajya Sabha Monsoon Session, 2005. Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 {{deals with}} {{devolution}} of interest {{of a male}} Hindu in <b>coparcenary</b> property and recognises the rule of devolution by survivorship {{among the members of}} the <b>coparcenary.</b> The retention of the Mitakashara <b>coparcenary</b> property without including the females in it means that the females cannot inherit in ancestral property as their male counterparts do. The law by excluding the daughter from participating in the <b>coparcenary</b> ownership not only contributes to her discrimination on the ground of gender but also has led to oppression and negation of her fundamental right of equality guaranteed by the Constitution. Several states inlcluding Kerala have made necessary changes in the law giving equal right to daughters in Hindu Mitakshara <b>coparcenary</b> property. This amendment is proposed with the intention to remove the discrimination as contained in section 6 of Act by giving equal rights to daughters in the Hindu Mitakshara <b>coparcenary</b> property as the sons have. These proposals are based on the recommendations of the Law Commission of India as contained in its 174 th Report on â€œProperty Rights of Women: Proposed Reform under the Hindu Lawâ€.

Especificamente, visamos Ã comparaÃÃo quantitativa da utilizaÃÃo desses serviÃos de saÃde entre dois tipos de planos: com e sem coparticipaÃÃo. Para isso, utilizamos dois mÃtodos de {{matching}} baseado no propensity score, onde os estimadores sÃo calculados a partir de grupos ou estratos (Stratification Matching) e a partir de uma funÃÃo densidade (Kernel Matching). No modelo de estratos o efeito estimado da coparticipaÃÃo em consultas mÃdicas ficou entre - 0, 358 e - 0, 979 {{per capita}} por ano. No modelo a partir de uma funÃÃo Kernel, o efeito da coparticipaÃÃo foi de - 0, 286 a - 1, 031 per capita por ano. No caso dos exames, o efeito da coparticipaÃÃo ficou entre - 2, 965 e - 4, 652 (Stratification Matching) e - 2, 621 e - 5, 057 (Kernel Matching). Em ambos os modelos a regiÃo Nordeste apresentou o maior efeito de coparticipaÃÃo, tanto para consultas quanto para exames, enquanto a regiÃo Sul teve o menor efeito. Os resultados alcanÃados com o trabalho evidenciam a ocorrÃncia de risco moral, ou seja, a utilizaÃÃo de serviÃos de saÃde Ã sensÃvel Ã imposiÃÃo de mecanismos de regulaÃÃo, onde indivÃduos com coparticipaÃÃo demandam consultas mÃdicas e exames em quantidade inferior aqueles sem coparticipaÃÃo. The {{objective of this}} study is to evaluate the occurrence of moral hazard in the demand for medical and support services for diagnosis and treatment (tests) in the Brazilian supplementary health system. Specifically, we aim at the quantitative comparison of the use of health services between two types of plans: with and without coparticipaÃÃo. For this, we use two methods of matching based on propensity score, where the estimators are derived from groups or strata (Stratification Matching) and from a density function (Kernel Matching). In the model of strata the estimated effect of coparticipaÃÃo medical appointments was between - 0. 358 and - 0. 979 per capita per year. In the model from a kernel function, the effect of <b>coparcenary</b> was - 0. 286 to - 1. 031 per capita per year. In the case of examinations, the effect of <b>coparcenary</b> was between - 2. 965 and - 4. 652 (Stratification Matching) and - 2. 621 and - 5. 057 (Kernel Matching). In both models the Northeast had the highest effect <b>coparcenary,</b> both for consultations and for examinations, while the South had the smallest effect. The results achieved through the study show the occurrence of moral hazard, ie the use of health services is sensitive to the imposition of regulatory mechanisms where individuals coparticipaÃÃo require medical examinations and in quantities not exceeding those without coparcenar...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether and}} to what extent amendments in inheritance legislation impact women's physical and human capital investments, using disaggregated household level data from India. The authors use inheritance patterns over three generations of individuals {{to assess the impact of}} changes in the Hindu Succession Act that grant daughters equal <b>coparcenary</b> birth rights in joint family property that were denied to daughters in the past. The causal effect is isolated by exploiting the variation in the timing of father's death to compare within household bequests of land given to sons and daughters in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. The analysis shows that the amendment significantly increased daughters' likelihood to inherit land, but that even after the amendment substantial bias persists. The results also indicate a robust increase in educational attainment of daughters, suggesting an alternative channel of wealth transfer...|$|E
40|$|By {{concentrating on}} the {{approaches}} to succession in Japanese and over-seas Chinese family businesses, this article attempts {{to come to terms}} with the question of why Japanese firms enjoy corporate longevity while overseas Chinese firms do not. Succession in the overseas Chinese family (<b>coparcenary)</b> is different from succession in Japanese families (primogen-iture) at every relevant point, and these differences have important con-sequences for overseas Chinese family business. The article also discusses economic, historical, and social functions of the two inheritance systems. It is bound to strike us that the Japanese ie belongs to a different world of structure from that of the Chinese chia, even though the two terms are written with the same ideograph [...] The ie is a corporate group: it never (in principle) dies. But the chia is in a perpetual state of dissolution, for when the partition of family takes place, none of the resulting units retains the precise identity of the unit from which it springs...|$|E
