25|$|Minor changes greeted 1976 models, {{the most}} notable {{of which was a}} new <b>crosshatch</b> grille insert. The Gran Sport {{handling}} package was replaced by an 'S/R' package that had similar sporting pretensions. Sales rallied slightly to 20,082 for 1976.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a <b>crosshatch</b> pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E

50|$|A {{section is}} a common method of {{depicting}} the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. It is often used in technical drawing and is traditionally <b>crosshatched.</b> The style of <b>crosshatching</b> often indicates the type of material the section passes through.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} correct the situation, a {{mechanic}} can take the engine apart, and deglaze the cylinders, usually using an abrasive. This creates a roughly 45 degree angle <b>crosshatching</b> of tiny grooves in the cylinder wall, and restores the engine's performance. <b>Crosshatching</b> that deviates too far from 45 degrees can either cause an unwanted accumulation of oil or be unable {{to hold on to}} the oil entirely.|$|R
2500|$|The 1973 {{model year}} {{introduced}} a hatchback bodystyle {{based on the}} 2-door coupe. The front and rear of the Nova were restyled, following a government mandate for vehicles to be fitted with front and rear bumpers capable of absorbing a low-speed impact of [...] To {{go along with the}} bigger bumpers, stylists gave the Nova a new grille with a loosely patterned <b>crosshatch</b> insert and parking lights located inboard of the headlights. In 1974, they could absorb 5mph impacts.|$|E
2500|$|The 1981 {{model year}} AMC Spirits {{received}} a new <b>crosshatch</b> grille {{with a single}} crosshair element. New optional [...] "Noryl" [...] wheelcovers were added. The leather-clad Limited models were canceled, leaving the DL as the top-rung model. The liftback still featured a GT package, available on both base and DL trims, with both engines. New options included power windows, rear window wiper and washer, power antenna, as well as tricolored [...] "rally" [...] stripes. The AMX version did not return for 1981. The optional three-speed automatic now included a lockup torque converter, and radial tires were standard fitment across the lineup.|$|E
2500|$|... 1968 models had {{reshaped}} loop-type bumpers {{that surrounded}} both the vehicle's recessed <b>crosshatch</b> front grille and tail lamps. Hidden wiper arms made their debut. Federally mandated {{side marker lights}} appeared, as inverted trapezoids on the lower leading edges of the front fenders, and circular in the rear. The interior was restyled {{and for the first}} time shared its instrument panel with the other full-size Buick models. Shoulder belts for front outboard occupants were made standard on all cars built from January 1, 1968. [...] Mechanically, the transmission lost its variable pitch torque converter. A tilt steering wheel was standard. Sales set another new record in 1968, as 49,284 units were sold.|$|E

40|$|A long-standing debate {{surrounds}} {{the issue of}} whether human and nonhuman animals share the same perceptual mechanisms. In humans, the Zöllner illusion occurs when two parallel lines appear to be convergent when oblique <b>crosshatching</b> lines are superimposed. Although one baboon study suggests that they too might perceive this illusion, the results of that study were unclear, whereas two recent studies suggest that birds see this illusion in the opposite direction from humans. It is currently unclear whether these mixed results are an artifact of the experimental design or reflect a peculiarity of birds’ visual system or, instead, a wider phenomenon shared among nonhuman mammals. Here, we trained 6 monkeys to select the narrower of two gaps at the end of two convergent lines. Three different conditions were set up: control (no <b>crosshatches),</b> perpendicular (<b>crosshatches</b> not inducing the illusion), and Zöllner (<b>crosshatches</b> inducing the illusion in humans). During training, the degrees of convergence between the two lines ranged from 15 ° to 12 °. Monkeys that reached the training criterion were tested with more difficult discriminations (11 °– 1 °), including probe trials with parallel lines (0 °). The results showed that monkeys perceived the Zöllner illusion {{in the same direction as}} humans. Comparison of these data with the data from bird studies points toward the existence of different orientation-tuned mechanisms between primate and nonprimate species...|$|R
2500|$|... 1977 changes {{included}} redesigned {{sheet metal}} {{for the first}} time in the Gremlin's now 8-year history: revised hood, shorter front fenders, new bumpers, taller glass tailgate, enlarged taillights, and rear license plate now covering the fuel filler. The front end was shortened by four inches (102mm) with all new sheet metal and a <b>crosshatch</b> grille insert. Parking lights reverted to rectangular, and headlights were recessed into square bezels with rounded corners. The new hood had a small [...] "power bulge" [...] at the front. The base model now included carpeting, as well as rocker panel and wheel lip moldings. The [...] "Custom" [...] model was available with a list price of $2,998. The X package returned as a $189 option, with a new striping pattern that ran straight back from the front fenders and crested upward over the rear wheels. Front disc brakes became standard.|$|E
2500|$|A new <b>crosshatch</b> grille {{and revised}} {{taillight}} lenses {{were the only}} appearance changes made to the 1979 Grand Prix. The same models, base, LJ and SJ continued as before as did the basic engine lineup including the [...] Buick V6 standard on base and LJ models, the [...] Pontiac V8 with two-barrel carburetor that was optional on both of those models, and the [...] 301 V8 with four-barrel carburetion that was standard on the SJ and optional on the other models. Transmissions remained the same as before with the three-speed manual standard with the V6 engine on the base model and automatic transmission optional. The automatic transmission was standard on LJ and SJ models and all models when a V8 engine was ordered. Again, the Pontiac V8s were not available in California, where they were replaced by Chevy [...] rated at 140 and [...]|$|E
2500|$|... 1976 Chevelles {{earned a}} billing as [...] "a size {{whose time has}} come." [...] With square {{headlights}} now legal, the top-shelf Malibu Classic got a <b>crosshatch</b> grille and stacked quad headlights while lower models had a waterfall grille and single headlights. Three V8s were available: a new 305-cubic-inch version rated at , a 165-horsepower 350-cubic-inch, and a 400-cubic-inch engine that developed 175 horses. Options included the Econominder gauge package. In its third and final season, the 1976 Laguna Type S-3 was little changed. It again featured quarter-window louvers and a sloped, body-color urethane front end. Lagunas shared their round-gauge instrument panel with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, and could be ordered with a four-spoke sport steering wheel as well as swivel front bucket seats and a center console. Lesser models made do with a more conventional dashboard and a linear-readout speedometer. Production of the Laguna edged up to 9,100 cars as the base price went to $4,621.|$|E

5000|$|Petate or petalillo pottery is {{distinguished}} {{by having a}} light yellow background filled with <b>crosshatching,</b> {{which looks like a}} woven palm mat, called a petate. According to José Bernabé, barro petate began when two potters by the name of Magdaleno Goldívar and José Cervantes began to fill the background with a fine <b>crosshatching.</b> The Bernabé family started experimenting with this decorative style around 1840. The decorative style require very fine white clay {{in order to create a}} very smooth painting surface. [...] The main design over the <b>crosshatching</b> is usually painted in black and occasionally in green. These include images of plants and animals, especially deer, rabbits, eagles, roosters and swans. The tighter the <b>crosshatching</b> is, the finer the piece. This type of pottery is used to make mugs for hot chocolate, platters, large bowls and some animal and human figures. This ware is painted before firing at 900C for five or six hours, glazed, and then fired again. The resulting ceramic resists temperatures of up to 3000C. The work involved in the decoration makes this one of the more expensive types of Mexican ceramic, and for this reason, it is most commonly seen on large, relatively flat platters. A giant urn in this style can take up to three years to complete. The two most famous masters of this type of pottery were Pedro Chávez and José Bernabé, but their families continue to make it.|$|R

50|$|In the chiaroscuro technique, {{multiple}} blocks {{were cut}} and inked with different colors so the resulting print resembles a pen-and-ink sketch. The paper {{served as the}} middle tone, and then highlights (chiara) were added with white gouache, and darkness (scuro) and shadow was created by adding <b>crosshatching</b> in pen or a dark wash with a brush. Woodcuts would consist of a key, or line block, which consisted of the contours and <b>crosshatching</b> and a varying number of tone blocks. The key block sometimes stood alone as {{a black and white}} print. The more blocks, the more tones the final product contained, and the more complex the printing and carving process became.|$|R
