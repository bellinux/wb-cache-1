40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} sub-optimality in training data for part-of-speech tagging. In particular, we examine {{to what extent the}} size of the training <b>corpus</b> <b>and</b> <b>certain</b> types of errors in it affect the performance of the tagger. We distinguish four types of errors: If a word is assigned a wrong tag, this tag can belong to the ambiguity class of the word (i. e. to the set of possible tags for that word) or not; furthermore, the major syntactic category (e. g. "N" or "V") can be correctly assigned (e. g. if a finite verb is classified as an infinitive) or not (e. g. if a verb is classified as a noun). We empirically explore the decrease of performance that each of these error types causes for different sizes of the training set. Our results show that those types of errors that are easier to eliminate have a particularly negative effect on the performance. Thus, it is worthwhile concentrating on the elimination of these types of errors, especially if the training corpus is large...|$|R

40|$|Many word {{forms in}} English {{sometimes}} function as lexical units {{in their own}} right but are also found as constituents of multiword units. Too often we have frequency information regarding all occurrences of a given word form, irrespective of whether it is functioning as a lexical unit or forming part of a larger multiword unit. For example, there are 997 tokens of ‘greenhouse’ in the British National Corpus but in over 500 of these cases, ‘greenhouse’ is a constituent of the phrasal units (the) greenhouse effect or greenhouse gas/gasses. This is a very obvious example, and one which is relatively easy to investigate. At {{the other end of the}} scales of ‘obviousness’ and ‘difficulty’ there are the very high frequency words, often very grammatical in nature. The proposed presentation investigates one of these, the determiner A. The precise purpose of the proposed paper is to present an estimation of the proportion of occurrences of the determiner A in modern English which are best viewed in terms of its obligatory presence in (relatively) fixed phrasal units. The corpus used in the study was the British National <b>Corpus,</b> <b>and</b> the methodology involved the downloading of several large random samples of the word A. The paper presents two types of information. Firstly, a description of the types of phrase which were included in the statistics, those which were not, and those which caused particular problems. And secondly, the quantitative results both for the whole <b>corpus</b> <b>and</b> for the spoken <b>corpus,</b> including <b>and</b> excluding <b>certain</b> types of phrasal unit...|$|R

If a cue is found, a sentence is classified as uncertain <b>and</b> <b>certain</b> otherwise. To examine {{a large number of}} feature combinations, we employ a genetic algorithm.

Corpus resources available to translators are placed along a cline going from “robust”, stable corpora (e. g. large reference corpora such as the BNC) to “virtual”, ephemeral corpora (e. g.

This paper describes the development of resources for sentiment analysis specifically for Arabic text in social media. A distinctive feature of the <b>corpora</b> <b>and</b> lexicons developed are that they are determined from informal Arabic that does not conform to grammatical or spelling standards. We refer to Arabic social media content of this sort as Dialectal Arabic (DA) - informal Arabic originating from and potentially mixing a range of different individual dialects. The paper describes the process adopted for developing <b>corpora</b> <b>and</b> sentiment lexicons for sentiment analysis within different social media and their resulting characteristics. The addition to providing useful NLP data sets for Dialectal Arabic the work also contributes to understanding the approach to developing <b>corpora</b> <b>and</b> lexicons...|$|R
