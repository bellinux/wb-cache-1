5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} <b>cleanings</b> essential. If being shown, their coat {{needs to be}} stripped every two to four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have an allergy to shampoo.|$|E
5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine <b>cleanings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular <b>cleanings,</b> usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E

5|$|Known predators of the bluespotted ribbontail ray include {{hammerhead sharks}} (Sphyrna) and {{bottlenose}} dolphins (Tursiops); {{it is also}} potentially preyed upon by other large fishes and marine mammals. When threatened, this ray tends to flee at high speed in a zigzag pattern, to throw off pursuers. Numerous parasites have been identified from this species: the tapeworms Aberrapex manjajiae, Anthobothrium taeniuri, Cephalobothrium taeniurai, Echinobothrium elegans and E. helmymohamedi, Kotorelliella jonesi, Polypocephalus saoudi, and Rhinebothrium ghardaguensis and R. taeniuri, the monogeneans Decacotyle lymmae, Empruthotrema quindecima, Entobdella australis, and Pseudohexabothrium taeniurae, the flatworms Pedunculacetabulum ghardaguensis and Anaporrhutum albidum, the nematode Mawsonascaris australis, the copepod Sheina orri, and the protozoan Trypanosoma taeniurae. This ray has been observed soliciting <b>cleanings</b> from the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) by raising the margins of its disc and pelvic fins.|$|E
5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting <b>cleanings</b> by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their mouths and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their mouths and gills.|$|E

50|$|Megasonics <b>cleaning</b> {{compared}} to ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> - The difference between ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> and megasonics <b>cleaning</b> {{lies in the}} frequency {{that is used to}} generate the acoustic waves. Ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> uses lower frequencies; it produces random cavitation. Megasonics <b>cleaning</b> uses higher frequencies at 1000 kHz; it produces controlled cavitation.|$|R
50|$|Commercial office <b>cleaning</b> {{companies}} use a {{wide variety}} of <b>cleaning</b> methods, chemicals, and equipment to facilitate and expedite the <b>cleaning</b> process.

25|$|Oaxaca woodcarvings {{were all}} {{originally}} painted with aniline paints made with natural ingredients such as bark of the copal tree, baking soda, lime juice, pomegranate seeds, zinc, indigo, huitlacoche and cochineal. These colorings {{were also used}} for dying clothing, ceremonial paints and other uses. Since 1985, most carvers have now switched to acrylics which resist fading and withstand repeated <b>cleanings</b> better. However, some still use aniline paints as they have a more rustic look that some customers prefer. Either way, the painting is generally done in two layers, with a solid undercoat and a multicolored designed superimposed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{presents}} how {{can be determined}} the degree of <b>cleaning</b> of the microelectronic parts. The <b>cleaning</b> degree ofthe parts depends on: temperature of the <b>cleaning</b> environment, the <b>cleaning</b> liquid nature, <b>cleaning</b> liquid viscosity, time of <b>cleaning.</b> Firstly {{the choice of the}} <b>cleaning</b> environments depends on the type of contaminant needed to be removed from the cleansed object, respectively on the chemical substance that can attack these contaminants. The degree of <b>cleaning</b> can be determined using two methods, in parallel, respectively: the method of mass loss and the method of microscopy...|$|R
50|$|For the {{activities}} described here the following terms are often found: metal <b>cleaning,</b> metal surface <b>cleaning,</b> component <b>cleaning,</b> degreasing, parts washing, parts <b>cleaning.</b> These are well established in technical language usage {{but they have}} their shortcomings. Metal <b>cleaning</b> can easily be mixed up with refinement of unpurified metals. Metal surface <b>cleaning</b> and metal <b>cleaning</b> do not consider the increasing usage of plastics and composite materials in this sector. The term component <b>cleaning</b> leaves out the <b>cleaning</b> of steel sections and sheets and finally degreasing only describes {{a part of the}} topic as in most cases also chips, fines, particles, salts etc. have to be removed.|$|R
25|$|Another study {{concluded}} that fouling degrades performance over time, and determined that although regular brushing was able to remove most of the microbial layer, over time a tougher layer formed {{that could not be}} removed through simple brushing. The study passed sponge rubber balls through the system. It concluded that although the ball treatment decreased the fouling rate it was not enough to completely halt growth and brushing was occasionally necessary to restore capacity. The microbes regrew more quickly later in the experiment (i.e. brushing became necessary more often) replicating the results of a previous study. The increased growth rate after subsequent <b>cleanings</b> appears to result from selection pressure on the microbial colony.|$|E
25|$|Preventive dental {{treatment}} {{is also necessary}} (and often overlooked by the patient), as the lack of saliva associated with xerostomia creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of bacteria that cause cavities. Treatments include at-home topical fluoride application to strengthen tooth enamel and frequent teeth <b>cleanings</b> by a dental hygienist. Existing cavities must also be treated, as cavities that extend into the tooth can not be effectively treated through teeth cleaning alone, and are at {{a high risk of}} spreading into the pulp of the tooth, leading to the loss of vitality and need for extraction or root canal therapy. This treatment regimen is the same as that used for all xerostomia patients, such as those undergoing head and neck radiation therapy which often damages the salivary glands, as they are more susceptible to radiation than other body tissues.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the jacket}} of a suit, between the outer fabric {{and the inner}} lining, there is a layer of sturdy {{interfacing}} fabric to prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the canvas after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a floating canvas, while cheaply manufactured models have a fused (glued) canvas. A fused canvas is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the suppleness and durability of the jacket, so many tailors are quick to deride fused canvas as being less durable, particularly since they may tend to permanently pucker along the jacket's edges after some use or a few dry <b>cleanings.</b> However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small. A few London tailors state that all bespoke suits should use a floating canvas.|$|E

40|$|The {{requirements}} for <b>cleaning</b> technology, e. g. local restrictability, ecological benefit and <b>cleaning</b> of even sub-µm particles, are risen up enormously {{in the last}} few years at the production of microelectromechanical systems and components. Most <b>cleaning</b> technologies are not able to meet all requirements, particulary local restrictability. Therefore a new <b>cleaning</b> technology, the Laser <b>cleaning,</b> has been introduced. Laser <b>cleaning</b> offers the possibility of local restrictability, high selectivity of the <b>cleaning</b> effect, application without chemicals and therefore high ecological benefit. It can be used for contaminations in form of films and particles. Moreover Laser <b>cleaning</b> is applicable to a wide range of materials and three-dimensional structures. Beside other <b>cleaning</b> technolgies particularly Laser <b>cleaning,</b> carried out with Excimer and Nd-YAG Lasers, is employed at the Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart.

500|$|Meth {{mouth is}} severe tooth decay and tooth loss, {{as well as}} tooth fracture, acid erosion, and other oral problems, {{potentially}} symptomatic of extended use of the drug methamphetamine.
