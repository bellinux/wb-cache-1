5|$|Bligh {{had landed}} in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim, and was quickly {{promoted}} to post-captain. In the following months {{he wrote his}} account of the mutiny, and on 22 October was honourably acquitted at <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> of responsibility for the Bounty's loss. Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition, which left London on 3 August of that year, before any news of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London. Bligh would be gone for more than two years, and would thus be absent from the <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> proceedings that awaited the returned mutineers.|$|E

5|$|Costing £8,000 to {{complete}} (£ in 2013), the new prison opened in 1811 with two sections, one for Admiralty prisoners under <b>court</b> <b>martial,</b> {{and one for}} debtors, with a shared chapel that {{had been part of}} the White Lion.|$|E
5|$|The second <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> again found Batsch {{guilty and}} Monts {{innocent}} of negligence. A third investigation, held in January 1879, reversed {{the decision of}} the previous verdicts and sentenced Monts to a prison term of one month and two days, though the Kaiser refused to implement the punishment. This necessitated another trial, which returned to the initial verdict and sentenced Batsch to six months in prison. The Kaiser commuted Batsch's sentence after he had served two months' time. Disappointed that his protégé had taken the blame for the sinking, Stosch requested another <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> for Monts, who was found not guilty. The Kaiser officially approved the verdict, which {{put an end to the}} series of trials over the sinking of Grosser Kurfürst.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{chooses not}} to take Smythe into custody immediately, but leaves him to {{contemplate}} his options – suicide or a <b>court</b> <b>martial.</b> As Smythe hunts for scorpion fish to feed Octopussy, he suffers a sting which triggers a fatal heart attack, during which Octopussy pulls him under. Deciding to spare Smythe's reputation, Bond classifies the death as an accidental drowning.|$|E

5|$|Dönitz {{contacted}} the British {{commander of the}} city of Flensburg, asking him for permission to conduct a formal state funeral, which was approved. That funeral, the last such of the Third Reich, was held on 16 May 1945 with Dönitz, Adolf Hitler's successor as Head of State, delivering the eulogy. In advance, Dönitz had ordered a board of inquiry and <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> to clarify the circumstances of the shooting. During the <b>court</b> <b>martial,</b> Gottlob stated that, in accordance with his orders, he had asked for the password three times without receiving a response from the person, whom he could not visually identify in the darkness. Without aiming he had fired his rifle from the hip. The chain of events was confirmed by the watch leader. The court ruled that Gottlob was not guilty and cleared him of any fault.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Rauschning {{claimed to}} have seen in Hitler's First World War {{military}} record an item concerning a <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> that found Hitler guilty of pederastic practices with an officer.

5|$|On 28 October 1797 Brock {{purchased}} {{the rank of}} lieutenant-colonel, and became acting commanding officer of the regiment, assuming substantive command on 22 March 1798 with the retirement of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Keppel. The rank was apparently bought cheaply; his predecessor from whom he {{purchased the}} rank was advised to sell up and leave the army rather than face a <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> and probable dismissal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Courts</b> <b>martial</b> existed {{separately}} from other courts. The system of <b>courts</b> <b>martial</b> was listed in Court-Martial Regulations 1867. According to it, minor crimes were {{dealt with in}} regiment court. The judges were officers appointed {{by the head of}} the regiment. In order to enforce the decision, consent of the head of the regiment was required. Grave crimes and appeals were dealt with in district <b>courts</b> <b>martial.</b> The highest instance was the Supreme Court-Martial. The members of the Supreme Court-Martial were appointed by the tsar.|$|R

5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E
5|$|In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 {{were found}} guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> of the Korean War. The Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the {{sentences}} and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though {{the men who were}} court martialed were pardoned, there is currently a campaign for a formal exoneration.|$|E

After additional hearings, Reid was ultimately acquitted of the charges. In November 1782, the regiment was moved to Pompton, New Jersey, for winter quarters. Its duties during this time included the interdiction of trade between the countryside and the British in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Lesser {{offences}} were {{dealt with}} by commanding officers.

5|$|Now in {{possession}} of the Royal Navy, President and her crew were ordered to proceed to Bermuda with Endymion. During the journey, they encountered a dangerous gale. The storm destroyed Presidents masts and strained Endymions timbers so badly that all the upper-deck guns were thrown overboard to prevent her from sinking. Decatur and his crew were briefly held prisoner in Bermuda. Upon the prisoners' return to the United States, a U.S. Navy <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> board acquitted Decatur, his officers, and his men of any wrongdoing in the surrender of President.|$|E

5|$|When Bligh {{landed in}} England on 14 March 1790, {{news of the}} mutiny had preceded {{him and he was}} fêted as a hero. In October 1790 at a formal court-martial for the loss of Bounty, he was honourably acquitted of {{responsibility}} for the loss and was promoted to post-captain. As an adjunct to the <b>court</b> <b>martial,</b> Bligh brought charges against Purcell for misconduct and insubordination; the former carpenter received a reprimand.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the troops}} {{went to the}} nearby village of Saint-Philippe, where they stayed {{overnight}} and received assistance from the townspeople. Captain Holland contacted C. W. Bennett, the British Consul at Saint-Denis, and they secured passage to Mauritius on the SS Lalpoora, located at Pointe des Galets. After brief stops in Saint-Joseph and St. Pierre, the troops were transported to Pointe des Galets by train. The Lalpoora left Réunion on the mid-afternoon of 17 January, and they arrived in Mauritius early the next morning. The officers of Warren Hastings were praised for the discipline and bravery of the troops involved in the evacuation; however, Captain Holland had to face a <b>court</b> <b>martial</b> for losing the ship; he was reprimanded and subsequently acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{sent the}} twelve mutineers {{and the seven}} deserters to Quebec for <b>court</b> <b>martial.</b> The mutineers had planned to jail all the {{officers}} (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the U.S. at Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, they would never have taken such action. Brock was evidently upset by the news that the conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.|$|E
