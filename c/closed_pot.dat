5000|$|Esquire is {{historically}} a feudal designation in Scotland. Today, {{the title of}} esquire {{is defined as a}} social dignity that refers to people of the Scottish gentry, who hold the next position in the Order of Precedence above Gentlemen. It is also used as a common courtesy in correspondence. Traditionally, this was one who was classified as a 'cadet for knighthood'. Today, the title of esquire is not bestowed on gentlemen, although certain positions carry with them the degree of esquire, such as that of advocate or Justice of the Peace. Whether an armiger is a gentleman, an esquire, or of a higher rank can be told by the type of helm depicted on the Letters Patent granting or matriculating the arms. In Scots Heraldry, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney makes clear that a gentleman's helm is a <b>closed</b> <b>pot</b> helm, in plain steel, with no gold, whereas an esquire's helm can be a steel pot helm garnished in gold or a helmet with a closed visor garnished in gold.

3000|$|Black Pigments Charcoal Black, Lamp Black, Ivory Black, Bone Black, Graphite, Black Chalk and Terre-noire (Black Earth) {{are among}} the list of black pigments. Well ground {{charcoal}} has often been used as black pigment. In India, charcoal prepared from twigs and woods of tamarind tree after burning in a <b>closed</b> <b>pot,</b> is powdered to make black pigment. Some other substances which after charring were used for preparing black pigment are the shells of almonds and coconuts. The charcoal so produced is soft and gives homogeneous and fine black pigment. By far, the most important black used India is ‘Kajal’ prepared by burning oil in a lamp and depositing the soot on an earthen bowl. Ivory black is prepared by charring ivory cuttings in a closed earthen pot and then grinding, washing and drying black residue. The black so prepared is very intense. It is not favoured now for ecological and animal rights considerations. Bone black is prepared by charring animal bones in closed earthen pots. It is not as intense as ivory black but used as a substitute. Powdered graphite, a mineral found {{in different parts of}} India, has been used as writing material. It gives a dull grey pigment. However, it has mostly been used for drawing rather than for painting. Black chalk is the name given to black clay used for paintings and terracotta. Terre-noire is the same as black clay. It is a mixture of carbonate of calcium, iron and manganese with clay.|$|E
40|$|Two {{reliable}} small-plant bioassays {{were developed}} using tissue-cultured banana, resulting in consistent symptom expression and infection by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). One bioassay {{was based on}} providing a constant watertable within a <b>closed</b> <b>pot</b> and the second used free-draining pots. Culture medium for spore generation influenced infectivity of Foc. Inoculation of potted banana by drenching potting mix with a conidial suspension, consisting mostly of microconidia, few macroconidia and no chlamydospores, generated from one-quarter-strength potato dextrose agar + streptomycin sulfate, resulted in inconsistent infection. When a conidial suspension that consisted of all three spore types, microconidia, macroconidia and chlamydospores, prepared from spores generated on carnation leaf agar was used, all plants became infected, indicating that the spore type present in conidial suspensions may contribute to inconsistency of infection. Inconsistency of infection was not due to loss of virulence of the pathogen in culture. Millet grain precolonised by Foc {{as a source of}} inoculum resulted in consistent infection between replicate plants. Sorghum was not a suitable grain for preparation of inoculum as it was observed to discolour roots and has the potential to stunt root growth, possibly due to the release of phytotoxins. For the modified closed-pot system, a pasteurised potting mix consisting of equal parts of bedding sand, perlite and vermiculite plus 1 g/L Triabon slow release fertiliser was suitable for plant growth and promoted capillary movement of water through the potting mix profile.

The goal was to determine if the pots (average opening diameter: 88 mm) were acoustically significant in these two small churches (volume about 910 m 3). The measured parameters were: resonance frequency, Leq, RT, EDT, STI, RASTI and C 50. The answer that our measurements imply is negative. The measurements taken do not make it possible to highlight a real difference between the two configurations: open and <b>closed</b> <b>pots.</b> The weak variations that were observed on the values of C 50, EDT and STI make very unlikely an audible improvement of the acoustics of these churches by the insertion of the pots. However, it is necessary to be careful and not to deduct too quickly from this preliminary study the inefficiency of the acoustic pots (it will probably depend on the church in question, the number and characteristics of pots and their positions within the church).

40|$|BACKGROUND: If {{the amount}} of {{resources}} allocated to reproduction (K) is fixed, then an increase in seed mass (S) can only be achieved by a decrease in seed number (n = K/S). Thus, log(n) = log(K) -log(S) producing a slope of - 1 when seed mass and number are plotted on log-log axes. However, in comparative studies, empirical support for a slope of - 1 is limited and contentious, leading some to question the utility of this concept. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: First, we show that the expected slope depends on whether genotypes and species producing seeds of different mass are expected to reach the same adult size and that this in turn depends partly {{on the nature of}} growth. Second, we present experimental results using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana. When these RILs are grown in large pots with plentiful nutrients, they exhibit a trade-off between seed size and number with a slope of - 1. 68 (+/- 0. 18) on log-log axes. This occurs because of genetic correlations between seed mass and adult size so that, under the right growth conditions, lines producing lighter seeds have the genetic potential to produce larger rosettes and hence a greater total mass of seeds. We re-grew lines in small pots (10 and 40 mm diameter) in a nutrient-poor substrate so that final adult size was heavily restricted by pot size. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Under our growth conditions, small-seeded lines were unable to produce a greater total mass of seeds. Hence a trade-off emerged between seed mass and seed number with a slope of - 1. 166 +/- 0. 319 on log-log axes in 40 -mm diameter <b>pots</b> (<b>close</b> to the expected value of - 1), although the slope was 0. 132 +/- 0. 263 in 10 -mm diameter pots, demonstrating that the nature of the trade-off is sensitive to the growth conditions...|$|R
40|$|Buried porous {{earthenware}} pots {{could have}} a big future as a viable irrigation method in arid and semi-arid areas, according to specialists in low cost irrigation in Latin America. Pots are being used in this way on farms in north-east Brazil. The porosity of the pots can be varied during manufacture, {{to take into account}} the permeability of the soil and the speed with which water seeps out of the pot to irrigate nearby plants. In the simplest systems, pots are used individually to water trees for reforestation or windbreaks by burying one <b>pot</b> <b>close</b> to each tree. For larger areas, methods of linking the pots into a single system have been developed. In north-east Brazil, large pots have been linked with PVC pipe, but researchers are now developing smaller pots, or capsules. These should give better control of the amount of water used. The capsules developed so far have been created in a mould and vary in size with an average diameter of 400 mm. Capsules have a narrow neck with an inlet and an outlet pipe so that they can be linked together by PVC tubing and plastic connectors glued into the apertures. Once the pipes are sealed into the capsules, water can flow along the system, topping up the capsules as it flows. Up to 2600 capsules have been used per hectare. Trials have shown water consumption can be kept down to 10 litres per capsule per day. Crops irrigated in this way have yielded well. In systems over small areas of up to 500 sq. metres, it has been established that the amount of water passing out of the last capsule is virtually the same as that leaving the first pot.

Commercial models can cook 20 or more cups. As a possible source of confusion, model specifications and names may list either cooked or uncooked capacity. Rice roughly doubles in size during cooking; therefore, a 10 cup (uncooked) rice cooker can produce up to 20 cups of cooked rice. The prices vary greatly, depending on the capacity, features, materials used, and the country of origin.|$|R

The result of stereo vision {{is a collection of}} three-dimensional points which describes the details of scene proportional to the resolution of the obtained images. Vehicle automatic steering and crop growth monitoring are two important operations in agricultural precision. The essential aspects of an automated steering are position and orientation of the agricultural equipment in relation to crop row, detection of obstacles and design of path planning between the crop rows. The developed map can provide this information in the real time. Machine vision has the capabilities to perform these tasks in order to execute some operations such as cultivation, spraying and harvesting. In greenhouse environment, it is possible to develop a map and perform an automatic control by detecting and localizing the cultivation platforms as the main moving obstacle. The current work was performed to meet a method based on the stereo vision for detecting and localizing platforms, and then, providing a two-dimensional map for cultivation platforms in the greenhouse environment. Materials and Methods In this research, two webcams, made by Microsoft Corporation with the resolution of 960 × 544, are connected to the computer via USB 2 in order to produce a stereo parallel camera. Due to the structure of cultivation platforms, the number of points in the point cloud will be decreased by extracting the only upper and lower edges of the platform. The proposed method in this work aims at extracting the edges based on depth discontinuous features in the region of platform edge. By getting the disparity image of the platform edges from the rectified stereo images and translating its data to 3 D-space, the point cloud model of the environments is constructed. Then by projecting the points to XZ plane and putting local maps together based on the visual odometry, global map of the environment is constructed. To evaluate the accuracy of the obtained algorithm in estimation of the position of the corners, Euclidian distances of coordinates of the corners achieved by Leica Total Station and coordinates and resulted from local maps, were computed. Results and Discussion Results showed that the lower edges have been detected with better accuracy than the upper ones. Upper edges were not desirably extracted because of being <b>close</b> to the <b>pots.</b> In contrast, due to the distance between lower edge and the ground surface, lower edges were extracted with a higher quality. Since the upper and lower edges of the platform are in the same direction, the lower edges of the platform have been only used for producing an integrated map of the greenhouse environment. The total length of the edge of the cultivation platforms was 106. 6 meter, that 94. 79...|$|R
