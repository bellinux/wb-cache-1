40|$|Pallets of {{automatic}} transfer lines {{serve as the}} technological and work-transfer equipment. However, their design {{is based on the}} general principles of designing machine accessories. Calculation of the basic design parameters of work based on their functioning features is fairly relevant. In pallet transfer movement over work positioning there is a mismatch between axes of the basic bushing of a pallet and the <b>clamping</b> <b>locks</b> of positioning. The paper identifies the factors influencing it, and defines the conditions to ensure the trouble-free <b>clamping</b> <b>lock.</b> The circular and rhombic clamping of pallet is simultaneous. Further, a clamping load is calculated from the pallet mass (together with the work-piece) and the geometric parameters of the pallet clamping. The paper reveals three movement stages of the <b>clamping</b> <b>lock</b> in a vertical plane when setting the pallet in work positioning: - a <b>clamping</b> <b>lock</b> free play till it encounters with the location bushing; - a <b>clamping</b> <b>lock</b> play length when the lead-in chamfer contacts the bushing chamfer; - a <b>clamping</b> <b>lock</b> play length over the circular surface of bushing. The study of this process has allowed us to calculate the time of pallet clamping and dynamic loads acting on the <b>clamping</b> <b>lock.</b> These calculations made it possible to calculate the required diameter of the <b>clamping</b> <b>lock.</b> The presented calculations allow a reasonable assigning the main design parameters of work positioning for the pallet automatic lines. </p...|$|R

40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. This paper presents design specifications and operation for a newly designed box trap. Used for live-capture of feral pigs in a tropical rain forest in Hawai’i, this trap can be utilized in other habitats for trapping other large quadrupeds (e. g., bears and deer). Each assembled trap weighs 195 pounds and has six separable portable panels. Following an eight-step procedure, a trap can be constructed in eight man-hours. Features of the trap which are not found in other designs and considered unique are: (1) it is all metal; (2) it is equipped with a multi-catch door which forms part of a panel; (3) it uses sleeve-couplings instead of conventional-type hinges for door attachment; (4) it employs convenient use of panel <b>clamps</b> for <b>locking</b> panels together; (5) it allows a wide range of convertibility of an individual trap into group traps of any configuration.
