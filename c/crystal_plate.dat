5000|$|Simplified optical {{scheme for}} XPW {{generation}} is shown on Fig. 1. It {{consists of a}} nonlinear <b>crystal</b> <b>plate</b> (thick 1-2 mm) sandwiched between two crossed polarizers. The intensity of generated XPW has cubic dependence {{with respect to the}} intensity of the input wave. In fact this is the main reason this effect is so successful for improvement of the contrast of the temporal and spatial profiles of femtosecond pulses. Since cubic crystals are used as nonlinear media they are isotropic with respect to linear properties (there is no birefringence) and because of that the phase and group velocities of both waves XPW and the fundamental wave(FW) are equal:VXPW=VFW and Vgr,XPW=Vgr,FW. Consequence of that is ideal phase and group velocity matching for the two waves propagating along the crystal. This property allows obtaining very good efficiency of the XPW generation process with minimum distortions of the pulse shape and the spectrum.|$|E

The G-Crystal is the only thing left from the original Tri-Solar System, and it is here that Mamoru has been hiding out all this time, working to restore Galeon to its original form and programming. The Sol Masters attempt to destroy the Crystal, and their duplicate of Cain attempts to conduct Fusion with the new Genesic Galeon. It refuses, and instead reveals that Guy is within, alive and well.

Other attendees were then presented with their commemoration later in the same day in the Royal Box: Mark Woodforde, Todd Woodbridge, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, Martina Hingis and Pete Sampras. Several post war champions were absent, but the only champions from the open era (post 1968) not to attend were Jimmy Connors and Richard Krajicek. Ilie Năstase was also invited as a two-time singles finalist, but did not attend. The inclusion of singles finalists and the exclusion of doubles champions who had not won at least four titles was mildly controversial, with Frew McMillan bemoaning to BBC Radio that his two-time mixed doubles championship partner Betty Stöve had not been invited, despite the Dutch woman holding three Wimbledon doubles titles and having reached the singles final once; whereas Hana Mandlíková and Goran Ivanišević both attended, neither one of whom had ever won a Wimbledon title of any kind prior to Wimbledon 2000.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of the precise thickness-shear frequency of electroded crystal plates have practical importance in quartz crystal resonator design and fabrication, especially when the high fundamental thickness-shear frequency has reduced the thickness of <b>crystal</b> <b>plate</b> {{to such a degree}} that the proper consideration of the effect of electrodes has been very important.

40|$|The linear {{birefringence}} of uniaxial <b>crystal</b> <b>plates</b> {{is known}} since the 17 th century, {{and it is}} widely used in numerous optical setups and devices.

The well-known linear birefringence and the new circular birefringence form an interesting analogy with the Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Fedorov beam shifts that appear in the light reflection at a dielectric interface. We report the experimental observation of the effect in a remarkably simple system of a tilted half-wave plate and polarizers using polarimetric and quantum-weak-measurement techniques for the beam-shift measurements. In view of great recent interest in spin-orbit interaction phenomena, our results could find applications in modern polarization optics and nano-photonics.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is mainly}} on the theoretical analysis of vibrating crystal plates for acoustic wave resonator and sensor applications. The frequency and mode effects of different surface structures on either or {{both sides of the}} crystal plates are the main concerns in this dissertation. These effects are fundamental to the improvement of existing acoustic wave devices, or to the design of new acoustic wave devices, especially new sensors based on these effects. ^ At first, two-dimensional equations of motion for an anisotropic <b>crystal</b> <b>plate</b> with two thin films on its surfaces are derived by reduction from the three-dimensional equations of anisotropic elasticity and joining separate equations for the <b>crystal</b> <b>plate</b> and the thin films through interface continuity conditions. The thin films possess multiphysical effects, including inertia, stiffness, intrinsic stress, electric and magnetic couplings. The equations derived are used to analyze the perturbation of the resonant frequencies of the <b>crystal</b> <b>plate</b> {{under the influence of the}} surface films. ^ After that, two relatively more complicated but really existing problems in acoustic wave devices are analyzed. One is the effects of a surface film with nonuniform thickness, either stepped or gradually varying. The other is a <b>crystal</b> <b>plate</b> carrying an array of thin films which may be periodic or nonperiodic. In addition to the effects of surface films, vibrations of crystal plates with arrays of surface attached fibers in extensional or flexural motions and surface attached particles are investigated to explore the possibility of using crystal resonators for fiber and particle characterizations. ^ Finally, the effects of material property variation of thin film piezoelectric actuators are also studied. ...|$|E
