50|$|The Le Rhône engines used an {{unconventional}} valve actuation system, {{with a single}} centrally-pivoting rocker arm moving the exhaust valve and the intake valve. When the arm moved down it opened the intake valve and when it moved up it opened the exhaust value. To make this system work a two-way push-pull rod was fitted, instead of the more conventional one-way pushrod. This feature required the cam followers to incorporate a positive action, a function designed in by using a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>links</b> and levers. This design prevented valve overlap and so limited power output, but as the engine structure and cooling arrangements {{would not have been}} adequate at a higher power output this should not be considered a significant design fault.|$|E

A global optimisation solution method applying a piecewise linearisation approach and range-reduction technique is developed to solve the model.

40|$|We {{consider}} two {{well known}} constructions of link invariants.

Certain instances of these two constructions give rise to essentially the same invariants, but when one carefully matches them there is a minus sign that seems out of place. We discuss exactly how the constructions match up in the case of the Jones polynomial, and where the minus sign comes from. On the quantum group side, one is led to use a non-standard ribbon element, which then allows one to consider a larger topological category...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{predicting}} attenuation on microwave Earth/spacecraft communication links, over wide areas and under various atmospheric conditions, has been developed. In {{the area around}} the ground station locations, a nearly horizontally aimed polarimetric S-band ground radar measures the specific differential phase (Kdp) along the Earth-space path. The specific attenuation along a path of interest is then computed by use of a theoretical model {{of the relationship between the}} measured S-band specific differential phase and the specific attenuation at the frequency to be used on the communication link. The model includes effects of rain, wet ice, and other forms of precipitation. The attenuation on the path of interest is then computed by integrating the specific attenuation over the length of the path. This method can be used to determine statistics of signal degradation on Earth/spacecraft communication links. It can also be used to obtain real-time estimates of attenuation along multiple Earth/spacecraft links that are parts of a communication network operating within the radar coverage area, thereby enabling better management of the network through appropriate dynamic routing along the best <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>links...</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for the calibration of microscopic traffic flow simulation models by enabling simultaneous selection of traffic links and associated parameters. That is, any number and <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>links</b> and model parameters can be selected for calibration. Most calibration approaches consider the entire network without enabling a specific selection of location and associated parameters. In practice, only {{a subset of}} links and parameters are used for calibration based {{on a number of}} factors such as expert local knowledge of the system. In this study, the calibration problem for the simultaneous selection of links and parameters was formulated using a mathematical programming approach. The proposed methodology is capable of calibrating model parameters model parameters, taking into consideration multiple performance measures and time periods simultaneously. The performance measures used in this study were volume and speed. The development of the methodology is independent of the characteristics of a specific traffic flow model. A genetic algorithm was implemented to determine the solution to the proposed mathematical program for the calibration of microscopic traffic flow models. In the experiments, two traffic models were calibrated. The first set of experiments included selection of links only, while all associated parameters were considered for calibration. The second set of experiments considered simultaneous selection of links and parameters. Results showed that the models were calibrated successfully subject to selection of a minimum number of links. All parameter values were reasonable and within constraints after successful calibration...|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Systems biology {{models can}} be used to test new {{hypotheses}} formulated on the basis of previous knowledge or new experimental data, contradictory with a previously existing model. New hypotheses often come {{in the shape of a}} set of possible regulatory mechanisms. This search is usually not limited to finding a single regulation link, but rather a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>links</b> subject to great uncertainty or no information about the kinetic parameters. Results: In this work, we combine a logic-based formalism, to describe all the possible regulatory structures for a given dynamic model of a pathway, with mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO). This framework aims to simultaneously identify the regulatory structure (represented by binary parameters) and the real-valued parameters that are consistent with the available experimental data, resulting in a logic-based differential equation model. The alternative to this would be to perform real-valued parameter estimation for each possible model structure, which is not tractable for models of the size presented in this work. The performance of the method presented here is illustrated with several case studies: a synthetic pathway problem of signaling regulation, a two component signal transduction pathway in bacterial homeostasis, and a signaling network in liver cancer cells.

40|$|Tanner, Herbert G. A new network {{topology}} optimization approach to {{cellular neural network}} design, as a method for realizing associative memories using sparser networks is conceptualized. This type of optimization allows recurrent neural networks to be implemented in a spatially distributed fashion, that is, with components of the network residing in different physical locations. This could find application in addressing the problem of dynamic allocation {{of a team of}} robots to a collection of spatially distributed tasks which is relevant for large scale environmental monitoring and surveillance. Spatially distributed sensing allows for greater coverage of the environment than a single large vehicle with multiple sensors would permit in many cases. In this work, we try to answer the question of how could the design process be different if the {{network topology}} was also part of the design. A sparser cellular neural network topology can be achieved without significantly degrading the performance of the network, by selectively deleting those weights from the optimized network which contribute the least to ability of the network to recall the desired patterns. This approach is particularly useful where neural links incur varying costs, such as implementation of associative memories over wireless sensor networks. The cellular neural networks interconnection topology is diluted, without significantly degrading its performance, where performance is quantified by the average recall probability of the patterns engraved into the networks associative memory. The average recall probability is a measure of performance of the designed network in presence of noise and is defined as the ratio of number of recovered memory patterns (perturbed initial condition vectors which result in same output as the stored memory vector) to the total number of perturbed initial condition vectors. Since the average recall probability cannot be assessed prior to testing, the optimization algorithm uses the networks stability parameters as a measure of quality of memorization, and optimization proceeds by selectively removing costly links that contribute the least to the magnitude of these parameters. Two different approaches to implementing the optimization of the networks topology are implemented and compared. The first one is a sequential process in which a single link is removed each time, specifically the one the removal of which incurs the least performance cost compared to all other existing high-cost links. This method ignores the possibility that a non-obvious <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>links</b> may produce better results through the links simultaneous removal. This phenomenon has been observed in simulation studies which validated the proposed method. To validate further the optimization, but more importantly, to ensure that the overall approach does not depend on the particular method used for the combinatorial optimization we also implemented an alternative approach which is based on the randomized optimization. In this approach a random sample of a sufficient number of i. i. d possible topology is generated. In other words, each random topology in the sample has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent. An example is used to demonstrate that irrespectively of the combinatorial algorithm used, the approach yields sparser associative memories that in general trade off performance for cost, and in many cases the performance of the diluted network is on par with the original system. In our numerical tests, the two methods yield comparable results, which do not differ significantly in terms of resulting network performance. Performance is quantified in terms of the network recall probability, and in the proposed optimization algorithm approach is captured by the neural networks stability parameters. Further, we apply the ideas developed so far to control network communication in actual robots to experimentally verify our simulation results. Experimental testing has shown that spatially distributed implementations of cnn on CoroBots are indeed feasible, and that for some cases, the communication delays related to the communication between the different components of the network are not significant enough to affect the performance and stability properties of the dynamical system. It is shown that the error between simulation of the discrete-time dynamics and experimental results practically coincide, with a maximum error difference of the order of 10 - 4. Thus the proposed combinatorial optimization methods performed almost equally well in practice as in simulations. University of Delaware, Department of Mechanical EngineeringM. S...|$|E
