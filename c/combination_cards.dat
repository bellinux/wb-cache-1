Mini PCI has been superseded by the much narrower PCI Express Mini Card.|$|E

50|$|When all twelve <b>combination</b> <b>cards</b> are {{in place}} at the board, the game shifts to Showdown Mode where players can now steal cards from each other. Rules for moving the pieces, {{increasing}} a score in one's own card, and stealing an opponent's card apply in this mode. A player's turn continues until he/she fails to steal a card.|$|E
50|$|The Matrox G200 {{graphics}} processor {{had been a}} successful product, competing with the various 2D & 3D <b>combination</b> <b>cards</b> available in 1998. Matrox took the technology developed from the G200 project, refined it, and basically doubled it up to form the G400 processor. The new chip featured several new and innovative additions, such as multiple monitor output support, an all-around 32-bit rendering pipeline with high performance, further improved 2D and video acceleration, and a new 3D feature known as Environment Mapped Bump Mapping.|$|E
50|$|Yahtzee Free for All, {{designed}} by Richard Borg in 2008, is a variant {{that uses a}} free-for-all format for two to six players. The components come in a hexagonal box {{made to look like}} a 3D image of a die. The inner box stores the components, while the outer box, when unfolded, doubles as the playing mat. The components compose of 30 dice (a set of five for each player), a set of chips and 36 <b>combination</b> <b>cards</b> bearing the 13 Yahtzee categories with different point values.|$|E

50|$|The game {{begins when}} the player holding the lowest card, {{which is the}} 3 {{depending}} upon the suit order being played, plays that card or a valid <b>card</b> <b>combination</b> including that <b>card.</b> The <b>card</b> <b>combination</b> should be placed faced up {{in the center of}} the table. Play then proceeds clockwise or counterclockwise. The next person must play a higher combination of the same number of cards or pass (play no cards). Once a player passes, he cannot return until a new round has started. If all players pass, the person who last put down a <b>card</b> <b>combination</b> starts a new round by playing any card or valid <b>card</b> <b>combination.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Monopoly Community Chest {{has been}} altered. Before, contestants {{manually}} changed the combination lock {{to the three}} colors on their cards. This season, a slot was added for the <b>combination</b> <b>cards</b> to be inserted into so that the combination would automatically light up on the combination lock. If the light is red, the chest remains locked and they'll {{go back into the}} studio audience. If there is only one family remaining, then their combination would win for them. If it's green however, then it will unlock and the family will advance to the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine for more money and a brand-new car.|$|E
5000|$|On the onset, the <b>combination</b> <b>cards</b> (Yahtzee cards {{separated}} beforehand) are shuffled {{and three}} {{are laid out}} on the playing mat. One player aims to form one the combinations using one's set of dice in three rolls. When successful, the player takes the card and places on his part of the field, ending one's turn. A player can steal another's card by forming a higher combination than the original one that player had formed (e.g. 2-3-4-5-6 is already enough to steal the Large Straight card from someone with the 1-2-3-4-5 combination). A card held on one player's side of the mat is open for stealing until play passes back to the holder of the card, at which point, that player [...] "banks" [...] or keeps that card from the mat, guaranteeing points and preparing to get another combination or steal another player's card.|$|E

Smart cards are defined as credit card-sized cards containing a computer chip, or microprocessor, and memory.

Hybrid cards {{may be used in}} contact and contactless modes. <b>Combination</b> <b>cards</b> may also be used for banking applications.

After that, they will use these rolls to earn money by rolling into Cavity Sam, {{which is similar to}} Operation Sam Dunk from the show's second season. The family can win up to $4,000 in cash and they will also earn a Community Chest <b>combination</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
25|$|The dealer {{leads the}} first trick with any single <b>card</b> or <b>combinations</b> of <b>cards,</b> {{and the game}} {{proceeds}} like most trick-taking games, where players take turn to play their cards in a counter-clockwise direction, and the player who plays the highest-ordered <b>card</b> or <b>combination</b> of <b>cards</b> take the trick and leads the next round. All cards taken by the declarers may be discarded {{for the rest of}} the round; point cards taken by the opponents count towards their number of points collected, and should be kept, but other cards may be similarly discarded.|$|R
50|$|Although {{fundamentally}} {{the same}} from the previous seasons, instead of two families competing with each other, one family is chosen from the audience and three members must bowl (one for each person), trying {{to build up a}} different combination of numbers. However, instead of the highest combination winning the game in earlier seasons, each combination is assigned a different prize the family can win after they have all played ranging from cameras to a vacation. At the end of the game, they proceed to draw a Community Chest <b>combination</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Though {{fundamentally}} {{the same}} as the previous seasons, the Boptagon is now smaller and accommodates only one player at a time in teams of two. Each player gets thirty seconds to get as many commands as possible. The new commands include [...] "Chop it!" [...] and [...] "Squeeze It!" [...] (which replace Twist It and Shout It). After two rounds of play with both team members, the team with the most correct commands wins the game. After that, the two teams will receive a Community Chest <b>combination</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Melding {{consists}} of displaying specific <b>combinations</b> of <b>cards</b> to all players. Typically {{this is done}} by placing the <b>combination</b> of <b>cards</b> face up on the playing surface until all players {{have had the opportunity}} to examine them. All players meld after the bid winner shows meld first. The types of melds include [...] "arounds", [...] "marriages", [...] "flushes" [...] and [...] "pinochles". These melds are placed under [...] "headings" [...] where a card which is melded under a particular heading can be used again under another heading, but cannot be melded again under the same heading.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{only two}} cards are dealt to each player, {{it is easy}} to {{characterize}} all of the starting hands. There are (52 × 51)/2 = 1,326 distinct possible <b>combinations</b> of two <b>cards</b> from a standard 52-card deck. Because no suit is more powerful than another, many of these can be equated for the analysis of starting-hand strategy.
