5000|$|Longtime NASCAR {{team owner}} and former Identity Ventures Racing partner Jay Robinson started Premium Motorsports. The team fielded the No. 62 Chevrolet for Brendan Gaughan while points and cars for the No. 62 {{came from the}} closed No. 36 team of Tommy Baldwin Racing after 2014. Gaughan left the team after Daytona in July with the season being {{finished}} with various drivers and various manufacturers. The team also fielded the <b>No.</b> <b>66</b> Toyota for Mike Wallace with owner points and cars for the <b>No.</b> <b>66</b> coming from the closed <b>No.</b> <b>66</b> Identity Ventures Racing team after 2014. However, Robinson shut the <b>No.</b> <b>66</b> team down {{due to lack of}} sponsorship and qualifying performance after 4 races, with Tanner Berryhill in a Chevrolet for the 4th race.|$|R
40|$|Osterix (Osx) is an osteoblast-specific {{transcription}} factor required for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Osx null mice develop a normal cartilage skeleton but fail to form bone and to express osteoblast-specific marker genes. To {{better understand the}} control of transcriptional regulation by Osx, we identified Osx-interacting proteins using proteomics approaches. Here, we report that a Jumonji C (JmjC) -domain containing protein, called <b>NO</b> <b>66,</b> directly interacts with Osx and inhibits Osx-mediated promoter activation. The knockdown of <b>NO</b> <b>66</b> in preosteoblast cells triggered accelerated osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, and markedly stimulated the expression of Osx target genes. A JmjC-dependent histone demethylase activity was exhibited by <b>NO</b> <b>66,</b> which was specific for both H 3 K 4 me and H 3 K 36 me in vitro and in vivo, and this activity was needed for the regulation of osteoblast-specific promoters. During BMP- 2 -induced differentiation of preosteoblasts, decreased <b>NO</b> <b>66</b> occupancy correlates with increased Osx occupancy at Osx-target promoters. Our results indicate that interactions between <b>NO</b> <b>66</b> and Osx regulate Osx-target genes in osteoblasts by modulating histone methylation states...|$|R
