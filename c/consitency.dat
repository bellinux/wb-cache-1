40|$|Choquet {{integrals}} and capacities play {{a crucial}} role in modern decision theory. Comonotony is a central concept for these theories because the main property of a Choquet integral is its additivity for comonotone functions. We consider a Choquet integral representation of preferences showing uncertainty aversion (pessimism) and propose axioms on time consistency which yield a candidate for conditional Choquet integrals. An other axiom characterizes the role of comonotony in the use of information. We obtain two conditioning rules for capacities which amount to the well-known Bayes' and Dempster–Schafer's updating rules. We are allowed to interpret both of them as a lack of confidence in information in a dynamic extension of pessimism.

40|$|Held in {{conjunction}} with the 3 rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid (CCGRID 2003), IEEE TFCCInternational audienceWe consider the design of DSM <b>consitency</b> protocols for hierachical architectures. Such architectures typically consist of a constellation of loosely-interconnected clusters, each cluster consisting of a set of tightly-interconnected nodes running multithreaded programs. We claim that high performance can only be reached by taking into account this interconnection hierachy at the very core of the protocol design. Previous work has focused on improving locality in data management by caching remote data within clusters. In contrast, our idea is to improve locality in the synchronization management. We demonstrate the feasibility through an experimental implementation of this idea in a home-based protocol for Release Consistency, and we provide a preliminary evaluation of the expectable performance gain...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} four systems of set theory based on linear logic. All of those systems have the {{principle}} of unrestricted comprehension but they are shown to be consistent. The <b>consitency</b> proofs are given by establishing the cut-elimination theorems. Our first system of linear set theory SMALL is formulated in full linear logic, i. e., with exponentials. However we do not allow exponentials to appear inside of set terms. Secondly, we formulate a system of set theory in linear logic with infinitary additive conjunction and disjunction, instead of exponentials. This system is called AS 1. Thirdly, we present the system of linear set theory LZF which is a conservative extension of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of regularity or ZF Γ. The idea is {{to build up a}} linear set theory on top of ZF Γ in a style similar to SMALL. We establish a partial cut-elimination result for LZF, and derive from it that LZF is a conservative extension of ZF Γ, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Implementation of {{the pending}} event set (PES) is often {{crucial to the}} {{execution}} speed of a simulation. Parallel access implementation of the PES is a possible means of gaining performance improvement in discrete event simulation. In this paper a comparative study of some sequential and parallel access implementations of the PES is presented, these include linked lists, the Calendar Queue, the Lazy Queue, the Skew Heap and the implicit binary heap. All the parallel access implementations have a potential for an O(1) access time. A comparison {{of the performance of}} these implementations on a shared memory multiprocessor is presented. From these experiments some guide-lines have been compiled for choosing priority queue implementations for the PES.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{methods used}} by recursion theory and formal logic to block paradoxes {{do not work}} in quantum information theory. Since quantum in-formation can exist as a coherent superposition of the classical &quot;yes &quot; and &quot;no &quot; states, certain tasks which are not conceivable in the classic',d setting can be performed in the quantum setting. Classical logical inconsisten-cies do not arise, since there exist fixed point states of the diagonalization operator. In particular, closed timelike curves need not be eliminated in the quantum setting, since they need not lead to the classical antinomies. Quantum information theory can also be subjected {{to the treatment of}} in-consistent information in databases and expert systems. It is suggested that any two pieces of contradicting information are stored and processed as coherent superposition. In order to be tractable, this strategy requires quantum computation.

This discourse contains strong aspects if an identification and justification process for finding the unique position and specific role of controlling in academia and business functions. Still, a widely accepted and sustainable delineation against other business economics and management diciplines has not been accomplished. However, {{a clear picture of}} the scientific object is regarded as beneficial for forming and directing research endeavours. This paper aims at structuring the course of the controlling conceptions discourse by presenting criteria for judging the quality of the existing conceptions (theoretic fountdation, precision, <b>consitency,</b> empiracal validity), and applying these to the conceptions. Building on the assumed adequacy of the proposed critera and the thusly extracted shortcomings of the conceptions, five theses are presented, which summarise the requirements on further conceptional controlling research and propose a new direction for these endeavours regarding the scientific object. ...|$|E

Flugge, (1926) p. 60) {{asserts that the}} {{existence}} of a self-adjoint time operator canonically conjugate to a given Hamiltonian implies that the time operator and the Hamitlonian posses completely continuous spectra spanning the entire real line. Thus the conclusion that there exists no self-adjoint time operator conjugate to a Hamiltonian with a spectrum which is a proper subspace of the real line. But we challenge this conclusion. We show rigourously the <b>consitency</b> of assuming a bounded, self-adjoint time operator conjugate to a Hamiltonian with an unbounded, or semibounded, or finitely countable point spectrum. Pauli implicitly assumed unconditionally that the domain of the Hamiltonian is invariant under the action of U_β=(-iβ T), where T is the time operator, for arbitrary real number. But we show that the β's are at most the differences of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. And this happens, under some other conditions, when the Hamiltonian has a non-empty point spectrum extending from negative to positive infinity. For a Hamiltonian with a simibounded or finitely countable point spectrum, we show that no U_β. We demonstrate our claim by giving an explicit example...|$|E

The {{mechanics}} of unsaturated soil {{is based in}} net pressure and matric suctions, being the last the responsible for the shear strength and deformation behaviors. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the behavior of deep foundations in unsaturated soil by analyzing the variation in the safety factor and the optimization of the designs for different saturation degrees. This study was developed using three samples from different soils, <b>consitency</b> limits, particle size, simple compression and triaxial tests were performed. Using the Plastic Index and the percentage of materials passing the No. 200 from the granulometric tests, and by using a model, the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve was established, which is considered as the best representation for a un unsaturated soil, and for the behavior of the matric suction at a determined humidity. The compression tests supplied values for undrained resistance at different saturation degrees. By using the α (by Tomlinson) and λ (by Vijayvergiya y Focht, 1972), methods for deep foundation design the admissible capacity, safety factor and pile dimensions were determined according to the test obtained resistance. Depending on the saturation characteristics and the physicochemical forces between particles, the least saturated sample will have greater values of undrained resistance; which is reflected in greater values of carrying capacity for the foundation. This reduces the uncertainty of the design and optimizes it. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela Ingeniería en Construcción; Laboratorio del CIVCO...|$|E
40|$|I have {{performed}} a litterature {{study on the}} topic Posttraumtic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) in suvivors of childhood cancer. The latest fifteen years {{this has been the}} main focus in research concerning the psychosocial situation of pediatric cancer patients. I searched PubMed with the terms “children and cancer and PTSD” and included relevant publications containing quantiative measures on prevalence. Becoming absorbed in the available litterature I narrowed my focus down to the following two approaches: 1. What causes the vast discrepancy in prevalence described in the different research-reports? 2. What predictors have the authors found to be relevant for childhood cancer survivors’ risk of developing posttraumatic stress symptoms? Twenty available publications turned out to be eligible for a closer study and comparision. As expected I found vast discrepancies as for the prevalences of PTSD and PTSS that were presented in the different reports. For PTSD-diagnosis alone the results varied from 0 % - 71 % of the studied individuals. I compared the studies on measures like study size, criterias of inclusion, diagnostic approaches and which predictors had been focused on. As a main result I found significantly large differences in these measures; potentially contributing largely to the discrepancies. Further on, I found that predictors like time from diagnosis or ended treatment, the patients’ subjective perseption of the disease and female sex might be significant, although further investigation will be needed to consolidate these findings. Specifically obvious is the need for more prospective longitudinal studies. In general I see a need for numerous additional studies of larger sizes and more <b>consitency</b> in the research methodology on this field...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Pompeiano, Antonio Ph. D., Pisa University and Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies, September, 2009. Zoysia spp. : Adaptability and Possible Use in the Mediterranean Environment. Major Professor: Sergio Miele. In today’s climate, {{in which}} {{economic}} and environmental sustainability has to be ensured, it is important promote alternative grass species that require minimal maintenance inputs. The excellent heat and drought tolerance of zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) made it an excellent choice for Mediterranean areas. Key barriers to widespread zoysiagrass use are slow establishment rate and lack of cold hardiness. My first objective was to evaluate the adaptation and performance of ten genotypes of Zoysia spp., assessing differences in establishment rate, winter color retention, and biometric traits. It was observed differences in total stolon length and stolon growth rate among the genotypes, and for all stolon growth parameters, Z. japonica as species had significantly the highest values compared with Z. matrella. A clear distinct trend in days to 50 % color retention was observed in this study on winter color retention of genotypes. Difference between Z. japonica genotypes were observed, with ‘DeAnza’, ‘El Toro’, and above all, ‘Victoria’ (respectively 57. 2, 57. 8, and 77. 6 Days 50) retained green color better than ‘Meyer’ value. Zoysia japonica genotypes exhibited poor color retention (50. 3 Days 50) compared to Z. matrella (L.) Merr. genotypes (79. 3 Days 50). An additional field study {{was carried out by}} transplant of single potted plants obtained from sprigs and raised in peat-filled honeycomb alveoli. This innovative establishment technique is considered a viable alternative to the more traditional warm-season turfgrass establishment techniques (stolonizing or plugging). At the University of Arkansas, a greenhouse study was conducted to determine the effect of ammonium and nitrate as nitrogen source on zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.). A slow-growing and a fast-growing cultivar of each species {‘El Toro’ and ‘Meyer’ [Z. japonica Steud. ], ‘Diamond’ and ’Zorro’ [Z. matrella (L.) Merr. ]} were assessed for growth analysis, root architecture, and color. Results of growth analysis indicate Z. japonica genotypes prefer solution with 1 NO 3 - : 3 NH 4 + ratio, on ‘Zorro’ a similar result was recorded, whereas no specific trend for dry matter yields of whole plants was observed on ‘Diamond’. Nitrate has been shown to cause a suppression in root growth, regardless the species. Changes in nitrate : ammonium ratio produced distinctive differences on root morphology. Surface area and root volume were promoted by prevalent ammonium treatments in Japanese lawngrass, while a lack of <b>consitency</b> in the patterns was observed in Manilagrass. A field trial was conducted to assess the effects of late-season N application, and timing on color retention of Z. matrella (L.) Merrill cv ‘Zeon’. This study shows that application dates play critical roles in plant response to prolong fall and winter color. No winter injury was observed in any plots the following spring regardless of the late-season N application date. Delaying N application is effective in maintaining acceptable color up to mid January. Additionally, a study was performed with the principal aim of assessing development of freeze tolerance (LT 50) of ‘Zeon’ zoysiagrass under the effect on two different levels of late-season nitrogen applications compared with an untreated control, and the dynamic of nonstructural carbohydrate composition and reserve are altered during cold acclimation and overwintering. During the experiment time, significant differences in response of treatments to the freeze test were found. In October, as expected, the higher N treatment was significantly less cold hardy (LT 50 = - 10. 0 °C) compared to the other treatments, but it results to be beneficial to freeze tolerance in March. The control reached its cold hardiness in November, 1 month earlier than the N treatments and in agreement with the color retention data. It showed a more linear freeze tolerance during experiment time. Significant variations in total soluble sugars occurred in leaves, stems, roots, and sprigs during acclimation and de-acclimation process. Alteration of metabolism was more evident in the 30 g N treatment, in particular in the storage sink...|$|E
