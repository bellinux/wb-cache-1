50|$|Released on July 2002 in Japan at reorganized Nissan Japanese dealerships called Nissan Blue Stage, and August 20, 2002 in the U.S., the 350Z coupé was {{available}} in 5 trim packages: '350Z' (Base), 'Enthusiast', 'Performance', 'Touring', and 'Track' editions. In Europe, only the 'Track' trim {{was available}}, although it was badged and marketed as '350Z'. The Base model {{did not include a}} VLSD or Traction Control and was only available with cloth seats. It did not include cruise control, nor power or heated seats. The Enthusiast model came with traction control, a VLSD, and cruise control. The Performance model came with bigger 18-inch wheels, front air dam, rear spoiler, optional Brembo brakes, and VDC instead of Traction Control. Touring was made more of the luxury model. It had power, leather, heated seats, VDC, a VLSD, xenon headlamps, optional Brembos, 18-inch wheels, and optional GPS. The Track model included Brembo brakes, front air dam, rear spoiler, traction <b>control,</b> <b>cloth</b> seats, 18-inch wheels, VLSD, and optional GPS.|$|E
50|$|By September 1942, 40 cloths {{had been}} {{specified}} (19 wool, 16 cotton, four rayon and one locknit) which all now utilised the CC41 Utility mark, {{designed for the}} Directorate of Civilian Clothing by Reginald Shipp. Though the symbol was intended to mean nothing, the 'two cheeses' looked similar to CC and it was inferred they stood for Civilian Clothing (and not <b>Controlled</b> <b>Cloth</b> or Commodity).|$|R
5000|$|The base SE trim level, only {{offered on}} the Freestyle between 2005 and 2006, was the [...] "base" [...] trim level, and offered the {{following}} features as standard equipment: a 3.0L [...] "DuraTec" [...] V6 engine, a CVT transmission (Freestyle only) or a 6 speed automatic transmission (Taurus X only), seventeen-inch alloy wheels and tires, an A/M-F/M stereo with a single-disc CD {{player and a}} four-speaker audio system, manual front and rear air conditioning with front <b>controls,</b> <b>cloth</b> seating surfaces, power windows, power door locks, keyless entry, an aluminum interior trim piece, black door handles and side mirrors, and matte gray lower body trim.|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of an improved wipe-rinse technique for the bioassay of large areas was undertaken due to inherent inadequacies {{in the cotton}} swab-rinse technique to which assay of spacecraft is currently restricted. Four types of contamination <b>control</b> <b>cloths</b> were initially tested. A polyester-bonded cloth (PBC) was selected for further evaluation because of its superior efficiency and handling characteristics. Results from comparative tests with PBC and cotton swabs on simulated spacecraft surfaces indicated a significantly higher recovery efficiency for the PBC than for the cotton (90. 4 versus 75. 2 %). Of the sampling area sites studied, PBC {{was found to be}} most effective on surface areas not exceeding 0. 74 sq m (8. 0 sq ft) ...|$|R
50|$|Added in version 8.5, nCloth is {{the first}} {{implementation}} of Maya Nucleus, Autodesk's simulation framework. nCloth provides artist with detailed <b>control</b> of <b>cloth</b> and material simulations.

50|$|Base G8 models come {{standard}} {{with six}} airbags (including full-length side curtain airbags), traction control, electronic stability control, dual tailpipes, 18-inch alloy wheels (fitted with either all-season or summer performance tires), sports body kit, fog lights, power windows and locks, cruise <b>control,</b> black <b>cloth</b> seats and a seven-speaker audio system, including front center speaker, single-disc CD player, and auxiliary input jack.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{efficient}} new method for modeling the natural motion of cloth flapping based on a stochastic method for wind simulation and a P-type Fourier descriptor. We do not use physical simulation and forces; instead we apply the generated wind value directly to the cloth motion. Since this approach does not require physical simulation, we can easily tune the implementation using parameters that <b>control</b> the <b>cloth</b> motion in real time. Moreover, we propose a few simple techniques to improve the visual realism of fluttering, the appearance of swirling, and wrinkle effects...|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} was in {{the cost}} of scarlet, which was dyed with kermes, derived from the Kermes vermilio insect native to the Mediterranean. Lincoln scarlet, from its imported dyestuff, was more expensive than Lincoln green. In 1198 the Sheriff of Lincoln bought ninety ells (about 112 yards) of scarlet cloth for £30 (6s 8d per ell); although the cloth was a finely finished fabric, its high price was almost certainly due mainly to the extremely costly dye-stuff, greyne (graine) from Kermes or scarlet grain. In 1182 the Sheriff of Lincoln bought Scarlet at 6s 8d/ell, Green and Blanchet both at 3s/ell and Gray at approximately 1s 8d/ell. By 1216 three guilds <b>controlling</b> the <b>cloth</b> trade were established in Lincoln, the Weavers', Dyers', and Fullers' guilds.|$|R
40|$|Control of {{physical}} simulation {{has become a}} popular topic {{in the field of}} computer graphics. Keyframe control has been applied to simulations of rigid bodies, smoke, liquid, flocks, and finite element-based elastic bodies. In this paper, we create a framework for controlling systems of interacting particles – paying special attention to simulations of cloth and flocking behavior. We introduce a novel integrator-swapping approximation in order to apply the adjoint method to linearized implicit schemes appropriate for cloth simulation. This allows the <b>control</b> of <b>cloth</b> while avoiding computationally infeasible derivative calculations. Meanwhile, flocking control using the adjoint method is significantly more efficient than currently-used methods for constraining group behaviors, allowing the controlled simulation of greater numbers of agents in fewer optimization iterations.

5|$|Days {{before the}} election, Morrow exposed a {{contract}} {{approved by the}} state Board of <b>Control</b> to purchase <b>cloth</b> from a man named A. S. J. Armstrong at twice its normal price. Black responded to the allegation by temporarily suspending his campaign and ordering an investigation. The investigation revealed that Armstrong was a plumber who was bidding {{on behalf of his}} brother-in-law, a former prison official in the Stanley administration. Despite this revelation, Black refused to remove members of the Board of Control. This issue finally sank Black's candidacy; Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes.|$|R

50|$|The castle {{is thought}} to have been built in the 13th-15th century, but the {{original}} building was destroyed and the current building was built on the foundation of its predecessor in the 16th century. The castle was surrounded by walls and had an upper and lower courtyard. In the 17th century, the castle was inhabited by the noble family, Decuypere, who <b>controlled</b> the city's <b>cloth</b> industry. In the 18th century, however, the castle became the property of the family, de Potter. Halfway through the 19th century, the castle became the property of René Van Oye who, in 1863, started a linen factory in the building. Between 1850 and 1874, he built a few houses around the property for his employees.|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. (Computer Science) A {{challenge}} faced when simulating {{the complex}} behaviour of cloth, especially at interactive frame rates, is maintaining {{an acceptable level}} of realism while keeping computation time to a minimum. A common method used to increase the performance is to decrease the number of nodes <b>controlling</b> the <b>cloth's</b> movement. This results in {{a significant decrease in}} the time taken to calculate each frame of the animation, but at the cost of sacrificing detail that can only be obtained using a dense discretisation of the cloth. A simple, efficient and popular method to simulate cloth is the mass-spring system, which utilises a regular grid of vertices representing discrete points along the cloth's surface. The structure of geometry images is similar, which makes them an ideal choice for representing arbitrary surface meshes in a cloth simulator whilst retaining the effciency of a mass-spring system. This dissertation presents a novel method of applying geometry images to cloth simulation in order to obtain cloth motion for surface meshes while retaining the simplicity of a massspring model. By adapting an implicit/explicit integration scheme, and utilising the regular structure of geometry images, an improvement in performance is achieved. Additionally, the cloth is able to drape over other objects, also represented as geometry images. The proposed method is efficient enough to allow fairly dense cloth meshes to be simulated in real-time...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a robotic cell to perform assembly and handling operations on cloth. - A flexible automation approach was adopted, in which the robot was required to <b>control</b> the <b>cloth</b> panel during both handling and sewing operations, without the aid of hard automation attachments which might limit the flexibility of the system. The cell consisted of an adaptively controlled robot, a hierarchy of controllers, a conventional sewing machine, a two-fingered fabric steering end-effector, and several sensor systems. A technique was developed for producing a seam parallel to an edge of arbitrary contour, in which two cameras, a cloth tension sensor and the sewing machine's shaft encoder provided the sensory input. Two sensory servo control systems were required, one control system generated the robot's trajectory to maintain a small constant cloth tension, and the other directed the robot to manipulate the cloth panel to maintain a constant seam width. The design of the <b>cloth</b> tension <b>control</b> was based on the measured frequency response of the open loop system. The seam width control was designed using simulation studies, which accounted for the control transfer function, and nonlinearities such as camera pixel resolution, time delays and robot motion limitations. Several robotic handling techniques were developed, so that a cloth panel placed arbitrarily on the sewing table could be set up for an edge seaming operation, and the cloth could be rotated about the needle. The system's flexibility was demonstrated in the assembly of an irregularly shaped cloth panel, in which three adjacent sides were sewn up. ...|$|R

40|$|Microbial electrosynthesis is a {{promising}} {{strategy for the}} microbial conversion of carbon dioxide to transportation fuels and other organic commodities, but optimization {{of this process is}} required for commercialization. Cathodes which enhance electrode–microbe electron transfer might improve rates of product formation. To evaluate this possibility, biofilms of Sporomusa ovata, which are effective in acetate electrosynthesis, were grown on a range of cathode materials and acetate production was monitored over time. Modifications of carbon cloth that resulted in a positive-charge enhanced microbial electrosynthesis. Functionalization with chitosan or cyanuric chloride increased acetate production rates 6 – 7 fold and modification with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane gave rates 3 -fold higher than untreated controls. A 3 -fold increase in electrosynthesis over untreated carbon cloth cathodes was also achieved with polyaniline cathodes. However, not all strategies to provide positively charged surfaces were successful, as treatment of carbon cloth with melamine or ammonia gas did not stimulate acetate electrosynthesis. Treating carbon cloth with metal, in particular gold, palladium, or nickel nanoparticles, also promoted electrosynthesis, yielding electrosynthesis rates that were 6 -, 4. 7 - or 4. 5 -fold faster than the untreated control, respectively. Cathodes comprised of cotton or polyester fabric treated with carbon nanotubes yielded cathodes that supported acetate electrosynthesis rates that were [similar] 3 -fold higher than carbon <b>cloth</b> <b>controls.</b> Recovery of electrons consumed in acetate was [similar] 80 % for all materials. The results demonstrate that one approach to increase rates of carbon dioxide reduction in microbial electrosynthesis is to modify cathode surfaces to improve microbe-electrode interactions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The use {{of mobile}} devices within {{healthcare}} settings by staff, patients and visitors is widespread and growing. DoH guidance states that {{patients should be}} allowed the widest possible use of mobile phones. For staff mobile devices have become an essential aspect of their day-to-day professional and personal lives. There is, however, clear evidence that phones/tablets can be contaminated with pathogens, which may survive for prolonged periods before being transferred onto hands or other surfaces. This quantitative study evaluates {{the ability of a}} range of technologies to decontaminate iPads. Methods The front, back and sides of iPads were contaminated with a standard suspension of Staphylococcus aureus. Half of these surfaces were sampled to provide pre-values, whilst the other half was decontaminated with either alcohol wipes, detergent wipes, quaternary ammonium impregnated wipes, or exposure to Ultraviolet light for either 30 or 60 seconds. As a <b>control,</b> a microfibre <b>cloth</b> impregnated with sterile water was also tested. Results Alcohol based wipes were most effective, generating on average a 2 log reduction {{on the back of the}} iPad and a 3 log reduction on the front. The cleaning of the front surface of the iPad was consistently easier to clean that the back. However, all of the wipes were less effective than UV exposure, where a 60 second exposure generated a 4 log reduction on the front and a 3. 5 log reduction on the back. Discussion The results indicate that commercial wipes are unable to effectively decontaminate the high touch surfaces of an iPad. However, the application of a UV decontamination technology was a much more effective method for the removal of bacteria from these surfaces. This suggests that UV based decontamination technology would provide a quick, efficient and economical method for the disinfection of mobile devices such as iPads in healthcare settings...|$|R
5000|$|Third {{generation}} {{models were}} sold as the Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country. The Caravan and Voyager {{were available in}} either 3 or 4 door configurations on either a standard model or an extended wheelbase model known as the Grand Voyager and Grand Caravan, respectively. The Town & Country was only available in a long wheelbase configuration, with either 3 or 4 doors. Caravan trim levels were largely carried over from the previous generation, offered in Base, SE, and {{top of the line}} ES models, while a Sport package was available on short wheelbase SE models. Caravan ES models came with more options than before, featuring a standard Infinity sound system, a power driver's seat, dual-zone climate <b>control,</b> deluxe <b>cloth</b> seating (leather was optional) and alloy wheels, among other features. As part of Chrysler's new corporate strategy to better focus the Plymouth brand on entry-level vehicles, Voyagers and were only available in base trim and better-equipped SE models, although a high end LE trim which was largely a clone of the Caravan ES was available in Canada. A Rallye option package continued to be available on SE model, being the de facto top of the line Voyager. It was renamed [...] "Expresso" [...] for 1998. The Town & Country was now available in two different trims, the LX and LXi. On the Voyager and Caravan, the trims were easily distinguished by their body-side moldings. Base models used a narrow accent color strip and SE models used a wide accent color strip, with Voyager SEs with the Rallye package receiving [...] "Rallye" [...] badges on the front doors. Caravan ES and Voyager LEs used the base model's narrow accent color molding combined with a full accent color effect on the lower portion of the doors. The vinyl woodgrain-appearance side paneling was no longer available, as the new side sheetmetal was no longer flat. Early Plymouth Voyagers had a Pentastar front logo and rear badges using the same font as the Caravan, which was changed to Plymouth's new [...] "sailboat" [...] logo and script font on the badges by calendar year 1996. Voyagers and Caravans were only differentiated by their grilles, and some wheel options, while The Town & Country received plastic lower side cladding with chrome strips, unique wheels and a chrome waterfall grille with the Chrysler brand's new ribbon logo. Unique features for the Town & Country included as pre-programmed driver's seat and mirror, standard leather interior, 8-way power adjustable front seats, Infinity sound system with cassette/CD player. As with previous generations, the NS minivan was exported as the Chrysler Voyager, which was a Dodge Caravan modified to meet European safety and lighting standards, while for the 2000 model year it received the Plymouth Voyager's front fascia.In 1997, the Town & Country received standard dual sliding doors and a short wheelbase SX model (not available in Canada), and in 1998 it received a new front fascia, headlamps and wheels. Also in 1998, the Caravan SE dropped, replaced with a new [...] "Sport" [...] model that came with a completely color keyed body, rear spoiler and new wheels, and the Plymouth Voyager Rallye was renamed Expresso, while all models got grocery bag hooks installed on the rear seats. In 1999, the Caravan received standard dual sliding doors, as well as new front fascias, the ES model received revised trim, the [...] "AutoStick" [...] transmission and 17 inch wheels. With the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand, Voyagers produced late in the 2000 model year became Chrysler Voyagers, though they didn't receive any of the trim or options of the European export model.|$|R
