2500|$|It {{can be too}} {{difficult}} to withdraw from short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines because of {{the intensity of the}} rebound symptoms felt between doses. Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to use the correct equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, <b>clobazam,</b> clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, nordazepam, and prazepam. [...] Benzodiazepines with a half-life of less than 24 hours include alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, flunitrazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam. The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The reduction rate used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5mg dose of diazepam or 5mg dose of chlordiazepoxide.|$|E

50|$|As of 2005, <b>clobazam</b> is {{approved}} in Canada for add-on use in tonic-clonic, complex partial, and myoclonic seizures. <b>Clobazam</b> {{is approved}} for adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures {{certain types of}} status epilepticus, specifically the myoclonic, myoclonic-absent, simple partial, complex partial, and tonic varieties, and non-status absence seizures. It is also approved for treatment of anxiety.In India, <b>clobazam</b> is approved for use as an adjunctive therapy in epilepsy and in acute and chronic anxiety. In Japan, <b>clobazam</b> is approved for adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant epilepsy featuring complex partial seizures. In New Zealand, <b>clobazam</b> is marketed as Frisium In the United Kingdom <b>clobazam</b> (Frisium) is approved for short-term (2-4 weeks) relief of acute anxiety in patients who have not responded to other drugs, with or without insomnia and without uncontrolled clinical depression.

50|$|<b>Clobazam</b> has {{two major}} metabolites: N-desmethyl-clobazam and 4'-hydroxyclobazam, the former {{of which is}} active. The {{demethylation}} is facilitated by CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6 and the 4'-hydroxyclobazam by CYP2C18 and CYP2C19.|$|E
50|$|In a {{double-blind}} placebo-controlled trial {{published in}} 1990 {{comparing it to}} clonazepam, 10 mg of <b>clobazam</b> was shown to be less sedating than either 0.5 mg or 1 mg of clonazepam.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clobazam</b> as {{with other}} {{benzodiazepine}} drugs can lead to physical dependence, addiction and {{what is known as}} the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from <b>clobazam</b> or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken for, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.|$|E
