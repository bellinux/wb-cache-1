5|$|Diagnosis of {{endometrial cancer}} is made first by a {{physical}} examination and dilation and <b>curettage</b> (removal of endometrial tissue; D). This tissue is then examined histologically for characteristics of cancer. If cancer is found, medical imaging may {{be done to}} see whether the cancer has spread or invaded tissue.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and <b>curettage</b> or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for {{histological}} examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through <b>curettage,</b> shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more sensitive than ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.|$|E

25|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} staged by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, {{which is based}} on {{clinical}} examination, rather than surgical findings. It allows only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, colposcopy, endocervical <b>curettage,</b> hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical conization.|$|E

40|$|Senescence is {{characterized}} by a gradual loss of the stem cells activity and an atrophy of all cells and tissues which lead to the deterioration of the functional activity. The senescence processes manifest also in the female genital organs, producing different morphologic alterations. For the evidentiation of these aspects we retrospectively analyze 75 cases, from menopausal and postmenopausal women, investigating the histerectomy specimens, bioptic <b>curettages</b> and cervico-vaginal smears. The specimens were paraffin-embeded and routinely fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and the smears were stained using Papanicolau technique. Histologic and cytologic alterations in uterus, ovaries and vagina were observed. There were seen changes of the endometrial glands and stroma, cystic atrophy. Also, it was emphasized the arteriosclerosis of myometrial arteries, with medial hypertrophy. The microscopic aspect of the atrophic endometrium is different in histerectomy specimens than in bioptic <b>curettages.</b> The endometrial cystic atrophy must be differentiated from glandulo-cystic hyperplasia with retrograde atrophy. The cervical squamous epithelium is atrophic, with little or no intracytoplasmic glycogen, and the endocervical glands developed small clusters called endocervical tunnel clusters. These histologic features must not be diagnosed as invasive well differentiated endocervical adenocarcinoma. It has been noticed the absence of primordial and maturing ovarian follicles, the absence of the luteal body (corpus luteum) and atretic follicles and the persistence of corpora albicantia, especially in medulla. In ovarian stroma, different proliferation degrees of the cortical and medular stromal cells were seen, with occasional luteinised stromal cells and cortical cysts. The cervico-vaginal smears presented atrophic features. The described cyto-morphologic aspects are due to insufficient estrogenic stimulation, {{as a consequence of the}} lack of ovarian hormone productio...|$|R
25|$|For {{low-risk}} disease, {{radiation therapy}} (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy), topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and cryotherapy (freezing the cancer off) can provide adequate {{control of the}} disease; all of them, however, may have lower overall cure rates than certain type of surgery. Other modalities of treatment such as photodynamic therapy, topical chemotherapy, electrodesiccation and <b>curettage</b> {{can be found in}} the discussions of basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Routine {{treatment}} {{should include}} immobilization {{of the affected}} limb, application of ice, local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis.

None of these treatments have been subjected to randomized controlled trials to conclusively show benefit. In almost all cases, bites are self-limited and typically heal without any medical intervention.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} {{treatment}} {{is to remove}} plaque.

25|$|In {{almost all}} cases, recluse bites are self-limited and {{typically}} heal without any medical intervention. Recommendations {{to limit the}} extent of damage include elevation and immobilization of the affected limb, application of ice. Both local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis are simple standards. There is no established treatment for more extensive necrosis. Many therapies have been used including hyperbaric oxygen, dapsone, antihistamines (e.g., cyproheptadine), antibiotics, dextran, glucocorticoids, vasodilators, heparin, nitroglycerin, electric shock, <b>curettage,</b> surgical excision, and antivenom. None of these treatments conclusively show benefit. Studies have shown surgical intervention is ineffective and may worsen outcome. Excision may delay wound healing, cause abscesses, and lead to objectionable scarring.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} {{advanced}} oral ischaemic osteoporosis and/or ONJ {{that are not}} bisphosphonates related, clinical evidence has shown that surgically removing the damaged marrow, usually by <b>curettage</b> and decortication, will eliminate the problem (and the pain) in 74% of patients with jaw involvement. Repeat surgeries, usually smaller procedures than the first, may be required. Almost a third of jawbone patients will need surgery {{in one or more}} other parts of the jaws because the disease so frequently present multiple lesions, i.e., multiple sites in the same or similar bones, with normal marrow in between. In the hip, at least half of all patients will get the disease in the opposite hip over time; this pattern occurs in the jaws as well. Recently, it has been found that some osteonecrosis patients respond to anticoagulation therapies alone. The earlier the diagnosis the better the prognosis. Research is ongoing on other non-surgical therapeutic modalities that could alone or in combination with surgery further improve the prognosis and reduce the morbidity of ONJ. A greater emphasis on minimizing or correcting known causes is necessary while further research is conducted on chronic ischaemic bone diseases such as oral osteoporosis and ONJ.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 40% {{of cases}} {{are related to}} obesity. Endometrial cancer is also {{associated}} with excessive estrogen exposure, {{high blood pressure and}} diabetes. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination, as in most birth control pills, decreases the risk. Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents. Endometrial cancer is sometimes loosely referred to as [...] "uterine cancer", although it is distinct from other forms of uterine cancer such as cervical cancer, uterine sarcoma, and trophoblastic disease. The most frequent type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma, which accounts for more than 80% of cases. Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by endometrial biopsy or by taking samples during a procedure known as dilation and <b>curettage.</b> A pap smear is not typically sufficient to show endometrial cancer. Regular screening in those at normal risk is not called for.|$|E
30|$|Women with IUA {{seeking help}} from the gynecologists may present {{different}} clinical manifestations from menstrual disorder dysmenorrhoea to hypo-fertility. The presence of IUA can be suspected, taking into account relevant information from a thorough personal patient history aimed to identify previous gynaecological infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, iatrogenic correlated complications, obstetrical complications and history of pelvic tuberculosis. However, IUA is considered as a rare pathological entity and its prevalence {{is very difficult to}} estimate. It depends on the population under study. In countries where genital tuberculosis is more prevalent, AS or IUA are more frequent [9]. In populations where more <b>curettages</b> or abortions are performed, IUA or AS may be more frequent [15]. The incidence depends from the diagnostic modalities and scrutiny of investigations. While incidence seems to increase as a result of better awareness of the condition by the general physicians and gynaecologists, it is of importance to realise that the incidence of pregnancy interruptions has also increased despite intense efforts of effective family planning measures and contraception. In 13 % of women undergoing routine infertility investigations AS has been found [16].|$|R
40|$|SummaryPlacenta accreta is {{the major}} cause of {{maternal}} death complicated by massive peripartum hemorrhage. Its development is traditionally considered {{to be related to}} a decidual defect caused by previous cesarean deliveries or uterine <b>curettages.</b> Usually, placental villi firmly adhere to the superficial myometrium and deeply invade, or even penetrate, the uterine wall. Abnormal uteroplacental neovascularization is another characteristic. Therefore, we hypothesized that placenta accreta develops as a result of abnormal expressions of growth-, angiogenesis- and invasion-related factors in trophoblast populations. We have found, in pregnancies complicated by placenta accreta: upregulated epidermal growth factor receptor and downregulated c-erbB- 2 oncoprotein in syncytiotrophoblasts; downregulated vasculoendothelial growth factor receptor- 2 expression in syncytiotrophoblasts and increased vasculoendothelial growth factor in placental lysates; and downregulated Tie- 2 expression in syncytiotrophoblasts and enhanced angiopoietin- 2 level in placental lysates. However, matrix metalloproteinase expression was not upregulated, so the association of these invasion-related molecules with placenta accreta is less likely. Taken together, these findings imply that complex factors, either alone or in combination, might be responsible for the development of placenta accreta. Further studies are needed to understand the signaling pathways and possible genetic events...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Pattern {{recognition}} of various phases of normal endometrium and endometrial pathologies during hysteroscopy has many advantages. It {{would help to}} triage women with AUB, {{so as to be}} selective with biopsies and <b>curettages.</b> Recognition of normal variant or benign lesion would reduce burden to the pathologist by decreasing the number of unnecessary sampling. It will also decreases anxiety of the patient as the report/prognostication can be instant in many cases. Material and methods: This prospective, double blind, correlation study was carried out in the teaching hospital with a sample population of 70 women presenting with AUB who underwent hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling. We identified patterns of endometrium which can used to predict six endometrial pathologies which were later correlated with the final histological diagnosis. Results: There was good correlation between hysteroscopic patterns and histopathology report, 33 % of starry sky appearance correlated with atrophic endometrium, 87 % of tongue shaped projections correlated with endometrial polyp, 44. 4 % of pebble stone appearance correlated with myomatous polyp, 50 % of polypoidal pattern correlated with endometrial hyperplasia. 100 % correlation was seen in strawberry appearance, pattern for secretory endometrium and cerebroid appearance which was pattern designated to endometrial carcinoma. Conclusion: Hysteroscopic pattern recognition is a useful concept to triage women who require sampling for histopathological diagnosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In many countries, {{surgical}} uterine evacuation is {{the standard}} treatment for women with a miscarriage, but expectant management has been advocated as an alternative. The choice between the two options cannot be based on published evidence alone, because randomized clinical trials are scarce while generalizability of findings to patients with a strong preference for either management options is unclear. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, the complications and efficacy of either expectant or surgical management for miscarriages were compared, and the results in patients who refused randomization and were managed {{according to their own}} preference were studied. In total, 122 patients were randomized and 305 were managed according to their choice. RESULTS: No differences were found in the number of emergency <b>curettages</b> and complications between expectant and surgical management. Efficacy at 6 weeks was 30 / 64 (47 %) in women allocated to expectant management, and 55 / 58 (95 %) in women allocated to surgical evacuation. After 7 days, 37 % of expectantly managed women had a spontaneous complete miscarriage. After 6 weeks, intention-to-treat analysis including cross-overs showed similar effectiveness (92 % versus 100 %). Results in the preference groups were comparable with those in the randomized groups. CONCLUSION: In our experience a waiting period of 7 days after diagnosis may prevent 37 % of surgical procedure...|$|R
40|$|SummaryEvidence as {{to whether}} {{clinician}} has to give specific treatment in all patients of catamenial hemoptysis is unclear. We considered that the current treatment such as long-term usage of hormonal agent or surgery might be excessive for the catamenial hemoptysis. Therefore, we developed prospective observation study with observation strategy and follow-up for the patients. In sequential four patients of catamenial hemoptysis between December 2000 and November 2001, physical examination, chest X-ray, pelvic ultrasonogram and chest CT scan were taken at both the diagnosis and last follow-up. All patients were only observed without specific treatment within the limit of the possibility and followed for average 58 months. Mean age of patients was 23. 5 years (range, 22 – 25 years). All patients {{have a history of}} undertaking one or two dilatations and <b>curettages</b> before diagnosis. The chest CT scans of all patients presented with ground-glass opacities of peripheral location that were disappeared without any residual lesion at last follow-up. Hemoptysis of two patients was spontaneously disappeared after 6 months. In the other two patients, it was greatly lessened in amount and frequency, then clinically insignificant in one. It was disappeared after subsequent 2 months and then relapsed two times in the late of follow-up of another patient. This study suggests that observation only may be an alternative option in the treatment of catamenial hemoptysis...|$|R
40|$|Three hundred thirty-seven female {{patients}} with the diagnosis of human papillomavirus (HPV) cervitis were reviewed during the last decade. The study {{was focused on the}} relationship between human papillomavirus cervitis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and the risk of developing cervical cancer, in situ or micro-invasive. The examined material was cervical <b>curettages</b> and segmental biopsies, and vaginal smears (Pap-test). The results of the research showed that the typical human papillomavirus cervitis represents the 49. 3 % of the above cases, while the rest 50. 7 %, represents human papillomavirus-like cervitis (cervitis with absence of one or more histological criteria of human papillomavirus infection). The mean age of the female {{patients with}} HPV infection was 35 years, ranged between the ages of 24 and 44 years. A 36. 5 % percentage of cervical intraepithelial involvement was found (CIN) in HPV cervitis. The mean age of the females with HPV cervitis without CIN cervical involvement was 45 years. The histological type of HPV cervitis is of great importance; 37. 1 % of flat condylomas complicated with CIN lesions and 1. 78 % developed cervical cancer, in situ, or micro-invasive. On the contrary, the infrequently found condylomas accuminata (8. 4 %), don't usually show CIN involvement of cervix or involution to cervical cancer (0 %).
