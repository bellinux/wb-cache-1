5000|$|In {{business}} economics <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis {{is a method}} of cost analysis, which itemizes {{the cost of a}} certain product or service into its various components, the so-called cost drivers. The <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis is a popular cost reduction strategy and a viable opportunity for businesses. [...] "Cost breakdown analysis is the process to build and understand the elements that compose the cost of a product or service. This technique is also referred to as Clean Sheet Costing, Open Book Costing ...Tear down analysis, Price Breakdown Analysis or Supplier Cost Analysis" [...] The price of a product or service is defined as cost plus profit, whereas cost can be broken down further into direct cost and indirect cost. As a business has virtually no influence on indirect cost, a cost reduction oriented <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis focuses rather on factors contributing to direct cost. The most common factors among direct cost are labor, raw materials and subcontracting. These are aspects of a business, over which it has direct control and which, in turn, enables the business to identify ways to save expenditure by the proper application of a <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis. Businesses can also combine this strategy with a value chain analysis, which allows price forecasts and hence, quicker responses to changes in the market.|$|R

40|$|Due {{to special}} {{characteristics}} of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), the &# 8213;transaction cost&# 8214; in PPPs {{is more than}} other delivery methods. Although {{there have been some}} attempts to study transaction costs in PPPs in Europe, transaction costs of PPPs in the US has not been explored well, and the need to develop a standard <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> structure to track, measure and estimate transaction costs in PPP projects is paramount. This thesis covers a theoretical discussion about the definition of transaction costs and different factors affecting them, and based on the mapping of PPP transaction activities to project costs, presents a <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> structure (CBS) as well as a cost accounting matrix. This accounting model is justified in chapter four using two case studies: I- 495 HOT lanes project in Virginia, and I- 595 improvements in Florida.

50|$|The {{indicators}} {{that have been}} identified are allocated percentages and in a detailed <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis these indicators should add up closely to 100%. This process requires an in-depth analysis of the business's expenses.For simplicity's sake, these random percentages have been assigned to the six cost drivers of transportation this example entails. After this step, the cost drivers are being analyzed while the analyzing party (be it the business itself or an external agency) tries to examine possibilities to cut current expenses. The business might find 42% of total costs {{to be too much}} for motor fuel and might either want to look for an alternative supplier or change to more fuel efficient trucks. The <b>cost</b> <b>breakdown</b> analysis is even more effective when repeated constantly, so that changes in the respective shares in total costs of the various cost drivers can be tracked down. Over a five-year period, the share of expenses for tires might have risen from 5% to 8%, accompanied by a decrease of expenses for personnel from 35% to 32%, which featured the dismissal of workforce. The business might want to consider contracting a cheaper supplier of tires and reemploy its former employees.|$|R
