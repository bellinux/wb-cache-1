40|$|Composition {{can take}} place during {{different}} stages of component life cycle. We identify two main stages: design phase- components are composed into <b>composite</b> <b>components</b> for reuse; deployment phase- components are compiled and the resulting binaries are assembled into executable systems. Ideally, the design phase composition should maximise component reuse. However, this ideal is not realised in current component-based development {{because they can not}} reuse <b>composite</b> <b>components</b> in design phase. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for composing components in design phase using exogenous connectors. In contrast to existing composition approaches, our approach allows <b>composite</b> <b>components</b> built in design phase to be further reusable in both design and deployment phases so as to achieve both component reuse and design flexibility. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in an industrial-strength case study- Automatic Train Protection system, and compare them with the closely-related existing composition approaches. 1...|$|R

The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} current software systems is encouraging {{the development of}} self-organizing software systems, i. e. systems capable of reconfiguring their structure at runtime.

This approach identifies the common concerns {{that are necessary to}} support the autonomic reconfiguration and encapsulates them into aspects, avoiding tangled code. Thus, self-reconfigurable <b>composite</b> <b>components</b> are weaved with these aspects and benefit from: (1) easy maintenance, since the reconfiguration concern is separated from the other concerns; (2) autonomous reconfiguration, since it is provided with dynamic reconfiguration services to change its architecture.

The thesis model described in the SAE technical paper has been refined and expanded to analyze additional vehicles and natural-fiber reinforced composite materials. 3 This study examines the life cycle energy and emissions associated with substituting natural fibers, cellulose and kenaf, for glass fibers in plastic composites used for automotive components.

By analyzing the disadvantages of the passive material supply model, an active material delivery model is proposed. Subsequently, an improved work flow of material delivery is introduced in detail for optimizing the traditional material supply. Barcode technology is used to collect the data of material receiving and issuing in the warehouse. By scanning the barcode, material information and working personnel information can be collected and inputted into the system in real time. The function module of material delivery system is composed of material delivery management, inventory management, and production planning management. The integration relationship between the material delivery system and other systems is also described. Three-layer structure is adopted to design and develop the system. The material delivery system has been implemented in an aircraft <b>composite</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing workshop. The results show that material supply time and cost has been reduced.
