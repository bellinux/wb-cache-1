40|$|With {{the concept}} {{climate-smart}} agriculture (CSA) being relatively new, {{there is a}} need to test and develop practical and systematic methodologies and approaches for documenting and evaluating CSA practices in the field. The implementation of CCAFS’ Climate-Smart Villages (CSV) involves identifying, assessing and selecting <b>climate-smart</b> <b>farming</b> practices. This report contains three sections: (i) a framework for identifying and assessing CSA in the field with a long list of CSA indicators in identifying and monitoring CSA interventions; (ii) cost-benefit analysis of some selected <b>climate-smart</b> <b>farming</b> systems; and (iii) the participatory process of prioritizing CSA options with the villagers. The work builds on our experiences from the My Loi CSV and its scaling domains in Ky Anh district, Ha Tinh province, in the north-central region of Viet Nam. English version: [URL]...|$|E

During the visit, the East Africa team {{met up with}} farmers taking the lead on so-called <b>climate-smart</b> <b>farming</b> practices and techniques. The practices include better management of fruit trees, like Mango which is really big in the area, use of cover crops {{in the field and}} fertilizers, both organic and inorganic, drought-tolerant crops such as Serrado sorghum, green grams, beans, intercropping techniques with legumes and cereals, and water harvesting techniques such as road-water capture, and drip-irrigation and much more. The sites are learning sites for other farms around, to come and see how they too can adopt climate-appropriate farming practices to help them build resilience towards a changing climate. Photos: C.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} now an issue that demands urgent attention. The UN Global Goals for Sustainable Development and COP 21 Paris Agreement {{emphasize}} its importance. The agricultural sector will be hardest hit by climate change and the impact will be felt most by the smallholder farmers we serve in Africa and Asia. Unseasonal rains, increasing frequency of droughts and extreme weather events, crop failures and low crop yields often exacerbated by degraded ecosystems have resulted in household food shortages, malnutrition, high poverty levels and forced migration. These are issues {{we have had to}} address in our work of building <b>climate-smart</b> <b>farming</b> communities. The farming community in the dryland tropics is the most impacted by climate change and ICRISAT and its partners have responded to the clarion call of COP 21 by developing climatesmart approaches for the dryland tropics that we proudly highlight in our annual report for 2015 [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{share with}} you program updates on climate change, {{agriculture}} and food security matters based on our work and that of partners. As world leaders {{look forward to the}} September 2014 UN Climate Summit that is part of a global effort to mobilize action and ambition on climate change, 26 African countries are participating in a voluntary climate-smart agriculture (CSA) alliance for Africa. Read about the objectives of the alliance in our first article. Also, follow a report back from an official United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Subsidiary Bodies 40 (SB 40) side event by CCAFS and partners which explored Africa’s readiness to advance CSA. Loss and damage in African countries has left communities facing acute food security problems as current coping strategies are inadequate. Read more from a recent study by CCAFS, the African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Mozambique. From Ethiopia – CCAFS study sites - researchers have found that genetic erosion threatens resilience of the Ethiopian Boran cattle. Read on to review this problem and some of the recommendations under the science section. A separate article presents promising findings following on farm potato trials led by the International Potato Centre (CIP). This project will deliver better potato varieties for farmers in Northern Tanzania. Under field updates, find out how a <b>climate-smart</b> <b>farm</b> looks like - we profile farmers (including women) from the Nyando climate-smart villages.

40|$|Containing {{a wealth}} of {{up-to-date}} research and examples, this booklet highlights the ‘cause and effect’ relationship between agriculture and climate change. Crucially it observes that a range of practices – ‘climate-smart agriculture’ – could increase food production, help farmers to become more resilient to global warming and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Yet how widespread these practices become {{will depend on the}} importance given to agriculture in international climate change negotiations and national policy-making. The first chapter examines how farming contributes to human-generated greenhouse gas emissions, and observes the effects of global warming and its impact on agriculture and fisheries. Chapter 2 considers possible solutions: adaption and mitigation strategies that farmers and fishers may adopt. Examples include conservation agriculture, agroforestry and <b>climate-smart</b> livestock <b>farming.</b> Boosting the role of agriculture in climate change negotiations – by establishing a work programme and setting up pilot projects – is addressed in chapter 3, while chapter 4 briefly reflects on the financial implications of adapting to climate change in the agricultural sector...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores how Climate-resiliency Field Schools {{involving}} smallholder {{farmers in}} the Mindanao region of the Philippines advance <b>climate-smart</b> <b>farming</b> practices. Using data from field observations, 86 interviews, and 13 focus group discussions from five municipalities, the research finds that cross-scale activities, including local plans and multi-stakeholder forums, and municipal budgeting processes, influence adaptation and mitigation to climate change in smallholder farming systems. Furthermore, using matrix analysis and stakeholder responses, we identify interactions, synergies, conflicts, and potential co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation, and food production practices. The analysis of climate-resiliency field school practices shows that the addition of livelihood outcomes to smallholder farming landscapes strengthen adaptation, mitigation, and food production outcomes (and vice versa). Climate-resiliency Field Schools have promoted the practice of organic farming, various systems for rice intensification, {{and the establishment of}} community seed banks. Other practices, such as soil conservation, reforestation, and agroforestry, have been used in Mindanao to maintain carbon stocks while increasing crop production. Climate-resiliency Field Schools serve as a multilevel institutional platform where farmers can access climate information, which they can use to improve farm planning (i. e., choices of crops, timing of farm preparation, and harvest). The research findings suggest that climate-smart interventions are highly location-specific, technically rigorous, involve knowledge-intensive processes, and are influenced by the knowledge and capacities of local farming communities and implementing partners. We conclude with some suggestions for the design of programs, and the types of interventions that are required to sustain and ultimately scale up efforts to enhance climate-smart agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Faidherbia albida parklands cover a {{large area}} of the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Africa, a region that suffers from soil {{fertility}} decline, food insecurity and climate change. The parklands deliver multiple benefits, including fuelwood, soil nutrient replenishment, moisture conservation, and improved crop yield underneath the canopy. Its microclimate modification may provide an affordable climate adaptation strategy which needs to be explored. We carried out an on-farm experiment for three consecutive seasons in the Ethiopian Central Rift Valley with treatments of Faidherbia trees with bare soil underneath, wheat grown beneath Faidherbia and wheat grown in open fields. We tested the sensitivity of wheat yield to tree-mediated variables of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature and soil nitrogen, using APSIM-wheat model. Results showed that soil moisture in the sub-soil was the least for wheat with tree, intermediate for sole tree and the highest for open field. Presence of trees resulted in 35 – 55 % larger available N close to tree crowns compared with sole wheat. Trees significantly reduced PAR reaching the canopy of wheat growing underneath to optimum levels. Midday air temperature was about 6 °C less under the trees than in the open fields. LAI, number of grains spike− 1, plant height, total aboveground biomass and wheat grain yield were all significantly higher (P < 0. 001) for wheat associated with F. albida compared with sole wheat. Model-based sensitivity analysis showed that under moderate to high rates of N, wheat yield responded positively to a decrease in temperature caused by F. albida shade. Thus, F. albida trees increase soil mineral N, wheat water use efficiency and reduce heat stress, increasing yield significantly. With heat and moisture stress {{likely to be more}} prevalent in the face of climate change, F. albida, with its impact on microclimate modification, maybe a starting point to design more resilient and <b>climate-smart</b> <b>farming</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Data {{collection}} for the Village Baseline Study for the Ekxang Climate-Smart Village located in Phonhong District, Vientiane Province, Lao PDR, {{took place on}} November 19 th - 21 st, 2014. Three days of focus group discussions were conducted separately for men and women. Participatory methods were used to gather information on community resources, organizational landscapes, information networks, and the community’s vision for the future. Men and women in Ekxang village had different point of views on their community’s resources. Women were focused more on the conservation and increased forest land as {{they are responsible for}} collecting the Non-Timber Forest Product. Men were more interested in the development of agro-forestry. Regarding agriculture, men were focused on rice paddies while the women were more focused on the smaller household vegetable gardens. There were several changes in community resources. Forest and pasture areas were significantly degraded due to urban development, increasing people demands, and expansion of agricultural lands since 1980 s. Infrastructures for irrigation were improved 30 years ago to expand the irrigated area but only few households in Ekxang could benefit from it. Villagers experience that soil fertility has declined compared to 25 years ago. There were a number of organizations operating at the village, half of them related to food security, food crisis and natural resource management. However, linkages is not strong the organizations. Farmer-to-farmer, mobile phone and television are main sources of information that support farmers in their decision making. There is a high potential to develop ICT-based technologies in order to support <b>climate-smart</b> <b>farming</b> practices to farmers. From the farmers’ perspective, their Climate-Smart Village should be an agroforestry landscape with smart groundwater use, smart pest management and crop diversification, and smart information services...|$|E
40|$|Pursuing <b>climate-smart</b> {{solutions}} at <b>farms</b> can {{be thought}} of as being part of strategic farm management in the context of sustainability and adapting to the future. When preparing for climate change, not only the environmental dimensions matter but all aspects of sustainability (ecological, economic, social and cultural) should be considered in tailoring climate-smart solutions for one’s own farm. Knowledge sharing, co-operation and long-term strategic thinking skills can support developing more sustainable and resilient agriculture and help farmers find and develop their own optimal climate-smart solutions that fit their development targets and pathways. Also many common practices of organic agriculture such as nutrient cycling and biological nitrogen fixation can help develop climate-smart agriculture...|$|R
40|$|The world {{population}} {{is likely to}} exceed 10 billion by 2050, thereby increasing food, feed and fuel production demand. On the other hand, global climate change (drought, heat, salinity, elevated CO 2 and extreme cold) hostile the global agricultural productions. The changes in climatic factors perhaps influence the crop distribution, affect the crop growth and yield, and increase the risks of farming and human health consequences in developing countries. Crop breeding {{is one of the}} approaches to fight environmental challenges in agriculture. Available literatures imply that genotypes of different crop species are expressing greater phenotypic variability to tolerate abiotic stresses by inherent constitutional. Hence, there is an opportunity for utilizing the existing variability in abiotic stress tolerance traits. The gene sources for abiotic tolerance are available in germplasm collection, landraces, or wild relatives, if not, with less frequency it can be created as transgenes, so moclones or mutants. However, to make significant advancement in abiotic stress breeding requires accurate and reproducible phenotyping under well-imposed stress environment. The targeted trait for abiotic stress tolerance should have high positive correlation with yield attributes and be amenable for scoring in given environment. The traits introgressed for abiotic stress tolerance vary with stress scenario, timing and intensity of stress encountered by the crop species. Most of the traits that confer abiotic stress tolerance are quantitative in nature. The conventional crop improvement strategy followed to transfer abiotic stress tolerance is by recurrent selection and backcross breeding, which delivered limited success. The recent advancement through rapid and high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping have given much hope for tailoring desirable traits to evolve climate-resilient cultivars. The gene pyramiding strategy is useful to accumulate desirable abiotic tolerant traits into a commercially preferred cultivar. Further, transgenic and double haploid approaches will help in accelerating the trait pyramiding strategy. The climate-resilient cultivars with <b>climate-smart</b> <b>farming</b> will offer sustainable and cost-effective solution to the changing agro-climatic situations...|$|E
