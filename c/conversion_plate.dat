40|$|Luminescent {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in white LEDs to convert part of the blue LED light into light with a longer wavelength, resulting in white light when both colors are well mixed. One way to integrate the luminescent material in the LED package is to deposit a thin luminescent layer on a planar carrier or disperse luminescent particles in the carrier material and then position the resulting wavelength <b>conversion</b> <b>plate</b> above one or more LEDs. It {{is very important that}} these wavelength conversion plates have the right properties to ensure homogeneous white light with a high efficiency and desired correlated color temperature (CCT). Key properties are the absorption and emission spectrum and the scattering and absorption coefficients. These properties strongly influence the color of the resulting light, but also the efficiency and the angular uniformity. This work describes an extensive study of the effect of the scattering and absorption coefficients in terms of the desired CCT. A computationally efficient extended Adding-Doubling method is used for the simulation of the light distribution and conversion in the planar wavelength conversion element. Ultimately an optimal combination with a high efficiency and low angular color deviation is desired. Different systems are investigated and optimal coefficients are found. With these findings a more targeted approach can be used in the manufacturing of wavelength conversion plates for white LEDs.

Strain UP- 2 appears to be highly specialized for growth on crude oil in sea water since it showed strong preference for oil or oil degradation products as substrates for growth, converted 66 % of the oil into a form no longer extractable by organic solvents, quantitatively degraded the paraffinic fraction (gas chromatographic analysis), emulsified the oil during exponential growth, and produced 1. 6 × 108 cells per mg of oil.

It provides a voxel size of 82 μm. In addition to providing the usual microarchitecture parameters, local topological analysis (LTA) depicting rod- and plate-like trabeculae may improve prediction of bone fragility. Thirty-three women with prevalent wrist fractures from the OFELY cohort were compared with age-matched controls. Bone microarchitecture, including the structural model index (SMI), was assessed by HR-pQCT, and micro-finite element analysis (μFE) was computed on trabecular bone images of the distal radius (XtremeCT, Scanco Medical AG). A new LTA method was applied to label each bone voxel as a rod, plate or node. Then the bone volume fraction (BV/TV*), the rod, plate and node ratios over bone volume (RV/BV*, PV/BV*, NV/BV*) or total volume (RV/TV*, PV/TV*, NV/TV*) and the rod to plate ratio (RV/PV*) were calculated. Associations between LTA parameters and wrist fractures were computed in a conditional logistic regression model. Multivariate models were tested to predict the μFE-derived trabecular bone stiffness. RV/TV* (OR= 4. 41 [1. 05 - 18. 62]) and BV/TV* (OR= 6. 45 [1. 06 - 39. 3]), were significantly associated with prevalent wrist fracture, after adjustment for ultra distal radius aBMD. Multivariate linear models including PV/TV* or BV/TV*+RV/PV* predicted trabecular stiffness with the same magnitude as those including SMI. <b>Conversion</b> from <b>plates</b> into rods was significantly associated with bone fragility, with a negative correlation between RV/PV* and trabecular bone stiffness (r=- 0. 63, p< 0. 0001).

40|$|We {{devised a}} new method for {{examining}} the structural {{changes that occur}} in trabecular bone in aging and in osteoporosis. With simultaneous measurement of total perimeter and bone area in thin sections, indirect indices of mean trabecular plate thickness (MTPT) and mean trabecular plate density (MTPD) can be derived, such that trabecular bone volume = MTPD X MTPT. MTPD is an index of {{the probability that a}} scanning or test line will intersect a structural element of bone, and is the reciprocal of the mean distance between the midpoints of structural elements, multiplied by pi/ 2. We applied this method to iliac bone samples from 78 normal subjects, 100 patients with vertebral fracture, and 50 patients with hip fracture. The reduction in trabecular bone volume observed in normal subjects with increasing age was mainly due to a reduction in plate density, with no significant decrease in plate thickness. The further reduction in trabecular bone volume observed in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture was mainly due to a further reduction in plate density. There was a relatively smaller reduction in plate thickness that was statistically significant in males but not in females. Only in patients with hip fracture did trabecular thinning contribute substantially to the additional loss of trabecular bone in osteoporosis relative to age. These data indicate that age-related bone loss occurs principally by a process that removes entire structural elements of bone; those that remain are more widely separated and some may undergo compensatory thickening, but most slowly become reduced in thickness. We propose that the process of removal is initiated by increased depth of osteoclastic resorption cavities which leads to focal perforation of trabecular plates; this is followed by progressive enlargement of the perforations with <b>conversion</b> of <b>plates</b> to rods. The resulting structural changes are more severe in osteoporotic patients than in normal subjects, but have been completed in most patients before they develop symptoms...|$|R

We present a case of open fracture of the forearm due to horse bite. Case Report: A 35 -year-old male farm-worker presented {{to the emergency room}} with alleged history of horse bite to the right forearm about 2 hours prior to presentation while feeding the horse. There was deformity of the forearm with multiple puncture wounds, deep abrasions and small lacerations on the distal-third of the forearm. Copious irrigation with normal saline was done and he was administered anti-tetanus and post-exposure rabies prophylaxis. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was commenced. Radiographs revealed fracture of radius and ulna in the mid-shaft region. He underwent emergency wound debridement, and the ulna was stabilised with an intra-medullary square nail. Seventy-two hours later, he underwent re-debridement and conversion osteosynthesis. He had an uneventful recovery and at three-month follow-up, the fractures had healed radiographically in anatomic alignment. At two-year follow-up, he is doing well, is pain free and has a normal range of motion compared to the contralateral side.

40|$|Osteoporosis is a multifactorial {{disorder}} of bone mineral homeostasis affecting the elderly. It {{is a major}} public health issue with significant socioeconomic consequences. Recent findings suggest that bone loss—the key manifestation of the disease—is accompanied by architectural deteriora-tion, both affecting the bone’s mechanical competence and susceptibility to fracture. This article reviews the potential of quantitative micro MRI (-MRI), including {{a discussion of the}} technical requirements for image acquisition, pro-cessing, and analysis for assessing the architectural impli-cations of osteoporosis and as a means to monitor the response to treatment. With current technology, the reso-lution achievable in clinically acceptable scan times and necessary signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is comparable to tra-becular thickness. This limited spatial resolution regime demands processing and analysis algorithms designed to operate under such limiting conditions. It is shown that three different classes of structural parameters can be dis-tinguished, characterizing scale, topology, and orientation. There is considerable evidence that osteoporotic bone loss affects all three classes but that topological changes, re-sulting from <b>conversion</b> of trabecular <b>plates</b> to rods, with the latter’s eventual disconnection, are particularly prom-inent.

Microcontact printing ([mu]CP), a particular form of soft lithography, scales the rubber stamp concept down to the micron range. Past work has demonstrated sub-nanometer resolutions attainable with [mu]CP.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} questions in developmental biology is how neurons are specified, acquire their distinct characteristics and find their correct innervations to form functional circuits. The development of different subsets of neurons involves the expression of a program intrinsic to each cell type and the response to extrinsic environmental influences represented by soluble factors. Breakthroughs in the understanding of the genetic programs that controls the specification of ventral cell fates in the spinal cord and hindbrain, have provided useful tools for the study of similar genetic networks in the more complex rostral regions of the central nervous system, such as the mesencephalon (also called midbrain). Midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons are born in the ventral midline of the midbrain and regulate important functions in the brain, including motor control, cognition, emotions and learning. The degeneration of mDA neurons is the major hallmark of Parkinson s disease (PD). The lack of knowledge regarding the factors involving in the early specification of mDA neurons {{has been one of the}} obstacles in applying embryonic stem cell (ESC) -based replacement therapy for PD. In paper I, we showed that Lmx 1 a and Msx 1 / 2 are two key components in the development of mDA neurons. Lmx 1 a is necessary and sufficient for the acquisition of the proper mDA fate by activating the expression of downstream mDA neuron markers, while Msx 1 / 2 synergizes with Lmx 1 a by suppressing alternative cell fates and promoting the progression of neurogenesis. Furthermore, we applied this knowledge to ESCs and showed that forced expression of Lmx 1 a could efficiently induce bona fide mDA neurons. In paper II, we continued to evaluate the role of Lmx 1 a in the mouse and compared the function of Lmx 1 a with its close homolog Lmx 1 b during mDA development. Surprisingly, loss of Lmx 1 a resulted in a moderate reduction of mDA neurons, which was partly due to the delayed <b>conversion</b> of floor <b>plate</b> into a neurogenic region at an early stage. Lmx 1 b could compensate to large extent for the loss of Lmx 1 a in mDA neuron generation as the compound genotype of the Lmx 1 genes displayed a dose-dependent effect. Importantly, we showed that Lmx 1 a and Lmx 1 b have distinct roles in specifying two subgroups, i. e. medial and lateral mDA neurons. In addition, we revealed the function of Lmx 1 b in patterning other ventral cell types, i. e. oculomotor (OM) neurons and red nucleus (RN) cells. Loss of Lmx 1 b caused a dramatic reduction of OM neurons. By contrast, RN cells were born prematurely and were overproduced. Our current findings establish that Lmx 1 b influences the differentiation of multiple neuronal subtypes in the ventral midbrain, while the activity of Lmx 1 a in the ventral midbrain appears devoted to the differentiation of mDA neurons...|$|R

Moreover, current knowledge on substances available to preserve bone growth during chemotherapy of childhood malignancies is limited. Previous animal studies have shown the short-term damaging effects of MTX on bone, and revealed that short-term MTX treatment in young rats can cause growth plate structural damages via suppression of chondrocyte proliferation and induction of chondrocyte apoptosis, which lead to metaphyseal bone loss. However, the underlying mechanisms for the structural and cellular damages remain unknown, particularly in the chronic treatment setting. Therefore, this PhD study, using chronic rat chemotherapy models, firstly aimed to compare and examine the damaging effects of low-dose vs. high-dose MTX on the skeleton and marrow progenitor cells of young rats. This was followed by mechanistic studies using immunostaining and real time RT-PCR with specimens from a chronic high-dose MTX chemotherapy trial, to identify underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms for MTX-induced growth plate and metaphyseal damages. In addition, this study also focused on the potential protective effects of supplementary anti-dote folinic acid (FA) against chronic MTX-induced skeletal damages. This study revealed chronic low-dose MTX treatment resulted in no damaging effects in the growth plate and nor significant suppression in primary spongiosa heights at the metaphysis. However, both short-term and chronic high-dose MTX treatment caused severe growth plate and metaphyseal damages. These results suggest MTXinduced skeletal toxicity in growing long bones is dose-dependent. Mechanistic studies using a chronic high-dose MTX chemotherapy model revealed that chronic MTX chemotherapy can result in severe structural and cellular damages at the growth plate. MTX was able to induce chondrocyte apoptosis, which was confirmed by real time RT-PCR analysis showing up-regulation of the apoptotic molecules. In addition, more cartilage resorptive cells “chondroclasts” were found along the cartilage-bone transitional zone after MTX treatment, which could affect the <b>conversion</b> of growth <b>plate</b> cartilage template into bone. In the metaphysis, MTX significantly reduced bone volume by inducing osteoblast apoptosis, adipocyte and osteoclast formation. However, molecular analysis within bone samples revealed no significant changes for molecules involved in bone cell differentiation, suggesting possible recovery of progenitors/ precursors after intense induction phase. However, some cytokines were found upregulated in blood plasma of treated rats. Finally, supplementary treatment with FA was able to reverse MTX-induced cellular damages at both the growth plate and metaphysis, suggesting FA supplementary treatment may be promising for reducing bone toxicity in young patients during chronic MTX chemotherapy.
