For surface roughness characteristics, five different surface roughness parameters (<b>centre</b> <b>line</b> <b>average</b> roughness: Ra, root mean square: Rq, skewness: Rsk, kurtosis: Rku and mean line peak spacing: Rsm) are considered. Three process parameters viz. gas pressure, arc current and torch height are considered. The experimental plan is based on Taguchi L 27 orthogonal array (OA). To convert the multi-responses problem to a single response optimization problem, WPCA is applied to compute a multi-response performance index (MPI) and then MPI has been optimized using Taguchi method. The optimum combination of process parameters has been found for maximum MRR and minimum surface roughness and verified through a confirmation test. Also, ANOVA is carried out and it is seen that the gas pressure is the most significant factor followed by arc current...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} multiple roughness characteristics of Ni-P-W coatings on a mild steel substrate. The different roughness parameters considered are <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> <b>average</b> roughness (Ra), {{root mean square roughness}} (Rq), skewness (Rsk), kurtosis (Rku) and mean line peak spacing (Rsm).

Experiments are carried out based on the L 27 Taguchi orthogonal designusing the combination of three process parameters, namely, concentration of tungsten ion, concentration of reducing agent and concentration of nickel source. It is observed that concentration of tungsten ion has the most significant influence in controlling roughness characteristics of Ni-P-W coating.

40|$|Mechanisms of {{lubrication}} {{of human}} synovial joints have been analysed {{in terms of}} the operating conditions of the joint, the synovial fluid and articular cartilage. In the hip and knee during a walking cycle the load may rise up to four times body weight. In the knee on dropping one metre the load may go up to 25 time body weight. The elastic modulus of cartilage {{is similar to that of}} the synthetic rubber of a car tyre. The cartilage surface is rough and in elderly specimens the <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> <b>average</b> is 2 - 75 mum. The friction force generated in reciprocating tests shows that both cartilage and synovial fluid are important in lubrication. The viscosity-shear rate relationships of normal synovial fluid show that it is non-Newtonian. Osteoarthrosic fluid is less so and rheumatoid fluid is more nearly Newtonian. Experiments with hip joints in a pendulum machine show that fluid film lubrication obtains at some phases of joint action. Boundary lubrication prevails under certain conditions and has been examined with a reciprocating friction machine. Digestion of hyaluronate does not alter the boundary lubrication, but trypsin digestion does. Surface active substances (lauryl sulphate and cetyl 3 -ammonium bromide) give a lubricating ability similar to that of synovial fluid. The effectiveness of the two substances varies with pH...|$|R
40|$|Stacks, each {{consisting}} {{of a large number}} of thin layers of the same material, were compressed under loads of up to 5 x lo 3 lbf. Within experimental error, the compression c per stack layer is independent of the number of layers but varies as a power m of the layer thickness: m equals 0. 48 for freshly assembled stacks of flat brass discs. Changes of c upon increasing the applied load W from 5 X loa to lo 3 lbf are of the order of the <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> <b>average</b> values of the surfaces in contaa. For loads greater than 8 x loa lbf the effective moduli exceed lo 5 lbf in-', increase with W and load cycling, and are within two orders of magnitude of the bulk elastic moduli. Considerable hysteresis occurs in the first load-unload cycle, but further irreversibility rapidly decreases in subsequent cycles provided W is never reduced below 50 lbf. The W-c curves for freshly assembled stacks of flat layers are approximately exponential: changes in slope of the graph of log W against c suggest that asperity deformation processes predominate at high loads (> 5. 5 x loa lbf) and layer flattening at low loads (< 2. 5 x loa lbf).

This paper investigates the effect of process parameters on material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness characteristic (<b>centre</b> <b>line</b> <b>average</b> roughness: Ra, root mean square roughness: Rq, skewness: Rsk, kurtosis: Rku and mean line peak spacing: Rsm) and parametric optimization of process parameters in ECM of EN 31 tool steel using grey relation analysis.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed to get the contribution of each parameter on the performance characteristics and it is observed that electrolyte concentration is the significant process parameter that affects the responses. The experimental results for the optimal setting show that there is considerable improvement about 48 % in the process using confirmation test. The optimal combination is electrolyte concentration 10 %, voltage 10 V, feed rate 0. 25 mm/min and inter-electrode gap 0. 2 mm for maximum MRR and minimum surface roughness. Surface and contour plots are generated to study the effect of input parameters on MRR and surface roughness.

40|$|A {{collaborative}} research project {{was set up}} to study peripheral diamond wheel machining damage in silicon nitride ceramics. The objective of the work to be carried out at the University of Surrey was to study the nature and depth of machining damage in 3 point flexural rupture test bars made from 5 wt% Y 2 O 3 sintered hot isostatically pressed silicon nitride. The bars were machined to three surface finishes. The work carried out at Rolls-Royce by Mr R Quinn concentrated on the effects the machining damage had on the fracture strengths of the test bars. Work at the University of Surrey has identified in detail the nature and depth of machining damage in "coarse" 0. 4 mum <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> <b>average</b> roughness surfaces. Deep grooves up to 2 mum depth, 18 mum width are found to have been superimposed on the general surface roughness by singularly large diamonds in the 350 grit diamond wheel. Sub-surface median cracks normal to the machining direction were clearly identified in bar cross-sections using oblique, diffuse "penumbra" illumination in an optical microscope, an as yet undocumented technique. Cross-section views of the machined surface and sub-surface were made possible by the very difficult and delicate technique of producing sandwich cross-sections of the machined bars. An analysis of machining-induced median cracks has not been carried out in such detail before. Semi-elliptical in shape the median cracks extend from 6 mum - 45 mum below the machined surface, and range from 19 mum to 101 mum in length parallel to the machining direction. They initiate at the focal point of a tributary system of microcracks at an average depth of 4 mum - 5 mum below the machined surface. It is believed that the median cracks initiate at the plastic/elastic boundary of a plastically deformed surface layer. Therefore a residual compressive layer, formed by the overlap of localised residual stresses from multi-particle contact events. and bound by an underlying tensile field, is thought to have an average depth of 4 mum - 5 mum. A very innovative technique was used to reveal sub-surface deformation, where TEM X-ray microdiffraction spots were distorted by mechanical damage in the ceramic grain structure. The "arcing" or "streaking" of the diffraction spots tended to disappear at a depth of 4 mum - 5 mum below the machined surface. This is further evidence of the existence of a thin layer in residual compression, which has an average depth of 4 mum - 5 mum. This technique is not known to have been used before. Fine diamond machining with a 600 grit wheel produced a <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> <b>average</b> roughness of 0. 01 / 0. 02 mum. However, evidence of machining damage is still present in the form of "remnant tracks" which lie parallel to the machining direction and consist of material pull-out. They are remnants of machining damage under grinding grooves introduced in previous machining stages. Single point Vickers pyramid diamond scratches were implemented at different loads on a polished surface. The morphology of the grooves and material fragmentation and the sub-surface median cracks were examined. Many features were found to resemble the deformation/fracture formed under a deep grinding groove in the coarse machined surface. Work carried out at Rolls-Royce by R Quinn showed that an increase in the quality of surface finish is accompanied by an increase in the mean strength and Weibull modulus of the machined bars. Furthermore a distinct anisotropy in the fracture strengths parallel and normal to the "coarse" machining direction is evidence of anisotropy in machining damage formed by a peripheral diamond grinding wheel. X-ray diffraction tests carried out at the CEGB by P E J Flewitt showed that machining damage produces a long range biaxial residual compressive field with the highest component acting normal to the machining direction. These results are consistent with the nature of machining damage identified at the University of Surrey, namely the strength-controlling median cracks which lie parallel to the machining direction and the residual compressive stress which exists as a thin 4 mum - 5 mum layer below the machined surface. Processing flaws were discovered in the as-hipped billets received for the project. Their elemental composition and likely origin were examined. A three dimensional "cellular network" flaw ranging from 400 mum to 2. 1 mm in size (in different production batches) {{is believed to have been}} formed as a result of flocculation clustering during processing. Clusters of 1 mum - 3 mum metallic particles were also identified. They range from 5 mum - 45 mum in size. The contaminant particles are steel and were introduced as a result of the original ceramic powder ball milling process which employed a steel ball mill...|$|R

The paper observes a significant decline of heights in the 1870 s, followed by only modest recovery during the next three decades. Both are related to a sequence of disasters. <b>Average</b> <b>heights</b> increased from the 1900 s, accelerating after World War II. The Japanese occupation and war of independence in the 1940 s were a set-back. <b>Average</b> <b>height</b> growth is related to improvements in food supply and the disease environment, particularly hygiene and medical care. GDP per capita and <b>average</b> <b>height</b> followed each other in broad terms, but the correlation is far from perfect. The paper offers several hypotheses to explain this fact. ...|$|R
