50|$|Following the Internationalization of the renminbi and the {{inclusion}} of the Renminbi in the Special drawing rights, there has been debates to peg the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi, instead of the United States dollar. Studies shows that, if the Hong Kong dollar were to be re-pegged to the Renminbi, it would need over 2 trillion Renminbi worth of assets to replace the HKMA’s US$340 billion in foreign reserves as of 2015, which exceeds the amount of existing Renminbi assets in Hong Kong’s offshore market. Moreover, according to figures from the HKMA as of the end of 2014, Renminbi deposits and <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposits</b> stood at 1.158 trillion Renminbi, while outstanding Renminbi bonds amounted to 381 billion and Renminbi-denominated loans stood at 188 billion. Other studies shows, while the Hong Kong's financial and economic links are increasingly dominated by mainland China, and previous concerns about the openness of China's capital account are slowly receding, if China continues to open its capital account, the peg could shift from United States dollar to renminbi.|$|E

50|$|Reforms {{made in the}} Indian Money Market are:-Deregulation of the Interest Rate : In recent {{period the}} {{government}} has adopted an interest rate policy of liberal nature. It lifted the ceiling rates of the call money market, short-term deposits, bills rediscounting, etc. Commercial banks are advised to see the interest rate change that takes place within the limit. There was a further deregulation of interest rates during the economic reforms. Currently interest rates {{are determined by the}} working of market forces except for a few regulations.Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMFs) : In order to provide additional short-term investment revenue, the RBI encouraged and established the Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs) in April 1992. MMMFs are allowed to sell units to corporate and individuals. The upper limit of 50 crore investments has also been lifted. Financial institutions such as the IDBI and the UTI have set up such funds.Establishment of the DFI : The Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) was set up in April 1988 to impart liquidity in the money market. It was set up jointly by the RBI, Public sector Banks and Financial Institutions. DFHI has {{played an important role in}} stabilizing the Indian money market.Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) : Through the LAF, the RBI remains in the money market on a continue basis through the repo transaction. LAF adjusts liquidity in the market through absorption and or injection of financial resources.Electronic Transactions : In order to impart transparency and efficiency in the money market transaction the electronic dealing system has been started. It covers all deals in the money market. Similarly it is useful for the RBI to watchdog the money market.Establishment of the CCIL : The Clearing Corporation of India limited (CCIL) was set up in April 2001. The CCIL clears all transactions in government securities, and repurchase agreements (repos) reported on the Negotiated Dealing System.Development of New Market Instruments : The government has consistently tried to introduce new short-term investment instruments. Examples: Treasury Bills of various duration, Commercial papers, <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deposits,</b> MMMFs, etc. have been introduced in the Indian Money Market.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the transmission mechanism of different shocks we need to know whether the supply of CDs (<b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposits)</b> available to any bank is perfectly elastic at the current rate, i. e. whether a bank can issue as many CDs as it wants without paying any premium. In this paper we use data on the French CDs market in order to study the sensibility of the CD's rate to the amount issued. We use data on the CDs issued by 400 banks during 38 months. The estimation of the elasticity of the CD's rate to the amount issued is then based on Panel data. It has {{to take into account the}} endogeneity of the regressor and possible selection biases (some banks do not issue CDs every month). So the model is estimated in first differences by using instrumental variables and GMM (generalized method of moments). The estimation reveals a significant elasticity of the rate to the issued amount, but this elasticity is economically relatively weak. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} reform process has given banks in India {{a great deal}} of freedom on both the assets and liabilities (or sources and uses of funds) sides of their balance sheets. To the extent that, financial liberalization has opened up new non-reservable and non-insured sources of funds (like <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deposits</b> and new issue of equity), any attempts by the central bank to influence bank lending by withdrawing reserves (leading to a fall in deposits) from the banking system could be countered by raising money from these alternate sources leaving bank lending unchanged. It is in this liberalized regime that the ’bank lending channel’, which emphasizes the presence of asymmetric information in the financial markets, becomes particularly relevant. In this article we attempt to verify if bank lending is constrained by the availability of insured deposits and whether there exist subgroups of banks that are less constrained. We find that banks in general are constrained in their lending by the availability of insured deposits and these constraints are more severe for those banks that lend predominantly against collateral. In India more than 85 per cent of bank lending is against collateral. This implies a potentially important influence of the bank lending channel...|$|E
30|$|In {{seasonal}} adjustment a time series is {{considered as a}} juxtaposition of several components, the trend-cycle, and the seasonal and irregular components. The Bureau of the Census X- 11 method, based on moving averages, correction of large errors and trading day adjustments, has long dominated. With the success of ARIMA modelling {{at the end of}} the 20 th century, methods with better outlier detection and trading day corrections by regression with ARIMA errors have appeared, with the regARIMA module of Census X- 12 -ARIMA or Bank of Spain TRAMO-SEATS. SEATS consists of extracting the components by an ARIMA-model-based unobserved components approach. This means that models are used for each component such that the sum of the components is compatible with the ARIMA model for the corrected time series. The underlying theory of the SEATS program is studied in many papers but there is no complete and systematic description of its output. Our purpose is to examine SEATS text output and to explain the results in simple words and formulas. This is done on a simple example, a time series with a non-seasonal model so that the computations can be verified step by step. The principles behind SEATS are first described, including the admissible decompositions and the canonical decomposition, and the derivation of the Wiener-Kolmogorov filter. Then the example is introduced: the interest rates of US <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposits.</b> The text output from SEATS is presented in edited form in several tables. Finally, the main results are checked on the example by means of a Microsoft Excel workbook and direct computations. In particular, the forecasts and backcasts are obtained; the admissible and canonical decompositions with two components are discussed; the filters are first derived using autocorrelations of two auxiliary ARMA processes, then applied on the prolonged time series; and the characteristics of the estimates, the revisions and the growth rates are analyzed.|$|E
