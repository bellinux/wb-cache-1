According to historian Heather Sutherland, this low circulation {{was rooted in}} several <b>cultural</b> <b>factors.</b> Firstly, the native populace at the time had limited literacy and education. Secondly, native intellectuals mainly spoke Dutch during formal discourse, while others kept to local languages; this led to comprehension issues for the Indonesian-language Poedjangga Baroe.|$|E
5|$|The major {{differences}} in life expectancy for women between {{developed and developing}} countries lie in the childbearing years. If a woman survives this period, {{the differences between the}} two regions become less marked, since in later life non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become the major causes of death in women throughout the world, with cardiovascular deaths accounting for 45% of deaths in older women, followed by cancer (15%) and lung disease (10%). These create additional burdens on the resources of developing countries. Changing lifestyles, including diet, physical activity and <b>cultural</b> <b>factors</b> that favour larger body size in women, are contributing to an increasing problem with obesity and diabetes amongst women in these countries and increasing the risks of cardiovascular disease and other NCDs.|$|E
5|$|Progressive rock {{came to be}} {{appreciated}} overseas, but it mostly remained a European, and especially British, phenomenon. Few American bands engaged in it, and the purest representatives of the genre, such as Starcastle and Happy the Man, remained limited to their own geographic regions. This is {{at least in part}} due to music industry differences between the US and Great Britain. <b>Cultural</b> <b>factors</b> were also involved, as US musicians tended to come from a blues background, while Europeans tended to have a foundation in classical music. North American progressive rock bands and artists often represented hybrid styles such as the complex arrangements of Rush, the hard rock of Captain Beyond, the Southern rock-tinged prog of Kansas, the jazz fusion of Frank Zappa and Return to Forever, and the eclectic fusion of the all-instrumental Dixie Dregs. British progressive rock acts had their greatest US success in the same geographic areas in which British heavy metal bands experienced their greatest popularity. The overlap in audiences led to the success of arena rock bands, such as Boston, Kansas, and Styx, who combined elements of the two styles.|$|E
30|$|According to {{the model}} {{presented}} in the last section, the trade pattern for societies could {{be affected by the}} <b>cultural</b> <b>factor</b> of work on a small scale in the following way: the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor</b> promotes working in small groups and discourages specialization; therefore, ceteris paribus, this type of society has lower priced products with lower economies of scale, when compared to those societies without this <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{next section}} {{presents}} {{evidence about the}} persistence of the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor</b> in indigenous communities in Mexico. Section  4 discusses the effects of the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor</b> on economic behavior and material welfare in terms of trade, and Sect. 5 discusses these effects in terms of economic growth.|$|R
30|$|We can {{conclude}} that indigenous communities share the <b>cultural</b> <b>factor</b> it is preferable {{to work on a}} small scale, which can be seen in their high rates of self-employment. Also, communities {{with a high degree of}} traditionalism (that closely follow the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor)</b> have less trade and lower economic growth than less traditional communities, and thus, they exhibit lower material welfare, as can be clearly seen in Sect. 5.3. However, as shown in Sects. 5 and 6, it is possible for a community to have the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor</b> and still experience positive economic growth, because the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor</b> is part of the utility function for indigenous peoples, which implies that it is part of their welfare. However, for this to occur, technological change is necessary, as I show in Sect. 6.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>cultural</b> <b>factors</b> that {{reinforce}} this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E

3000|$|Proposition 1 {{shows that}} prices for those {{products}} with greater {{economies of scale}} will be lower, regardless {{of the presence of}} the <b>cultural</b> <b>factor</b> effect. However, given Proposition 2, the decrease in prices will be less profound as [...] Z [...] grows, a result that depends on the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor.</b> In the example of the two communities, if [...] Z_A > Z_B, inequality (13) will be met, causing community B to export to A the goods produced with greater economies of scale and consequently, community A will export the goods with lower economies of scale to B. Under this scheme, trade patterns are determined by the difference in the communities’ <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor.</b>|$|R
3000|$|The {{conclusion}} of the theoretical economic growth model is that, if [...] Z [...] is large, growth {{is going to be}} very slow or non-existent, because communities will not be making use of economic specialization. In Sect. 3.2 I included evidence that Mexican indigenous people prefer to work on a small scale (the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor),</b> and in Sect. 4.4 I showed that they sell goods with low economies of scale, which is consistent with the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor.</b> But, if the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor</b> influences the economic behavior of Mexican indigenous people, then, according with the economic growth model shown in the previous section, this population’s economic growth must be very slow or non-existent.|$|R

30|$|The paper also {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor</b> on the economic behavior of indigenous societies, mainly in terms of trade and economic growth. The paper examines trade in terms of the inter-industry trade model developed by Krugman (1979), with the addition of the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor</b> to the model. The result is a trade model that contemplates cultural differences. However, societies that engage in trade (both those with and without the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor)</b> do not experience many of the material benefits of trade, although they increase their utility. The empirical evidence analyzed shows that Mexican indigenous communities mainly export both agricultural products and crafts, which are products with constant economic scale.|$|R

30|$|The section {{develops}} {{an economic}} growth model {{that includes the}} <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor.</b> First, I assume that the total economy (indigenous and non-indigenous) can be represented as an AK model (with human and physical capital). When the weight of Z is small, the economic growth of indigenous communities (and the total economy) can also be characterized as following an AK model, as the factors that keep these communities economically poor could be exogenous, such as lack of opportunities, discrimination and so forth. However, when the weight of Z is large, the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor</b> influences economic behavior; thus, the economies of indigenous communities could be characterized as following a Neoclassical model, with economic growth tending toward zero. In this case, the factors that keep these communities in economic poverty are both endogenous (like the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Factor)</b> and exogenous. In this section, we analyze how Neoclassical economies can be expanded into AK model economies.|$|R
