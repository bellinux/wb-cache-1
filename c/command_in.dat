5|$|The {{functional}} commands {{established in}} 1953–54 were revised in 1959. Home Command was renamed Operational Command, and Training and Maintenance Commands merged to become Support Command. Operational Command was renamed Air <b>Command</b> <b>in</b> 1987, {{and three years}} later Support Command split into Logistics Command and Training <b>Command.</b> <b>In</b> 1997, logistics management became the responsibility of Support Command (Air Force), the RAAF component of the Defence-wide Support Command Australia (later subsumed by the Defence Materiel Organisation). Training Command was re-formed as Air Force Training Group, a force element group under Air <b>Command,</b> <b>in</b> 2006. Air Command thus became the sole command-level organisation in the RAAF.|$|E

5|$|Air Vice Marshal Allan Leslie Walters, CB, CBE, AFC (2November 1905– 19October 1968) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Born in Victoria and raised in Western Australia, {{he graduated from the}} Royal Military College, Duntroon, before transferring to the RAAF in 1928. He was considered one of the service's leading flying instructors and aerobatic pilots between the wars, and was appointed to his first squadron <b>command</b> <b>in</b> 1937. Over the course of World WarII, Walters led No.1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron in Singapore, No.1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, Northern Territory, No.72 Wing in Dutch New Guinea, and Northern <b>Command</b> <b>in</b> Papua New Guinea. He was decorated with the Air Force Cross in 1941 for his work with No.1 Squadron, and mentioned in despatches in 1944 for his service with No.72 Wing.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{suitability}} {{once again}} {{came in for}} discussion during the war. Ansons and Boulton Paul Defiants were not suitable for ASR operations. The Vickers Warwick was earmarked for the main ASR aircraft. Four 20-aircraft squadrons with specialised ASR conversion were to be made available by the spring, 1943. While development was slow. Nevertheless, the effort paid off. In May 1943, 156 men of Bomber Command were rescued from the sea by No. 279 Squadron alone. By the end of 1943 Coastal Command had rescued 1,684 aircrew out of 5,466 presumed to have ditched in the sea. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, 163 aircrew and 60 other personnel were rescued. During the month, June 1944, 355 were saved by ASR units of Coastal <b>Command.</b> <b>In</b> all, 10,663 persons were rescued by Coastal <b>Command</b> <b>in</b> ASR operations. Of this total, 5,721 were Allied aircrew, 277 enemy aircrew, and 4,665 non-aircrew.|$|E

5|$|Although the U.S. <b>command</b> <b>in</b> Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington became increasingly aware of this arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk. Washington still had hopes of reopening a dialog with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E
5|$|Because General Maurice Sarrail had {{demonstrated}} {{a tendency to}} interfere in politics, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau relieved him of his <b>command</b> <b>in</b> December 1917.

5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} the armed services as separate organisations.
