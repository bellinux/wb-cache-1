40|$|We report two new {{phenomena}} of deontic reasoning: (1) For <b>conditionals</b> with deontic content such as, “If the nurse {{cleaned up the}} blood then she must have worn rubber gloves”, reasoners make more modus tollens inferences (from “she did not wear rubber gloves ” to “she did not clean up the blood”) compared to <b>conditionals</b> with epistemic content. (2) For <b>conditionals</b> in the subjunctive mood with deontic content, such as, “If the nurse had cleaned up the blood then she must have had to wear rubber gloves”, reasoners make the same frequency of all inferences as they do for <b>conditionals</b> in the indicative mood with deontic content. In this regard, subjunctive deontics are different from subjunctive epistemic conditionals: reasoners interpret subjunctive epistemic <b>conditionals</b> as counterfactual and they make more negative inferences such as modus tollens from them. The experiments show these two phenomena occur for deontic <b>conditionals</b> that contain the modal auxiliary “must ” and ones that do not.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} about the initial {{flowering}} of <b>conditionals,</b> if-(then) constructions, in children's spontaneous speech. It is motivated by two major theoretical interests. The first and most immediate is to understand the acquisition process itself. <b>Conditionals</b> are conceptually, and in many languages morphosyntactically, complex. What aspects of cognitive and grammatical development are implicated in their acquisition? Does learning {{take place in the}} context of particular interactions with other speakers? Where do <b>conditionals</b> fit in with the acquisition of other complex sentences? What are the semantic, syntactic and pragmatic properties of the first <b>conditionals?</b> Underlying this first interest is a second, more strictly linguistic one. Research of recent years has found increasing evidence that natural languages are constrained in certain ways. The source of these constraints is not yet clearly understood, but it is widely assumed that some of them derive ultimately from properties of children's capacity for language acquisition. Present volume arose out of a Symposium on <b>Conditionals</b> and Cognitive Processes, which was held at Stanford University in December 1983. <b>Conditionals</b> and Cognitive Processes (1983); Symposium on <b>conditionals</b> and cognitive processes, Stanford University, Dec. 198...|$|R
