40|$|Youth {{misuse of}} fire is a multifaceted, complex, and {{dangerous}} phenomenon. In {{response to this}} problem, Fire and Rescue NSW and Juvenile Justice NSW established a memorandum of understanding to facilitate firefighter involvement {{in the provision of}} fire safety education during Youth Justice <b>Conferencing</b> <b>for</b> young people who commit fire-related offences. Despite being used for over a decade, <b>conferencing</b> <b>for</b> youth misuse of fire is yet to attract theoretical analysis or empirical investigation.

Comparative analysis revealed that child-centred disaster risk reduction offers a scaffold to explain and justify the mechanisms operating in Youth Justice <b>Conferencing</b> <b>for</b> youth misuse of fire. This theoretical alignment has implications for both Youth Justice Conferencing and child-centred disaster risk reduction...|$|R
