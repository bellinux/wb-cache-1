30|$|The {{third round}} {{discussed}} a regulative principle {{proposed for the}} formulation of policy on the COOL of main ingredients, the definition of “main ingredient” and the desirability for worldwide standardisation of the <b>country-of-origin</b> <b>marking.</b>|$|E
30|$|In every country, the {{government}} plays {{a crucial role}} in matters concerning the <b>country-of-origin</b> <b>marking</b> of foods. Since the beginning of this century, the mandatory country-of-origin labelling (COOL) has been introduced in the European Union (2000), USA (2002) and some other countries and also has been applied to more and more products, to better guarantee food safety and quality. However, in the international scene, COOL is a controversial issue criticised as a trade protection measure. The most notable example was the COOL dispute between the USA and Canada/Mexico where the WTO ruled that US COOL measure is inconsistent with its WTO obligations WTO (n.d.-a, n.d.-b). COOL seems to be a trade protection measure, and the consumer’s right to know the origins of their foods seems to conflict with free trade.|$|E
30|$|In the {{international}} scene, country-of-origin labelling (COOL) is a controversial issue. We aim at defining {{criteria for the}} <b>country-of-origin</b> <b>marking</b> COOL for processed foods and figure out the effect of COOL on international trade. We conduct qualitative and systematic research using the Delphi method. The panel of experts in food labelling and food policy was composed of 19 members in 13 countries. The experts actively discussed topics ranging from the possible protectionism of COOL to the desirability of worldwide standardisation of COOL, providing comprehensive perspectives on the issues concerning COOL. The essential consensus is that multiple countries of origin marking can give accurate information {{about the origin of}} food produced by two or more countries, avoiding misinformation for consumers. This research provides valuable insights for the formulation of COOL policy in various countries. The main limitation is due to the absence of the view of producer associations.|$|E
