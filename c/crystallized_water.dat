The water ice absorption is seen toward d 121 - 1925 and d 216 - 0939, while the spectra of d 182 - 316, d 183 - 405, and d 218 - 354 show no water ice feature around 3. 1 um within the detection limits. By comparing the water ice features toward nearby stars, {{we find that the}} water ice absorption toward d 121 - 1925 and d 216 - 0939 most likely originates from the foreground material and the surrounding disk, respectively. The angle of the disk inclination is found to be mainly responsible for the difference of the optical depth of the water ice among the five young stars. Our results suggest that there is a critical inclination angle between 65 deg and 75 deg for the circumstellar disk where the water ice absorption becomes strong. The average density at the disk surface of d 216 - 0939 was found to be 6. 38 x 10 ^(- 18) g cm^(- 3). The water ice absorption band in the d 216 - 0939 disk is remarkable in that the maximum optical depth of the water ice band is at a longer wavelength than detected before.

The glass transition of the system was detected by DSC for water contents higher than the critical water content corresponding to the formation of the first sorption layer of water molecules directly bound to primary hydration sites, namely 0. 073 (grams of water per grams of dry protein), estimated by ESI. A strong plasticization of the Tg was observed by DSC for hydration levels lower than those necessary for crystallization of water during cooling, i. e. lower than about 0. 3 (grams of water per grams of hydrated protein) followed by a stabilization of Tg at about - 80 °C for higher water contents. The α relaxation associated with the glass transition was also observed in dielectric measurements. In TSDC a microphase separation could be detected resulting in double Tg for some hydration levels.
