Cell-level path allocation, performed once in every time slot, ensures that cells are routed through the second stage of the switch without delay or contention.

40|$|This work {{develops}} {{an exact}} logical operation model {{to predict the}} performance of the all-optical shared-memory architecture (OSMA) class of packet switches and provides a means to obtain a reasonable approximation of OSMA switch performance within certain types of networks, including the Banyan family. All-optical packet switches have the potential to far exceed the bandwidth capability of their current electronic counterparts. However, all-optical switching technology is currently not mature. Consequently, all-optical switch fabrics and buffers are more constrained in size and can cost several orders of magnitude more than those of electronic switches. The use of shared-memory buffers and/or links with multiple parallel channels (<b>channel</b> <b>grouping)</b> have been suggested as ways to maximize switch performance with buffers of limited size. However, analysis of shared-memory switches is far more difficult than for other commonly used buffering strategies. Obtaining packet loss performance by simulation is often not a viable alternative to modeling if low loss rates or large networks are encountered. Published models of electronic shared-memory packet switches (ESMP) have primarily involved approximate models to allow analysis of switches with a large number of ports and/or buffer cells. Because most ESMP models become inaccurate for small switches, and OSMA switches, unlike ESMP switches, do not buffer packets unless contention occurs, existing ESMP models cannot be applied to OSMA switches. Previous models of OSMA switches were confined to isolated (non-networked), symmetric OSMA switches using <b>channel</b> <b>grouping</b> under random traffic. This work is far more general in that it also encompasses OSMA switches that (1) are subjected to bursty traffic and/or with input links that have arbitrary occupancy probability distributions, (2) are interconnected to form a network and (3) are asymmetric.

40|$|The {{properties}} of switching techniques {{suitable for use}} in broadband networks have been investigated. Methods for evaluating the performance of such switches have been reviewed. A notation has been introduced to describe a class of binary self-routing networks. Hence a technique has been developed for determining {{the nature of the}} equivalence between two networks drawn from this class. The necessary and sufficient condition for two packets not to collide in a binary self-routing network has been obtained. This has been used to prove the non-blocking property of the Batcher-banyan switch. A condition for a three-stage network with <b>channel</b> <b>grouping</b> and link speed-up to be nonblocking has been obtained, of which previous conditions are special cases. A new three-stage switch architecture has been proposed, based upon a novel cell-level algorithm for path allocation in the intermediate stage of the switch. The algorithm is suited to hardware implementation using parallelism to achieve a very short execution time. An array of processors is required to implement the algorithm The processor {{has been shown to be}} of simple design. It must be initialised with a count representing the number of cells requesting a given output module. A fast method has been described for performing the request counting using a non-blocking binary self-routing network. Hardware is also required to forward routing tags from the processors to the appropriate data cells, when they have been allocated a path through the intermediate stage. A method of distributing these routing tags by means of a non-blocking copy network has been presented. The performance of the new path allocation algorithm has been determined by simulation. The rate of cell loss can increase substantially in a three-stage switch when the output modules are non-uniformly loaded. It has been shown that the appropriate use of <b>channel</b> <b>grouping</b> in the intermediate stage of the switch can reduce the effect of non-uniform loading on performance...|$|E

40|$|A simple distributed, modular {{architecture}} {{for a very}} large scale ATM switch is proposed in this paper. By extending {{the concept of the}} original knockout switch, the cell filtering and ' contention resolution functions are distributed over many small switch elements, which are arranged in a cross-bar structure. The output ports of a switch fabric are partitioned into a number of groups by a novel grouping network to permit sharing of the routing paths in the same group. This results in close to one order of magnitude fewer switch elements. The proposed ATM switch has a regular and uniform structure and thus has the the advantages of (1) easy expansion due to the modular structure, (2) high integration density for the VLSI implementation, (3) relaxed synchronization for data and clock signals and (4) building the center switch fabric with a single type of chip.

40|$|Abstract—A general {{expansion}} {{architecture is}} proposed {{that can be}} used in building large-scale switches using any type of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch. The proposed universal multistage interconnection network (UniMIN) switch is composed of a buffered distribution network (DN) and a column of output switch modules (OSM’s), which can be any type of ATM switch. ATM cells are routed to their destination using a two-level routing strategy. The DN provides each incoming cell with a self-routing path to the destined OSM, which is the switch module containing the destination output port. Further routing to the destined output port is performed by the destination OSM. Use of the <b>channel</b> <b>grouping</b> technique yields excellent delay/throughput performance in the DN, and the virtual FIFO concept is used for implementing the output buffers of the distribution module without internal speedup. We also propose a “fair virtual FIFO ” to provide fairness between input links while preserving cell sequence. The distribution network is composed of one kind of distribution module which has the same size as the OSM, regardless of the overall switch size. This gives good modular scalability in the UniMIN switch. Performance analysis for uniform traffic and hot-spot traffic shows that a negligible delay and cell loss ratio in the DN can be achieved with a small buffer size, and that DN yields robust performance even with hot-spot traffic. In addition, a fairness property of the proposed fair virtual FIFO is shown by a simulation study.

40|$|The ongoing {{improvements}} in the analytical techniques based on more realistic assumptions, plant performance feedback, and the latest fuel designs {{have resulted in a}} significant increase in the calculated operational margins related to the safety analysis. The power level is used, with other data, in many of the licensing analyses that demonstrate the safety of the plant. The increasing of the available safety analysis margin provides BWR plants with the potential for an increase in thermal power rating up to 20 % (Power Uprate). In order to operate much more effectively and to more efficiently use Pu fissile materials, BWR plants expand the operating range in the region of operation with less flow than rated core flow. This extended operating domain for a plant that has uprated power greater than ~ 7 % is identified as Maximum Extended Load Line Limit Analysis Plus (MELLLA+). Since in the BWR design the stability must be evaluated over the entire operating domain where power oscillations could occur, the MELLLA+ domain must be investigated. New licensing bases, hardware and software specifications are required to prevent plants from exceeding their Safety Limit Minimum Critical Power Ratio (SLMCPR) due to oscillations in fuel channel power. The “Detect and Suppress Solution - Confirmation Density” (DSS-CD) [Ref. 1] is a GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) proprietary and US NRC approved methodology. DSS-CD is a stability Long Term Solution (LTS) which consists of hardware and software that provide for reliable, automatic detection and suppression of stability related power oscillations. It is designed to identify unstable power oscillations upon inception and initiate control rod insertion to terminate the oscillations prior to any significant power amplitude growth that would threaten the SLMCPR. The computer code TRACG [Ref. 4], the GEH proprietary version of the Transient Analysis Reactor Code (TRAC), is used to evaluate the Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) performance of anticipated instability events that are reasonably limiting in ii order to perform best-estimate event simulations for a specified range of operating conditions and anticipated oscillation modes. TRACG [Ref. 4] is a multi dimensional twofluid Thermal-Hydraulic (T-H) model with a three dimensional (3 -D) kinetics model capable of simulating the reactor core and the systems relevant for establishing boundary conditions for the reactor vessel. TRACG has been extensively qualified against test data and BWR actual plant data from instability events. The stability performance of the core is highly dependent on the core configuration and operating state. Each DSS-CD stability evaluation consists of a steady-state analysis performed, using the GEH proprietary 3 -D core simulator PANACEA, to establish the core condition immediately prior to a transient event that is modeled using TRACG. The scenarios considered in the analysis are loss of core flow events due to recirculation pump trip events, starting from the expected most limiting steady-state operating conditions, at the highest Power/Flow (P/F) ratios in the MELLLA+ domain. The main objective of this dissertation is to demonstrate that the DSS-CD solution provides positive margin to the safety limit MCPR at the time of the suppression of the power oscillations. The power suppression by DSS-CD for high growth instability events occurs within a few oscillation periods from the time the instability is sensed by a period based oscillation counting detection algorithm, confirmed by multiple Oscillation Power Range Monitors (OPRMs), combined with the detected oscillations reaching a low amplitude discriminator setpoint. In addition some sensitivity analyses are performed in order to evaluate the impact of a few parameters on the stability behavior of the core. These parameters were identified to be relevant based on preliminary analysis and the T-H stability literature. • Sensitivity analysis on the axial nodalization of the bypass region to study the impact of the bypass voiding on the T-H feedback in the TRACG 3 -D neutronkinetics solution for two different top guide geometries. iii • Sensitivity of the stability behavior of the core to the <b>channel</b> <b>grouping.</b> The impact of the <b>channel</b> <b>grouping</b> on stability applications during two recirculation pump trip (2 RPT) events is performed. The stability performances of the core in 2 RPT events requires evaluation of two aspects; 1) onset of oscillations; and 2) mode of oscillations. • Noise to the system applied to evaluate the impact on the onset of oscillation. • A more realistic UO 2 conductivity model that takes into consideration exposure and gadolinium concentration was used in order to understand the impact on stability applications of the fuel rod thermal time constant. Finally, the use of automation tools for nuclear analysis and in particular to perform stability evaluation is discussed. The benefits of the automation tools are considered in the context of productivity and prevention of human errors to better assure the delivery of quality analysis products...|$|E
40|$|Density Wave Oscillations (DWOs) {{are known}} to be {{possible}} when a coolant undergoes considerable density reduction while passing through a heated channel. In the development of boiling water reactors (BWRs), there has been considerable concern about the effects of such oscillations when coupled with neutronic feedback. The current trend of increasing reactor power density and relying more extensively on natural circulation for core cooling may have consequences for the stability characteristics of new BWR designs. This work addresses {{a wide range of issues}} associated with the BWR stability: 1) flashing-induced instability and natural circulation BWR startup; 2) stability of the BWRs with advanced designs involving high power :densities; 3) modeling assumptions in stability analysis methods; and 4) the fuel clad performance during power and flow oscillations. To capture the effect of flashing on density wave oscillations during low pressure startup conditions, a code named FISTAB has been developed in the frequency domain. The code is based on a single channel thermal-hydraulic model of the balance of the water/steam circulation loop, and incorporates the pressure dependent water/steam thermodynamic properties, from which the evaporation due to flashing is captured. The functionality of the FISTAB code is confirmed by testing the experimental results at SIRIUS-N facility. Both stationary and perturbation results agree well with the experimental results. The proposed ESBWR start-up procedure under natural convection conditions has been examined by the FISTAB code. It is confirmed that the examined operating points along the ESBWR start-up trajectory from TRACG simulation will be stable. To avoid the instability resulting from the transition from single-phase natural circulation to two-phase circulation, a simple criterion is proposed for the natural convection BWR start-up when the steam dome pressure is still low. Using the frequency domain code STAB developed at MIT, stability analyses of some proposed advanced BWRs have been conducted, including the high power density BWR core designs using the Large Assembly with Small Pins (LASP) or Cross Shape Twisted (CST) fuel designs developed at MIT, and the Hitachi's RBWR cores utilizing a hard neutron spectrum and even higher power density cores. The STAB code is the predecessor of the FISTAB code, and thermodynamic properties of the coolant are only dependent on system pressure in STAB. It is concluded that good stability performance of the LASP core and the CST core can be maintained at nominal conditions, even though they have 20 % higher reactor thermal power than the reference core. Power uprate does not seem to have significant effects on thermal-hydraulic stability performance when the power-to-flow ratio is maintained. Also, both the RBWR-AC and RBWR-TB 2 designs are found viable from a stability performance point of view, even though the core exit qualities are almost 3 times those of a traditional BWR. The stability of the RBWRs is enhanced through the fast transient response of the shorter core, more flat power and power-to-flow ratio distributions, less negative void feedback coefficient, and the core inlet orifice design. To examine the capability of coupled 3 D thermal-hydraulics and neutronics codes for stability analysis, USNRC's latest system analysis code, TRACE, is chosen in this work. Its validation for stability analysis and comparison with the frequency domain approach, have been performed against the Ringhals 1 stability tests. Comprehensive assessment of modeling choices on TRACE stability analysis has been made, including effects of timespatial discretization, numerical schemes, thermal-hydraulic <b>channel</b> <b>grouping,</b> neutronics modeling, and control system modeling. The predictions from both the TRACE and STAB codes are found in reasonably good agreement with the Ringhals 1 test results. The biases for the predicted global decay ratio are about 0. 07 in TRACE results, and - 0. 04 in STAB results. However, the standard deviations of decay ratios are both large, around 0. 1, indicating large uncertainties in both analyses. Although the TRACE code uses more sophisticated neutronic and thermal hydraulic models, the modeling uncertainty is not less than that of the STAB code. The benchmark results of both codes for the Ringhals stability test are at the same level of accuracy. The fuel cladding integrity during power oscillations without reactor scram is examined by using the FRAPTRAN code, with consideration of both the stress-strain criterion and thermal fatigue. Under the assumed power oscillation conditions for high burn-up fuel, the cladding can satisfy the stress-strain criteria in the ASME Code. Also, the equivalent alternating stress is below the fatigue threshold stress, thus the fatigue limit is not violated. It can be concluded that under a large amount of the undamped power oscillation cycles, the cladding would not fail, and the fuel integrity is not compromised. by Rui Hu. Thesis (Ph. D.)
