50|$|CCID (chip <b>card</b> <b>interface</b> <b>device)</b> {{protocol}} is a USB protocol {{that allows}} a smartcard {{to be connected to}} a computer via a card reader using a standard USB interface, without the need for each manufacturer of smartcards to provide its own reader or protocol. This allows the smartcard {{to be used as a}} security token for authentication and data encryption, such as that used in Bitlocker. Chip card interface devices come in a variety of forms. The smallest CCID form is a standard USB dongle and may contain a SIM card or Secure Digital card inside the USB dongle. Another popular device is a USB smart card reader keyboard, which in addition to being a standard PC USB keyboard, has an additional slot for accepting a smartcard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Network {{communication}} using unprotected air as {{a medium}} leads to unique challenges ensuring confidentiality, in-tegrity and availability. While newer amendments of IEEE 802. 11 provide acceptable confidentiality and integrity, availability is still questionable despite broad usage of Wi-Fi technologies for tasks where availability is critical. We will present new security weaknesses that we have identified in the 802. 11 standard and especially the 802. 11 h amendment. Our results are underlined by an extensive analysis of attacks addressing the quiet informa-tion element and channel switch announcement in management frames. For some stations a complete DoS effect can be achieved with a single packet {{for more than one}} minute. This shows that the newly identified attacks are more efficient than earlier approaches like a deauthentication attack. Tests were performed with a large variety of network <b>interface</b> <b>cards,</b> mobile <b>devices,</b> and operating systems. I...|$|R
50|$|Hardware {{typically}} {{consists of}} a physical controller, most often a MIDI or Human <b>interface</b> <b>device,</b> often resembling a scaled-down CDJ setup (albeit, without hardware CD players) or a pad-controller resembling the traditional Akai MPC; a newer class of controllers is represented by grid-based button controllers such as the Novation Launchpad. Some include built-in sound <b>card</b> <b>interfaces</b> and others rely on the PC's internal sound setup or make use of a breakout box with a sound card. Some makers of controllers include Akai Professional, Numark Industries, Native Instruments, Novation, Vestax, Livid Instruments, Keith McMillen, Denon, Monome. Some DJ CD Players, such as the Pioneer Corporation CDJ800 and Numark MixDeck can also function as controllers. Older controllers occasionally used standard MIDI connectors, most controllers today are USB-based.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} new Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>device</b> for the MPICH Implementation of the MPI (Message Passing Interface) {{standard}} using MP{_}Lite. MP{_}Lite is a lightweight message-passing library that is not a full MPI implementation, but offers high performance MPICH (Message Passing Interface CHameleon) is a full implementation of the MPI standard that has the p 4 library as the underlying communication device for TCP/IP networks. By integrating MP{_}Lite as a Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>device</b> in MPICH, a parallel programmer can utilize the full MPI implementation of MPICH as well as the high bandwidth offered by MP{_}Lite. There are several layers in the MPICH library where one can tie a new <b>device.</b> The Channel <b>Interface</b> is the lowest layer that requires very few functions to add a new device. By attaching MP{_}Lite to MPICH at the lowest level, the Channel Interface, almost all of the performance of the MP{_}Lite library can be delivered to the applications using MPICH. MP{_}Lite can be implemented either as a blocking or a non-blocking Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>device.</b> The performance was measured on two separate test clusters, the PC and the Alpha miniclusters, having Gigabit Ethernet connections. The PC cluster has two 1. 8 GHz Pentium 4 PCs and the Alpha cluster has two 500 MHz Compaq DS 20 workstations. Different network <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> like Netgear, TrendNet and SysKonnect Gigabit Ethernet cards were used for the measurements. Both the blocking and non-blocking MPICH-MP{_}Lite Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>devices</b> perform close to raw TCP, whereas a performance loss of 25 - 30 % is seen in the MPICH-p 4 Channel <b>Interface</b> <b>device</b> for larger messages. The superior performance offered by the MPICH-MP{_}Lite device compared to the MPICH-p 4 device can be easily seen on the SysKonnect cards using jumbo frames. The throughput curve also improves considerably by increasing the Eager/Rendezvous threshold...|$|R
