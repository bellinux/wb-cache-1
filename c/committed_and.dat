He {{received}} scholarship offers from Arizona, Florida State, Kansas, Kentucky, LSU, and North Carolina. After verbally committing to Florida State in March 2004, Rolle reopened his recruitment in July. He decided on LSU, to which fellow Laurinburg teammate Chris Johnson had already <b>committed,</b> <b>and</b> signed his letter of intent on November 18, 2004. Rolle was listed as the eighth-best power forward {{in the class of}} 2005 and 32nd overall recruit by Rivals.com.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{vulnerability}} of the Australian shipping industry, the Axis attacks did not seriously affect the Australian or Allied war effort. While the German surface raiders which operated against Australia caused considerable disruption to merchant shipping and tied down Allied naval vessels, they did not sink many ships and only operated in Australian waters for a few short periods. The effectiveness of the Japanese submarine campaign against Australia was limited by the inadequate numbers of submarines <b>committed</b> <b>and</b> flaws in Japan's submarine doctrine. The submarines were, however, successful in forcing the Allies to devote considerable resources to protecting shipping in Australian waters between 1942 and late 1943. The institution of coastal convoys between 1942 and 1943 may have also significantly reduced the efficiency of the Australian shipping industry during this period.|$|E
40|$|The {{interlinking}} of <b>commit</b> <b>and</b> issue {{data has}} become a de-facto standard in software development. Modern issue tracking systems, such as JIRA, automatically interlink <b>commits</b> <b>and</b> issues by the extraction of identifiers (e. g., issue key) from commit messages. However, the conventions {{for the use of}} interlinking methodologies vary between software projects. For example, some projects enforce the use of identifiers for every commit while others have less restrictive conventions. In this work, we introduce a model called PaLiMod to enable the analysis of interlinking characteristics in <b>commit</b> <b>and</b> issue data. We surveyed 15 Apache projects to investigate differences and commonalities between linked <b>and</b> non-linked <b>commits</b> <b>and</b> issues. Based on the gathered information, we created a set of heuristics to interlink the residual of non-linked <b>commits</b> <b>and</b> issues. We present the characteristics of Loners <b>and</b> Phantoms in <b>commit</b> <b>and</b> issue data. The results of our evaluation indicate that the proposed PaLiMod model and heuristics enable an automatic interlinking and can indeed reduce the residual of non-linked <b>commits</b> <b>and</b> issues in software projects...|$|R

5|$|On June 11, 2008, the CTA {{board was}} {{scheduled}} to hear the city's plan of a three-phase bailout {{of the construction of}} the rapid transit station under block 37. The plan included $20million in additional tax increment financing. This comes on top of an extra $60–70million in excess of its budgeted amount that the CTA has been forces to expend. The building developer, Joseph Freed & Associates, has agreed to accept $19million of cost overruns. This round of assistance only covers costs that have been incurred to date. No further funds have been <b>committed</b> <b>and</b> the station's development is being halted until such funds arise. The original budget was $213million ($173 from CTA) and costs to date have been $320million. As of last year the costs were $150million over budget and the city is seeking private investment. Construction finally began on the third building, the hotel and residences in the end of 2009.|$|E
5|$|Teresa Elena De Simone (24 June 19575 December 1979) {{was murdered}} in Southampton, England, in 1979. Her murder led {{to one of the}} longest proven cases of a {{miscarriage}} of justice in English legal history. The murder occurred outside the Tom Tackle pub and {{was the subject of a}} three-year police investigation which resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson. Over the course of his 15-day trial it was revealed that Hodgson was a pathological liar and had confessed to numerous crimes, including some that he could not have <b>committed</b> <b>and</b> others that did not appear to have happened. Hodgson was convicted of the murder by a unanimous jury verdict in 1982 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 27 years in prison he was exonerated and released in March 2009. DNA analysis of semen samples that had been preserved from the original crime scene showed that they could not have come from him.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{considerable}} amount of scholarship on Jinnah which stems from Pakistan; according to Akbar S. Ahmed, it is not widely read outside the country and usually avoids even the slightest criticism of Jinnah. According to Ahmed, some books published about Jinnah outside Pakistan mention that he consumed alcohol, but this is omitted from books published inside Pakistan. Ahmed suggests that depicting the Quaid drinking would weaken Jinnah's Islamic identity, and by extension, Pakistan's. Some sources allege he gave up alcohol {{near the end of his}} life. Yahya Bakhtiar, who observed Jinnah from close quarters, concluded that Jinnah was a very sincere, deeply <b>committed</b> <b>and</b> dedicated Mussalman.|$|E

5|$|While the {{majority}} of the division was in Crete, the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment, which had not been sent to Greece, was detached to the British 7th Armoured Brigade and subsequently took part in Operation Brevity in the Western Desert in May. Following the evacuation of Crete, while the 6th Division began rebuilding in Palestine, the cavalry was allocated {{to take part in the}} bloody but successful attack on Vichy French forces in the Syria–Lebanon campaign. Two depleted infantry battalions from the 17th Brigade– the 2/3rd and 2/5th– were also <b>committed</b> <b>and</b> subsequently took part in the drive on Damascus in mid-June. They were later joined by the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion and together they fought through the campaign until the French capitulated in mid-July. In the process they suffered 168 casualties; total 6th Division casualties for the Syrian campaign amounted to 39 killed and 129 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{three levels}} of Brazilian {{government}} assured the free provision {{of a range of}} services to the bid, including security, medical services, customs, transport, immigration, and other governmental services and support. Rio de Janeiro also approved funding of US$240 billion from the Program for Growth Acceleration (PAC) of the federal government. Other revenue-generating activities include sponsorship sales, ticketing program, licensing and merchandising. These revenues will be supplemented by IOC-secured commercial and broadcast contributions. Capital expenditure on infrastructure by the government or the private sector includes already <b>committed</b> <b>and</b> ongoing investments of US$3.9 billion on projects such as airport and subway expansions and construction of the metropolitan road arc. The OCOG budget does not assume any capital contributions to the construction of permanent or legacy venues, other than for Games overlay, including the construction of temporary venues. The balance of OCOG expenditures will be funded by the public sector, involving a combination of government commitments from Federal, State and Municipal levels. The OCOG budget and operating expenses are projected at US$2.8 billion, with its Olympic-related budget, including capital investments in transportation, sports venues and incremental costs being US$11.6 billion. The government submitted guarantees to cover any potential shortfall. The bid expenses for both Applicant and Candidature phases were of R$85,792 million, as released during the official closing of the campaign on November 11, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{criminal}} trial continued {{for most of}} the summer and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime {{was supposed to have been}} <b>committed</b> <b>and</b> attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E

5|$|The {{first night}} of 21–22 July, the Marines of 3rd Battalion came under a concerted counterattack by the {{survivors}} of the Japanese 320th Independent Infantry Battalion, as well as the 319th, committed by Japanese commander General Kiyoshi Shigematsu to retake the Chonito Cliffs. The Japanese managed to infiltrate past many 3rd Battalion units through ravines and dry river beds and briefly threatened to overrun the battalion command post. The fighting was so heavy that parts of the Division Reserve were <b>committed</b> <b>and</b> the destroyer USS McKee was unable to provide close fire support, as the Japanese and Marines were so closely intermingled. However the Marines held firm and managed to repulse the attack by 0830. During the counterattack, a mortarman with Kilo Company, Private First Class Luther Skaggs, Jr., was critically wounded in the leg by a Japanese grenade. After applying a tourniquet, Skaggs continued to fight for another eight hours before moving unassisted to the rear where most of his leg was amputated. For this he became the first Marine from 3rd Battalion to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Over the next two days the 3rd Battalion fought a savage battle with the Japanese defenders for the Chonito Cliffs and Fonte Plateau area, as the battalion struggled to capture the Mt. Tenjo Road. On 23 July, 3rd Battalion seized the last ridge leading to the Fonte Plateau, provoking a heavy Japanese counterattack. LtCol Houser himself was seriously wounded in this engagement and the Executive Officer, Major Royal Bastian, took command. Then 3rd Battalion, now reinforced with tanks, took part in the assault on the Fonte Plateau on 25 July, seizing the key position after just an hour of fighting. The night of 25–26 July saw the climax of the fighting on Guam when the Japanese launched an all-out counterattack against the Americans. In the 3rd Battalion's sector, Japanese sailors of the 54th Keibitai launched a series of failed attacks against the now-well defended Marine positions. Backed up with artillery, the Marines easily repulsed the Japanese.|$|E
