500|$|Modern is {{a format}} that was first {{played at the}} Magic Online 2011 Community Cup, a {{response}} to players' desire for a non-rotating format that is more accessible to newer players. Wizards of the Coast introduced Modern as a legal format on August 12, 2011, and saw its first paper magic play at Pro Tour Philadelphia 2011. Modern consists of every block and core set using the modern <b>card</b> <b>frame</b> since the release of 8th Edition to the present. [...] Certain cards that released in products that are not standard legal such as Planechase or Commander series cards, are not legal in Modern, {{even if they have}} the modern <b>card</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{starting}} with the [...] Core Set, the game went through its biggest visual change since its creation—a new <b>card</b> <b>frame</b> layout was developed to allow more rules text and larger art on the cards, while reducing the thick, colored border to a minimum. The new frame design aimed to improve contrast and readability using black type instead of the previous white, a new font, and partitioned areas for the name, card type, and power and toughness.|$|E

5000|$|QL Magic is {{a variant}} where players can only play with cards {{with the old}} Magic <b>card</b> <b>frames,</b> in {{contrast}} with the Modern format. As such the format allows players to play with cards from Alpha up to Onslaught block. The format also uses an older version of the rules based on the 6th Edition rules.|$|R

When Betti retaliates in self-defense, the criminals coming to aid the dead crook kicks away his gun and plays the victim <b>card,</b> <b>framing</b> Betti. Betti is then placed under arrest and is awaiting trial.|$|R
50|$|TI {{developed}} the TM990 series of computer modules, including CPU, memory, I/O, which when plugged into a <b>card</b> <b>frame</b> could form a 16-bit minicomputer. These were typically used for process control. A microprocessor trainer {{was released in}} the form of the TM990/189.|$|E
50|$|The {{implementation}} of the Power Nine cards online are functionally {{identical to the original}} cards, but have updated rules text, different artwork and are displayed with a modern <b>card</b> <b>frame.</b> With exception of the Black Lotus, the illustrations are those that were originally given to the winners of the Vintage Championships as alternate Power Nine artworks. The Black Lotus received a new artwork by Chris Rahn.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, {{starting}} with the Eighth Edition Core Set, the game went through its biggest visual change since its creation—a new <b>card</b> <b>frame</b> layout was developed to allow more rules text and larger art on the cards, while reducing the thick, colored border to a minimum.

50|$|Modern allows {{cards from}} all core sets {{beginning}} with the 8th Edition core set and all expansions printed afterwards. The 8th Edition core set was when Magic cards began to be printed in modern <b>card</b> <b>frames,</b> {{and this is where}} the name for the format is derived. Wizards believed this cutoff would have the advantage of giving a visual cue as to which cards are legal in the Modern format.|$|R

Orders are sent {{anywhere in the world}} with a functioning postal system, but are printed and posted from print centres based in the UK, USA, Germany and Australia. The postcards are 6 x 4 inch, and the greeting cards are 7 x 5 inch, printed with a gloss finish.|$|R
5000|$|... nCUBE 10 {{referred}} to the machine's ability to build an order-ten hypercube, supporting 1024 CPUs in a single machine. Some of the modules would be used strictly for input/output, which included the nChannel storage control <b>card,</b> <b>frame</b> buffers, and the InterSystem card that allowed nCUBEs to be attached to each other. At least one host board needed to be installed, acting as the terminal driver. It could also partition the machine into [...] "sub-cubes" [...] and allocate them separately to different users.|$|E
50|$|Seventh Edition was {{the last}} base set printed in the 'old' frame; Eighth Edition {{introduced}} the modern <b>card</b> <b>frame.</b> Seventh was the first base set to contain foil cards, which were printed with black borders. It {{was the last}} base set to be released prior to the final expansion of the then-current block (Seventh Edition was released before Apocalypse). Starting with Eighth Edition, the base set editions (which, with 8th, would become known as Core Set editions) were released after the last expansion of the then-current block and before the first expansion of the subsequent block.|$|E
5000|$|Magic 2015 was {{released}} on July 18, 2014. [...] Magic 2015 made the second major change to the <b>card</b> <b>frame</b> in Magics history (the first being in Eighth Edition). Changes include a slight font change (Starting with Magic 2015, an in-house font known as Beleren will be used rather than the Matrix Bold font), {{the addition of a}} holofoil stamp in the bottom center of all rare and mythic rare cards, a slightly narrower black border, and a redesign of the collectors info at the bottom of each card. The new border {{will make it easier for}} machines to read the cards, helping to prevent mispackaging. [...] Advertising for the set featured the planeswalker Garruk Wildspeaker, with a tagline of [...] "Hunt Bigger Game." ...|$|E
50|$|Magic {{continued}} {{a steady}} pace releasing successful expansion blocks with Odyssey and Onslaught. Decipher released The Motion Pictures expansion for the Star Trek CCG, and also {{announced that it}} would be the last expansion for the game. Decipher then released the Second Edition for the Star Trek CCG which refined the rules, rebooted the game, and introduced new <b>card</b> <b>frames.</b> Collectible miniature games made more splashes in 2002 with the releases of HeroClix and MechWarrior.|$|R

Blessings, employed by Catholics and Protestants alike, usually incorporate a picture of Christ's crucifixion and a prayer [...] "to the Sweet Name of Jesus and His dear saints". Many of these were printed in Belgium, and Turnhout.|$|R

5000|$|To further {{represent}} the temporal chaos afflicting Dominaria, Time Spiral was released {{with an additional}} sub-set of 121 [...] "Timeshifted" [...] cards, reprints of select cards from every set prior to Mirrodin. The [...] "Timeshifted" [...] cards were updated to meet the current rules and keywording. To differentiate them from normal cards, [...] "Timeshifted" [...] cards are printed in the pre-8th Edition <b>card</b> <b>frame,</b> with a purple Time Spiral expansion symbol. The [...] "Timeshifted" [...] cards are distributed one per booster pack and three per tournament pack (taking the place of common cards), and also appear in the preconstructed decks. According to DCI-distributed tournament primers, [...] "Timeshifted" [...] cards are tournament legal where Time Spiral or the set of original printing are.|$|E
5000|$|Mirrodin {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first {{expansion}} set to feature the new card front design (which debuted in 8th Edition). The high number of artifacts in Mirrodin highlighted the inherent flaw of the new border design — artifact cards, which were now bordered in a very light grey instead of brown, were very hard to distinguish from white cards. The problem prompted Wizards of the Coast to change the bordering background of artifact cards to a much darker grey in Fifth Dawn. Also due to complications when switching to the new <b>card</b> <b>frame,</b> mana symbols in the text box of Mirrodin cards are greyed out instead of being in color. [...] Beginning with Mirrodin Wizards reduced {{the size of their}} large expansion sets from 350 to 306 cards. This was due to regular complaints, that Wizards was producing too many cards and players could not keep up. Beginning with Darksteel Wizards also increased the size of small expansion sets from 143 to 165 cards. Thus the number of cards released each year would stay the same, but then Magic developer Randy Buehler explained that Wizards believed this change {{would make it easier for}} collectors and players to keep up with number of new cards as these would be release more homogeneously over the course of the year.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by Bill Rose (lead designer), Matt Place, Mark Rosewater and Paul Sottosanti, and {{developed}} by Devin Low (lead developer), Zvi Mowshowitz, Brian Schneider, Henry Stern and Mike Turian, Planar Chaos was tasked with representing the {{present in a}} set focused on the cycle of time. [...] The design team considered {{a number of ways}} to represent an alternate present, including the introduction of purple as a new color. [...] Eventually, the team chose to represent alternate realities where elements of the color pie were shifted, placing spell types and abilities into unusual colors. These alternate realities were epitomized by the set's 45 [...] "color shifted" [...] cards. Unlike their predecessors in Time Spiral, these cards were direct reprints of previous cards, save for shifts in color, land or color references in card text, card name and creature type. Timeshifted cards in Planar Chaos appear in an altered version of the modern <b>card</b> <b>frame</b> with standard set symbols. (An example of this is the card , a black reprint of the white card [...] ). Timeshifted cards in Planar Chaos are also distributed differently. In each pack, three common cards are of the Timeshifted variety and an uncommon is replaced with either a timeshifted rare or uncommon. Foil cards, instead of replacing a card of the same rarity, replace a common card. As such, it is possible to receive a booster with up to three rare cards: one normal, one foil and one timeshifted. The uncommon timeshifted cards show up in a 3:1 ratio to the rare timeshifted cards, so the average out of 4 boosters is 3 uncommon and 1 rare timeshifted card.|$|E

30|$|Normally, {{a yellow}} card caption stays 2 to 4  s {{on the screen}} while the whole event lasts longer. The caption remains on display for the {{duration}} of almost 50 to 100 frames. A novel algorithm to detect a yellow <b>card</b> <b>frame</b> is proposed, which is described below. Generally, the yellow card is displayed as a caption with the player information at the bottom part of the image. It is observed that in most broadcast soccer videos, the caption appears {{on the bottom of the}} screen. We process an input frame below the centre of an image and that is also not exactly at the bottom area as it is very difficult to have an idea of the caption placement and its size and height variations. This domain knowledge helps us to detect this event easily rather than classifying this event from a set of events like goal, corner and even other types of events.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaTo support {{initiatives}} for cheaper, faster, better ground telemetry systems, the Data Systems Technology Division (DSTD) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center {{is developing}} a new Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) targeted to dramatically {{lower the cost of}} telemetry frame synchronization. This single VLSI device, known as the Parallel Integrated Frame Synchronizer (PIFS) chip, integrates most of the functionality contained in high density 9 U VME <b>card</b> <b>frame</b> synchronizer subsystems currently in use. In 1987, a first generation 20 Mbps VMEBus frame synchronizer based on 2. 0 micron CMOS VLSI technology was developed by Data Systems Technology Division. In 1990, this subsystem architecture was recast using 0. 8 micron ECL & GaAs VLSI to achieve 300 Mbps performance. The PIFS chip, based on 0. 7 micron CMOS technology, will provide a superset of the current VMEBus subsystem functions at rates up to 500 Mbps at approximately one-tenth current replication costs. Functions performed by this third generation device include true and inverted 64 bit marker correlation with programmable error tolerances, programmable frame length and marker patterns, programmable search-check-lock-flywheel acquisition strategy, slip detection, and CRC error detection. Acquired frames can optionally be annotated with quality trailer and time stamp. A comprehensive set of cumulative accounting registers are provided on-chip for data quality monitoring. Prototypes of the PIFS chip are expected in October 1995. This paper will describe the architecture and implementation of this new low-cost high functionality device...|$|E

5000|$|At the {{invitation}} of the assistant manager, Bill Crank, the Winstanleys, authors of the book cited below, visited May Mill in September 1980. They said: Although we expected to see some old spinning machines, we were very surprised to find so many still in use; in fact, {{there was very little}} new machinery. Many of the machines were pre-1920, and some dated to about the turn of the century. Slubber and drawing frames were said {{to be part of the}} original May Mill equipment These were made in 1902 by Howard & Bullough of Accrington. Numerous <b>carding</b> <b>frames</b> by Platt Brothers of Oldham were dated 1905, 1907 and 1920, but some of these had been converted to suit Courtauld's needs. Fly frames, also made by Howard & Bullough, were dated 1915. The scutchers made by Platt Brothers, were built in 1921 and 1924. Cone winders by Geo. Hattersley were made about 1950. Perhaps the most modern machines were ring spinning frames, dated 1967.|$|R
