5000|$|Harman LJ (dissenting) {{thought the}} {{defining}} feature {{of a bank}} was the maintenance of current accounts, including deposit or savings accounts where notice is required before withdrawal of funds. The <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> was [...] "an additional requirement", but not an essential feature of a bank. Therefore, he opined, United Dominion Trust was not a banker {{because it did not}} operate current accounts. He acknowledged that it was regarded as such by other bankers, he regarded this as insufficient to make it a bank itself.|$|E
50|$|Cheque {{truncation}} means {{stopping the}} flow <b>of</b> the physical <b>cheques</b> issued by a drawer to the drawee branch. The physical instrument is truncated {{at some point}} {{en route to the}} drawee branch and an electronic image <b>of</b> the <b>cheque</b> is sent to the drawee branch along with the relevant information like the MICR fields, date of presentation, presenting banks etc. This would eliminate the need to move the physical instruments across branches, except in exceptional circumstances, resulting in an effective reduction in the time required for payment <b>of</b> <b>cheques,</b> the associated cost of transit and delays in processing, etc., thus speeding up the process <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> or realization <b>of</b> <b>cheques.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Cheques</b> are one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{accepted}} {{forms of payment}} for settling transactions. Money transactions through cheque collections are pertinent to banking and are an integral activity of any bank. It is not an optional service and hence such services by no means are a gratis. Moreover, the cost involved in <b>collections</b> <b>of</b> such <b>cheques</b> (local or outstation) is borne by the customers {{in some form or}} other. It was recognized as early as in the 1970 s that cheque collection policy for the banks in India is a matter of concern. Though a micro issue with respect to the whole gamut of banking, this has its macro implications keeping in mind the mass of bank account holders in India. In this paper, we study the <b>cheque</b> <b>collection</b> policy <b>of</b> the country for both pre and post deregulation scenario. Also, based on a multidimensional scaling technique, categorisation of 31 banks with respect to various parameters <b>of</b> their present <b>cheque</b> <b>collection</b> policies has been made. Although not an exhaustive study, the minimal statistics gathered and analysed leads one to believe that the existing institutional mechanism for setting up cheque collection policies is not adequate. The spirit with which RBI deregulated the cheque collection process has not got translated into the policies made by banks. It is seen that forces of competition, as a deterrent, is inadequate to improve quality service in the field <b>of</b> <b>cheque</b> <b>collections</b> and that the banks and the regulator have a responsibility to act proactively {{in the interest of the}} depositors. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Lord Denning MR {{opined that}} {{normally}} a company would only constitute a bank if it undertook certain activities: (1) {{the acceptance of}} money from, and the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> for, customers and the placing of the funds to the customers’ credit; (2) honouring cheques or orders drawn on the bank by their customers when presented for payment and the debiting of the customers' accounts accordingly; and (3) keeping some form of current or running accounts for the entries of customers' credits and debits. But he further added that a company might still constitute a bank, even though it did not undertake these activities if it {{was regarded as a}} bank by other bankers. He stated that [...] "like many other beings, a banker is easier to recognise than to define. In case of doubt, it is, I think, permissible to look at the reputation of the firm amongst ordinary intelligent commercial men." [...] He also argued that when a business is running as a bank, judges should be reluctant to hold {{that it is not a}} bank.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the law {{governing}} the bank-customer relationship pertaining to the disposition of funds by cheques and credit transfers, covering both paper-based and electronic payments. The work addresses, with various degrees of detail, common law, civilian, and `mixed 2 ̆ 7 jurisdictions, particularly, Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland and the United States. In addition to the description of the law in these jurisdictions, the book contains an in-depth analysis of the common issues and the responses to them, in light of desired policies. Accordingly, an evaluation of the various rules and proposals for reform are integral parts of the study. The book is divided into four parts. Part I is an overview of the various legal systems and fundamentals in banking and payment law, in an overall historical context. Part II deals with the banking relationship, within which collections and payments occur. It highlights the customer contract, the deposit transaction, the mandate authorizing bank collections and payments, and the debt resulting from entries to the current account. Part III covers the performance of the mandate. It discusses extensively laws governing the payment and <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> and credit transfers, in the context of actual clearing and settlement mechanisms, particularly large-value transfer systems in developed countries. Part IV is on payment systems misuse through fraud, either in the initiation payments or in misdirecting them. It discusses cheque forgery, unauthorized electronic funds transfers, forged cheques indorsements, and misdirected funds transfers. A unique feature of the work is the integration of a cohesive analytic perspective, both doctrinal and policy-oriented, into a comparative descriptive framework. The book searches for a universal `law merchant 2 ̆ 7 transcending the boundaries of the various legal systems. It is aimed at the banking and payment law specialist and student {{as well as to the}} general comparative lawyer. Its focus on both present law and reform makes it useful to both the academic and practising lawyer. [URL]...|$|E

50|$|Although {{technology}} {{needed to}} exist {{to be able}} to truncate a cheque, it was the laws related to cheques that were the main impediment to their introduction. New Zealand {{was one of the first}} countries to introduce truncation and imaging <b>of</b> <b>cheques,</b> when in 1995 the Cheques Act 1960 was amended to provide for the electronic presentation <b>of</b> <b>cheques.</b> A number <b>of</b> other countries followed over the next few years, but progress was mixed due to the decline in the use <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> generally in favour of electronic payment systems. Some countries decided that the effort to implement truncation could not be justified for a declining payment method, and instead phased out the use <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> altogether.|$|R
5000|$|Although forms <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> {{have been}} in use since ancient times and {{at least since the}} 9th century, it was during the 20th century that cheques became a highly popular {{non-cash}} method for making payments and the usage <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> peaked.

50|$|Cheques use MICR {{encoding}} {{containing the}} BSB and account number {{to identify the}} bank and account to debit, {{as well as other}} information to streamline the processing <b>of</b> <b>cheques.</b> In 2014, the cost <b>of</b> processing <b>cheques</b> was the highest of all modes of payments at $5 per transaction, compared to about $0.20 for direct debits. A recent innovation has been digital cheque imagining, which involves cheques being digitised to improve processing efficiencies. Images <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> are now captured at branches and processing centres and exchanged electronically. This has ended the costly practice <b>of</b> physically transporting <b>cheques</b> around Australia and maintaining long-term storage and retrieval systems.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Eurocheque {{system was}} phased out and {{replaced}} with domestic clearing systems. Old eurocheques could still be used, but they were now processed by national clearing systems.

50|$|Instrument-specific {{legislation}} {{includes the}} Cheques Act 1960, {{part of the}} Bills of Exchange Act 1908, which codifies aspects related to the cheque payment instrument, notably the procedures for the endorsement, presentment and payment <b>of</b> <b>cheques.</b> A 1995 amendment provided for the electronic presentment <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> and removed the previous requirement to deliver cheques physically to the paying bank, opening the way for cheque truncation and imaging. Truncation allows for the transmission of an electronic image of all or part <b>of</b> the <b>cheque</b> to the paying bank’s branch, instead of the cumbersome physical presentment. This reduced the total cheque clearance time, as well as eliminating the costs of physically moving the cheque.|$|R
50|$|Starting in the 1960s machine {{readable}} routing {{and account}} information {{was added to}} the bottom <b>of</b> <b>cheques</b> in MICR format.
