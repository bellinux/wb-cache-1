40|$|AbstractUsing {{dark-field}} microscopy, we {{have found}} that certain sugars <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> normal-to-curly helical transition of bacterial flagella. Titration of flagella isolated from Salmonella typhimwium with 16 different carbohydrates showed that: (i) only certain sugars <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> transition. There is no obvious relationship between the simple physico-chemical properties of the sugar and whether <b>the</b> sugar <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> transition or not; (ii) the efficacies of sugars that do <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> transition differ markedly. For these sugars there is a relationship between efficacy and molecular size.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of more precise cost {{information}} on contract renegotiations between supply-chain parties. Specifically, we experimentally investigate the benefits of activity-based costing (ABC) information to address common supply chain inefficiencies that are <b>caused</b> by <b>the</b> buyer or the seller, but have the same underlying costs. Results suggest that the impact of more precise cost information depends crucially on <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of <b>the</b> inefficiency that parties need to address during the negotiation. ABC information increases the total joint profit in the supply chain. However, ABC information increases the seller’s perceptions of the fairness of the buyer’s arguments for contract changes only when <b>the</b> buyer <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency but not when <b>the</b> seller <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency. The combined effect of ABC information on joint profit and fairness perceptions thus increases the buyer’s profit only when buyer <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency but not when <b>the</b> seller <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> inefficiency. status: publishe...|$|R
