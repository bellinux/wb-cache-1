40|$|Introduction: Haemorrhoidal {{disease is}} the most {{frequent}} benign anorectal disease. Conservative, minimally invasive and surgical methods {{are used in the}} treatment of haemorrhoidal disease. Radiofrequency thermoablation is a popular new technique in the treatment of varicose veins. Aim: Assessment of the use of the method in the treatment of haemorrhoidal disease using bipolar radiofrequency-induced thermotherapy (RFITT or so-called <b>Celon</b> method). Material and methods: We used the CelonLab PRECISION (<b>Celon</b> AG medical instruments, Teltow, Germany) with the bipolar RFITT applicator <b>Celon</b> ProBREATH for the treatment of haemorrhoidal disease stages III and IV. Results: In the Department of Surgery at the Atlas Hospital in Zlin, Czech Republic, a total of 71 patients were treated from 9 / 2007 to 10 / 2010 with this new treatment approach. The success rate was 100 %, local recurrence rate was 2. 8 %, and medium-term satisfaction of patients who underwent the procedure was 99. 5 %. Complications appeared in 4. 26 % of cases. Conclusions: The new RFITTH technique for treatment of advanced stages of haemorrhoidal disease is a new treatment modality with good curative response, low level of complications, minimum pain and quick return of patients to their usual activities...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{article is}} aimed at {{introducing}} Sono-Guided Endostripping Technique of the Great Saphenous vein and comparing it with radiofrequency ablation in 104 patients. Methods: 52 pa-tients underwent Sono-Guided Endostripping and 52 patients had radiofrequency ablation with <b>Celon</b> Olympus device. They were followed for 3 months with physical examination and Doppler Sonography for possible complications and recanalization. Results: Recanalization rate was 11. 5 % in RFAs while it was 0. 0 % in the Endostripping group. There {{were no significant differences}} for other complications (hematoma, DVT, paresthesia) but pain, which had 1. 21 and 3. 15 VAS scores for RFA and Endostripping groups, respectively. Recanalization rate was more in RFA comparing with the Endostripping group (11. 5 % vs. 0. 0 %, P < 0. 013). RFA was more expensive. Conclusion: Sono-Guided Endostripping is a safe and cost-effective method (due to no need for using RFA probe); however, the patient must be admitted to the hospital and take appropriate anesthesia. Cosmetic result of the technique is fairly comparable with RFA scars in the thigh and leg...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: During {{the last}} years, many {{endovascular}} techniques {{have been developed}} in order to eliminate not only the reflux in stem veins but in perforating veins and their tributaries, too. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to use endo - vascular RFITT and the foam sclerotherapy for the occlusion of perforating veins as the prime source of reflux and their tributaries. Material and Methods: The <b>Celon</b> method was used for the thermal treatment. Polydocalon with the concentration 1 % and 2 % with DSS technique was used for the foam sclerotherapy. The RFITT was accomplished in 127 perforating veins in total. This group was divided into three subgroups. The first one consists of patients where only RFITT was carried out (n= 41), in the second, there were patients with RFITT realized with sclerotherapy during one session (n= 48), in the third, RFITT was completed with sclerotherapy in one month after the RFITT intervention (n= 38). The control group included perforating veins treated only with sclerotherapy (n= 81). The power setting 6 W was used on the generator during the RFITT with Celon- ProSurge micro and 18 W for usage of <b>Celon</b> ProCurve probe. Results: The effectiveness of the procedure in the group 1 was 8. 8 %, in the group two 93. 7 %, in the group three 92. 1 % and in the control group 76. 5 % in one year follow up. There was no significant difference between the effectiveness in groups 1, 2 and 3. The marginal difference was among all three groups with RFITT and the control group. Significant differences were in the parameter of the extinction of visible varicose veins with the reflux from perforators. The extinction was faster in group 3 than in group 2 and in the control group and the slowest was in group 1. The significant difference was observed between groups 2 and 3 compared with group 1 and the margin difference was between groups 2 and 3 compared with the control group. No significant difference was observed between groups 1 and the control group. Conclusions: All procedures are effective. The most important is the combination of RFITT and the sclerotherapy one month after thermal intervention. This is associated with a low risk of recanalization and the fastest extinction of visible varicose veins...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} feasibility and effectivity of software-assisted {{monitoring of}} MR guided Radiofrequencyablation (RFA) of malignant liver tumors. Materials and Methods: MR-guided RFA of n= 10 primary and n= 18 secondary malignant liver tumors was performed for n= 20 patients in an interventional MR unit (Magnetom Espree 1. 5 T, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim). The tumor size was between 10 and 60 mm. Monopolar and bipolar internally-cooled MR compatible RF electrodes were used (Valleylab,Cool-tip, Burlington, MA and <b>Celon</b> AG, ProSurge, Teltow). Therapy monitoring was assisted by a software comparing tumor and tumor ablation state until complete tumor destruction {{within a given}} safety margin of 1 cm (MeVisSafir, Fraunhofer Mevis, Bremen). Therefore MR data were immediately transferred via DICOM to a MeVis workstation. Results: MRguided RF ablation by using MeVisSafir was technically successful in 20 / 20 (100 %) patients as assessed {{at the end of}} each session. Complete coagulation was intended in 27 / 28 tumors by using the software-assistent. To achieve complete coagulation 1 / 28 tumors required a second session. MeVisSafir was able to monitor the extent of coagulation necrosis and to determine the safety margin. Furthermore, it was supportive in guiding overlapping ablations for complete tumor coagulation for larger livertumors (> 30 mm). Conclusions: Software-assisted MR-guided RFA of liver malignancies is feasible and effective, especially for the therapy monitoring of larger malignant liver tumors...|$|E
40|$|Background: Conventional {{monopolar}} radiofrequency ablation (RFA) {{bears the}} risks of incomplete ablation and tumor seeding. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of multipolar RFA with non-touch technique for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤  3  cm. Methods: Fifteen cirrhotic patients (9 men, 6 women; age 51 – 83 years, mean 64. 4 years, Child-Pugh score: A =  10 and B =  5) with 17 HCCs of ≤  3  cm (mean: 26  mm), which were diagnosed based on typical radiologic findings were enrolled. Two or three <b>Celon</b> Prosurge Bipolar electrodes with 3 -cm active tip were deployed with non-touch technique via percutaneous approach under ultrasound guidance. Results: Complete ablation was achieved in all 17 lesions. This is defined as no enhanced part around the ablated index tumors according to dynamic computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at least 1 month after ablation. No local tumor progression was detected at follow-up (range, 3 – 21. 5 months; mean, 10 months). No track seeding was observed. There was one distant recurrence 15. 4 months after ablation. One patient had procedure-related biliary stricture and died of pneumonia 3. 5 months after tumor ablation. Conclusion: Multipolar RFA with non-touch technique is an effective method to achieve complete tumor ablation and an adequate safety margin. This method has low complication rate and bears minimal risk of tumor seeding...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThere {{have been}} few {{randomised}} studies comparing Radiofrequency Ablation(RFA) with other endovenous techniques. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether RFA of the great saphenous vein (GSV) was associated with less pain and bruising than endovenous laser ablation (EVLA). Materials and methodsThis trial had two cohorts – patients with bilateral GSV incompetence causing varicose veins (VV) and those with unilateral GSV VVs. In total 87 legs were treated in this study. Limbs in the bilateral group were treated with RFA in one leg and EVLA in the other. In the unilateral group limbs were randomised to RFA or EVLA. RFA was performed using the <b>Celon</b> RFiTT system (Teltow, Germany). EVLA was performed using an 810 nm Laser (Biolitec AG, Germany). Phlebectomies were performed as required. Primary endpoints were patient assessed pain and bruising measured by visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints were patency assessed by duplex ultrasound at 6 weeks and 6 months. ResultsIn the bilateral group, RFA resulted in significantly less pain than EVLA on days 2 – 11 postoperatively. RFA also resulted in significantly less bruising than EVLA on days 3 – 9. There were no significant differences in mean post operative pain, bruising and activity scores in the unilateral group. Both RFA and EVLA resulted in occlusion rates of 95 % at 10 days postoperatively. ConclusionsRFA was less painful for patients than EVLA and produced less bruising in the postoperative period with comparable success rates but there was no difference in the unilateral group...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{ablation}} techniques like RFA and MWA {{became a}} therapy option for {{primary and secondary}} malignancies in organs and bones. An entire tumor ablation directly after intervention is crucial for the further course of the disease. Therefore, an image validation right after intervention should ratify whether the ablation was sufficient or further therapy is mandatory. One aim of this thesis was to evaluate if the entire thermal ablation necrosis, especially the border from ablated to healthy tissue, was visible directly after intervention in an open 1 T MRI system. For the MWA using a single antenna, only smaller necroses can be produced because of the limited range of microwaves in tissue. Several RFA-studies reported possible enlargement of necroses by installing sodium solutions into tissue previous to RFA. One aim of this thesis was to investigate whether preinterventional fluid injection before MWA might enlarge the necrosis similarly to fluid injection performing RFA. Methods: In this thesis, two original scientific articles for RFA and one original scientific article on MWA were summarized. Therefore, the articles related to RFA were presented together. Subsequently the MWA article was presented. Results: For the 3 cm ablation all tested RF systems exceeded the target volume of 14. 14 cm 3. For the 5 cm lesion only the Boston Scientific and the <b>Celon</b> system exceeded the target volume of 65. 45 cm 3. The Radionics and AngioDynamics system achieved smaller ablation volumes and remained below the target volume. For the MR-volumetry all volumes for every test series and lesion size were smaller than the macroscopically measured and calculated volumes. Averaged over all four RFA-systems, lesion sizes and sequences, 60 % of the necrosis zone after Intervention was not visible. For MWA {{no significant differences were}} detected between the test series including fluid preinjection of iso- or hypertonic saline solutions in comparison to the trials without preinjection or only water-injection. Discussion: After evaluation of the two MR sequences, in both RFA and MWA-trials the T 1 -sequence detected larger ablation-volumes than the PD-sequence. However, the border from the transitional zone to healthy tissue was not detectable by MRI with the respective sequences directly after intervention. Therefore, no accurate statement about the completeness of the thermal ablation by MR-imaging could be given. For MWA, fluid preinjection did not enlarge the necrosis in contrast to RFA, irrespective of sodium concentration in water. Therefore larger ablations volumes needed a repositioning of the MW-antenna or the simultaneous use of more than one MW-system...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of the CT-based non-invasive thermometry during percutaneous hepatic RF ablation in an in vivo porcine model. It should be proved that an increase of the temperature in the liver parenchyma leads to a change of the CT value. Percutaneous hepatic RF ablation was performed in four female pigs. Parallel to the used bipolar needle-shaped RF applicator (CelonLabPower) with an active tip of 30 mm (<b>Celon</b> ProSurge T 30) optical temperature probes (SFF- 2 m) were inserted into the liver with a fixed distance of 5, 10, 15 mm and in two pigs also with a distance of 20 mm to the RF applicator. After starting the RF ablation performed with a generator output of 20 W, unenhanced sequential CT scans of the liver were acquired using the following scan protocol: 140 kV tube voltage, 300 mAs/rotation tube current time product, collimation 24 x 1. 2 mm, rotation time 0. 5 s (SOMATOM Definition). After acquisition of the raw data, axial image data were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1. 2 mm and the convolution kernel B 30 s using the conventional as well as the extended CT scale. Temperature was recorded continuously by the temperature probes. For analysing the CT scans a circular 0. 5 cm² region of interest (ROI) was manually placed around the tips of the temperature probes to measure local CT values. For statistical analysis mean value and standard deviation of the measured temperature change and of the change of the CT value were calculated for each animal and each temperature probe and compared descriptively. Some CT values of the four animals were investigated for the same temperature and also compared descriptively. Additionally, regression analysis was performed to analyse the relationship between local temperature changes and the measured averaged CT value. A p-value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant (SAS Software 9. 1. 3). Descriptive analysis showed an inverse relationship between the measured temperature and the averaged CT value for all animals. The measured averaged temperature decreased with increasing distance to the RF applicator. In addition, the averaged CT value rose with increasing distance to the RF applicator. Comparing the CT values for the same temperature descriptively, interindividual differences were found. Performing regression analysis a significant influence of the temperature on the CT value was proved. With an exception of two temperature probes, negative regression coefficients were measured for the relationship between local temperature and averaged CT value. Negative regression coefficients varied between - 0. 053 HU/°C (p = 0. 4987) and - 0. 671 HU/°C (p < 0. 0001). There was no difference between the results using the conventional or the extended CT scale. The results of the study show that the CT-based non-invasive thermometry during percutaneous hepatic RF ablation is feasible in an in vivo porcine model. Using multislice CT during RF ablation, local temperature changes can be detected by a change of the CT value, so that in using the CT value temperature can be determined in vivo non-invasively. In conclusion, the results of this study may provide a base for a CT-based non-invasive thermometry during hyperthermal ablation therapies. However, artefacts by motion and metal hamper a precise CT-based temperature monitoring. Furthermore, the development of a more accurate and robust software-based method for a standardised analysis of the image data is required, so that the CT-based non-invasive thermometry can find its way into the clinical routine...|$|E
