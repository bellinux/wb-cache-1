50|$|Cerberus Dragon (Keruberosu Doragon): The Cerberus is the {{combination}} of the Fire Dragon and all five upgraded medium-scale Rescue Vehicles. Its Final Rescue is the Cerberus Crash (Keruberosu Kurasshu), which Cerberus Dragon fires multiple Ice blasts to the enemy, freezing it on contact and finishes it with an all out crush using its drills, shovel and <b>crane</b> <b>attachments.</b>|$|R

Under the Ordnance Corps these [...] "off the shelf" [...] tractors were meant to tow artillery pieces so were not equipped with blades like their Engineer counterparts. Eventually these were replaced by purpose built [...] "High Speed Tractors" [...] (HST). Some tractors were equipped with <b>crane</b> <b>attachments</b> for ammunition, and material handling.|$|R

50|$|The British Army intends {{upgrading}} its Warriors {{to extend}} their service life to 2025. The Warrior Capability Sustainment Program (WCSP) will involve upgrading 380 of its Warriors with the Warrior Modular Protection System (WMPS) and Warrior Enhanced Electronic Architecture (WEEA). Within that group, 245 vehicles will also be fitted with a new turret and weapon system under the Warrior Fightability Lethality Improvement Program (WFLIP). The remainder, which will be designated as Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicles (ABSV), will lack turrets and carry out field repair and recovery roles using winch and <b>crane</b> <b>attachments.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{modeling}} method of tower <b>crane</b> flexible <b>attachments</b> based on ANSYS is researched for more practical crane. Form-finding {{is used to}} model and analyze flexible attachments and the analytic equations for typical example are derived. Comparing the analytic solutions with ANSYS solutions, the biggest relative error is 0. 45 % which is the foot moment relative error while cantilever beam top transverse force is 5 Ã— 10 5 N. The {{results show that the}} form-finding method accords with engineering practice, and is reliable and suitable for structural analysis of flexible <b>attachment</b> tower <b>crane...</b>|$|R
