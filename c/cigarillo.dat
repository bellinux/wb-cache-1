500|$|Both men {{are portrayed}} as very incompetent, in [...] "Nob and Nobility", it takes Prince George a week {{to put on a}} pair of {{trousers}} by himself, eventually putting them on his head. George relies heavily on Blackadder in the third (Mr. E. Blackadder) series, even while Blackadder despises George for his immense wealth and complete inability to rectify problems in his life. While George is considered [...] "moronic" [...] and [...] "idiotic", he is helpful, loyal, and is aware he is not very intelligent, describing himself as [...] "thick as a whale omelette". In a 2008 retrospective, co-star Stephen Fry said George's keenness for self-improvement was one of the things he felt made the character likeable. In [...] "Duel and Duality," [...] the final episode of the third series, after a sexual encounter with the Duke of Wellington's nieces, this princely incarnation of George is struck by a point-blank shot from the vengeful Wellington's pistol and killed. George briefly awakes, believing that he may have a <b>cigarillo</b> case on him that deflected the blow, but when he realises that he must have left the case at home, promptly falls dead again in Baldrick's arms.|$|E
60|$|Up in the North, {{under the}} cold grey sky, God Almighty {{may be a}} hard taskmaster, and the Kingdom of Heaven is {{attained}} only by much endeavour; but in Cordova these things come more easily. The aged priest walks {{in the sun and}} smokes his <b>cigarillo.</b> Heaven is not such an inaccessible place after all. Evidently he feels that he has done his duty--with the help of Havana tobacco--in that state of life wherein it has pleased a merciful providence to place him; and St. Peter would never be so churlish as to close the golden gates {{in the face of an}} ancient canon who sauntered to them jauntily, with the fag end of a cigarette in the corner of his mouth. Let us cultivate our cabbages in the best of all possible worlds; and afterwards--Dieu pardonnera; c'est son métier.|$|E

50|$|Cigarillos are long, thin cigars, {{somewhat}} {{larger than}} cigarettes but smaller than regular cigars. They may be fitted into a <b>cigarillo</b> holder {{in order to}} be smoked, though they are most often smoked without such a device. Using a cutting tool in order to prepare a <b>cigarillo</b> is less common than with larger cigars, as they are often open on both ends. Cigarillos may be machine-made, although many hand-made versions do exist; the latter are often produced by premium cigar manufacturers.

50|$|Generally, a <b>cigarillo</b> {{contains}} about 3 grams of tobacco, the length varies from 3 to 4 in. (7 - 10 cm) and the diameter is about 6 to 9 mm, usually 8 mm.

50|$|A <b>cigarillo</b> is a machine-made cigar that is {{shorter and}} {{narrower}} than a traditional cigar but larger than little cigars, filtered cigars, and cigarettes, thus similar {{in size and}} composition to small panatela sized cigars, cheroots, and traditional blunts. Cigarillos are usually not filtered, although some have plastic or wood tips, and {{are not meant to}} be inhaled. They are sold in varying quantities: singles, two-packs, three-packs, and five-packs. Cigarillos are very inexpensive: in the United States, usually sold for less than a dollar. Sometimes they are informally called small cigars, mini cigars, or club cigars. Some famous cigar brands, such as Cohiba or Davidoff, also make cigarillos---Cohiba Mini and Davidoff Club Cigarillos, for example. And there are purely <b>cigarillo</b> brands, such as Café Crème, Dannemann Moods, Mehari's, Al Capone, and Swisher Sweets. Cigarillos have a secondary use: they are often used for the making of marijuana cigars.|$|E

40|$|Background: Second hand smoke (ETS) -associated {{particulate}} matter (PM) contributes considerably to indoor air contamination and constitutes a health risk for passive smokers. Easy to measure, PM {{is a useful}} parameter to estimate the dosage of ETS that passive smokers are exposed to. Apart from its suitability as a surrogate parameter for ETS-exposure, PM itself affects human morbidity and mortality in a dose-dependent manner. We think that ETS-associated PM should be considered an independent hazard factor, separately from the many other known harmful compounds of ETS. We believe that brand-specific and tobacco-product-specific differences in the release of PM matter and that these differences are of public interest. Methods: To generate ETS of cigarettes and <b>cigarillos</b> as standardized and reproducible as possible, an automatic second hand smoke emitter (AETSE) was developed {{and placed in a}} glass chamber. L&M cigarettes (“without additives”, “red label”, “blue label”), L&M filtered <b>cigarillos</b> (“red”) and 3 R 4 F standard research cigarettes (as reference) were smoked automatically according to a self-developed, standardized protocol until the tobacco product was smoked down to 8 mm distance from the tipping paper of the filter. Results: Mean concentration (Cmean) and area under the curve (AUC) in a plot of PM 2. 5 against time were measured, and compared. CmeanPM 2. 5 were found to be 518 μg/m 3 for 3 R 4 F cigarettes, 576 μg/m 3 for L&M “without additives” (“red”), 448 μg/m 3 for L&M “blue label”, 547 μg/m 3 for L&M “red label”, and 755 μg/m 3 for L&M filtered <b>cigarillos</b> (“red”). AUCPM 2. 5 -values were 208, 214 μg/m 3 ·s for 3 R 4 F reference cigarettes, 204, 629 μg/m 3 ·s for L&M “without additives” (“red”), 152, 718 μg/m 3 ·s for L&M “blue label”, 238, 098 μg/m 3 ·s for L&M “red label” and 796, 909 μg/m 3 ·s for L&M filtered <b>cigarillos</b> (“red”). Conclusion: Considering the large and significant differences in {{particulate matter}} emissions between cigarettes and <b>cigarillos,</b> we think that a favorable taxation of <b>cigarillos</b> is not justifiable...|$|R
5000|$|In Spanish-speaking countries, {{as well as}} in the Philippines, [...] "cigarrillo" [...] is a cigarette. In the Philippines, it {{is often}} spelt sigarílyo.

5000|$|A blunt is a cigar {{which is}} wider than a <b>cigarillo</b> {{and not quite}} as wide as a Corona.
