5|$|Carbon may burn vigorously and brightly in the {{presence}} of air at high temperatures. Large accumulations of coal, which have remained inert for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of oxygen, may spontaneously <b>combust</b> when exposed to air in coal mine waste tips, ship cargo holds and coal bunkers, and storage dumps.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear {{applications}} where graphite {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} moderator, accumulation of Wigner energy followed by a sudden, spontaneous release may occur. Annealing to at least 250°C can release the energy safely, although in the Windscale fire the procedure went wrong, causing other reactor materials to <b>combust.</b>|$|E
5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously <b>combust</b> when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants due {{to their}} extensive use. <b>Combusted</b> residue from electronic waste (e-waste) combustion {{is one of the}} contamination sources because PBDEs may be deposited in the soil and transported to remote locations. The transport and deposition behaviors of PBDEs released from burning were evaluated by analyzing their concentrations and congener distributions. Total PBDE concentrations were detected in the range from 2379 to 6238 ng/g (dry weight) in the <b>combusted</b> residue samples collected from a large open burning site and from 247. 4 to 1422. 3 ng/g in soil samples collected from different locations close to the open burning site. BDE- 209, 183, 153, 99, and 47 were detected in relative high concentrations in both <b>combusted</b> residue and soil samples. The interpretation of the PBDEs concentrations and congener patterns in the <b>combusted</b> residue and soil samples indicated that PBDEs contamination in soil might be a result of e-waste burning and transportation, and deposit of the <b>combusted</b> residue. The total PBDE concentrations decreased significantly with increasing distance from the burned site, suggesting that the <b>combusted</b> activities were the major source of PBDEs in the region and the transportation behavior of lower brominated congeners might not differ from that of higher brominated congeners for short distances...|$|R

5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously <b>combust)</b> and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational {{life of the}} plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles {{too small to be}} filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{radioactive}} contamination from Rocky Flats came from three sources: a catastrophic fire in 1957, leaking barrels in an outdoor storage area in 1964-1968, and another less severe fire in 1969. Plutonium, {{used to construct}} the weapons' fissile components, can spontaneously <b>combust</b> at room temperatures in air. Additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate pondcrete vitrification attempts and routine releases during the decades of plant operations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously <b>combust,</b> and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E

5|$|Following the setback of HOTOL's cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, {{along with}} John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to {{establish}} their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue {{the development of a}} viable spaceplane and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, REL publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could <b>combust</b> hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight; but again SABRE was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL's RB545 engine Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development. REL has also sought to form ties with other company with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of lubricating oil. The ship's captain {{was concerned about}} having to take the flammable items but was told {{that they had to}} go. A proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously <b>combust.</b> This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|While Manhattan {{is being}} evacuated, a Japanese man named Kunihiko Maeda manages {{to sneak into}} the city, {{witnessing}} a police officer <b>combust</b> into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo, with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried to culture the cells of his wife after {{she was involved in}} a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve may be trying to give birth to an “Ultimate Being”. The next day, the three go to see Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory, Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks a few questions of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave and head for the St. Francis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{steam car}} is a car (automobile) powered by a steam engine. A steam engine is an {{external}} combustion engine (ECE) where the fuel is <b>combusted</b> away from the engine, {{as opposed to an}} internal combustion engine (ICE) where the fuel is <b>combusted</b> within the engine. ECEs have a lower thermal efficiency, but it is easier to regulate carbon monoxide production.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{propellant}} {{flows through}} {{two kinds of}} combustion chambers; the first called preburner and the second called main combustion chamber. In the preburner, {{a small portion of}} propellant is <b>combusted,</b> and the over-pressure produced is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant. In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are <b>combusted</b> completely so to produce thrust.|$|R

25|$|The premixing/prevaporizing {{injectors}} work {{by mixing}} or vaporizing the fuel {{before it reaches}} the combustion zone. This method allows the fuel to be very uniformly mixed with the air, reducing emissions from the engine. One disadvantage of this method is that fuel may auto-ignite or otherwise <b>combust</b> before the fuel-air mixture reaches the combustion zone. If this happens the combustor can be seriously damaged.|$|E
25|$|Between 2002 and 2004, 73% {{of heating}} fires and 27% of all {{residential}} {{fires in the}} United States {{were found to be}} caused by failure to clean out creosote buildup. Since 1990, creosote buildup has caused 75% fewer fires. This is partly due to the use of efficient wood-burning stoves that fully <b>combust</b> the carbon from fuel, and partly due to the use of Class A flues, insulated double wall stainless steel pipe.|$|E
50|$|In the geologically recent past, some coal in the {{formation}} has spontaneously and naturally <b>combusted</b> to form clinker, red and brick-looking burnt coal. These rocks outcrop irregularly and are up to 100 m thick. Clinker is found near deformed zones such as faults or tight folds, and is older than the deformities themselves. They {{are thought to have}} <b>combusted</b> after the development of the Cerrejón thrust fault and alluvial fan.|$|R

25|$|Fires {{start when}} a {{inflammable}} or a combustible material, {{in combination with}} a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, {{and is able to}} sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, an inflammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to <b>combust</b> more readily.|$|E
25|$|Most {{igniters}} in {{gas turbine}} applications are electrical spark igniters, similar to automotive spark plugs. The igniter {{needs to be}} in the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed, but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining and the igniter is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors (see Types of combustors below), the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another, so igniters are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily <b>combust.</b> This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude.|$|E
25|$|Biochar (charcoal {{created by}} {{pyrolysis}} of biomass) {{is a potent}} form of longterm (thousands of years) biosequestration of atmosphereic CO2 derived from investigation of the extremely fertile Terra preta soils of the Amazon Basin. Placing biochar in soils also improves water quality, increases soil fertility, raises agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old growth forests. As a method of generating bio-energy with carbon storage Rob Flanagan and the EPRIDA biochar company have developed low-tech cooking stoves for developing nations that can burn agricultural wastes such as rice husks and produce 15% by weight of biochar; while BEST Energies in NSW Australia have spent a decade developing an Agrichar technology that can <b>combust</b> 96 tonnes of dry biomass each day, generating 30-40 tonnes of biochar. A parametric study of biosequestration by Malcolm Fowles at the Open University, indicated that to mitigate global warming, policies should encourage displacement of coal with biomass as a power source for baseload electricity generation if the latter’s conversion efficiency rose over 30%, otherwise biosequestering carbon from biomass as a cheaper mitigation option than geosequestration by CO2 capture and storage.|$|E

500|$|The {{bond energy}} of difluorine {{is much lower}} than that of either [...] or [...] and similar to the easily cleaved {{peroxide}} bond; this, along with high electronegativity, accounts for fluorine's easy dissociation, high reactivity, and strong bonds to non-fluorine atoms. Conversely, bonds to other atoms are very strong because of fluorine's high electronegativity. Unreactive substances like powdered steel, glass fragments, and asbestos fibers react quickly with cold fluorine gas; wood and water spontaneously <b>combust</b> under a fluorine jet.|$|E

500|$|The early {{motion picture}} {{industry}} primarily used nitrocellulose film stock, commonly called nitrate film. This film is flammable, and produces its own oxygen supply as it burns. Nitrate fires burn rapidly, and cannot typically be extinguished, capable of burning even underwater. Additionally, nitrocellulose {{is subject to}} thermal decomposition and hydrolysis, breaking down over time {{in the presence of}} high temperatures and moisture. This decaying film stock releases nitrogen oxides that themselves contribute to the decay and make the damaged film burn more easily. Under the right conditions, nitrate film can even spontaneously <b>combust.</b> In part because of substantial variability in the manufacturing of early film, there is considerable uncertainty about the circumstances necessary for self-ignition. Sustained temperatures of [...] or higher, large quantities of nitrate film, increased humidity, poor ventilation, and aged or decaying film have all been considered risk factors. Most such fires in film archives have taken place in heat waves during summer months, in closed facilities with limited ventilation, exacerbating several of these variables. Especially in confined areas, such fires can result in explosions.|$|E
