The first specimens observed would later {{come to be}} known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel <b>carbon</b> <b>layer</b> faces near the fiber core. This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber. The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo. In fact, they call it the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.|$|E
25|$|A higher {{cracking}} temperature (also {{referred to}} as severity) favors the production of ethene and benzene, whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of propene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. The process also results in the slow deposition of coke, a form of carbon, on the reactor walls. This degrades {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, so reaction conditions are designed to minimize this. Nonetheless, a steam cracking furnace can usually only run for a few months at a time between de-cokings. Decokes require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This converts the hard solid <b>carbon</b> <b>layer</b> to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Once this reaction is complete, the furnace can be returned to service.|$|E

The earliest radiocarbon date extracted from the mosque belongs to a burnt tree stump, which dates back to 703-848 cal AD.

40|$|Laser Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{is quite}} sensitive {{to detect the}} changes of graphite structure. In this study, the Laser Raman technique was applied to analyze the deposited <b>carbon</b> <b>layers</b> on TEXTOR test limiters of carbon (C) and tungsten (W) produced by intentional carbon deposition experiments by methane gas puffing. The <b>carbon</b> deposited <b>layers</b> showed the Raman spectra composed of two broad peaks, G-peak and D-peak, centered at around 1580 and 1355 cm(- 1) respectively. For W limiter, the G-peak position and the integrated intensity of the two peaks well correlate to hydrogen concentrations in the deposited <b>carbon</b> <b>layers</b> and their thicknesses, respectively. Hence Laser Raman spectroscopy is a promising tool for the in situ analysis of <b>carbon</b> redeposit <b>layers</b> on plasma facing W materials and probably on Be materials. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|The fuel used in HTGRs is coated fuel {{particles}}, such as TRISO fuel particles. Coated fuel particles have fuel kernels, {{usually made}} of uranium dioxide, however, uranium carbide or uranium oxycarbide are also possibilities. Uranium oxycarbide combines uranium carbide with the uranium dioxide {{to reduce the}} oxygen stoichiometry. Less oxygen may lower the internal pressure in the TRISO particles caused by the formation of carbon monoxide, due to the oxidization of the porous <b>carbon</b> <b>layer</b> in the particle. The TRISO particles are either dispersed in a pebble for the pebble bed design or molded into compacts/rods that are then inserted into the hexagonal graphite blocks. The QUADRISO fuel concept conceived at Argonne National Laboratory {{has been used to}} better manage the excess of reactivity.|$|E
5000|$|Recent advancements in {{modified}} porous nano-crystalline {{films have}} enabled {{the creation of}} electrochromic display. The single substrate display structure consists of several stacked porous layers printed {{on top of each}} other on a substrate modified with a transparent conductor (such as ITO or PEDOT:PSS). Each printed layer has a specific set of functions. A working electrode consists of a positive porous semiconductor (say Titanium Dioxide, [...] ) with adsorbed chromogens (different chromogens for different colors). These chromogens change color by reduction or oxidation. A passivator is used as the negative of the image to improve electrical performance. The insulator layer serves the purpose of increasing the contrast ratio and separating the working electrode electrically from the counter electrode. The counter electrode provides a high capacitance to counterbalances the charge inserted/extracted on the SEG electrode (and maintain overall device charge neutrality). Carbon is an example of charge reservoir film. A conducting <b>carbon</b> <b>layer</b> is typically used as the conductive back contact for the counter electrode. In the last printing step, the porous monolith structure is overprinted with a liquid or polymer-gel electrolyte, dried, and then may be incorporated into various encapsulation or enclosures, depending on the application requirements. Displays are very thin, typically 30 micrometer, or about 1/3 of a human hair. The device can be switched on by applying an electrical potential to the transparent conducting substrate relative to the conductive <b>carbon</b> <b>layer.</b> This causes a reduction of viologen molecules (coloration) to occur inside the working electrode. By reversing the applied potential or providing a discharge path, the device bleaches. A unique feature of the electrochromic monolith is the relatively low voltage (around 1 Volt) needed to color or bleach the viologens. This can be explained by the small over- potentials needed to drive the electrochemical reduction of the surface adsorbed viologens/chromogens.|$|E
40|$|The optical {{properties}} of differently textured pyrolytic carbon films were quantitatively analyzed by polarized light microscopy.

These calculations are not only essential for an understanding of the characterization of pyrolytic carbon films by polarized light microscopy but also for an understanding of the correlation between extinction angles measured for flat and for cylindrical pyrolytic <b>carbon</b> <b>layers.</b> Pyrolytic <b>carbon</b> films deposited on flat cordierite substrates were studied by polarized light microscopy.

For the magnetically very soft films, single iron crystallites were found to cross the entire film thickness.

He found the <b>carbon</b> <b>layer</b> and the bone fragments and believed it {{to be from the}} Migration Age, which newer dating techniques later proved correct. There was great interest in the excavation; seats were built for the public to watch. In the first season, the top layer of logs were laid bare and samples taken. Shafts were dug into the mound in two directions, named the 'East Front' and 'West Front' in view of the wartime situation. Before work could resume at the site, Norway had been occupied by Nazi Germany. The German scholar Herbert Jankuhn sought to place the second season's digging {{under the direction of the}} Ahnenerbe, which would have entitled the Germans to claim any finds, but Anton Wilhelm Brøgger, director of the Museum of National Antiquities, obtained the necessary funds from Norwegian sources and the second season's digging was supervised by Norwegians and carried out by unemployed young men.|$|E
5000|$|Partial {{reduction}} can {{be achieved}} by treating the suspended graphene oxide with hydrazine hydrate at 100 °C for 24 hours, [...] by exposing graphene oxide to hydrogen plasma for a few seconds, or by exposure to a strong pulse of light, such as that of a Xenon flash. Due to the oxidation protocol, manifold defects already present in graphene oxide hamper the effectiveness of the reduction. Thus, the graphene quality obtained after reduction is limited by the precursor quality (graphene oxide) and the efficiency of the reducing agent. However, the conductivity of the graphene obtained by this route is below 10 S/cm, and the charge mobility is between 0.1 and 10 cm2/Vs. These values are much greater than the oxide's, but still a few orders of magnitude lower than those of pristine graphene. Recently, the synthetic protocol for graphite oxide was optimized and almost intact graphene oxide with a preserved carbon framework was obtained. Reduction of this almost intact graphene oxide performs much better and the mobility values of charge carriers exceeds 1000 cm2/Vs for the best quality of flakes. Inspection with the atomic force microscope shows that the oxygen bonds distort the <b>carbon</b> <b>layer,</b> creating a pronounced intrinsic roughness in the oxide layers which persists after reduction. These defects also show up in Raman spectra of graphene oxide.|$|E
