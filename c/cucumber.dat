5|$|<b>Cucumber</b> {{focuses on}} the life of the middle-aged Henry Best (Vincent Franklin) and the fallout from a {{disastrous}} date with his boyfriend of nine years, and is accompanied with Banana, an E4 anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum {{on the periphery of the}} <b>Cucumber</b> narrative, and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing modern sex, sexuality and issues arisen during the show with the cast and public. The three names reference a urological scale categorising the male erection by hardness from tofu to <b>cucumber,</b> and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between the two generations. Although <b>Cucumber</b> was designed as a self-contained serial focusing {{on the life of}} one man, Davies envisioned Banana as open-ended with the potential to continue after its sister series finished.|$|E
5|$|The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, {{being found}} only in the {{oesophagus}} of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves. When the sea <b>cucumber</b> sucks in sediment, the bivalve allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea <b>cucumber</b> is unharmed.|$|E
5|$|After {{his partner}} {{developed}} cancer in late 2011, Davies {{returned to the}} UK, and co-created the CBBC drama, Wizards vs Aliens, which aired from 2012 to 2014. He created <b>Cucumber,</b> a Channel 4 series about middle-aged gay men in the Manchester gay scene; Banana, an E4 series about young LGBT people in the <b>Cucumber</b> universe; and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing issues which have arisen in the sister series, modern sex and sexuality with the cast and public. All three shows aired in 2015 for a single series.|$|E
50|$|In May 2011, <b>cucumbers</b> {{infected}} with E. coli were {{claimed to have}} caused the deaths of at least ten people, leading to some retailers withdrawing <b>cucumbers</b> from sale in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic.

However, subsequent testing failed to show contamination in imported Spanish <b>cucumbers,</b> which led to the Spanish Government demanding compensation for Spanish farmers who had been forced to destroy huge quantities of <b>cucumbers.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} a software prototype for <b>cucumbers</b> selection and grading by applying Standard Backpropagation Neural Network (SBPNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), <b>cucumber</b> beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed in itself, it hosts {{a number of}} insects and diseases, including both pests and beneficial insects. It is also a potential reservoir of the <b>cucumber</b> mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E
5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, <b>cucumber</b> beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E

50|$|Most people {{report a}} mild, almost watery or light melon aroma and flavor of <b>cucumbers</b> {{resulting}} from compounds called (E,Z)-nona-2,6-dienal, (Z)-2-nonenal and (E)-2-nonenal. The slightly bitter taste of <b>cucumbers</b> results from cucurbitacins.|$|R
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cucurbita are {{susceptible}} to some types of mosaic virus including: <b>Cucumber</b> mosaic virus (CMV), Papaya ringspot virus-cucurbit strain (PRSV), Squash mosaic virus (SqMV), Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV), and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV). PRSV {{is the only one}} of these viruses that does not affect all cucurbits. SqMV and CMV are the most common viruses among cucurbits. Symptoms of these viruses show a high degree of similarity, which often results in laboratory investigation being needed to differentiate which one is affecting plants.|$|E

This version was a favorite selection among customers at The Table Creekside in Sarasota, Florida.

25|$|Together {{with sea}} <b>cucumbers</b> (Holothuroidea), {{they make up}} the subphylum Echinozoa, which is {{characterized}} by a globoid shape without arms or projecting rays.

5|$|In {{the time}} that Gates was there, {{research}} focused mainly on honey production, brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the <b>cucumber</b> and cranberry industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities {{from day to day}} as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research, with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E

The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers.

Rates of midday sediment defecation (mean: 23 g h− 1) and short-term displacements (mean: 60 cm h− 1) by the hosts were not significantly affected by the number of echinoderm commensals they carried. The frequent relationships at the location suggest that such facultative commensalism between echinoderms could be more common than previously understood. Appreciable numbers of scaleworms, crabs and shrimps on the sea <b>cucumbers</b> show that sea <b>cucumbers</b> can act as hosts to echinoderms and other epibiotic taxa, bolstering the notion that they play important ecological roles in reef ecosystems...|$|R
