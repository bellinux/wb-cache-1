40|$|Routes to novel heterocyclic azo {{compounds}} and components of use as potential inkjet dyes were investigated. A new route to fluorenones from biphenyl acid chlorides using FVP (Flash Vacuum Pyrolysis) has been discovered. Fluorenone and 4 -methylfluoren- 9 -one were prepared by FVP of 2 -phenylbenzoyl chloride and 2 -methylbiphenyl- 2 -carbonyl chloride respectively. Xanthen- 9 -one and thioxanthen- 9 -one were also prepared by FVP from the corresponding acid chlorides. 9 -Phenanthrol {{could also be}} prepared via the FVP of biphenylacetyl choride {{and the application of}} this method to a heterocylic thiophene system afforded naphtho[1, 2 -b]thiophen- 4 -ol. Naphtho[2, 1 -b]thiophen- 4 -ol and naphtho[1, 2 -b]furan- 4 -ol could be obtained in low yields by the FVP of (2 -thiophen- 3 -ylphenyl) acetic acid methyl ester and (2 -furan- 2 -ylphenyl) acetic acid methyl ester over a tungsten trioxide catalyst. Coupling of these systems with the diazonium salt of Acid Yellow 9 afforded the corresponding azo compounds. New heterocyclic dyes were also prepared from the condensation of heterocyclic hydrazines with 4, 9 -disulfophenanthrenequinone. Pyridine, pyridazine, phthalazine, isoquinoline and 2 -quinoline disulfophenanthrene quinone metallised 2 : 1 nickel complexed magenta dyes were prepared. Industrial tests by standard methods revealed the pyridazine dye has a particularly impressive balance of light and ozone fastness over similar magenta dyes. The reaction of an arylnitro compound with 2 -aminopyridine appeared to be an attractive and high yielding route to 2 -(phenylazo) pyridine. However, application of this reaction to substituted and naphthalene systems failed. This afforded byproducts due to nucleophilic substitution of groups such as methoxy and the relatively uncommon nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen with none of the required azo products obtained. Therefore it appeared that the reaction of a nitro and amine was not a robust and versatile route to heterocyclic azo compounds. An alternate route to heterocyclic azo compounds involved the use of the Mills reaction by the condensation o-anisidine, p-chloroaniline, 2 -aminophenol, 3 - aminophenol, naphthylamine, 8 -amnioquinoline and 2 -acetylamino- 5 -aminobenzenesulfonic acid with 2 -nitrosopyridine afforded the heterocyclic azo products in moderate to high yields. The Mills reaction does appear to be the favored route to heterocyclic azo compounds. Several factors were identified which affect the process of bisazo coupling of chromotropic acid and products obtained. Reaction at the ipso position of monoPACAs (2 -phenylazochromotropic acid) leading to increased yields of the ipso substitution monoPACA by-product as opposed to the expected bisazo <b>coupling</b> <b>position</b> was a major problem. Studies indicated reactivity at the ipso position was greatly reduced by the presence of electron withdrawing groups around the phenyl ring of the monoPACA. Further study indicated reaction at the bisazo <b>coupling</b> <b>position</b> increased with the strength of the diazonium salt used in bisazo coupling. Therefore the electronic nature of the monoPACA starting material and the diazonium salt used in bisazo coupling greatly affected the products obtained. Reaction pH studies also revealed attack at the bisazo <b>coupling</b> <b>position</b> increases with pH and at lower pH (5. 0 – 8. 0) attack at the ipso position dominated. Reactivity of the monoPACA starting material also increased with pH. The influence of steric effects upon bisazo coupling revealed, in the cases where ortho sulfonic acid groups were present in the monoPACA, a reduction in attack at the ipso position. Hence the reaction appeared to be directed towards the required bisazo <b>coupling</b> <b>position.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{dendritic}} filtering on the existence, stability, and robustness of phase-locked states to heterogeneity and noise in a pair of electrically coupled ball-and-stick neurons with passive dendrites. We use the theory of weakly coupled oscillators and analytically derived filtering properties of the dendritic coupling to systematically explore how the electrotonic length and diameter of dendrites can alter phase-locking. In the case of a fixed value of the coupling conductance (g c) taken from the literature, we find that repeated exchanges in stability between the synchronous and anti-phase states can occur as the electrical coupling becomes more distally located on the dendrites. However, the robustness of the phase-locked states in this case decreases rapidly towards zero as the distance between the electrical coupling and the somata increases. Published estimates of g c are calculated from the experimentally measured coupling coefficient (CC) based on a single-compartment description of a neuron, and therefore may be severe underestimates of g c. With this in mind, we re-examine the stability and robustness of phase-locking using a fixed value of CC, which imposes a limit on the maximum distance the electrical coupling can be located away from the somata. In this case, although the phase-locked states remain robust over the entire range of possible coupling locations, no exchanges in stability with changing <b>coupling</b> <b>position</b> are observed except for a single exchange that occurs {{in the case of a}} high somatic firing frequency and a large dendritic radius. Thus, our analysis suggests that multiple exchanges in stability with changing coupling location are unlikely to be observed in real neural systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

Supplying electricity to remote off grid areas like villages around Leticia, Colombia is often interrelated with high costs and geographical limitations. Today most of the electricity demand is met through the usage of diesel generators. The generators are easy to use and have a relatively reliable functionality. However, fuel is expensive and there are other negative aspects as fumes and sound pollution. In order to provide a cleaner, more reliable and cost efficient alternative the company Jabe Energy AB has in cooperation with the volunteer organization Ankarstiftelsen developed a new type of hydrokinetic turbine (slow moving none damming turbine). Previous studies have shown that there is potential for hydrokinetic turbines to increase their power output simply by their relative placement (coupling potential). That is, {{it might be possible to}} extrude more power from a system where two hydrokinetic turbines are placed in a close relation rather than being completely separated. Since the turbine investigated is newly developed there have been no previous studies regarding its specific coupling potential. To investigate this potential given the conditions in the Amazon basin, a field study is conducted where measurements on water velocity at different heights in the water column is collected.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{piezoelectric}} thin film actuation of RF MEMS devices. lt is demonstrated that piezoelectric actuation using silicon structures with integrated PZT thin film {{is suitable for}} RF MEMS switches and mechanical filters. Both these devices are studied, fabricated and tested. To assist the mechanical design of a piezoelectric microswitch an electrical model is developed, from which design parameters can be derived to meet the requirement of an insertion loss of - 1 dB and an isolation loss of - 40 dB at 4 GHz. The model shows how the switching gap and the overlapping dimension are two key parameters and the ratio between the two should be larger than 0. 15. Switching gaps are chosen as 5 m and 7. 5 m from the designed range of 3 ~ 15 m. An equivalent circuit network incorporating a transmission line model of the coupling beam is developed to demonstrate a design method for the mechanical filter. The model reveals that the coupling beam stiffness, <b>coupling</b> <b>position,</b> electromechanical coupling factor and the quality factor of the piezoelectric cantilever have substantial effects on filter characteristics. A narrower/wider bandwidth with higher/lower filter Q can result if the <b>coupling</b> <b>position</b> is near/further to a cantilever's anchor position. Extreme situations of the above two coupling cases result in filter bandwidth's disappearing and filter centre frequency's shifting. For a desired filter insertion loss source and load resistances need {{to be determined by}} quality factors of terminal circuit and coupled resonators. A bulk micromachining process compatible with the integration of PZT thin film onto silicon is developed. ln general, for PZT pattern size above 100 m wet etching could give satisfactory pattern definition, however for pattern size below 50 m dry etching is needed. To etch a thickness 2 1 m PZT film long dry etching lime demands for the survivability of a masking material. ln this study a technique combined of dry and wet etching is developed for a 1 m PZT film. lt is found that a low pressure promotes a higher etch rate and the best etching conditions are a gas mixture with a composition of 1 / 4 for CHF 3 /Ar at a total gas flow of 25 sccm under a RF power of 150 W. Dry etching is also developed to release cantilevers from the buried S 102 layer with conditions of a gas mixture of 13 sccm CHF 3 and 3 sccm 02 at 80 mTorr and a RF power of 100 W in 30 mins for 1 m Si 02. To be compatible with PZT elements silicon cantilevers are processed using deep reactive ion etching. PZT thin film actuation has been demonstrated successfully with PZI' thin film integrated silicon cantilevers. A static deflection of 2. 89 m is measured at an actuating voltage of 20 V for a 100 m wide and 450 m long cantilever. A displacement of 556 nm at 12. 98 kHz resonance is measured for a 200 m wide and 850 m long cantilever under a 10 mV AC plus a 10 V DC. A piezoelectric strain constant d 31 of 30. 15 pC/N has been obtained for the PZT thin film used in this study. Filter resonant modes and impedance responses are measured. The filter concept design is justified by the obtained results. Using the impedance data the electromechanical coupling factor, filter centre frequency, filter bandwidth and filter Q are determined. There is a good agreement between the measured and calculated filter centre frequencies. At the first filter resonant mode a maximum piezoelectric coupling factor of 0. 19 and a maximum resonator-Q of 235 are recorded. At the second filter resonant mode a maximum of 0. 12 and a maximum resonator-Q of 360 are obtained. Results show smaller coupling factors than required at the 13 ' and 2 " centre frequencies for all measured filters. This implies that pass bands of designed filters will be missing from their responses at the 18 ' and 2 " centre frequencies. Design improvements are given in the relevant results discussions. Residual stresses are studied for deflected cantilevers after release. The tensile stress of PZT, the converted tensile stress of Pt and the compressive stress of remaining buried SiO 2 layer could result in the upwards-deflected cantilevers. The compressive stress of P could compensate the tensile stress of PZT and flatten the cantilever beam. lf the buried SiO 2 layer is removed incompletely or if the tensile stress of PZT layer is very high, then upwards-deflected cantilevers would result. Measurements of the most switch cantilevers show larger initial deflections than the designed switching gaps. Finally, conclusions and suggestions of future work are given...|$|E
40|$|Nanoscale {{wires and}} {{molecules}} have remarkable electrical properties {{that make them}} well suited for new electronic devices. The projected device densities result in very small separation distances and therefore the possibility of device-device interactions. However, {{we do not know}} what impacts wire-wire interactions might have on the properties of closely spaced devices. If two quantum wires interact, what types of effects will there be on transport properties such as conductance? How would the coupling strength, length of wire, position of contact, or the energy of the electrons affect conductance? Understanding the effects of the interactions will assist the construction of efficient nanoscale devices. This thesis examined the effects of interaction on the low-field conductance using a simple classical model and two quantum models of coupled quantum wires fabricated electrostatically in the two-dimensional electron gas at the interface of the heterostructure A 1 GaAs/GaAs. We considered the effect of position and length of an interaction between two parallel quantum wires formed by hard wall boundaries and connected to electron reservoirs. Our second model consisted of two artificial molecular wires, i. e., parallel chains of quantum dots. We used a one-electron Schrodinger equation in the envelope approximation, a tight-binding Hamiltonian, and a recursive Green's function method to study the electron transport properties. Multi-parameter computations using a fortran- 95 computer model provided data for an analysis of the relationships among conductance, the interaction strength, interaction location, and electron energy. In contrast to the monotonic changes predicted by the classical model, the lowfield conductance of interacting hard wall quantum wires varies in an oscillatory manner with the perturbing interaction strength and position. For electron energies below the first conductance plateau, Breit-Wigner resonances appear as a consequence of coupling. These conductance properties are explained with reference to quasi-bound states created by reflections at the end boundaries of the wires and the separating wall. At low electron energies, the conductance signature of a symmetric artificial molecule composed of serial quantum dots is a band of resonances. Coupled artificial molecular wires display a split-off molecular band with an energy separation that grows with the coupling strength and a bandwidth that narrows. The position of the Fermi energy relative to the molecular band states plays a dominant role in determining the lowfield conductance of interacting artificial molecules. The conductance variation with coupling ranges from oscillatory to monotonic, depending on the Fermi energy. Varying the atom-atom <b>coupling</b> <b>position</b> in the molecular wires causes a relatively small shift in the resonance band energies. Department of Physics and AstronomyThesis (M. S. ...|$|E
50|$|The coupler {{face has}} a {{protruding}} cone and a matching cup. Inside the cone {{there is a}} rigid metal hoop connected to a revolving, spring-loaded metal disk with a notch on the opposite side. When ready to couple, the spring turns the disk so the hoop is extended from the cone; as the cars meet the hoop enters the cup on the other coupler, stopping against the disk. The hoops are then pressed back into their own coupler, causing the disks to rotate until the notches align with the hoops. After the hoops have entered the notches the disks spring back into the hoop extended <b>position,</b> locking the <b>coupling.</b> In the <b>coupled</b> <b>position</b> forces on the hoops and disk will balance out, {{which means that the}} Scharfenberg is not dependent on heavy latches to stay locked as many other couplers are.|$|R
