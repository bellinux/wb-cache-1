40|$|For {{producing}} oil {{remains that}} remained at old oil wells (mature field), {{a method of}} advanced oil acquirement improvement known as an Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) should be applied. Surfactant {{plays an important role}} in EOR process by reducing interfacial tension (IFT), altering wettability, reducing oil viscosity, and stabilizing dispersion to facilitate the process of oil jetting from reservoir to production well. To optimally <b>cleanse</b> <b>oil</b> that still remained a surfactant compatible with formation water and reservoir is needed. This study was conducted to get the best time of sulfonation process for producing MES surfactant with lower interfacial tension for EOR application. Results showed that the best times of sulfonation process with lower interfacial tension value were 3 and 4 hour...|$|R
30|$|In the future, {{oil shale}} {{will be an}} {{important}} energy resource. Froth flotation is a new method increasing the usability of oil shale. In this paper, oil shale samples were characterized based on their mineral composition, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, size distribution, and density analysis. In addition, the flotation performance of oil shale was investigated. The effects of pulp concentration, agitation speed, aeration rate, and the type of reagents on the flotation performance were explored. Analysis of the samples’ characteristics indicates that <b>cleansed</b> <b>oil</b> shale is highly usable. The optimal flotation performance occurred for a pulp concentration of 50  g/L, a collector dosage of 1000  g/t, a frother dosage of 300  g/t, an agitation speed of 1900  rpm, and an aeration rate of 160  L/h. Froth flotation is a mature method and is widely used, and thus, {{it can be used to}} improve the industrial production of oil shale.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>cleansing</b> method, often {{abbreviated}} as OCM, is {{a system}} for cleaning a human face using oil(s). Sometimes, oils can be mixed; one example is 50% {{extra virgin olive oil}} and 50% castor oil. This mixture can be optimized based on skin type and personal preference.|$|R
50|$|The {{company began}} in 1946 when Estée Lauder {{and her husband}} Joseph Lauder began {{producing}} cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: <b>Cleansing</b> <b>Oil,</b> Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.|$|E
50|$|Records {{of the use}} of {{cosmetics}} in Korea {{date back}} to the time of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, and the use of makeup flourished during the Goryeo kingdom. Cosmetics were made from lotions extracted from plants, including gourd stems; Ground mung bean contains saponin and was helpful for <b>cleansing.</b> Castor <b>oils</b> and camellia oils were used as hair oil. They had a pleasant smell and were not sticky. To moisturise and add gloss to the skin, safflower oil was used. Apricot and peach oils were used to remove freckles and liver spots. A powder called 'mibun' or 'baekbun' was made from ground rice and millet blended with water or oil.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} achieve a {{perfectly}} even skin tone, Korean women {{go so far as}} to perform a daily 8 to 10-step skincare routine. Traditionally, these extensive routines include makeup remover, double <b>cleansing</b> (i.e. consecutive <b>oil</b> and water-based <b>cleansing),</b> exfoliator, toner, essence (lightweight hydrating concentrates), treatments (boosters, serums, ampoules), sheet masks (thin cotton sheets doused in a liquid-based formula that claims to moisturize, brighten, and even treat fine lines), eye cream, moisturizer and sunscreen.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When {{oil spills}} {{in the coastal}} environment, the spilled oil may {{interact}} with the suspended particulate matter {{in the water column}} to form oil-SPM aggregates (OSAs). This process has been recognized to enhance natural <b>cleansing</b> of <b>oiled</b> shorelines. This laboratory study was conducted using SPM samples with different particle size distribution and mineral composition, two crude oil samples, filtered natural seawater, and a reciprocating shaker. The sediment-to-oil ratio was kept constant to 1 in all the experiments. The oil trapped in negatively buoyant OSAs was measured using an Infrared Oil Content Analyzer. Results showed that OSA formation increased with the decrease of the sediment size, the maximum oil trapped in settled OSAs was 182 mg oil / g sediment when OSAs were formed with kaolinite and CST 180 crude oil...|$|R
50|$|In {{accordance}} with skin type variations, castor oil {{may be too}} harsh in some skin-care regimens and is sometimes used in a 1:9 ratio. However, overly oily skin can make use of {{a larger proportion of}} castor oil. Other oils that are commonly used are jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, coconut oil, argan oil, rosehip oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and grapeseed oil. Furthermore, some sources say that the <b>oil</b> <b>cleansing</b> method is not viable for sensitive skin.|$|R
50|$|Eucalyptus oil {{is used in}} flavouring. Cineole-based {{eucalyptus}} oil {{is used as a}} flavouring at low levels (0.002%) in various products, including baked goods, confectionery, meat products and beverages. Eucalyptus oil has antimicrobial activity against a broad range of foodborne human pathogens and food spoilage microorganisms. Non-cineole peppermint gum, strawberry gum and lemon ironbark are also used as flavouring. Eucalyptus oil is also used as a fragrance component to impart a fresh and clean aroma in soaps, detergents, lotions, and perfumes. It is known for its pungent, intoxicating scent. Due to its <b>cleansing</b> properties, Eucalyptus <b>oil</b> is found in mouthrinses to freshen breath.|$|R
50|$|K-Beauty is an {{umbrella}} term for skin-care products {{that derive from}} South Korea. The fad gained popularity worldwide, particularly in the U.S., in 2016 and focuses on health, hydration and a preferred lack of pigment. Products used include ingredients such as snail slime, morphing masks, bee venom (an anti-inflammatory “faux-tox” alleged to relax facial muscles), moisturizing starfish extract, and pig collagen. The regimen involves {{a series of steps}} including <b>cleansing</b> rituals (with <b>oil</b> and water based products), sheet masks, essences, s, moisturizers, cushion compacts, fermented products, and SPF 35 sunscreen. At night, the sunscreen is replaced by a “sleep cream”. Each regimen is addressed differently depending on complexion factors including hormonal fluctuations and lifestyle choices.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Environmental {{pollution}} by petroleum is {{an increasing}} global problem with phytoremediation {{being one of the}} viable tools for <b>cleansing</b> crude <b>oil</b> polluted soil. The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain the remediating effect of Piper guineense and Azadirachta indica on the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) on the leaves of deliberately crude oil polluted germinating Telfairia occidentalis. Vessel I contains growing plant and water only, vessel II contains growing plant + crude oil only, vessel III, IV and V had growing plant+crude oil + 100 g of Azadirachta indica, 77 g of P. guineense and 100 g of Azadirachta indica + 77 g of P. guineense leaves respectively. After 8 weeks of plant growth, the levels of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the plants were determined using gas chromatography. The result indicates that naphthalene levels were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in plants grown on vessels with 77 g P. guineense (4. 2 ± 0. 003 µg/Kg) and 77 g P. guineense + 100 g A. indica (4. 2 ± 0. 007 µg/Kg) compared to the crude oil only vessel (2. 1 ± 0. 003 µg/Kg). Phenanthrene levels were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) in plants grown on vessels with 100 g A. indica (1. 7 ± 0. 002 µg/Kg) compared to levels in crude oil only grown plants (2. 2 ± 0. 003 µg/Kg). Acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene benzo(k) fluoranthene and benzo(a) pyrene levels were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in plants grown in vessels III,IV and V compared to the crude oil only vessel. Also, dibenzo(a,b) anthracene and indenol(1, 2, 3 cd) pyrene levels were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) in plants grown on vessels remediated with 100 g A. indica and 77 g P. guineense + 100 g A. indica when compared with plants grow...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Standard {{protocols}} for autologous fat transfer involve centrifugation of the lipoaspirate {{for better}} separation. But {{the effect of}} the centrifugal forces on cell viability and possible induction of apoptosis is discussed controversially in current literature. In addition to this, several questions regarding basic biochemical properties of the transplant remain unanswered. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -BB have been shown to improve transplantation results, but there is still no data on the content of those in lipoaspirate used for lipofilling. METHODS: We have examined the viability of adipocytes in lipoaspirates after centrifugation by 8 different accelerations up to 20. 000 xg immediately after the respective centrifugation as well as after 4 days of cultivation by staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide. The content of bFGF, IGF, VEGF and PDGF-BB in freshly aspirated adipose tissue and the presence of those factors in the various fractions after centrifugation was measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay readings. Growth factor content was also analyzed after storage periods of 3 and 5 days. RESULTS: No significant alterations in the viability of differently centrifuged adipocytes were found. There are significantly interindividual varying quantities of bFGF, IGF- 1, VEGF, and PDGF-BB in the lipoaspirate harvested for transplantation. Separation by centrifugation and discarding of the infranatant and supernatant fluid means that most of the growth factors are left in the transplant. The growth factor content in the other fractions was significantly lower. Lipoaspirate can be cultured for several days, with the tissue remaining biologically active and producing significant growth factor levels. CONCLUSION: Our results show that centrifugation, {{as a part of the}} protocol of lipofilling, has no effect on the survival rate of isolated adipocytes in the purified fat. In contrast, lipoaspirates centrifuged with higher accelerations seem to be better <b>cleansed</b> of <b>oil.</b> The knowledge of the naturally occurring range for these growth factor quantities is a plausible explanation for the volume reduction often found after lipofilling procedures...|$|R
40|$|Sena-Graph syrup has {{recently}} been formulated by an Iranian pharmaceutical company for being used in bowel evacuation before radiography, colonoscopy and surgery. This study compares the efficacy, adverse effects and patient compliance of two bowel preparation regimens with castor oil and Sena-Graph syrup in of outpatients for Intravenous Urography (IVU). One hundred and fourteen consecutive outpatients were randomized to receive either the standard bowel preparation with 60 mL of castor oil or the test method with 60 mL of Sena-Graph syrup before IVU examination. Demographic data of patients and their prior bowel preparation experience were collected before the examination. Two radiologists, blinded to the method of bowel preparation, reviewed the radiographs and graded the bowel preparation. The compliance and acceptability of both regimens were assessed by using structured questionnaires filled by the patients. The Numbers, ages, weights and gender distribution of patients and their prior bowel preparation experience {{in the two groups}} did not differ significantly. The cleanliness scores for the castor oil and Sena-Graph group were 3. 97 ± 0. 971 and 4. 87 ± 0. 917, respectively. The results indicated that Sena-Graph syrup causes a better bowel <b>cleansing</b> compared castor <b>oil.</b> Adverse effects in Sena-Graph groups were significantly lower than the castor oil group. Acceptability of the regimen in patients who used Sena-Graph was higher than the other group. The Sena-Graph regimen is significantly more effective and better tolerated than of Castor oil regimen in bowel cleansing. The incidence and severity of the adverse effects from Castor oil was higher than Sena-Graph...|$|R
