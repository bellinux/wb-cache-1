Wuvulu speakers use a realis mood to <b>convey</b> <b>past</b> tense as speakers can be certain about events that have occurred. In some cases, realis mood is used to convey present tense — often to indicate a state of being. Wuvulu speakers use an irrealis mood to convey future tense.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses a {{corpus of}} tokens retrieved from broadcast news stories and print news articles {{to examine the}} array of constructions used to encode stative predications in Modern Standard Arabic. A state {{is defined as a}} situation that includes its reference time, whether that time is encoding time or another time of orientation. A range of stativity diagnostics are implemented. The constructions analyzed include both those that select for the class of states and those that yield various stative construals of otherwise dynamic predications. The constructions examined range from inflectional constructions to verb-headed phrasal patterns to verbless predicates; a lexicalist implementation of Construction Grammar, Sign Based Construction Grammar, provides a uniform format for representing the constructions as feature-structure descriptions. The constructions include: the p(refix) -stem verb, an inflectional construction exhibiting considerable semantic and syntactic flexibility; participles, including both the Active Participle, which typically yields a progressive reading and sometimes a perfect reading, and the Passive Participle, which yields a perfect reading; non-verbal predicates, which denote various stative relations, including existence, property attribution, possession and deontic modality; and phrasal constructions headed by the auxiliary kāna, which are used to <b>convey</b> <b>past</b> states, irrealis states and resultant states, while serving as a copula in syntactic contexts requiring a copula. A final case study underlines the formal and semantic heterogeneity of the class of Arabic stativizers by examining an emergent idiomatic pattern, the yatimmu construction, which has either a progressive function or a perfect function, depending primarily on subordination. The dissertation shows that in Arabic news narratives, users deploy distinct stative constructions in distinct contexts to convey whatever state is relevant in the context. It demonstrates that constructions convey both tense-based notions (like state ongoing at encoding time) and aspectual notions (state ongoing at the time of another event invoked by the text). In addition, it demonstrates that aspectual constructions are not ‘merely’ aspectual, but instead have constraints relating to argument structure, valency and subordination. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation investigates post-completion auditing (PCA) of capital investments and organizational learning (OL). The empirical {{data in this}} cross-sectional field study is primarily based on interviews conducted in the 30 largest Finnish manufacturing companies. The dissertation consists of an introduction and three articles covering different aspects of PCA and OL. The first article examines reasons for the non-adoption of PCA. It specifically analyses and maps alternate capital investment controls (ACICs) that enable evaluation {{of the success of}} an investment and the enhancement of OL and draws upon the concept of equifinality to discuss the role of ACICs in discouraging PCA adoption. Drawing on the concepts of cybernetic control systems, the second article assesses the significance of PCA in measuring performance and controlling current investments (assisting correction and abandonment decisions), enhancing the integrity of investment appraisals, and in evaluating personnel. Additionally, the paper examines the beneficial effects of PCA related to organizational learning. The third article investigates whether or not the design of PCA systems provides a platform for organizational learning. First, with the aid of Huber’s (1991) categorisation of OL constructs and the PCA literature, an OL-conducive PCA design was synthesised. It was then used as a benchmark for investigating PCA practices in the companies that were the focus of this study. The results confirm prior literature that enhancing OL is the major reason for PCA and that the major perceived benefits of PCA are related to OL. The empirical evidence supports that the benefits that result from double-loop type learning which are related to future capital investments, are the major advantages of PCA, whereas PCA can be marginally beneficial in assisting problem detecting and solving (single-loop learning) for current investments. The findings of the study support the contention that PCA system sophistication can have an important role in facilitating (or hindering) OL. Specifically, organizational-memory-related aspects, such as adequate filing of PCA results and convenient access to them, can aid a company to effectively <b>convey</b> <b>past</b> investment experiences to new projects. Additionally, the results suggest that alternate capital investment controls (ACICs) can have a major role in explaining PCA practices in companies. The ACICs identified in this study include formal and informal systems and procedures specifically for performance measurement (e. g. following up production key figures, sales and profit centers) and OL (e. g. utilising central expertise and experienced internal resources). ACICs seem to diminish the relevance of PCA in companies and consequently affect the perceived importance of PCA adoption and PCA system sophistication. It is particularly smaller companies, companies that do not have a critical mass of investments, who may perceive ACICs as sufficient and do not adopt PCA. In a similar vein among the PCA adopters, the larger companies having a critical mass of major capital investments tend to have more sophisticated PCA designs, whereas the smaller companies appear to rely on less sophisticated PCA combined with ACICs...|$|E

25|$|Drift diving {{occurs when}} the divers allow {{themselves}} to be <b>conveyed</b> <b>past</b> the bottom by the prevailing current, minimising the effort required to cover a relatively large distance, but moving the divers away from the start position and making their surfacing position uncertain. The usual way of monitoring the position of a group is by the lead diver towing a surface marker buoy, and the divers of the group all following the dive leader. The dive boat follows the buoy at a distance where the lookouts can see if any diver surfaces near the buoy. Divers from the group either surface along the buoy line, or if there is current shear or they are separated from the group, deploy their own DSMB and surface on that. Groups of inexperienced divers may be escorted by a second divemaster who tries to keep them together, directs stragglers back to the dive leader, and keeps track of remaining gas. Divers may be formally grouped in buddy pairs, surfacing together when the first is low on gas, or more informally, and rely on the divemasters if they have a problem.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{microwave}} imaging {{is becoming more}} prevalent for detection of interior hidden defects in manufactured and packaged materials.

40|$|This output {{consists}} of images taken in Japan from April to May 2010. I travelled between cities that {{were affected by}} World War II, {{as well as to}} ancient locations in remote western Japan, examining the shifting symbolism of the cherry blossom. While initially associated with Buddhist concepts of renewal, the celebration of life and good fortune, the cherry blossom was re-appropriated during Japan's 19 th-century militarization and colonial expansion. Once celebrated as a healthy and abundant flower, the falling of the petals from the tree became the symbol of Kamikaze soldiers. I develop this investigation of life and death symbolism in my exploration of trees planted before the war in unaffected remote areas, contrasting them with trees in Hiroshima that were planted in nuclear soil. I made use of digital cameras that allowed for images to be taken under extreme light conditions, further questioning the ability of photography as a medium to convey a singular truth or story. Presenting documentation of what is assumed to be an exact location, my digital process allows for the absolute light and colour veracity of these landscapes to be questioned and by extension the viewer's interpretation of this location's history.

Here, we addressed this question with a recent model that describes the LPFC functioning as a cascade of control processes along a rostrocaudal axis, whereby anterior frontal regions influence the processing in posterior frontal regions to guide action selection on the basis of the temporal structure of information. METHODS: We assessed effective connectivity within the rostrocaudal axis of the LPFC by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging in 15 schizophrenic patients and 14 matched healthy control subjects with structural equation modeling and psychophysiological interactions. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, activity in the left caudal LPFC regions was under the influence of left rostral LPFC regions when controlling information <b>conveyed</b> by <b>past</b> events. By contrast, schizophrenic patients failed to demonstrate significant effective connectivity from rostral to caudal LPFC regions in both hemispheres. CONCLUSIONS: The hierarchical control along the rostrocaudal axis of the LPFC is impaired in schizophrenia. This provides the first evidence of a top-down functional disconnection within the LPFC in this disorder. This disruption of top-down connectivity from rostral to caudal LPFC regions observed in patients might affect their ability to select the appropriate sets of stimulus-response associations in the caudal LPFC on the basis of information <b>conveyed</b> by <b>past</b> events. This impaired hierarchical control within the LPFC could result from poorly encoded contextual information due to abnormal computations in the caudal LPFC...|$|R

More important, we explicitly assess the scale of the data-based evidence in favor of each model. Model uncertainty is taken into account when necessary. Overall, the evidence in the data, without conditioning on any single predetermined model, points to a negative risk-return relation.

40|$|Available online 28 July 2014. When {{we become}} aware that our past actions carry {{information}} about qualities that we possess or lack, which others use {{to decide how}} to deal with us, are we unconcerned, content to rely on what we have done, or do we take action to alter this information?

Once made aware of what follows, trustees have the option to play a second dictator game, from which their choice will be accurately conveyed to trusters in addition to their decision in the initial game.

Correlative data showed that peacocks with high display rate (the number of behavioral displays per hour) {{and a large number}} of tail eyespots had low levels of circulating heterophils, suggesting better health status. Experimental activation of the immune system, through LPS injection, significantly reduced display rate compared to a control group. However, the sensitivity of a male display rate to the immune challenge was dependent on the number of tail eyespots: males with higher number of tail eyespots were better able to cope with the experimental immune challenge, and maintained their display rate at levels closer to the levels performed before the immune activation. These results are consistent with the idea that multiple signaling might enhance information reliability...|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} {{on the topic of}} the {{contemporary}} remembering of, as well as the interest in, the Chilean women's movement during Pinochet's dictatorship. During the dictatorship the organized women represented a considerable opposition force to the military regime, and were amongst the first social organizations that dared to publically defy it. However, since the transition to a post-dictatorial society the gender-based movement has lost its former visibility and centrality in Chilean politics. The approach of the thesis is twofold. First, it explores the official history politics of the Chilean state to grasp how civil society's influence in the past is portrayed, or whether it is at all. Second, the views of women themselves involved in the past women's movement, as well as the discourse they use in public events, are placed under scrutiny to analyze their interest in <b>conveying</b> their own <b>past</b> as well as their possibilities to do this. Historical memory here is understood according to the theory embraced by Isabel Shafir Piper: memory being created in the present can be construed in endless different ways and no memory is more correct than another. A shared historical memory of the past based only on concepts of repression and tragedy, and without agency, however, have far-reaching consequences for a post-dictatorial civil society. The aspects of the experience of the female societal subjects and the Chilean political history of women are {{at the core of the}} thesis. The most important sources are in-depth semi-structured interviews with central Chilean female figures who participated in the women's movement during the dictatorship or who have been central in women's organizations and politics since. Also the Truth Commission reports are used as material for examining the Chilean state's memory politics since the dictatorship. The results of the thesis are that state's interest in portraying women as societal subjects crucial in the past shines with its absence. Neither are later generations interested in the matter of civil society during the dictatorship, nor in the past in general. In consequence, the women who were active in the past are the ones who most <b>convey</b> their own <b>past</b> experiences, and they face considerable challenges reaching a receptive audience for their words, although a clear interest in keeping the past present is detectable. According to the theory of Gabriel Salazar, the official memory and memory originating from the social organizations are in juxtaposition to each other and hence civil society memory acquires the characteristic of resistance to the official oblivion. The analysis of the thesis arrives at that memory can be comprehended as a right and not only a curiosity. In post-dictatorial societies, such as contemporary Chile, one must strive for remembering beyond only human rights violations. In conclusion, change in memory politics and memory activities in the future is possible, as social movement remembering is related to the ever-evolving societal context in which it occurs as well as other aspects of social movement dynamics.

A coalition can despoil any other coalition less powerful than itself. The present paper studies {{the extent to which the}} exercise of power can be constrained by a shared concept of legitimacy. The basic pillage {{game is a}}ugmented by a set of extrinsic variables that can <b>convey</b> information about <b>past</b> behavior. Depending on the power function, the illegitimate use of power can be inhibited by legitimizing the subsequent use of power against the transgressors. Legitimacy is modeled in a static sense, called quasi-legitimacy, using the stable set (von Neumann-Morgenstern solution) of the augmented pillage game, and in an explicitly dynamic sense, called simply legitimacy, using a concept of farsighted core. Quasi-legitimacy is shown to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for legitimacy. The sets of quasi-legitimate wealth allocations are characterized, and an iterative process is developed for constructing the largest quasi-legitimate set of allocations for each pillage game. If the power function gives enough weight to coalition size that no individual can be as powerful as the coalition of everyone else, then a natural augmentation of the basic pillage game can legitimize the set of all allocations. However, if the power of each coalition is determined by its total wealth alone, then even the weaker concept of quasi-legitimacy cannot stabilize anything other than the stable set of the basic pillage game. The legitimate sets of wealth allocations are characterized in general, and a weaker condition is shown to characterize the legitimacy of the largest quasi-legitimate set. 1...|$|R
