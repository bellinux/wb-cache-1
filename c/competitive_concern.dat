40|$|Canadian {{manufacturers}} {{contend with}} a number of competitive challenges within a rapidly changing global market. Among these are the present and projected shortages of skilled workers who are {{critical to the success of}} secondary sector firms that increasingly utilize advanced manufacturing technologies. The recent boom in Alberta’s economy has exacerbated an already critical national workforce situation. Evidence from a recent survey of manufacturers suggests that the skilled labour issue is a far more salient problem for manufacturers in Alberta than for most of Canada. The shortage of skilled workers ranks, by far, as the most important <b>competitive</b> <b>concern</b> for Alberta manufacturers. This issue appears to have limited growth for many firms from this province, to a higher degree than seen elsewhere in the country. This paper also explores the extent of the human capital shortage in manufacturing and the strategies that firms are using to address this challenge...|$|E
40|$|Barriers {{to entry}} are a necessary, but not {{sufficient}} condition for a merger to adversely affect competition. As a barrier definition must {{be linked to}} the specific theory of <b>competitive</b> <b>concern</b> under review to be meaningful, a theoretical barrier definition is unlikely to be useful. Instead, an operational definition of barriers to entry is required. This paper explores the operationalization of the Merger Guidelines barrier to entry concept. A review of the files observes that most matters involve multiple entry scenarios, so it is often impossible to draw strict conclusions for the individual characteristics of timeliness, likelihood or sufficiency. However, by following each entry scenario through the three-stage analysis, it is possible to identify barriers to entry in 109 of the 138 matters reviewed. Within this analysis, the timeliness consideration is generally supported by the best evidence, while the likelihood characteristic leaves the most room for improvement. A total of 55 matters exhibit evidence of recent entry and 46 files report expectations of future entry. A few files detail innovative net present value analyses to determine the profitability of entry into the market. This type of financial analysis offers the promise of a quantitative approach to likelihood analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|Personal {{data has}} both an {{economic}} and a dignitary value. This begs {{the question of whether}} competition law should respect the dual nature of personal data, given that the regulation of competition is chiefly dictated by economic concerns. This article addresses that question by mapping the potential intersections between EU data protection law and competition law. In particular, it argues that data protection law exercises an internal and an external constraint on competition law. On the one hand, competition law involves judgments about ‘normal competition’ and consumer welfare which may require a normative contribution by data protection law. Using data protection as a normative benchmark in this way does not depart from the logic of competition law as data protection still requires a <b>competitive</b> <b>concern</b> hook on which to hang. Data protection would thus act as an ‘internal constraint’ on competition law. On the other hand, regardless of such logic, competition authorities are bound to respect the fundamental right to data protection. This requires them to restrict the scope of competition law and to guarantee the effectiveness of that fundamental right. In this way, data protection acts as an ‘external constraint’ on competition law. Recognising these constraints would pave the way for a more coherent EU law approach to consumer concerns in a digital society...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} digital platforms {{in the context}} on EU competition law by conducting an economic and legal analy-sis of the potential <b>competitive</b> <b>concerns</b> that derive from the characteristics of digital platforms and the competitive dynamics thereof. With this in mind, the following research questions can be identified: 1) 	What are digital platforms? 2) 	What are the <b>competitive</b> <b>concerns</b> raised in relation to digital platforms? 3) 	Why is the topic so debated? The methodologic approach of this study has elements of both law and economics and legal dogmatics. The adopted methodology endeavors to address the research questions in a more holistic manner, which is to facilitate the discourse between legal and economic arguments. Structurally, this study is divided into four main chapters. Chapter 2 outlines the legal framework of EU competition law by making necessary observation regarding the primary competition rules in the Treaties and the objectives of competi-tion policy. Chapter 3 sheds light on the economics of data {{in the context of}} digital platforms, because it is impossible to understand the debate, whether or not the interplay between user data and market power can be of competitive con-cern, without understanding the factors driving competition among platforms. Chapter 4 provides further insights on the <b>competitive</b> <b>concerns</b> associated with platform competition. Lastly, Chapter 5 addresses the criticism of the above and Chapter 6 includes the conclusions of this study. This study will illustrate that the <b>competitive</b> <b>concerns</b> attributed to platform competition are indeed controversial. Never-theless, the economics of data and the competitive dynamics of platforms seem to merit thee notion that digital markets are subject to market concentration and could under certain circumstances facilitate anticompetitive behavior. As of consequence, the European Commission as the main enforcer of EU competition law should not leave these concerns unaddressed...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of new service development (NSD) {{has become an}} important <b>competitive</b> <b>concern</b> in many service industries. However, NSD remains among the least studied and understood topics in the service management literature. As a result, our current understanding of the critical resources and activities to develop new services is inadequate given NSD’s importance as a service competitiveness driver. Until recently, the generally accepted principle behind NSD was that “new services happen ” rather than occurring through formal development processes. Recent efforts to address this debate have been inconclusive. Thus, {{additional research is needed}} to validate or discredit the belief that new services happen as a result of intuition, flair, and luck. Relying upon the general distinctions between research exploitation and exploration, this paper describes areas in NSD research that deserve further leveraging and refinement (i. e. exploitation) and identifies areas requiring discovery or new study (i. e. exploration). We discuss the critical substantive and research design issues facing NSD scholars such as defining new services, choice in focusing on the NSD process or performance (or both), and specification of unit of analysis. We also examine what can be exploited from the study of new product development to further understanding of NSD. Finally, we explore one important area for future NSD research exploration: the impact of the Internet on the desig...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHighways {{and roads}} are an {{important}} part of public assets in all countries, allowing movement between communities. As well as other types of infrastructure, the roads infrastructure requires a proper procurement process. The research shows that prices presented in public bids are lower than those expected by contracting authorities. Public owners are restricted to the public bidding procedures, especially the provision to use low bid price in the Public Procurement Act. Often a public owner has concerns about the contractor bidding with the lowest sum. Contractors are repeatedly requested to explain the reasons for their low price. This leads to time extension of the bid process. The lack of contracts for construction work and an additional <b>competitive</b> <b>concern</b> to win out in the bid process may be the reason for low prices. An incorrect calculation of the estimated contract price by the contracting authority itself could be another reason. The cost analysis of two sections of highway clearly showed incorrect cost estimates by the relevant contracting authority. The difference was primarily due to significantly lower rates of indirect costs and profit, rebates granted when buying building materials, and lower cost of plant. The author summarizes the possible causes of the incorrect estimates of expected value and at the same time proposes methods to achieve better estimates for the contract price. The public sector may use the results of this study to identify the ineffectiveness of procurement in the area of infrastructure projects in the Czech Republic. The proposed procedures should improve the efficiency of procurement and provide better cost estimates by the public agencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} “commitment decision” procedure, {{introduced into}} European competition law with Art. 9 of Regulation 1 / 2003, {{was meant to}} provide the Commission with the possibility to dispose of competition law cases {{by way of a}} kind of formal settlement, roughly analogous to the US consent decree. It has quickly become an important instrument of European competition law enforcement. Since May 2004, roughly 50 % of all Commission decisions applying Art. 81 or Art. 82 in non-hardcore-cartel cases have been taken under Art. 9 of Reg. 1 / 2003. However, the CFI’s Alrosa judgment of 11 July 2007 calls into question the Commission’s commitment decision practice in various respects. Alrosa does not conceive commitment decisions as “settlements” proper, but treats them as public law enforcement largely analogous to infringement decisions under Art. 7 of Reg. 1 / 2003. It emphasizes the Commission’s duty to investigate and clearly formulate the <b>competitive</b> <b>concern,</b> insists on a full judicial review of the proportionality of the commitments and underlines the full judicial protection of the concerned undertakings’ procedural rights, namely the right to access to the file and the right to be heard. This paper provides an overview of the Commission’s commitment decision practice since Art. 9 of Reg. 1 / 2003 has entered into force, discusses the concerns that this practice has raised and the implications of the Alrosa judgment, should it be upheld by the ECJ. According to the author, the Alrosa judgment fundamentally re-conceptualizes the function and structure of commitment decision procedures, with likely repercussions on analogous provisions in national competition laws. It creates important safeguards against the real risk that the Commission’s incentives to settle cases may diverge from the public interest in effective protection of competition...|$|E

Part 33 {{to update}} the filing requirements for applications under Part 33, including public utility mergers. The Commission expects that, by providing applicants more detailed guidance for preparing applications, the revised filing requirements will assist the Commission in determining whether applications under section 203 of the Federal Power Act {{are consistent with the}} public interest and will provide more certainty and expedition in the Commission's handling of such applications. This final Rule generally follows the- 2 -approach of the NOPR. This Rule affirms the Commission's screening approach to mergers that may raise horizontal <b>competitive</b> <b>concerns</b> and sets forth specific filing requirements consistent with the Appendix A analysis set forth in the Merger Policy Statement. This Rule also establishes guidelines for vertical competitive analysis and accompanying filing requirements for mergers that may raise vertical market power concerns. The Rule streamlines filing requirements and reduces the information burden for mergers and other dispositions of jurisdictional facilities that raise no <b>competitive</b> <b>concerns</b> and eliminates certain filing requirements in Part 33 that are outdated or no longer useful to the Commission in analyzing mergers and other dispositions of jurisdictional facilities...|$|R

40|$|New Horizontal Merger Guidelines {{were issued}} {{jointly by the}} Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission in August, 2010, {{replacing}} Guidelines issued in 1992 that no longer reflected either the law or government enforcement policy. The new Guidelines are a striking improvement. They are less technocratic, accommodating a greater and more realistic variety of theories about why mergers of competitors can be anticompetitive and, accordingly, {{a greater variety of}} methodologies for assessing them. The unifying theme of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines is to prevent the enhancement of market power that might result from mergers. The 2010 Guidelines state that “[a] merger enhances market power if it is likely to encourage one or more firms to raise price, reduce output, diminish innovation, or otherwise harm customers as a result of diminished competitive constraints or incentives. ” The focus on enhancement of market power is not limited to price. Both the 1992 and 2010 Guidelines expressed a concern about mergers that might restrain innovation, but the emphasis in the 2010 Guidelines is greatly expanded. The agencies are increasingly concerned about excessive reliance on market definition mechanisms that are, at best, rough approximations of reality. This increases the relative weight that will be given to other factors. That {{is not to suggest that}} the Agencies will not employ technical methodologies. Indeed, the economic methodologies for delineating markets have become more technical and precise over time, thanks in large part to economists that have been working on merger analysis, whether independently or under the aegis of one of the Agencies. Rather, the Guidelines indicate a broader range of approaches. Under the 2010 Guidelines market definition essentially plays two roles: “First, [it] helps specify the line of commerce and section of the country in which the <b>competitive</b> <b>concern</b> arises.... Second, [it] allows the Agencies to identify market participants and measure market shares and market concentration. ” Market definition (and the measuring of market shares and concentration) is no longer an end in itself, though it is “useful to the extent it illuminates the merger’s competitive effects. ” The 2010 Guidelines also place a heavier emphasis on direct evidence of competitive effects in defining markets: “[e]vidence of competitive effects can inform market definition, just as market definition can be informative regarding competitive effects. ” This essay attempts to integrate the 2010 Guidelines into merger enforcement policy in the United States, highlighting the most important differences between the approach taken in the 2010 Guidelines and that taken by both previous Guidelines, the enforcement agencies, and the courts...|$|E
40|$|In music licensing, {{powerful}} music publishers have begun—for {{the first}} time ever— to withdraw their digital copyrights from the collectives that license those rights, in order to negotiate considerably higher rates in private deals. At {{the beginning of the}} year, two of these publishers commanded a private royalty rate nearly twice that of the going collective rate. This result could be seen as a coup for the free market: Constrained by consent decrees and conflicting interests, collectives are simply not able to establish and enforce a true market rate in the new, digital age. This could also be seen as a pathological form of private ordering: Powerful licensors using their considerable market power to impose a supracompetitive rate on a hapless licensee. While {{there is no way to}} know what the market rate looks like in a highly regulated industry like music publishing, the anticompetitive effects of these withdrawals may have detrimental consequences for artists, licensees and consumers. In industries such as music licensing, network effects, parallel pricing and tacit collusion can work to eliminate meaningful competition from the marketplace. The resulting lack of competition threatens to stifle innovation in both the affected, and related, industries. Normally, where a market operates in a workably competitive manner, the remedy for anticompetitive behavior can be found in antitrust law. In music licensing, however, some concerning behaviors, including both parallel pricing and tacit collusion, do not rise to the level of antitrust violations; as such, they cannot be addressed by antitrust law. This is no small irony. At one point, antitrust served as a check on the licensing collectives by establishing consent decrees to govern behavior. Due to a series of acquisitions that have reduced the music publishing industry to a mere three entities, the collectives that are being circumvented by these withdrawals (and whose conduct is governed by consent decrees) now pose less of a <b>competitive</b> <b>concern</b> than do individual publishing companies acting privately, or in concert through tacit collusion. The case of intellectual property rights, which defer competition for creators and inventors for a limited period of time, is particularly challenging for antitrust. Running contrary to conventional wisdom, this Article posits that regulation—not antitrust—is the optimal means of enabling entry and innovation in the music licensing market. While regulation is conventionally understood to restrict new entry and to interfere with competition, this Article demonstrates that where a market becomes highly concentrated, regulation can actually encourage competition by ensuring access to key inputs at competitive rates. While not without its drawbacks, including an increase in the cost of private action, remedial regulation in music licensing corrects anticompetitive behavior and ensures ongoing access to content and fair payment to artists, while supporting continued innovation in content distribution...|$|E
