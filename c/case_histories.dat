5|$|The book {{presents}} <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> {{of all the}} twin-pairs {{studied and}} the raw data from the analyses. Its last chapters put the results {{in the context of}} existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.|$|E

Many <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E

40|$|Title of the thesis: <b>Case</b> <b>history</b> of {{physiotherapy}} care of {{a patient}} diagnosed with cervicalgia Written by: Ludvík Maier Supervisor: col. Michal Říha MD, PhD., MBA Object: The aim of this work is to describe the problems of cervicalgia. Summary: This thesis consists of two parts - special and general. General part focuses on {{the definition of the}} disease, causes, clinical features and therapeutic approaches to the issue. The special part is {{the most important part of}} the thesis. It includes a <b>case</b> <b>history</b> of a patient with chronic neck pain. Critical part of this <b>case</b> <b>history</b> is a plan of therapy and record of individual physiotherapy procedures which were applied according to the initial analysis. In the end of the special part is the evaluation of the effeciency of the therapy. The <b>case</b> <b>history</b> was developed during internship in the Military University Hospital in Prague. From the achieved results of the research of the theses we can say that the used procedures in therapy contributed to the improvement of the condition of the patient.

25|$|According to Ishikawa and Ichihashi in the Japanese Journal of Clinical Medicine, {{the first}} author {{to use the term}} Asperger's {{syndrome}} in the English-language literature was the German physician, Gerhard Bosch. Between 1951 and 1962, Bosch worked as a psychiatrist at Frankfurt University. In 1962, he published a monograph detailing five <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> of individuals with PDD that was translated to English eight years later, becoming {{one of the first to}} establish German research on autism, and attracting attention outside the German-speaking world.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the MMR vaccine was {{the subject}} of {{controversy}} after the publication in The Lancet of a 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield and others reporting <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> of 12 children mostly with autism spectrum disorders with onset soon after administration of the vaccine. At a 1998 press conference, Wakefield suggested that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single vaccination. This suggestion was not supported by the paper, and several subsequent peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism. It later emerged that Wakefield had received funding from litigants against vaccine manufacturers and that he had not informed colleagues or medical authorities of his conflict of interest; had this been known, publication in The Lancet would not have taken place in the way that it did. Wakefield has been heavily criticized on scientific grounds and for triggering a decline in vaccination rates (vaccination rates in the UK dropped to 80% in the years following the study), as well as on ethical grounds for the way the research was conducted. In 2004, the MMR-and-autism interpretation of the paper was formally retracted by 10 of Wakefield's 12 coauthors, and in 2010 The Lancets editors fully retracted the paper. Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and is barred from practising medicine in the UK.|$|E

25|$|The book is {{in three}} sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, {{including}} animal migration and the homing of pigeons, and on animal precognition, including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> of {{dogs and cats}} that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes {{for half an hour}} or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when {{she was on her way}} home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly significant statistically. Sheldrake performed 12 further tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines. Sheldrake also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.|$|E

500|$|Saruman [...] "was great once, of a noble {{kind that}} we should not dare raise our hands against" [...] but decays as the book goes on. Patricia Meyer Spacks calls him [...] "one of the main <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> [...] of the gradual {{destructive}} effect of willing submission to evil wills". Paul Kocher identifies Saruman's use of a palantír, a seeing-stone, as the immediate cause of his downfall, but also suggests that through his study of [...] "the arts of the enemy", Saruman was drawn into imitation of Sauron. According to Jonathan Evans and Spacks, Saruman succumbs to the lust for power, while Shippey identifies Saruman's devotion to goals of knowledge, organization and control as his weakness. Tolkien writes that the Istari's chief temptation (and that to which Saruman fell) is impatience, leading to a desire to force others to do good, and then to a simple desire for power.|$|E

The suspicion of society is aroused against him, all the worse in some ways for carrying an atmosphere of mystery." [...] The report said that [...] "nothing could more clearly prove the anomalous and illogical and disingenuous nature of the blue discharge than this policy of the Veterans Administration". The committee called the system for dealing with blue-ticket veterans [...] "a squeeze play between the war department and the veterans' administration" [...] and took the agency to task for assuming [...] "the right to separate the sheep from the goats" [...] and [...] "passing moral verdicts on the history of any soldier".|$|E
500|$|Conant's {{experience}} with the Manhattan Project convinced him that the public needed {{a better understanding of}} science, and he moved to revitalize the history and philosophy of science program at Harvard. He took the lead personally by teaching a new undergraduate course, Natural Science 4, [...] "On Understanding Science". His course notes became the basis for a book of the same name, published in 1948. In 1952, he began teaching another undergraduate course, Philosophy 150, [...] "A Philosophy of Science". In his teachings and writing on the philosophy of science, he drew heavily on those of his Harvard colleague Willard Van Orman Quine. Conant contributed four chapters to the 1957 Harvard <b>Case</b> <b>Histories</b> in Experimental Science, including an account of the overthrow of the phlogiston theory. In 1951, he published Science and Common Sense, in which he attempted to explain the ways of scientists to laymen. Conant's ideas about scientific progress would come under attack by his own protégés, notably Thomas Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Conant commented on Kuhn's manuscript in draft form.|$|E

[...] Bird also presented the paper at the Westminster Medical School, where Snow took {{a special interest in}} it. [...] Until then, Snow and many others had believed that carbonic acid acted merely by excluding oxygen. [...] The experiments of Bird and others convinced him that it was harmful in its own right, but he still did not subscribe to Bird's view that it was an active poison. [...] Also in 1839, Bird published a comprehensive paper in Guy's Hospital Reports, complete with many <b>case</b> <b>histories,</b> in which he documents the state of knowledge. [...] He realised that at least some cases of poisoning from stoves were due not to carbonic acid, but to some other agent, although he still had not identified it as carbon monoxide.Coley, p. 366Vinten-Johansen, p. 90 ...|$|E
