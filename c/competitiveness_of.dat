5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries.

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{improvements}} in regional transport infrastructure precipitated {{the decline of}} Salford's existing industries, including those at the Salford Docks. Increased foreign competition began to undermine the <b>competitiveness</b> <b>of</b> local textile processing businesses. Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s, and a significant economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford's population. By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and cotton spinning had by 1971 ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.|$|E

40|$|Questionnaire {{data from}} 200 {{managers}} were analyzed. Hierarchical factor analysis found two general factors <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> that were labeled <b>Competitiveness</b> and Self-Description <b>of</b> <b>Competitiveness.</b> Additionally, four specific factors were found: Affective Reaction to Competitiveness, Win, Beating Others in the Workplace, and Recognition of Performance. Analogous to prior findings with General Intelligence, {{this study suggests}} that the measurement <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> will best be achieved through the measurement of many factors rather than items from only the general factors;The hierarchical factor analysis methodology used in this study was superior to the second-order analysis procedures typically performed in the literature because it allowed for the loadings of the items on both the first and second-order factors to be evaluated. The analysis was used to distinguish between the components <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> and the components of achievement motivation. Results suggested that the components <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> and achievement motivation have been confused in the literature, and a clarification of these two multidimensional sets of constructs is provided;Gender differences were found for all of the components <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> but one, indicating that women score lower on most components <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> than men. However, when gender and gender identity were regressed on the component scores, no main effects due to gender or interactions with gender occurred. Gender differences seemed to disappear when gender identity was added to the model, but because of multicollinearity, it was impossible to determine which of these two influences accounted for the overall significance in the regression models;Univariate and multivariate analyses of the components <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> indicated that there were different relationships between these factors and the other predictors and performance criteria included in this study. Few significant correlations were found between the components <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> and the criteria variables. Additionally, the results of the multiple regression analyses indicated that components <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> did not show incremental validity over the other predictors used in the study. In general, components <b>of</b> <b>competitiveness</b> seem to be poorer predictors of success for restaurant managers than other variables...|$|R

5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the <b>competitiveness</b> <b>of</b> a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

The city is home to the Montreal Exchange, the oldest stock exchange in Canada and the only financial derivatives exchange in the country. The corporate headquarters of the Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Canada, two of the biggest banks in Canada, were in Montreal. While both banks moved their headquarters to Toronto, Ontario, their legal corporate offices remain in Montreal. The city is home to head offices of two smaller banks, National Bank of Canada and Laurentian Bank of Canada. The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, an instutitonal investor managing assets totalling $248billion CAD, has its main business office in Montreal.

5|$|Oldham's {{townscape}} {{was dominated}} by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills. Oldham was hit hard by the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, when supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut off. Wholly reliant upon the textile industry, the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town. By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central government, land was purchased {{with the intention of}} employing local cotton workers to construct Alexandra Park, which opened on 28 August 1865. Said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, as the importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during the 20th century, Oldham's economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of cotton spinning. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and <b>competitiveness</b> <b>of</b> its production, the last cotton spun in the town was in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Prior to federation, {{the various}} Australian colonies could, and often did, charge tariffs on goods {{from the other}} colonies, ostensibly for the {{protection}} of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest large city, more expensive and reducing the <b>competitiveness</b> <b>of</b> these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets. In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity. Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings. Along the Riverina the Murray was—and remains—part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Supplies of {{raw cotton}} from the United States were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, {{leading to the}} {{formation}} of the Crompton Local Board of Health in 1863, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality. The Great Depression, and First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline in Shaw and Crompton. Although the industry endured, as imports of cheaper foreign yarns increased during the mid-20th century, Shaw and Crompton's textile sector declined gradually to a halt; said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, cotton spinning reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and <b>competitiveness</b> <b>of</b> its production, the final cotton was spun in Shaw and Crompton in 1989, in Lilac and Park mills. Of the 48 cotton mills that have occupied Shaw and Crompton, only six are still standing, all of which are now used as distribution centres.|$|E
