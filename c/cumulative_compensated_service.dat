The tool monitors partner service interaction to compute Quality of Service (QoS) data and performs dynamic service adaptation based on various available service selection strategies, such as availability or response time. The service adaptation happens transparently at runtime by dynamically selecting an alternative service for an existing service used in the process, without any changes to the deployed BPEL process. To gain even more flexibility, the tool provides transformation components to <b>compensate</b> <b>service</b> interface mismatches, which are likely to occur when using alternative services offered by different providers...|$|R

In the worst case, {{there is only one}} leading flow and the others are lagging flows. When the leading flow forwards all of its packets, its new packet arrives at an empty queue.

40|$|Abstract—Open Web-based {{and social}} {{platforms}} dramatically influence models of work. Today, {{there is an}} increasing interest in outsourcing tasks to crowdsourcing environments that guarantee professional processing. The challenge is to gain the customer’s confidence by organizing the crowd’s mixture of capabilities and structure to become reliable. This work outlines the requirements for a reliable management in crowdcomputing environments. For that purpose, distinguished crowd members act as responsible points of reference. These members mediate the crowd’s workforce, settle agreements, organize activities, schedule tasks, and monitor behavior. At {{the center of this}} work we provide a hard/soft constraints scheduling algorithm that integrates existing agreement models for service-oriented systems with crowdcomputing environments. We outline an architecture that monitors the capabilities of crowd members, triggers agreement violations, and deploys counteractions to <b>compensate</b> <b>service</b> quality degradation.

40|$|Fairness and {{protection}} are two important properties required to support Quality-ofService (QoS). In this paper, we present WGPS (Wireless General Processor Sharing) and PWGPS (Packetized WGPS) schedulers to provide fairness {{and protection}} in wireless packet networks. Since our schedulers pre-allocate bandwidth for compensating flows which suffered bursty and location-dependent channel errors and the compensation is {{performed by the}} <b>compensated</b> <b>service</b> shares which are increased by the same factor for the errord flows, our schedulers can achieve fairness and protection at the same time. I. INTRODUCTION Fairness is defined {{in the context of}} GPS(Generalized Processor Sharing) where each flow is assigned a fair service share and the service is instantaneously distributed among the backlogged flows in proportion to their shares[1, 2]. Since fair scheduling can protect well-behaving flows from other misbehaving flows by limiting misbehaving flows to their fair shares and since it can prov [...] ...|$|R

If the packet is transmitted in the dirty channel, the transmission may fail and the packet is unable to recover at the receiver. If this happens, the packet must be retransmitted for fairness.

40|$|Over the years, {{the notion}} of {{transactions}} has become synonymous with providing fault-tolerance, reliability and robustness to database systems. However, challenges arise {{when we try to}} apply them to novel computing paradigms such as ActiveXML (AXML) systems. AXML provides an elegant platform to integrate the power of XML, Web services and Peer to Peer (P 2 P) paradigms by allowing (active) Web services calls to be embedded within XML documents. We propose a transactional framework which provides relaxed ACID properties to AXML systems. Relaxed atomicity is usually provided with the help of compensation. However, current compensation based models assume the existence of a pre-defined compensating operation. Also, compensation is assumed to be more or less peer (or service provider) dependent, i. e., the original and <b>compensating</b> <b>services</b> are provided by the same peer. We show how compensation for AXML transactions can be constructed dynamically at run-time and achieved in a peer independent manner. Finally, we consider the issue of peer disconnection, an inherent trait of P 2 P systems, and propose an innovative solution based on peer “chaining”. 1...|$|R
40|$|The cloud {{computing}} paradigm {{gives rise to}} Web service marketplaces where complex services are provided by several modular vendors. Recently more and more intermediaries are pushing onto the market, thereby driving competition. Offering innovative business models which are capable of attracting service providers and consumers is a reasonable strategy to beat competitors and {{to take advantage of}} network effects. We develop a mechanism that introduces a novel way of distributing revenues among service providers – the power ratio. Its underlying presumption is not only to <b>compensate</b> <b>service</b> providers who actually contribute to a complex service offered at a time, but also to pay out partners who are on standby – i. e. vendors that support the network’s variety and stability, but actually do not contribute to the complex service delivered. We show that a payment function that is based upon the power ratio is a promising approach to draw in service providers as it outperforms a payment function that rewards vendors merely based on their actual allocation in terms of expected payoffs for different types of service vendors...|$|R

During the years, it has gained – and subsequently lost – popularity in the research community. After a historical perspective on {{the rise and fall of}} learning research in AI, some of the limitations of current learning systems are reviewed, followed by a presentation of various responses about how to overcome them. A special focus is given on one of the responses, the attempt to draw lessons from a detailed study of evolutionary and developmental processes and stages of learning in nature, in particular in human beings. From this, a number of principles for machine learning are inferred. A key aspect seems to be that learning should be <b>cumulative</b> to <b>compensate</b> for the exponential growth in learning complexity. I...|$|R
