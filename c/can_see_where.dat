25|$|A water clock uses a flow {{of water}} to measure time. If {{viscosity}} is neglected, the physical principle required to study such clocks is Torricelli's law. There {{are two types of}} water clocks: inflow and outflow. In an outflow water clock, a container is filled with water, and the water is drained slowly and evenly out of the container. This container has markings that are used to show the passage of time. As the water leaves the container, an observer <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> the water is level with the lines and tell how much time has passed. An inflow water clock works in basically the same way, except instead of flowing out of the container, the water is filling up the marked container. As the container fills, the observer <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> the water meets the lines and tell how much time has passed.|$|E
25|$|The {{mark of a}} great cabinetmaker is his {{combination}} of design and execution. It's how well they resolve the challenges of designing a piece coupled with their craftsmanship and technique. Pabst was the most distinguished cabinetmaker in Philadelphia {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century. Clearly, the quality of his carving and cabinetmaking is of the highest order, and Philadelphia has a tradition of producing superior furniture since the 18th century, overshadowing Boston and New York.Daniel Pabst really did develop a unique and identifiable decorative vocabulary. He tended to envelop the object's architecture with a fine scale pattern; it was an invention of his own. He wasn't aping the European antecedent. While I think there are masterpieces of Pabst's not from Furness's pen, he certainly benefitted from his close association with the architect.Pabst's Modern Gothic work presents the very germ of the modern movement. Like Christopher Dresser and Bruce Talbert, he conventionalized design, departing from the realistic motifs of the mid-19th century. You <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> this reductivity evolves into the Craftsman style.— Andrew Van Styn, furniture scholar & dealer.|$|E

500|$|A durian {{falling on}} a person's head can cause serious {{injuries}} {{because it is}} heavy, armed with sharp thorns, and can fall from a significant height. Wearing a hardhat is recommended when collecting the fruit. Alfred Russel Wallace writes that death rarely ensues from it, because the copious effusion of blood prevents the inflammation which might otherwise take place. A common saying is that a durian has eyes and <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it is falling because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when people may be hurt. A saying in Indonesian, ketiban durian runtuh, which translates to [...] "getting a durian avalanche", {{is the equivalent of}} the English phrase [...] "windfall gain". Nevertheless, signs warning people not to linger under durian trees are found in Indonesia. Strong nylon or woven rope nettings are often strung between durian trees in orchards, serving a threefold purpose: the nets aid {{in the collection of the}} mature fruits, deter ground-level scavengers, and most importantly, prevent the durians from falling onto people.|$|E
500|$|One of Lois's key {{relationships}} is with Clark, who is {{her husband in}} the comics. For Smallville, the characters' relationship is in constant development. Darren Swimmer describes the relationship between Lois and Clark in season five as [...] "a bit of a melting of the ice". The two characters continue to [...] "butt heads", but the audience <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> there is a growing attraction and that either would be there for the other in a time of need. According to Erica Durance, in season five it is not yet clear if either character realizes the attraction, but the joking between the two characters represents a foreshadowing of a greater relationship. Durance believes that because of Lois's self-imposed walls, even if she thought about Clark in a romantic notion for just an instant she would immediately make it out to be a joke because she is not ready for that type of closeness, yet. The actress sees season five as being too soon for the characters to be [...] "in-love" [...] because they are still getting to know each other. Writer Brian Peterson describes Lois's relationship with Oliver Queen in season six as a precursor to her future relationship with Clark. As Peterson sees it, it is the dynamic between her and Oliver, with her willingness to accept Oliver's secret identity as Green Arrow as mirroring the relationship she will have with Clark. As far as season six is concerned, the relationship between Lois and Clark is still undefined for the audience. As Durance describes it, neither character is willing to put an official label on their relationship. The pair has learned to deal with each other's [...] "quirks", but there are still moments that both feel uncomfortable with. Instead at this point, Durance believes that Clark and Lois are satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother-sister friendship" [...] label, than trying to discover how they both truly feel about each other.|$|E
2500|$|These {{meals and}} {{meetings}} are an opportunity {{both for the}} prefrosh {{to get to know}} the feel of the different houses and for the upperclassmen to meet and rate the prefrosh so both <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> they might belong. [...] Many Houses also show house-made videos to the prefrosh, which yield the prefrosh additional information about the various personalities of the Houses. [...] At the end of this week, the frosh rate each of the 8 Houses on a scale of 1 to 20. Based on this, and the opinions of the Houses' existing members, the prefrosh are placed into a House which will be their home physically and socially for the next few years. The InterHouse Committee attempts to ensure a certain level of secrecy regarding the exact process, so that the confidentiality of both the freshmen, and those involved with their final housing assignments, is maintained. [...] Also, the selection process is constrained: [...] there are only a limited number of openings in each House, and it is impossible to simultaneously meet the preferences of all of the Freshmen and Houses.|$|E
