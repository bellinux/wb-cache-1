40|$|Abstract—The {{physical}} properties of highly deformable {{objects such as}} clothing poses a challenging problem for autonomously acting systems. Especially, grasping and manipulation require new approaches that can accommodate for an object’s variable and changing appearance. In this paper, we present {{a system that is}} capable of fully autonomously transforming a clothing item from a random crumpled configuration into a folded state. We describe a method to compute valid grasp poses on the cloth which accounts for deformability. Our algorithm includes a novel fold detection and grasp generation strategy, which suggests grasp poses on <b>cloth</b> <b>folds.</b> <b>Machine</b> learning techniques are used to evaluate these grasp poses. In our experiments, we use a stock PR 2 robot whose two arms alternatingly perform grasps on a T-shirt equipped with fiducial markers. The goal of this grasp sequence is to bring the T-shirt into a configuration from which the robot can fold it. In several experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our approach. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Motion {{planning}} for robotic manipulation of clothing is a challenging problem as clothing articles have high-dimensional configuration spaces and are computationally expensive to simulate. We present an algorithm for robotic <b>cloth</b> <b>folding</b> that, given {{a sequence of}} desired folds, outputs a motion plan consisting of a sequence of primitives for a robot to <b>fold</b> the <b>cloth.</b> Previous work on <b>cloth</b> <b>folding</b> {{does not take into}} account the constraints of the robot, and thus produces plans which are often infeasible given the kinematics of robots like the Willow Garage PR 2. In this paper we introduce a class of motion primitives that start and end in a subset of the cloth’s state space. To find a sequence of primitives that achieves all required folds, the algorithm takes advantage of the partial ordering inherent in folding, and produces a time-optimal motion plan (given the set of primitives) for the robot if one exists. We describe experiments with a general purpose mobile robotic platform, the PR 2, folding articles that require dragging and base motion in addition to folding. Our experiments show that (1) many articles of clothing conform well enough to the assumptions made in our model and (2) this approach allows our robot to perform a wide variety of folds on articles of various sizes and shapes. ...|$|R
40|$|Stereo {{matching}} {{deals with}} recovering quantitative depth {{information from a}} set of input images, based on the visual disparity between corresponding points. Generally most of the algorithms assume that the processed images are rectified. As robotics becomes popular, conducting stereo matching {{in the context of}} cloth manipulation, such as obtaining the disparity map of the garments from the two cameras of the <b>cloth</b> <b>folding</b> robot, is useful and challenging. This is resulted from the fact of the high efficiency, accuracy and low memory requirement under the usage of high resolution images in order to capture the details (e. g. cloth wrinkles) for the given application (e. g. <b>cloth</b> <b>folding).</b> Meanwhile, the images can be unrectified. Therefore, we propose to adapt guided filtering algorithm into the pyramidical stereo matching framework that works directly for unrectified images. To evaluate the proposed unrectified stereo matching in terms of accuracy, we present three datasets that are suited to especially the characteristics of the task of cloth manipulations. By com- paring the proposed algorithm with two baseline algorithms on those three datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach is accurate, efficient and requires low memory. This also shows that rather than relying on image rectification, directly applying stereo matching through the unrectified images can be also quite effective and meanwhile efficien...|$|R
