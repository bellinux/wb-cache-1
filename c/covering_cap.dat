50|$|The {{modified}} Boucherie process {{consists of}} placing freshly cut, unpeeled timbers onto declining skids, with the stump slightly elevated, then fastening watertight <b>covering</b> <b>caps</b> or boring {{a number of}} holes into the ends, and inserting a solution of copper sulfate or other waterborne preservative into the caps or holes from an elevated container. Preservative oils tend to not penetrate satisfactorily by this method. The hydrostatic pressure of the liquid forces the preservative lengthwise into and through the sapwood, thus pushing the sap out of {{the other end of}} the timber. After a few days, the sapwood is completely impregnated; unfortunately little or no penetration takes place in the heartwood. Only green wood can be treated in this manner. This process has found considerable usage to impregnate poles and also larger trees in Europe and North America, and has experienced a revival of usage to impregnate bamboo in countries such as Costa Rica, Bangladesh, India and the state of Hawaii.|$|R

5000|$|Saproamanita vittadinii or Amanita vittadinii, {{commonly}} known as the Vittadini's lepidella, is a European saprophyte mushroom often classified in the genus Amanita and more recently in the genus Saproamanita. [...] Unlike ordinary Amanitas, this species is known to occur without accompanying woody plant symbionts. It has a general aspect somewhat between Macrolepiota and Armillaria, but it is characterized by a pure white colour overall (whilst those genera are brownish) and by the squamous (scaly) <b>covering</b> of <b>cap</b> and stipe.|$|R

5|$|Strobilomyces foveatus is {{a little-known}} species of fungus in the Boletaceae family. It was first {{reported}} by mycologist E.J.H. Corner in 1972, from specimens he collected in Malaysia in 1959, {{and has since}} been found in Australia. Fruit bodies are characterized by the small dark brown to black conical scales <b>covering</b> the <b>cap,</b> and the net-like pattern of ridges on the upper stem. The roughly spherical spores measure about eight micrometres, and are densely covered with slender conical spines. The edibility of this species is unknown.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the root cap is to enable {{downward}} growth of the root, with the root <b>cap</b> <b>covering</b> the sensitive tissue in the root. Also, the root cap enables geoperception or gravitropism. This allows the plant to grow downwards (with gravity) or upwards (against gravity).|$|R

50|$|The {{ridgeline}} in {{this area}} had a permanent <b>covering</b> or <b>cap</b> of firn. When this firn cap melted, it formed small lakes in the hollows which had no drainage. In the warm period that followed the glacial period, vegetation grew {{on the shores of}} these waters. Reeds and horsetails produced the first humus and initiated the formation of peat. Meanwhile, falling deciduous leaves, pollen and grass collected in the waters. The pollen trapped in the fen still enables today, after thousands of years, an accurate determination of the then prevailing vegetation and the climate.|$|R

50|$|Ice {{sheets and}} ice caps cover vast areas and are {{unconstrained}} by the underlying topography having a radial flow.

Ice sheets and ice caps can be classified further.|$|R
