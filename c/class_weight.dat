5000|$|The San Juan 21 is a {{pleasure}} to sail for both novices and experienced racers. Due to its light weight (1400 lbs <b>Class</b> <b>Weight),</b> it accelerates briskly in puffs and will literally sail rings around most bigger boats in light to moderate winds. There are several one-design class fleets located at various lakes across the country with active racing schedules all summer.

It has space for a camping toilet and ample storage for other essentials.|$|E
50|$|A gravity racer obtains {{its energy}} solely {{from the force}} of gravity (assuming no {{starting}} push is permitted), which is effectively equal for any combination of racer design and course. However, performance can be greatly affected by the combined effects of various forms of drag and also the moment of inertia of the wheels, and also of course by the skill of the driver in choosing optimal lines. Drag breaks down into aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. The latter can be minimised by careful attention to the wheel bearings, tyre sizes and pressures, and brakes (to avoid parasitic brake drag). High tyre pressures and narrower tyres will typically lower the tyre contact rolling resistance, usually at the expense of grip. Larger wheels have lower rolling resistance than small ones, and rolling resistance is also proportional to overall weight. If permitted, a 3-wheeler design will have 25% less rotational inertia than a 4-wheeler, all else being equal. Aerodynamic drag can be minimised by designing a fully enclosed body that reduces the drag coefficient, but given that this can be a highly technical thing to achieve especially for the amateur builder, and given that some aerodynamic drag is inevitable, a heavier cart will always do better than a lighter one with the same drag coefficient - its terminal velocity will be higher. For this reason there are usually <b>class</b> <b>weight</b> limits in most controlled forms of the sport. Since some of the potential energy due to gravity must be converted to the kinetic energy of the rotating wheels, a vehicle with lighter wheels will accelerate faster than one with heavier wheels. If a race is started on some form of ramp, having a tail-heavy car can also improve final acceleration, as the effective height of the centre of gravity of the vehicle is raised.|$|E
5000|$|Using his {{knowledge}} of Taoism, combined with the other disciplines, Master Chia began teaching the Universal Healing Tao System. He eventually trained other Instructors to communicate t{{his knowledge}} and he established the Natural Healing Center in Thailand. Five years later, he {{decided to move to}} New York, where in 1979, he opened the Universal Healing Tao Center. During his years in America, Master Chia continued his studies in the Wu system of Tai Chi with Edward Yee in New York. Since then, Master Chia has taught tens of thousands of students throughout the world. He has trained and certified over 1,500 instructors and practitioners from all over the world. Universal Healing Tao Centers, Chi Nei Tsang Institutes, Cosmic Healing Forums and Immortal Mountain Sanctuaries have opened in many locations in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa and Australia. In 1994, Master Chia moved back to Thailand, where he had begun construction of Tao Garden, the Universal Healing Tao Training Center in Chiang Mai. Master Chia is a warm, friendly and helpful man who views himself primarily as a teacher. He presents the Universal Healing Tao System in a straightforward and practical manner, while always expanding his knowledge and approach to teaching. He uses a word processor for writing and is totally at ease with the latest computer technology. [...] Master Chia estimates that it will take fifty books to convey the full Universal Healing Tao System. In June 1990, at a dinner in San Francisco, Master Chia was honored by the International Congress of Chinese Medicine and Qi Gong (Chi Kung), who named him the Chi Kung Master of the Year. He is the first recipient of this annual award. In December 2000, the Tao Garden Health Resort and Universal Healing Tao Training Center was completed with two Meditation Halls, two open air Simple Chi Kung Pavilions, indoor Tai Chi, Tao Yin and Chi Nei Tsang Hall, Tai Chi Natural Swimming Pool, Pakua Center, Internal World <b>Class</b> <b>Weight</b> Lifting Hall and complete Eight Court Recreational Facilities. In February 2002, the Immortal Tao practices were held at Tao Garden for the first time using the Dark Room technology creating a complete environment for the higher level Taoist practices. In September 2003 Master Chia opened the Tao Garden Holistic Medical Spa using Western and Eastern Technology with Traditional Thai Massage, India Arvada Therapies and Chinese Chi Nei Tsang Massage. The Spa is supervised by trained and certificated Medical Doctors, MDs with Holistic Degrees providing Colonic Therapy, Stem Cell Cancer Prevention and Natural Cancer Cure Treatments.|$|E

The first row contains baseline results from the Complete mode, with equal weights for all constructs (Table 7). The second row repeats the result obtained with a weight of 2.0 attributed to Class constructs (Table 9, row E). It is possible to see that average MAP increased from 0.244 (baseline) to 0.266 when Method weight is set to 1.5 (row G), and to 0.253 when Method weight is 2.0 (row H). Combining Method weight = 1.5 and <b>Class</b> <b>weight</b> = 2.0 (row G) even increased average MAP compared to using only <b>Class</b> <b>weight</b> = 2.0 (row E), although by a negligible amount (only 0.4 % higher, from 0.265 to 0.266).|$|E

40|$|In domain adaptation, maximum mean {{discrepancy}} (MMD) {{has been}} widely adopted as a discrepancy metric between the distributions of source and target domains. However, existing MMD-based domain adaptation methods generally ignore the changes of class prior distributions, i. e., <b>class</b> <b>weight</b> bias across domains. This remains an open problem but ubiquitous for domain adaptation, which {{can be caused by}} changes in sample selection criteria and application scenarios. We show that MMD cannot account for <b>class</b> <b>weight</b> bias and results in degraded domain adaptation performance. To address this issue, a weighted MMD model is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we introduce class-specific auxiliary weights into the original MMD for exploiting the class prior probability on source and target domains, whose challenge {{lies in the fact that}} the class label in target domain is unavailable. To account for it, our proposed weighted MMD model is defined by introducing an auxiliary weight for each class in the source domain, and a classification EM algorithm is suggested by alternating between assigning the pseudo-labels, estimating auxiliary weights and updating model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our weighted MMD over conventional MMD for domain adaptation. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by CVPR 1...|$|E
