500|$|Since Mrs. Voorhees, {{the killer}} in the {{original}} Friday the 13th, does not show up until the final reel of the film, Manfredini had the job of creating a score that would represent the killer in her absence. Manfredini {{was inspired by the}} 1975 film Jaws, where the shark is not seen {{for the majority of the}} film, but the motif created by John Williams cued the audience as to when the shark was present during scenes and unseen. While listening to a piece of Krzysztof Penderecki music, which contained a chorus with [...] "striking pronunciations", Manfredini was inspired to recreate a similar sound for Friday the 13th. He came up with the sound [...] "ki ki ki, ma ma ma", based on the line [...] "Kill her mommy!", which Mrs. Voorhees recites repeatedly in the final reel. The [...] "ki" [...] comes from [...] "kill", and the [...] "ma" [...] from [...] "mommy". To achieve the unique sound he wanted for the film, Manfredini spoke the two words [...] "harshly, distinctly, and rhythmically into a microphone" [...] and ran them into an echo reverberation machine. Manfredini finished the original score after a few weeks and recorded it in a friend's basement. Victor Miller and assistant editor Jay Keuper have commented on how memorable the music is, with Keuper describing it as [...] "iconographic".

In the 1940s, over 300 Portuguese lived {{in the small town of}} Gurúè which gravitated around the tea aristocracy who provided all the amenities for the entire working population, including a private small airline to the largest cities on the coast, like Nampula, and the port city of Quelimane, the capital of Zambezia, in Portuguese East Africa. After the death of tea tycoon Manuel Saraiva Junqueiro, in an airplane crash, the town of Gurúè was renamed Vila Junqueiro in October 1959. By the late 1950s the town had grown, the cinema was founded and TAZ airline (Transportes Aéreos da Zambézia) increased its flights in the town’s airfield. Under Portuguese administration the town expanded harmoniously in terms of urbanism and architectural landscape.|$|R
