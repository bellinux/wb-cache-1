Colchicine-induced polyploidization {{depends on}} tubulin {{polymerization}} in <b>c-metaphase</b> cells. Protoplasma, 227, (2 - 4), 147 - 153. Sponsorship: Leverhulme TrustThe microtubule cytoskeleton plays {{a crucial role}} in the cell cycle and in mitosis. Colchicine is a microtubule-depolymerizing agent that has long been used to induce chromosome individualization in cells arrested at metaphase and also in the induction of polyploid plants. Although attempts have been made to explain the processes and mechanisms underlying polyploidy induction, the role of the cytoskeleton still remains largely unknown. Through immunodetection of alpha-tubulin, different concentrations (0. 5 or 5 mM) of colchicine were found to produce opposite effects in the organization of the cytoskeleton in rye (Secale cereale L.). A low concentration (0. 5 mM) induced depolymerization of the microtubular cytoskeleton in all phases of the cell cycle. In contrast, a high concentration (5 mM) was found to induce the polymerization of new tubulin-containing structures in <b>c-metaphase</b> cells. Furthermore, both treatments also showed contrasting effects in the induction of polyploid cells. Flow cytometric analysis and quantitative assessments of nucleolus-organizing regions revealed that only the high-concentration colchicine treatment was effective in the formation of polyploid cells. Our studies indicate that spindle disruption alone is insufficient for the induction of polyploid cells. The absence of any tubulin structures in plants treated with colchicine at the low concentration induced cell anomalies, such as the occurrence of nuclei with irregular shape and/or (additional) micronuclei, 12 h after recovery, pointing to a direct effect on cell viability. In contrast, the almost insignificant level of cell anomalies in the high-concentration treatment suggests that the presence of new tubulin-containing structures allows the reconstitution of 4 C nuclei and their progression into the cell cycle.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the processes involved in the origin of trisomic karyotypes, i. e. co-migration of sister chromatids (mitotic non-disjunction, MND) and recovery of micronuclei (MN) originating from lagging chromosomes/chromatids at anaphase (mitotic indirect non-disjunction, MIND), and to evaluate their relative contribution to aneuploidy in human lymphocytes mitotically activated in vitro. Therefore, phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes from one donor were treated with 10 and 25 nM colchicine and analysed through two cell cycles by means of both molecular (FISH with centromeric DNA probes specific for chromosomes 7 and 11) and classical cytogenetic techniques. The following events were analysed: (i) chromosome/chromatid Loss (a MN-generating event) in M- 1 bipolar ana-telophases; (ii) MN recovery in M 2 + prophases; (iii) non-disjunction and loss of chromosomes 7 and 11 by FISH analysis in cytochalasin B-induced binucleate cells; (iv) spontaneous frequency of trisomic cells by chromosome counting and FISH analysis in M- 1 c-metaphases; (v) induced frequency of trisomic cells by chromosome counting and FISH analysis in M- 2 <b>c-metaphases.</b> Our results indicate that MND plays a major role compared with MIND in the origin of trisomic karyotypes, being similar to 4 - to 5 -fold higher in colchicine-treated cells. Moreover, remarkable reductions in the observed frequencies of trisomic cells were recorded in comparison with the expected ones, with an observed/ expected frequency ratio of trisomic M- 2 <b>c-metaphases</b> ranging between 1 / 3 and 1 / 6...|$|R

Chromium can damage DNA in several ways, including DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) which generate chromosomal aberrations, micronucleus formation, sister chromatid exchange, formation of DNA adducts and alterations in DNA replication and transcription. In our study, water samples from three sites in the Córrego dos Bagres stream in the Franca municipality of the Brazilian state of São Paulo were subjected to the comet assay and micronucleus test using erythrocytes from the fish Oreochromis niloticus. Nuclear abnormalities of the erythrocytes included blebbed, notched and lobed nuclei, probably due to genotoxic chromium compounds. The greatest comet assay damage occurred with water from a chromium-containing tannery effluent discharge site, supporting the hypothesis that chromium residues can be genotoxic.

When the cells were returned to a 37 °C incubator, mitosis was resumed and the cells entered G 1 synchronously. Ultrastructural studies of N 2 O-blocked cells revealed a bipolar spindle with centriole pairs at each pole. Both chromosomal and interpolar (pole-to-pole) microtubules were also present. Thus, N 2 O, unlike most c-mitotic agents, appeared to have little or no effect upon spindle microtubule assembly. However, the failure of chromo somes to become properly aligned onto the metaphase plate indicated an impairment in normal prometaphase movement. The alignment of spindle microtubules was frequently atypical with some chromosomal microtubules extending from kinetochores to the poles, while others extended out at acute angles from the spindle axis. These ultrastructural studies indicated that N 2 O blocked cells at a stage in mitosis more advanced than that produced by Colcemid or other c-mitotic agents.

In contrast, the levels of cyclin B remain uniformly high throughout these developmental stages. In cells within cellularized embryos and the larval brain, cyclin A accumulates to peak levels in prophase and is degraded throughout {{the period in which}} chromosomes are becoming aligned on the metaphase plate.

Although attempts have been made to explain the processes and mechanisms underlying polyploidy induction, the role of the cytoskeleton still remains largely unknown. Through immunodetection of alpha-tubulin, different concentrations (0. 5 or 5 mM) of colchicine were found to produce opposite effects in the organization of the cytoskeleton in rye (Secale cereale L.). A low concentration (0. 5 mM) induced depolymerization of the microtubular cytoskeleton in all phases of the cell cycle. In contrast, a high concentration (5 mM) was found to induce the polymerization of new tubulin-containing structures in <b>c-metaphase</b> cells. Furthermore, both treatments also showed contrasting effects in the induction of polyploid cells. Flow cytometric analysis and quantitative assessments of nucleolus-organizing regions revealed that only the high-concentration colchicine treatment was effective in the formation of polyploid cells.

None of the collectives showed sex differences. Measurement of the radial distances revealed more peripheral position of the majority of large chromosomes. The satellite-carrying chromosomes of the D group always had a central position in the mitosis. The chromosomes of the groups D, E, F and G were closest to the centre; with the exception of chromosome 18 which was peripheral in all three collectives. For the male probands, the y-chromosome was shown in all three collectives to have a smaller radial distance than the x-chromosome. A typical distribution was found for the radial and homologue distances for the trisomic cells, two of them had a very large radial distance, the third a value corresponding to its size. For the homolarger measurements hereby the distribution is quite independent of parental source. Comparison of the groups showed no differences either between normal and trisomy cells or between the different cell types. Examination of chromosomes 6 and 15 proved conclusively that the chromosomes are not particularly orientated in the <b>c-metaphase</b> regarding the position of short and long arm. A preferential combination of particular satellite carrying chromosomes leads to the frequent fusions of chromosomes 13 and 14, or 14 and 21. Equally, no preferential association could be demonstrated of the chromosome 21 and the chromosomes with large heterochromatin blocks in the centromere region (chromosomes 1 and 9). The distances were of the same order of magnitude as those between 21 and chromosome 6, a submetacentric chromosome without a marked heterochromatin region.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{colchicine}} and heavy water on cell division in wheat roots {{have been examined}} by means of mitotic index measurements correlated with an electron-microscope examination of the tissue. Heavy water alone caused an arrest of mitosis both in normal tissue and in roots which had been brought into partial synchrony of division by means of 5 -aminouracil. Colchicine alone caused an accumulation of cells at <b>c-metaphase</b> in the synchronized tissue. Colchicine dissolved in heavy water showed variable effects; at high heavy water concentrations (greater then 70 %) mitosis was arrested; when the heavy water concentration was less than 70 %, the mitotic index was approximately equal to that obtained by treatment of the tissue with colchicine dissolved in ordinary water. These actions of colchicine and heavy water on the mitosis of the cells have been related to the formation and organization of the microtubules in the dividing cells. Heavy-water treatment was characterized {{by an increase in}} the number of microtubules found in the preprophase band and in the mitotic spindle. The microtubules of the preprophase band in cells treated with heavy water were arranged in a highly disoriented manner. After colchicine treatment the numbers of microtubules at the preprophase band and in the mitotic spindle were depleted. The preprophase band consisted of a few microtubules situated close to the wall. In the mitotic spindle the microtubules were either not present or visible only in the vicinity of profiles of endopla 8 mic reticulum or the chromosomes. When the cells were exposed to a solution of colchi-cine in 70 % heavy water microtubules were absent from the mitotic spindle and the pre-prophase band consisted of a few microtubules which were sometimes found scattered both along the wall and dispersed further into the cytoplasm...|$|E
