The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi’s exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access to the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the <b>country’s</b> <b>Export</b> <b>Development</b> Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.|$|R

Our findings indicate that China’s involvement in vertical production networks exerts {{a positive effect on}} China’s manufacturing exports. An important policy implication, particularly relevant for developing economies, is that a policy promoting a more extensive involvement in global production sharing may significantly improve an economy’s export performance...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} flows of FDI and trade in eight high {{performing}} East Asian economies {{with a focus}} on the relationship between FDI and host <b>country</b> <b>exports.</b> The <b>development</b> and importance of FDI and trade for the region is described. The empirical part of the paper examines the relationship between FDI and host <b>country</b> <b>exports,</b> using data for the period 1980 to 2003. Time series regressions for individual economies as well as panel data estimation indicate that FDI inflows have a significant and positive effect on host <b>country</b> <b>exports,</b> suggesting that export-platform FDI may be important for the East Asian economies. No clear link between outflows of FDI and exports was found, allowing FDI outflows to function as both a complement and a substitute for source <b>country</b> <b>exports.</b> Granger causality tests find indications of FDI inflows causing exports, providing further evidence that the export-platform FDI strategy applies for the East Asian economies. foreign direct investment; East Asia; international trade; exports...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effects on the Bangladeshi economy of phasing out textile and {{clothing}} (T&C) quotas currently maintained by industrial countries. The planned abolition of the quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in 2005 will alter the competitiveness of various <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> Bangladesh relies heavily on textile and clothing exports and is potentially very vulnerable to this change in competitiveness. Based on assessments of quota restrictiveness and export similarity, and an analysis of its supply constraints, the paper concludes that Bangladesh could face significant pressure on its balance of payments, output, and employment when the quotas are eliminated.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} trade {{diagnostic}} studies {{carried out in}} 11 LDCs through the donor-funded Integrated Framework for Trade Related Technical Assistance (IF), to assess how effectively they have assessed trade related needs and put the objective of promoting poverty reduction at the centre of this analysis. It finds that although these studies present much of use to these <b>countries</b> in promoting <b>export</b> <b>development</b> they neglect key areas of significance to poverty reduction efforts. Food crop trade receives minimal attention; there is limited attention to the constraints facing small-scale producers in agriculture and elsewhere; there is a limited focus on and ambition for services and industrial development; {{and analysis of the}} impact of trade reforms on poverty is weak and poorly linked to the discussion on trade capacity building needs. Although the IF has contributed to efforts to diagnose trade needs in the least developed countries (LDCs), it is clear that diagnostic studies need to be kept under review so that future generations of these studies better address poverty-related trade constraints and are developed through a more open and participatory dialogue in these countries...|$|R

40|$|We {{characterize}} {{the evolution of}} <b>country</b> <b>export</b> performance {{over the last five}} decades. Using the gravity model of trade, we extract a measure of <b>country</b> <b>export</b> capability by industry which we use to evaluate how absolute advantage changes over time for 135 industries in 90 countries. We alternatively use the Balassa RCA index as a measure of comparative advantage. Part I of the analysis documents two em-pirical regularities in <b>country</b> <b>export</b> behavior. One is hyperspecialization: in the typical <b>country,</b> <b>export</b> success is concentrated in a handful of industries. Hyperspecialization is consistent with a heavy upper tail in the distribution of absolute advantage across industries within a country, which is well approxi-mated by a generalized gamma distribution whose shape is stable both across countries and over time. The second empirical regularity is a high rate of turnover in a <b>country’s</b> top <b>export</b> industries. Churning in top exports reflects mean reversion in a typical country’s absolute advantage, which we estimate to be on the order of 30 % per decade. Part II of the analysis reconciles hyperspecialization in exports with high decay rates in export capability by modeling absolute advantage as a stochastic process. We specify a generalized logistic diffusion for absolute advantage that allows for Brownian innovations (accounting for surges in a <b>country’s</b> <b>export</b> prowess), a country-wide stochastic trend (flexibly transforming absolut...|$|R
