40|$|The {{transferred}} vibration and {{induced noise}} {{due to the}} tyre cavity resonance currently have no effective solutions used for tyre-wheel mass production. All proposed solutions currently employed are hard to service and difficult to maintain. Different analysis approaches for validation of computer simulation model are presented in this paper. Modal analysis results of the tyre cavity and wheel rim were compared and a complex nature of tyre cavity acoustic properties is understood. A simulation of modified air cavities has been conducted. The analysis conducted in this paper aims to find effective solutions for elimination of the <b>coupling</b> <b>wheel</b> - tyre cavity resonance mode by shifting the tyre cavity mode...|$|E

5000|$|Between 1913 and 1915, the SAR placed 45 Class 14 {{locomotives}} in service. Designed by Hendrie as {{a development}} of the Class 12, it was built by Robert Stephenson and Company. With 48 in <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> it was evolved as intermediate locomotive between the Class 3B with its 45 in <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> and the Class 12 with its 51 in <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Garratt {{design has}} some {{inherent}} drawbacks, however, the first being a diminishing factor of adhesion over long distances. As water and coal is consumed, the weight over the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> is reduced, thereby reducing their factor of adhesion, {{the ratio of}} weight on <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> to tractive effort. Therefore, as the weight on the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> decreases, the locomotive has less adhesion and becomes increasingly prone to slipping.|$|R
5000|$|The second pair of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{had a total}} sideplay of 13/32 in, {{while the}} {{trailing}} <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> had a sideplay of 1 in. The engines bore number plates on their smokebox sides, inscribed [...] "LE" [...] and the engine number. Both versions of the type were equipped with dust shields over the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> and valve gear to protect the moving parts from blown sand in the Namib desert.|$|R
50|$|The {{class were}} four-cylinder {{compound}} locomotives of the de Glenn type - the high-pressure cylinders {{were on the}} outside and drove the middle <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> the low-pressure cylinders were inside, and drove the leading <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{compound}} Mallet locomotive, the rear set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are driven by}} the smaller high-pressure cylinders, from which spent steam is then fed to the larger low-pressure cylinders which drive the front set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like the {{subsequent}} Classes 16D and 16DA, the Class 16C locomotives were all delivered with 60 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b> Their as-delivered boiler operating pressure {{was set at}} [...] During 1936, their <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter was enlarged to 63 in, similar to the modification which was also done on some Classes 16D and 16DA locomotives. In the process, their boiler operating pressure was raised to [...] to not have their tractive effort reduced by the larger <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The outside {{cylinders}} {{drove the}} <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{and the inside}} cylinders drove a coupled pair of rack wheels. The rack wheels were carried on a frame suspended from the widely separated leading and driving <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axles, which had an 8 ft wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|In the {{compound}} Mallet locomotive, the rear set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are driven by}} the smaller high-pressure cylinders which are fed steam from the steam dome. Their spent steam is then fed to the larger low-pressure cylinders which drive the front set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|These locomotives, {{which used}} Stephenson valve gear, were {{intended}} for freight work. The locomotives {{delivered to the}} Midland System had <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> of 42 in diameter, while those delivered to the Eastern System where grades were much more severe, had <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> of 38 in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{operated on}} [...] gauge. The “A”, {{is used to}} identify the number of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> being four <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> for the A10 class, followed by numerals indicating the cylinder diameter of ten inches. Baldwin indicates that the builder was the Baldwin Locomotive Works, United States.|$|R
50|$|In the {{compound}} Mallet locomotive, the rear set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are driven by}} the smaller high-pressure cylinders which are fed steam from the steam dome via the superheater. Their spent steam is then fed to the larger low-pressure cylinders which drive the front set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the Class 14 was {{designed}} by D.A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR), {{it was believed that}} small differences in wheel diameter had disproportionate effects on performance. The SAR already had the Class 3B Mountain type with 45 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> and the Class 12 Mountain type with 51 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> but for the 300 ft radius curves and 1 in 30 (3⅓%) compensated gradients of the Natal mainline, the Class 14 with 48 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> was designed as an intermediate-sized locomotive.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} had larger boilers {{than the}} Eight-Coupled Tank locomotives {{which had been}} delivered from the same manufacturer between 1907 and 1910, but their cylinders, frames and motion were interchangeable {{with those of the}} tank engines. As on the tank engines, the second pair of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> had a total sideplay of 13/32 in, while the trailing <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> had a sideplay of 1 in. The locomotives were equipped with dust shields over the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> and valve gear to protect the moving parts from blown sand in the Namib desert.|$|R

50|$|All these {{locomotives}} had 42 {{in diameter}} <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> unlike the six 4th Class locomotives {{which had been}} delivered to the Eastern System in 1880 and 1881, which had smaller 38 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b> These 33 locomotives were delivered with Stephenson valve gear, like their predecessors of 1880 and 1881.|$|R
50|$|The 2-6-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} was {{most often used}} for articulated compound steam Mallet locomotives. In a compound Mallet, the rear set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> are driven by the smaller high pressure cylinders, from which spent steam is then fed to the larger low pressure cylinders that drive the front set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The cylinders, with rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear, were {{identical}} {{to those of the}} Class 19C but with the stroke reduced from 26 in to 24 in. The modified cylinder covers had deep spigots to suit the reduction in stroke. The main drive and valve gear drive was from the third pair of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b> Grease lubrication was provided for all <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axle boxes. The ten-coupled wheel arrangement, in conjunction with the sharp curvature of the lines in South West, necessitated special side play for the leading <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axle boxes and spherical bearings for the leading crank pins.|$|R
50|$|To {{enable them}} to {{negotiate}} 300 ft radius curves, the leading <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were given a 1 in total side-play in their horn blocks, while the tyre flanges of the intermediate <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were of reduced thickness and the leading coupling rods were provided with spherical bearings at the knuckle joints and crank pins. In addition, largely also {{as a result of}} the decision to use the shorter Watson Standard boiler, it was decided to reduce the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter from the originally intended 66 in to 63 in, which shortened the coupled wheelbase and would further ease passage on sharp curves.|$|R

50|$|Like the Neilson-built 4th Class 4-6-0TT of 1882, these {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with Joy valve gear, {{but they had}} smaller <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> of 38+1/2 in diameter. The <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were not spaced equidistant from each other, with a wheelbase of 3 ft between the leading wheel and the driver and 4 ft between the driver and the trailing wheel.|$|R
50|$|The spring {{compensation}} {{of the engine}} was arranged in two groups. The leading Bissel bogie and the first two pairs of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were compensated in one group, while the remaining three pairs of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were compensated with the trailing bogie. Cross compensation was provided between the leading Bissel bogie and leading <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b> Instead of pins, case-hardened cotters were provided for fulcrums of the bearing spring compensating beams. The proportion of balanced reciprocating parts was only 6% which reduced the hammer blow on the rails to 5 lcwt kg per wheel at 50 mph. The locomotive was noted for its smooth running.|$|R
50|$|The 4-8-2+2-8-4 Double Mountain was {{probably}} the optimal Garratt wheel arrangement, with the four-wheeled leading bogies and the two-wheeled trailing trucks on each engine unit ensuring stability at speed and with sixteen <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> for traction. More <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> would inhibit the locomotive on tight curves, while the only advantage of more non-coupled wheels would be to reduce the axle loading.|$|R

50|$|The {{predecessor}} 4-8-2+2-8-4 Double Mountain {{was probably}} the optimal Garratt wheel arrangement, with the four-wheeled leading bogies and the two-wheeled trailing trucks on each engine unit ensuring stability at speed and with sixteen <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> for traction. More <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> would inhibit the locomotive on tight curves, while the only advantage of more non-coupled wheels, such as on the Double Northern, was to reduce the axle loading.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1940s six {{of these}} locomotives, three from each {{manufacturer}} group, were retyred with 63 in diameter tyres on their <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b> To not have their tractive effort {{reduced by the}} larger <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> their cylinders were reamed from a bore of 22 to 23 in and their operating boiler pressure was raised to [...] All the modified locomotives remained classified as Class 16DA.|$|R
5000|$|Ten {{more were}} {{delivered}} by NBL in 1915, numbered {{in the range}} from 1789 to 1798. While the first two batches were delivered with all <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> flanged, beginning with this third batch the leading <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were flangeless to cope with the sharp curves on the Hex River Pass. These and subsequent locomotives had rear end running boards which continued straight through underneath their cabs.|$|R
50|$|During 1922, the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were retyred {{and their}} {{diameter}} was increased from 42+1/2 in to 42+3/4 in.|$|R
50|$|All <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were flanged. The axle {{boxes of}} the leading and {{trailing}} wheels were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axle boxes were soft grease-lubricated. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, valve spindles and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the steam chests and cylinders.|$|R
50|$|All these {{locomotives}} had 42 {{in diameter}} <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> unlike the six 4th Class locomotives {{which had been}} delivered to the Eastern System in 1880 and 1881 which had smaller 38 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b> They were delivered with Joy valve gear and therefore had a semi-circular cut-out {{at the bottom of}} the side-tanks to allow access to part of the Joy valve gear mechanism which protruded above the running board.|$|R
50|$|In the {{compound}} Mallet locomotive, the rear set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are driven by}} the smaller high-pressure cylinders which are fed steam from the steam dome. Their spent steam is then fed to the larger low-pressure cylinders which drive the front set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b> By comparison, in the more usual arrangement of simple expansion, steam is expanded just once in any one cylinder before being exhausted through the smokebox.|$|R
50|$|Like their Type B 4-6-0 sister engines, the {{locomotives}} had bar frames. The drivers, {{the middle}} wheelset of the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> were flangeless {{to enable the}} engine to negotiate sharp curves. The <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were not spaced equidistant from each other, with 39 in between the wheel centres of the leading wheelset and the drivers and 36 in between the wheel centres of the drivers and the trailing wheelset.|$|R
50|$|With its 72 in {{diameter}} <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> the Class 16E {{was considered the}} most remarkable Cape gauge express passenger locomotive ever built. It had the largest fire grate on any Pacific outside North America. The <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were the largest ever used on any less than 4 ft standard gauge locomotive and it had an all-up weight and tractive effort equal to or exceeding that of most Pacifics outside North America.|$|R
50|$|The outside wet-steam engine had inside {{valves and}} drove the first <b>coupled</b> axle. The <b>wheels</b> were sprung with leaf springs located over the top, that were linked by a {{compensating}} lever between the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It had larger <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> with a 49 in diameter, {{compared}} to the 46 in of the earlier locomotives.|$|R
