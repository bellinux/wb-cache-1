40|$|After a {{break of}} a few years, the European Union has {{recently}} again become active {{in the area of}} co-ordinating capital income taxes between Member States. In December 1997, the Council of Finance Ministers agreed to establish a highlevel Working Party to implement a Code of Conduct on business taxation. In March 1998, the Commission proposed a revised draft of the 1990 Directive to liminate withholding taxes on <b>interest</b> and royalty <b>payments</b> between associated companies within the EU. In May 1998, the Commission proposed a Directive designed to ensure minimum effective taxation of savings income within the EU, by ensuring that all Member States either apply a withholding tax of at least 20 per cent on <b>cross-border</b> <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> to EU-resident individuals or provide information on interest income to other Member States. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Interest</b> <b>payments</b> between {{affiliated}} companies which aim at shifting profit from high to low tax countries are a well-known and frequently used tool in international tax planning. It {{is therefore not}} surprising that in the OECD Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) (Action Plan) considerable attention {{is given to the}} measures limiting the deductibility of (excessive) intra-group <b>interest</b> <b>payments.</b> 1 The Action Plan does not, however, provide any clear guidance as to which, among the domestic anti-abuse measures existing in OECD or non-OECD member countries, should be recommended. Moreover, the OECD, by sticking to the arm’s length standard, refuses to consider more radical corporate tax reforms that could put an end to tax arbitrage opportunities created by <b>cross-borders</b> intra-group <b>interest</b> <b>payments.</b> From the EU perspective one may observe some interesting convergences between the OECD initiatives and the new measures that are presently being discussed in the European Commission and the Counci...|$|R
50|$|In 1990, the Parent-subsidiary {{directive}} {{tackled the}} issue of double taxation of repatriated profits by a mother company from its subsidiaries.4 Member states are requested either to exempt repatriated profits, or to deduct taxes already paid by the affiliates from the mother's tax bill (partial credit system). The objective was to avoid discriminating against foreign subsidiaries (taxed twice) in relation to purely domestic firms (taxed only once). In 2003, the Interest and Royalties directive further reduced the incidence of double taxation by abolishing withholding taxes on <b>cross-border</b> <b>interest</b> and royalty <b>payments</b> within the EU.|$|R

30|$|To analyze an IDR, one has {{to specify}} the cases in which <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> do and do not occur. While the partnership’s <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> is certain and {{does not depend on}} the project’s return, the corporation’s <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> or default gain do depend on the {{realization}} of x. As long as x<λ +T_ cit(x), the corporation not only fails to pay any interest, but moreover realizes a default gain for paying back less than the nominal debt amount. For x>λ +T_ cit(x), debt capital is fully redeemed and interest paid at least partially. Full <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> requires x>λ (1 +i)+T_ cit(x). We define x_ DG and x_ 0 as the critical gross returns that distinguish between the three cases, as is illustrated in Fig. 1.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{interest}} on consumer debt {{must be taken}} into account when measuring poverty and inequality. These <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> cannot be used to support household living standards. This makes middle- and low-income households worse off. Recent increases in consumer debt means that this deterioration in living standards is not captured by conventional government statistics. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances, we make estimates of poverty and inequality that take into account rising <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on consumer debt and discuss some of the implications of these estimates. consumer debt, income inequality, <b>interest</b> <b>payments,</b> poverty,...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we exploit the choice allowed by IFRS {{regarding}} {{the presentation of}} <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on the cash flow statement to answer two related questions: First, whether the classification choice is explained by firm reporting incentives and second, whether it is value relevant. Using a UK sample, we find that firms reporting losses, with {{a greater proportion of}} their debt stemming from public sources, with CFO-based covenants and greater increases in leverage in the year of adoption are less likely to report <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> in cash flows from operating activities (CFOA). Results also suggest that the incentive to meet or beat analyst CFO forecasts decreases, but strong corporate governance increases the probability of including <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> in CFOA. Based {{on the assumption that the}} decision not to classify <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> in CFOA captures lower disclosure quality or poor future expected performance, we posit that these firms should also exhibit lower valuations. Results obtained after correcting for self-selection bias confirm this assertion. We conclude that managers’ decision not to classify <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> in CFOA is consistent with the opportunistic use of the choice allowed by IFRS...|$|R
