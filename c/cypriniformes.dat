25|$|<b>Cypriniformes</b> {{include the}} most {{primitive}} of the Ostariophysi {{in the narrow}} sense (i.e. excluding Gonorynchiformes). This is evidenced not only by physiological details, but their great distribution, which indicates they had the longest time to spread. The earliest that <b>Cypriniformes</b> might have diverged from Characiphysi (Characiformes and relatives) {{is thought to be}} about the Early Triassic, about 250 million years ago (mya). However, their divergence probably occurred only with the splitting-up of Pangaea in the Jurassic, maybe 160 million years ago. By 110 mya, the plate tectonics evidence indicates that the Laurasian <b>Cypriniformes</b> must have been distinct from their Gondwanan relatives.|$|E
25|$|The {{goldfish}} (Carassius auratus) is a {{freshwater fish}} in the family Cyprinidae of order <b>Cypriniformes.</b> It {{is one of the}} most commonly kept aquarium fish.|$|E
25|$|Characiformes {{form part}} of a series called Otophysi within the {{superorder}} Ostariophysi. Otophysi contains three other orders, <b>Cypriniformes,</b> Siluriformes, and Gymnotiformes. Characiformes forms a group known as Characiphysi with Siluriformes and Gymnotiformes. Characiformes is the sister group to the orders Siluriformes and Gymnotiformes, though this has been debated in light of recent molecular evidence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cypriniformes</b> is {{an order}} of ray-finned fish, {{including}} the carps, minnows, loaches and relatives. This order contains 11-12 families, over 400 genera, and more than 4,250 species, with new species being described every few months or so, and new genera being recognized frequently. They are most diverse in southeastern Asia, and are entirely absent from Australia and South America.|$|E
25|$|Historically these {{included}} all the forms now {{placed in the}} superorder Ostariophysi except the catfish, which {{were placed in the}} order Siluriformes. By this definition, the <b>Cypriniformes</b> were paraphyletic, so recently the orders Gonorhynchiformes, Characiformes (characins and allies), and Gymnotiformes (knifefishes and electric eels) have been separated out to form their own monophyletic orders.|$|E
25|$|Characins {{possess a}} Weberian apparatus, {{a series of}} bony parts {{connecting}} the swim bladder and inner ear. Superficially, the Characiformes somewhat resemble their relatives of the order <b>Cypriniformes,</b> but have a small fleshy adipose fin between the dorsal fin and tail. Most species have teeth within the mouth, since they are often carnivorous. The body is almost always covered in well-defined scales. The mouth is also usually not truly protractile.|$|E
25|$|The {{families}} of <b>Cypriniformes</b> are traditionally {{divided into two}} superfamilies. Superfamily Cyprinioidea contains the carps and minnows (Cyprinidae) and, according to some, also the mountain carps as the family Psilorhynchidae. In 2012 Maurice Kottelat reviewed the superfamily Cobitioidea and under his revision it now consists of the following families: hillstream loaches (Balitoridae), Barbuccidae, Botiidae, suckers (Catostomidae), true loaches (Cobitidae), Ellopostomatidae, Gastromyzontidae, sucking loaches (Gyrinocheilidae), stone loaches (Nemacheilidae), Serpenticobitidae and long-finned loaches (Vaillantellidae).|$|E
25|$|Habitat destruction, damming of upland rivers, {{pollution}} {{and in some}} cases overfishing for food or the pet trade have driven some <b>Cypriniformes</b> to the brink of extinction or even beyond. In particular, Cyprinidae of southwestern North America have been severely affected; a considerable number went entirely extinct after settlement by Europeans. For example, in 1900 the thicktail chub (Gila crassicauda) was the most common freshwater fish found in California; 70 years later not a single living individual existed.|$|E
25|$|In science, one of {{the most}} famous members of the <b>Cypriniformes</b> is the {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio). The zebrafish is {{one of the}} most important vertebrate model organisms in biological and biochemical sciences, being used in many kinds of experiment. As, during early development, the zebrafish has a nearly transparent body, it is ideal for studying developmental biology. It is also used for the elucidation of biochemical signaling pathways. They are also good pets, but can be shy in bright light and crowded tanks.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that about 350 fish species live in the entire Ganges drainage, including several endemics. In a major 2007–2009 study of fish in the Ganges basin (including the river itself and its tributaries, but excluding the Brahmaputra and Meghna basins), a total of 143 fish species were recorded, including 10 non-native introduced species. The most diverse orders are <b>Cypriniformes</b> (barbs and allies), Siluriformes (catfish) and Perciformes (perciform fish), each comprising about 50%, 23% and 14% of the total fish species in the drainage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cypriniformes</b> {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in south-east Asia, where the most diversity of this group is found today. The alternative hypothesis is that they began in South America, similar to the other otophysans. If this were the case, they would have spread to Asia through Africa or North America before the continents split up, for these are purely freshwater fishes. As the Characiformes began to diversify and spread, they may have out-competed South American basal cypriniforms in Africa, where more advanced cypriniforms survive and coexist with characiforms.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the brown}} pelican (P. occidentalis), the American white pelican does not dive for its food. Instead it catches its prey while swimming. Each bird eats more than 4 pounds of food a day, mostly fish such as <b>Cypriniformes</b> like Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Lahontan Tui chub (Gila bicolor obesa) and shiners, Perciformes like Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus) or Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), Salmoniformes like Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Siluriformes (catfish), and jackfish. Other animals eaten by these birds are {{crayfish}} and amphibians, and sometimes larval salamanders. Birds nesting on saline lakes, where food is scarce, will travel great distances to better feeding grounds.|$|E
25|$|The oldest characiform is Santanichthys of {{the early}} Cretaceous (Albian stage) of Brazil. While all extant species are freshwater, this species was {{probably}} either brackish or marine. Many other fossils are also known. Characiformes likely first diversified during the Cretaceous period, though fossils are poorly known. During the Cretaceous period, the rift between South America and Africa would be forming; this may explain the contrast in diversity between the two continents. Their low diversity in Africa may explain why some primitive fish families and <b>Cypriniformes</b> coexist with them while they are absent in South America, where these fish may have been driven extinct. The characiforms had not spread into Africa soon enough to also reach the land bridge between Africa and Asia. The earliest they could have spread into Central America was the late Miocene.|$|E
2500|$|The Cyprinidae [...] are {{the family}} of {{freshwater}} fishes, collectively called [...] cyprinids, that includes the carps, the true minnows, and their relatives (for example, the barbs and barbels). [...] Also commonly called the [...] "carp family", or [...] "minnow family", Cyprinidae is the largest known fish family and the largest vertebrate animal family in general, with about 3,000 living and extinct species in about 370 genera. The family belongs to the ostariophysian order <b>Cypriniformes,</b> of whose genera and species the cyprinids make more than two-thirds. The family name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek kyprînos (κυπρῖνος, [...] "carp").|$|E
2500|$|Catfish {{belong to}} a {{superorder}} called the Ostariophysi, which also includes the <b>Cypriniformes,</b> Characiformes, Gonorynchiformes and Gymnotiformes, a superorder characterized by the Weberian apparatus. Some place Gymnotiformes as a sub-order of Siluriformes, however this is not as widely accepted. Currently, the Siluriformes {{are said to be}} the sister group to the Gymnotiformes, though this has been debated due to more recent molecular evidence. [...] there are about 36 extant catfish families, and about 3,093 extant species have been described. This makes the catfish order the second or third most diverse vertebrate order; in fact, 1 out of every 20 vertebrate species is a catfish.|$|E
2500|$|Like other {{orders of}} the Ostariophysi, fishes of <b>cypriniformes</b> possess a [...] Weberian apparatus. They differ from most of their {{relatives}} in having only a dorsal fin on their back; most other fishes of Ostariophysi have a small fleshy adipose fin behind the dorsal fin. Further differences are the Cypriniformes' unique kinethmoid, a small median bone in the snout, {{and the lack of}} teeth in the mouth. Instead, they have convergent structures called pharyngeal teeth in the throat. While other groups of fish, such as cichlids, also possess pharyngeal teeth, the cypriniformes' teeth grind against a chewing pad on the base of the skull, instead of an upper pharyngeal jaw.|$|E
2500|$|... 416 {{fish species}} are {{known from the}} Yangtze basin, {{including}} 362 that strictly are freshwater species. The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters, such as the river's estuary or the East China Sea. This makes {{it one of the}} most species rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species rich in China (in comparison, the Pearl River has almost 300 fish species and the Yellow River 150). 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin. Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above , are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river. The largest orders in the Yangtze are <b>Cypriniformes</b> (280 species, including 150 endemics), Siluriformes (40 species, including 20 endemics), Perciformes (50 species, including 4 endemics), Tetraodontiformes (12 species, including 1 endemic) and Osmeriformes (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.|$|E
