40|$|Gray mail, {{messages}} that could reasonably be considered either spam or good by different email users, is a commonly observed issue in production spam filtering systems. In this paper we study this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> using a large real-world email corpus and signaturebased campaign detection techniques. Our analysis shows that even an optimal filter will inevitably perform unsatisfactorily on gray mail, unless user preferences {{are taken into}} account. To overcome this difficulty we design a light-weight user model that is highly scalable and can be easily combined with a traditional global spam filter. Our approach is able to incorporate both partial and complete user feedback on message labels and catches up to 40 % more spam from gray mail in the low false-positive region. ...|$|E
40|$|The United States Postal Service (USPS) is a {{distributor}} of print media, and its {{policies and practices}} will engender short- and long-term effects on commercial printers, and by extension, their customers (publishers and marketers). Increasing mail rates may force publishers to seek electronic and other alternatives that in turn might lower mail volumes sufficiently to adversely affect Postal Service operations, causing a cycle of rate increases coupled with volume decreases. Simultaneously, electronic bill presentment and payment competes for that <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> that essentially supports the USPS. These occurrences could threaten the infrastructure that supports universal mail service and could negatively impact the $ 900 billion printing and mailing industries.

40|$|USPS drafted an Environmental Strategic Plan {{and formed}} a “Greening of the Mail ” task force [...] a {{partnership}} with several public and private organizations aimed at improving environmental performance and informing {{the debate over the}} environmental impact of mail. Despite the efforts of the Postal Service to improve environmental performance, some environmental organizations and competitors of the Postal Service have raised issues questioning the impact of bulk advertising or direct mail on the environment. This study analyzes the environmental costs and benefits of direct mail. Our analysis indicates that the environmental benefits of direct mail, although hard to quantify precisely, are far greater than the costs. To set a context for the discussion of environmental costs and benefits, we begin with a discussion of the composition of direct mail. The majority of direct mail is mailed at Standard (A) rates (previously referred to as Third-Class rates). This <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> accounted for over 39 percent of 1996 mail volume and has grown rapidly in this decade. The majority of Standard (A) mail consists o...|$|E

Although {{there are differences in}} the manner that the postal systems of the 191 nations that belong to the Universal Postal Union (UPU) apply and regulate the way their mails are franked, most mails fall under one (and sometimes more) of four major types and/or methods of franking: postage (stamps, etc.), privilege, official business, and business reply mail.|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} half year of its {{inception}} the Parcel Post service with its new series of special stamps proved to be very successful, resulting with the <b>mailing</b> <b>of</b> more than 300 million parcels during this short period. But after much confusion among and pressure from postal workers, the Post Office Department acquiesced and the Postmaster General authorized the use of ordinary postage stamps to pay the postage on 4th class parcels, beginning on July 1, 1913, ending mandatory use of the new stamps after precisely six months. In turn Parcel Post stamps were allowed for use to pay the postage for all <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> until the supply finally ran out. This is the only series of stamps issued by the Post Office that have ever been allowed dual usage. The last printing of Parcel Post stamps, a run of the 10-cent value, occurred on June 24, 1913, but stamps still in stock continued to be shipped to post offices for quite some time, particularly of higher values, with the final delivery—a supply of 75-cent stamps—made as late as 1921. Although the stamps were discontinued, one new denomination of the series—20 cents—was deemed too useful to discard, and a 20 cent value was accordingly added to the existing definitive Washington-Franklin series.|$|R
50|$|Also during 1893, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing {{competed for}} the postage stamp {{printing}} contract, and won {{it on the}} first try. For the postage issues of the 1894 series, the Bureau took over the plates of the 1890 small banknote series but modified them by adding triangles to the upper corners of the designs. Three new designs were needed, because the Post Office elected to add $1, $2 and $5 stamps to the series (previously, the top value of any definitive issue had been 90¢). On many of the 1894 stamps, perforations are of notably poor quality, but the Bureau would soon make technical improvements. In 1895 counterfeits of the 2¢ value were discovered, which prompted the BEP to begin printing stamps on watermarked paper {{for the first time}} in U.S. postal history. The watermarks imbedded the logo U S P S into the paper in double-lined letters. The Bureau's definitive issues of the 1890s consisted of 13 different denominations ranging from 1 cent to 5 dollars, and may be differentiated by the presence or absence of this watermark, which would appear on all U. S. Postage stamps between 1895 and 1910. The final issue of 1898 altered the colors of many denominations to bring the series into conformity with the recommendations of the Universal Postal Union (an international body charged with facilitating the course <b>of</b> transnational <b>mail).</b> The aim was to ensure that in all its member nations, stamps for given <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> would appear in the same colors. Accordingly, U.S. 1¢ stamps (postcards) were now green and 5¢ stamps (international mail) were now blue, while 2¢ stamps remained red. (As a result, it was also necessary to replace the blue and green on higher values with other colors.) U.S. postage continued to reflect this color-coding quite strictly until the mid-1930s, continuing also in the invariable use of purple for 3¢ stamps.|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In fiscal year 2006, the United States Postal Service (USPS) was responsible for discarding about 6. 1 billion pieces <b>of</b> undeliverable-as-addressed Standard <b>Mail</b> (a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> bulk advertising <b>mail</b> that includes catalogs and circulars). Some <b>of</b> this <b>mail</b> was recycled, but a large quantity of it was treated as waste and simply thrown away. Standard Mail is increasing in prominence due, in part, to its importance to businesses, nonprofits, and others as an effective way for (1) providing consumers with information on their products and services and (2) soliciting contributions from mail recipients. Some mail recipients, however, view Standard Mail as an annoyance that also poses privacy and environmental concerns. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Standard Mail accounted for about 5. 8 million tons, or 2. 4 percent, of municipal solid waste (otherwise known as trash or garbage) in 2005. Of this amount, 64 percent {{was placed in a}} landfill or incinerated, and 36 percent was recycled. The 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act required GAO to report [...] by December 20, 2007 [...] on, among other matters, USPS mail-related recycling accomplishments and additional recycling opportunities. For mail-related recycling accomplishments (initiatives), we expanded our work to include the mailing industry and other stakeholders, as appropriate. For this report on our interim results, our objectives were as follows: (1) describe the recent initiatives <b>of</b> USPS, the <b>mailing</b> industry, and other stakeholders with respect to four mail-related recycling topics, and (2) convey stakeholder-identified opportunities for USPS to engage in, or encourage others to engage in, activities related to these topics, as well as factors to consider [...] such as mission compatibility, logistics, and cost [...] in deciding whether to adopt these opportunities. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two threads in {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art: a networking approach dedicated to open participation and a crafted approach dedicated to the art object.

American artist Ray Johnson and the international artistic group operating under the banner of Fluxus are discussed as establishing mail art as a separate form through their creation <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network. The generation that followed Johnson and Fluxus expanded on the free and open ethos <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network, making it a cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and embracing new technology. Finally, this study examines work by contemporary mail artists who have not yet been historicized and who return to a craft approach in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art. Using Glenn Adamson 2 ̆ 7 s theory of craft, this thesis concludes that craft is an equally pertinent aspect <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and that, although it is underemphasized in mail art 2 ̆ 7 s first two generations, it is a dominant factor in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art today...|$|R
