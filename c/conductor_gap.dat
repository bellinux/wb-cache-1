40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} isolated genus two curves. There is no known efficient algorithm to explicitly construct isogenies between two genus two curves with large <b>conductor</b> <b>gap.</b> Thus there is no known way of transporting the discrete log problem (DLP) from an isolated curve to a large set of isogenous curves by constructing isogenies. Isolated genus two curves are curves that have large <b>conductor</b> <b>gap</b> to any other endomorphism classes. Isolated curves might be more secure for DLP based hyperelliptic curve cryptography. We establish results on explicit expressions for the index of an endomorphism ring in the maximal CM order, and give conditions under which the index is a prime number or an almost prime number for three different categories of quartic CM fields. We also derived heuristic asymptotic results on the densities and distributions of isolated genus two curves with CM by any fixed quartic CM field. Computational results, which are also shown for three explicit examples, agree with heuristic prediction with errors within a tolerable range...|$|E

40|$|The current {{techniques}} and methodologies {{used in the}} field of material characterization are well documented and widely accepted as reliable and accurate. However, literature describing these techniques focuses on the algorithms used during material characterization; few studies have reposted on the design of, and the selection criteria for, the test fixtures themselves. This research focuses on the measurement cell with the goal of determining the sensitivity of the measurement cell to the addition of a thin film material. Microstrip and coplanar waveguide were chosen for the analysis, which included three configurations of each transmission line geometry: a reference with no additional thin film material, one with the thin film on top of the conductors and one with the thin film beneath the conductors but on top of the transmission line substrate. The scattering parameters for the reference cell are compared to the scattering parameters of the test cell with the thin film material. The additional thin film material changes the effective dielectric constant of the reference cell; this change is evident in the phase and amplitude of S 21. The optimum measurement cell is the one that experiences the greatest change to the effective dielectric constant with the addition of the thin film. Thus the greatest difference in S 21 between the reference cell and the test cell is indicative of the reference cell 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity. The figure of merit (FOM) to determine the structure 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity is the integration over frequency of the magnitude of the vector difference of S 21. The analysis shows that the double-layered CPW measurement cell was the most sensitive. Once the optimum structure was determined an analysis of the sensitivity of the FOM to changes in the physical and electrical properties of the reference structure was conducted. The most important factors in the selection of the reference cell as evident by the FOM 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity are the substrate to thin film dielectric constant ratio and the CPW conductor aspect ratio to the thin film thickness. In particular, thinner films require a smaller <b>conductor</b> <b>gap</b> while wider gaps are preferable for thicker films. Measurement of four different CPW geometries, each covered in a 300 micron Polydimethylsiloxane thick film, validate the analysis process. The measurement cells differ in the conductor aspect ratio.

Despite its wide use of this structure, design rules of selecting geometrical details concerning the input/output feeding points are determined in each case experimentally, which is a tiresome process. In order to achieve an accurate and reliable design and to avoid cut and paste to achieve fine tuning of resonance at the desired frequency and matching at the input/output lines a field analysis is implemented to develop accurate design rules. In this context the effect of feeding structure geometrical details as well as inner-outer <b>conductor</b> <b>gaps</b> are examined.

30|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, an {{explicit}} formula in terms of elliptic integrals for a structure’s per-unit-length capacitance and inductance can be obtained, if the boundary value problem for Laplace’s equation {{can be divided into}} separate decoupled homogeneous domains, and the number of distinct conductors in each domain is no more than two. In the present paper we use a general approach based on implicit expressions with hyperelliptic integrals [15, 16], recently revisited in [17]. In contrast to the more established techniques, it is not constrained by the requirement that each domain contains no more than two conductors, but still requires them to be homogeneous. This allows to obtain expressions for the mutual capacitance and inductance matrices of coupled transmission lines even if they have completely arbitrary <b>conductor</b> and <b>gap</b> widths. The effect of finite thickness conductors has been recently investigated [18].|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate a generic process for fabrication and characterization of the Superconductive coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators. Superconductive CPW resonators with various lengths and shapes are designed to investigate their electrical and magnetic properties as well as resonance properties and sensitivities. In {{the first part of}} thesis, two different models are introduced in order to estimate the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a superconducting CPW resonator. The first model is based on Bean critical-state model and the second one is based on current dependence of London penetration depth. The existence of a shift in resonant frequency  of Superconductive CPW resonator caused by a non-linear kinetic inductance is also shown experimentally. Simulations were carried out to estimate the nonlinear kinetic inductance due to the self- induced magnetic field penetration. The rest of the thesis is concerned with development of very smooth Aluminum (Al) thin films with RMS (Root Mean Square) roughness 1 ~nm and CAD (Computer Aid Design) of superconductive CPW resonators.

The DRC program monitors compliance with the design rules (minimum width of the <b>conductors</b> and <b>gaps,</b> the parameters of pads and via-holes, the parameters of polygons, etc.) and also checks the route tracing, short circuits, the presence of objects outside PCB edge and other design errors. The result of the DRC program running is the generated error report. For quality production of circuit boards DRC-errors should be corrected, that is ensured by the creation of error-free DRC report. Method. A problem of correction repeatability of DRC-errors {{was identified as a}} result of trial operation of P-CAD, Altium Designer and KiCAD programs. For its solution the analysis of DRC-errors was carried out; the methods of their correction were studied. DRC-errors were proposed to be clustered. Groups of errors include the types of errors, which correction sequence has no impact on the correction time. The algorithm for correction of DRC-errors is proposed. Main Results. The best correction sequence of DRC-errors has been determined. The algorithm has been tested in the following EDA: P-CAD, Altium Designer and KiCAD. Testing has been carried out on two and four-layer test PCB (digital and analog). Comparison of DRC-errors correction time with the algorithm application to the same time without it has been done. It has been shown that time saved for the DRC-errors correction increases with the number of error types up to 3. 7 times. Practical Relevance. The proposed algorithm application will reduce PCB design time and improve the quality of the PCB design.

40|$|Previous {{micro strip}} -to -waveguide {{transitions}} either required a hermetically sealed waveguide configuration, or a balun {{that needed to}} be tuned according to the frequency band of interest. In this design, the balun is realized using a double -Y junction to transition from microstrip to coplanar strip feeding a quasi-Yagi dipole array (see figure). The length of the feed (Lf) extending into the waveguide is 15. 54 mm. The length of the ground plane below the ULTRALAM substrate is 7. 75 mm. The lengths L 1, L 2, and L 3 are 8. 50 mm, 4. 38 mm, and 2. 14 mm, respectively. These lengths were computed via a preliminary optimization aimed at improving the return loss at the band edges. The waveguide feed was designed to excite the TE 10 mode in a WR- 90 waveguide, and to operate over the recommended frequencies of 8. 2 to 12. 4 GHz. The feed employs a Rogers 6010 substrate (dielectric constant Er approx. equals 10. 2) bonded with a Rogers ULTRALAM substrate (Er approx. equals 2. 5). The ULTRALAM substrate serves to provide mechanical strength for 6010 substrate, and to mitigate loses due to parasitic modes (the ground plane is etched on the bottom of this layer due to the topology of the double -Y balun). The double-Y balun transitioning from an unbalanced microstrip line to a balanced coplanar strip (CPS) line does not provide inherent impedance transformation; hence, Klopfenstein impedance tapers were synthesized to transition from 50 to 77 Ohms in the microstrip section and from 77 to 110 Ohms in the CPS section. At the balun junction, the CPS stub lengths were chosen such that the X/ 8 resonance is pushed outside the bandwidth of operation.

40|$|The dynamic {{operation}} {{as well as}} {{the failure}} modes of a hairpin nucleate bubble generator operating at 125 kHz has been studied using a high-speed optical sampling system. The hairpin generator loop consists of a 6. 8 -μm wide 4. 2 -μm <b>gap</b> <b>conductor</b> located under a 20 -μm period 110 ° chevron propagation pattern. In stable operation {{in the center of the}} operating range, bubbles are nucleated along the hairpin conductor preserving a U shape that reflects the shape of the hairpin conductor. After nucleation, the <b>gap</b> of the <b>conductor</b> fills with a long wide domain. This long domain then shrinks to a stable position under the propagation elements with a wall velocity of 40 m/s. All velocities observed are consistent with velocities observed on free bubbles using radial expansion, except for the growth in length after nucleation during the generate pulse, where the domain grows about three times faster than would be expected. This difference is attributed to the in-plane component of the generate current field that is very nonuniform through the thickness of the sample. The failure mode for a low or short generate pulse is multibubble generation caused by nonuniform nucleation along the length of the conductors of the hairpin loop. For certain pulse characteristics at this low end of the operating range, a stable U-shaped domain is nucleated only to be cut into two domains at the end of the generate pulse as the drive field reverses the poles on the nearest chevron stack from what it was during the pulse. The failure mode at the upper end of the operating range also results in excess bubbles. Here the mechanism can be identified as the development of a wavy wall as it moves rapidly under the conductor element in the presence of a large in-plane field caused by the generate current. This distortion then increases as the domain shrinks, resulting in nobs that are pinched off to create excess bubbles. The distortion is similar to that seen during the collapse of highly expanded stripes. This failure can be cured by increasing the fall time of the generate pulse to a least 100 ns...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} {{predicting}} the e ect of a Floating Conductor (FC) on the breakdown voltage is presented and critically analysed {{in conjunction with}} results from laborat- ory work. Firstly, the scenario of live-line maintenance on HVDC lines is modelled by a FC within a rod-plane gap. The use of a rod-plane gap is to produce a non- uniform eld distribution, representing the non-uniform eld that would surround the conductor of a transmission line. This test object is then further simpli ed into simple gap geometries such that the breakdown voltage of the two gaps separated by the FC can be numerically calculated and the breakdown voltage of the entire test object predicted. The DC breakdown voltage of the rod-plane gap is then presented {{as a function of}} the position of the FC in the gap. The simulations are performed for both positive and negative DC voltages. The laboratory work uses a similar test object, with the U 50 breakdown voltage recorded {{as a function of the}} position of the FC within the rod-plane gap. The simulation model is then critically analysed by comparing the laboratory and simulation results. It is concluded that although the model predicts the change in the breakdown strength from the starting to the ending points, the developed model has omitted detail that leads to discrepancies in the predicted results when compared to the laboratory results. This omitted detail includes the e ect of corona discharge from the FC, additional parameters a ecting the potential of the FC, the oversimpli cation of the gap geometry for numerical calculation, and the lack of a dynamic model for the changing electrostatic scenario as an applied voltage increases towards the breakdown voltage. The results also show that the position of a FC a ects the breakdown strength of a non-uniform gap. This e ect is due to the polarity dependent nature of breakdown in a non-uniform gap and in particular, the di erence in the breakdown strength of a quasi-symmetrical (rod-rod) and asymmetrical (rod-plane) non-uniform gap. The e ects of charged particles and their interaction with the oating <b>conductor</b> in the <b>gap</b> is also deemed to have a signi cant e ect on the breakdown strength, with their behaviour also in uenced by the sustained electric eld that is a result of HVDC stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} high {{frequency}} microwave devices is rapidly increasing with the advances {{achieved in the}} communication systems. However, the standard guiding structures have high losses such as microstrip technology, or difficulty in manufacturing {{such as in the}} case of waveguides. The newly developed ridge gap waveguide (RGW) technology resolves the problems above as it has low losses and does not require electrical contacts as required in the waveguides. The concept of RGW is simple as it allows the wave propagations in the guiding part and eliminates the leakage in all other directions. The region that surrounds the ridge consists of two parallel surfaces; one is a perfect electric conductor (PEC) and the second is a perfect magnetic <b>conductor</b> (PMC). The <b>gap</b> between the two surfaces should be less than a quarter wavelength. Periodic conducting nails realize the PMC that practically has a possible bandwidth 2. 5 : 1 and in some cases exceeds 3 : 1. Usually, the design of these surfaces relies on the unit cell analysis that is based on determining its band gap, the estimation of the band gap is performed numerically. The band gap of the cell is the operating bandwidth of the complete structure. For the first time, we presented a method to measure the band gap from s-parameter measurements. Utilization of the broadband characteristics strongly depends on the proper design of the transition between the RGW and the standard guiding structures and connectors. Most of the available transitions make use of around one-third of the possible bandwidth. Therefore, we present new transitions that utilize the whole possible bandwidth of the RGW. The presented work can be divided into four major parts. Several microwave components are designed based on the RGW such as power divider, hybrid couplers, and a circulator. New methods are presented for efficient and accurate design of these components. One of the main contributions is related to the RGW circulator design; it's an accurate design procedure that can be used with other technologies as well. In addition, a new setup to measure the low relative permittivity of thin materials such as fabrics is presented. An example of a leaky wave antenna using split slot arrays is presented. These studies highlight the RGW advantages and can be considered as a step towards the standardization of this technology...|$|R

Like other materials, LCPs also show some disadvantages such as poor adhesion to Copper (Cu), problems in via processing, etc. In order to evaluate LCP’s electrical performance, the design, fabrication and characterization of passive components operating at frequencies extending into the mm-wave regime are performed to determine the feasibility of LCP as a low-cost substrate solution for mm-wave application. Since the U. S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released the unlicensed use of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) systems for different applications, much interest and many research activities have been aroused on exploring a variety of UWB components and devices. Of them, UWB bandpass filter and UWB antenna {{have been identified as}} two of the key circuit blocks in the whole UWB system. Although much effort has been invested in experimental and theoretical studies of microstrip UWB filters and UWB antennas, it is still difficult to get filters with excellent performance and simultaneously low cost and compact size, and wide bandwidth antennas with small area. In this thesis, two novel compact microstrip UWB bandpass filters, an UWB printed monopole antenna and a 60 GHz parallel-coupled line bandpass filter are presented on LCP substrates. Based on the dual-mode ring resonator theory, two UWB bandpass filters, working on 22 - 29 GHz and 50 - 70 GHz band, are proposed. The proposed UWB bandpass filter includes a full dual-mode rectangular-ring resonator at the center, which controls the bandwidth of the passband and two novel parallel-coupled feed structures between input/output ports and the ring resonator, for coupling purposes with the resonator. Moreover, a tapered Co-Planar Waveguide (CPW) -fed hollowed UWB printed monopole antenna is also presented on a LCP substrate. It consists of a hollowed elliptical monopole, two trapeziform ground planes and a tapered CPW feeder, which provides this antenna extremely wide bandwidth and compact size. Finally, a 60 GHz band planar microstrip bandpass filter with ultra-fine <b>conductor</b> linewidth and <b>gap</b> is reported based on the parallel-coupled line structure. By using standard processing methods i. e. surface pretreatment, sputter deposition, photolithography and wet etching, all of these microwave passive devices are fabricated on LCP laminate based substrates. In order to improve the surface roughness of the LCP substrates, the surface is pre-treated by means of oxygen plasma etching. In addition, a thin adhesion layer of Titanium (Ti) is applied prior to the sputter deposition of Cu to improve the adhesion between the Cu and the LCP material. The comparison of simulated and measured results of both developed filters and antennas is also shown and discussed. The fact that both UWB bandpass filters and UWB antennas show good results, verifies that LCP materials are potentially promising substrate material for microwave/mm-wave applications...|$|R
