25|$|The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separation</b> of {{isotopes}} {{was first}} suggested by Aston and Lindemann in 1919 {{and the first}} successful experiments were reported by Beams and Haynes on isotopes of chlorine in 1936. However attempts to use the technology during the Manhattan project were unproductive. In modern times it is the main method used throughout the world to enrich uranium {{and as a result}} remains a fairly secretive process, hindering a more widespread uptake of the technology. In general a feed of UF6 gas is connected to a cylinder that is rotated at high speed. Near {{the outer edge of the}} cylinder heavier gas molecules containing U-238 collect, while molecules containing U-235 concentrate at the center and are then fed to another cascade stage. Use of gaseous centrifugal technology to enrich isotopes is desirable as power consumption is greatly reduced when compared to more conventional techniques such as diffusion plants since fewer cascade steps are required to reach similar degrees of separation. In fact, gas centrifuges using uranium hexafluoride have largely replaced gaseous diffusion technology for uranium enrichment. As well as requiring less energy to achieve the same separation, far smaller scale plants are possible, making them an economic possibility for a small nation attempting to produce a nuclear weapon. Pakistan is believed to have used this method in developing its nuclear weapons.|$|E

The work performance and structural parameters of conveyor are immediately related to the production capability, the working life and the separating effect of the centrifuge. The existing researches always use the theoretical calculation of the approximate loads to analyze the strength of conveyor, and it cannot reflect the stress situations accurately. In order to ensure the precise mastery of the working performance, this article obtained pressure distribution under working conditions from CFX evaluation and gained equivalent stress and deformation under several load conditions by using the ANSYS Workbench platform to check the strength of conveyor. The {{results showed that the}} influence of centrifugal hydraulic pressure was less than that of centrifugal force on the strength and deformation of conveyor. Besides, the maximum equivalent stress occurred at the inside of the feed opening, while the maximum deformation occurred at the conveyor blade edge of taper extremity. Furthermore, whether considered the feed opening or not, the computing model had a great influence on the analysis results, and the simplified loads had a great influence on the deformation analysis results.
