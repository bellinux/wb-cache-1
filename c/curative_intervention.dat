30|$|Our {{dependent}} variables are ‘type of intervention’, ‘type of support’, ‘targeted family member’, ‘targeted age group’ and ‘goals of intervention’. The variable ‘type of intervention’ consists of universally preventive interventions, targeted prevention/early <b>interventions</b> and <b>curative</b> <b>interventions.</b> Universally preventive interventions are those interventions that target the general parent population and {{which do not}} specify any “parental conditions.” They are available for all parents. Targeted prevention programs do specify certain conditions—which vary between programs—and are offered to specific groups of parents only. For instance, a program such as the Community Mothers Program (Moeders informeren moeders) is specifically developed for young first-time mothers from a low social–economical background, whereas a program like Pedagogical Advises (Pedagogisch Adviseren) is developed to offer help and assistance to all parents in Dutch society. <b>Curative</b> <b>interventions</b> are interventions for parenting situations in which problems have already occurred, and the interventions specifically aim to tackle these problems, for example, Multisystemic Therapy that helps parents in dealing with children who are exhibiting serious externalizing problem behaviour such as drugs abuse, truancy and aggression.|$|R

English-language publications retrieved from PubMed and from references of retrieved papers describing clinical studies of <b>curative</b> <b>interventions</b> were read and demographic, recruitment year, and intervention-type details were noted. Variables of interest included participation by sex, age, and race; changes in participation rates by recruitment year; and differences in participation by intervention type. Of 151 publications, 23 % reported full demographic data of study enrollees, and only 6 % reported conducting efficacy analyses by demographic variables. Included studies recruited participants from 1991 to 2011. No study conducted safety analyses by demographic variables. The representation of women, older people, and nonwhites did not reflect national or international burdens of HIV infection. Participation of demographic subgroups differed by intervention type and study location. Rates of participation of demographic groups of interest did not vary with time. Limited data suggest efficacy, particularly of early therapy initiation followed by treatment interruption, may vary by demographic variables, in this case sex.

50|$|The {{consensus}} statement highlighted {{the need for}} well-designed studies to address these questions as an important health research priority. In the meantime, active surveillance {{for the treatment of}} low risk prostate cancer is now being offered to more and more patients where it is generally considered that prostate cancer will not cause the man harm during his lifetime if treatment is delayed or avoided. For these men, surveillance is thought to offer a more targeted approach to management; avoiding unnecessary treatment and its risk of associated side effects, while allowing for <b>curative</b> <b>intervention</b> for those that experience disease progression on observation.|$|E
5000|$|Most urologists {{will monitor}} a patient on {{surveillance}} with PSA and {{digital rectal examination}} at least biannually, and perform surveillance prostate biopsies at 1-2 year intervals. [...] However, defining disease progression is problematic. Progression in active surveillance programs has been defined based on PSA kinetics or exceeding a given PSA threshold, increased extent of cancer or higher grade disease on prostate biopsy, change in digital rectal examination, and proceeding to <b>curative</b> <b>intervention.</b> Yet, PSA changes and exceeding a given threshold PSA value may not reflect progression of disease. [...] A change in stage or digital rectal examination findings is unusual among patients with low risk disease. Switching from surveillance to <b>curative</b> <b>intervention</b> may be triggered by a patient’s personal preference or anxiety and not necessarily by {{a change in the}} cancer. Cancer grade is the strongest feature associated with long term freedom from disease in untreated men, and therefore the finding of high grade cancer (Gleason score above 6) is the most universally agreed upon trigger for intervention for men on surveillance. However, it appears that most men who are found to have high grade disease on surveillance biopsies, had the high grade disease missed on the diagnostic biopsy and not progression from low to high grade cancer while on surveillance. This misclassification of disease at diagnosis may be reduced in the future with improvements in imaging and biopsy tissue assessment that go beyond the Gleason score.|$|E
50|$|For {{low grade}} astrocytomas, {{removal of the}} tumor will {{generally}} allow functional survival for many years. In some reports, the five-year survival has been over 90% with well resected tumors. Indeed, broad intervention of low grade conditions is a contested matter. In particular, pilocytic astrocytomas are commonly indolent bodies that may permit normal neurologic function. However, left unattended these tumors may eventually undergo neoplastic transformation. To date, complete resection of high grade astrocytomas is impossible because of the diffuse infiltration of tumor cells into normal parenchyma. Thus, high grade astrocytomas inevitably recur after initial surgery or therapy, and are usually treated similarly as the initial tumor. Despite decades of therapeutic research, <b>curative</b> <b>intervention</b> is still nonexistent for high grade astrocytomas; patient care ultimately focuses on palliative management.|$|E

50|$|Prostate {{specific}} antigen (PSA) based {{screening for}} prostate cancer led to earlier detection of prostate cancer (stage migration), and thus altered {{the course of the}} disease in the absence of treatment (natural history). The incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer increased with widespread PSA testing, as did the length of time that men live with their disease, as compared to the pre PSA era. The stage migration that occurred, with application of <b>curative</b> <b>intervention</b> at an earlier stage, undoubtedly led to a reduction inprostate cancer mortality. However, the extent to which this reduction was due to PSA based screening is debatable. Further, because prostate cancer progresses slowly and is found most often in older men with competing risks of mortality, {{the extent to which these}} changes in natural history have resulted in benefit and harm are also debatable.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} tumor metrics, natural history studies clearly {{demonstrate}} that Gleason score {{is a powerful}} predictor {{of the risk of}} disease progression and dissemination. It is therefore essential that the diagnosis reflect an accurate grade. For this, MRI-guided targeted biopsies may be superior to conventional TRUS-guided systematic biopsies; a National Institutes of Health study comparing the two biopsy approaches demonstrated that targeted biopsy results led to upgraded TRUS biopsy Gleason scores in 32% of cases, which could rule active surveillance out for those patients. In addition, the supplemental risk factor information provided by both stage and PSA at diagnosis should be included in making an active surveillance decision (see table above). Finally, the preference of a patient for living with cancer or side effects of treatment should be considered in decision making. [...] Patients with similar disease characteristics for whom both observation and <b>curative</b> <b>intervention</b> might be reasonable, may have differing personal preferences. For some, willingness to accept a decline in quality of life to be rid of a cancer that has minimal chance of causing harm over a decade or more may seem reasonable; while others would rather live with a cancer and maintain their quality of life. An understanding of a patient’s personal preferences should play a large part in shared decision making.|$|E

Methods: The records of patients undergoing hepatectomy for colorectal metastases over 10 years in one centre were retrospectively reviewed to determine when and how recurrence was diagnosed. Specific attention was paid to the detection of potentially curable disease. Results: Of 41 recurrences, 22 occurred in the first year postoperatively, 21 of which were suitable for palliative treatment only.
