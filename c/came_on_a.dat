5|$|Alabama {{continued}} their scoring {{into the third}} quarter with touchdowns on their first two possessions of the half. The first <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 38-yard McCarron pass to Amari Cooper on a drive that also saw McCarron complete a pass to his brother Corey McCarron. The second <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 31-yard Chris Black run that made the score 42–0. With the Crimson Tide significantly up, mostly back-up players completed the fourth quarter. After a long drive stalled at the Mocs' 23-yard line, Eddie Jackson returned a C. J. Board fumble caused by Jonathan Allen to the Chattanooga six-yard line. On the next play, Dee Hart made the final score 49–0 with his six-yard touchdown run. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mocs to 12–0.|$|E
5|$|Over a {{third of}} Georgia's 71rushingyards <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single 26-yard run {{in the first quarter}} by halfback Kregg Lumpkin. After the run, Lumpkin would amass only 13additionalyards in the {{remaining}} threequarters of play. Over half of Georgia's total offensive yards (200 total yards) came through the air from Stafford, who finished with 129passingyards, oneinterception, and onetouchdown. Approximately a third (41yards) of Stafford's passing yards <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single completion in the fourth quarter. Another long pass play netted Stafford 24yards. Together, the two plays accounted for half of Stafford's total passing yards. Seven other completions netted only 64yards, an average of just over 9yards a play.|$|E

5|$|In the fourth, the Crimson Tide scored touchdowns on both {{of their}} {{offensive}} possessions and made the final score 48–7. The first <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 20-yard AJ McCarron pass to Kevin Norwood and the second on a seven-yard Altee Tenpenny run. Offensively, McCarron threw for 359 yards and Drake and Yeldon ran for 106 yards and 124 respectively. This {{marked the first time}} in team history that Alabama had a 300-yard passer and two 100-yard runners in a single game. For his performance, right guard Anthony Steen was recognized as SEC Offensive Linemen of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Wildcats to 36–2–1.|$|E
5|$|In {{their annual}} rivalry game, Alabama {{defeated}} the Tennessee Volunteers 45–10 at Tuscaloosa. The Crimson Tide took a 21–0 lead after they scored touchdowns {{on all three}} of their first quarter possessions. The first <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 54-yard AJ McCarron pass to Amari Cooper, the second on a one-yard T. J. Yeldon run and the third on a 22-yard McCarron pass to Kevin Norwood. After Alabama extended their lead to 28–0 {{early in the second}} quarter on Yeldon's second one-yard run of the game, the defense made their first turnover when Deion Belue intercepted a Justin Worley pass.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} the Rockets' first all-time meeting against Navy, 14 {{unanswered}} points {{in the fourth quarter}} gave the Midshipmen the 14–10 win at the Glass Bowl. Toledo led 10–0 as they entered the fourth quarter with points scored on a 34-yard Hanna field goal in the first and on a six-yard David Andrews touchdown run in the third. Navy came back to win the game in the fourth on a pair of Jason Pace touchdowns. The first <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nine-yard run and the second on a five-yard reception from Alton Grizzard. The loss effectively resulted in the Rockets failing to get a bowl bid as Central Michigan got the automatic MAC bid to the California Bowl due to having the tiebreaker over Toledo.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{performance}} was supplemented by Tech running back Branden Ore, who led all rushers with 55yards on 19rushes. Fourteenof Ore's 55yards <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single play {{halfway through the}} fourth quarter when the Boston College's defensive line gave way, admitting Tech's runner into the defensive secondary. The run helped set up Virginia Tech's go-ahead touchdown later in the fourth quarter. Capping Tech's ground game were complimentary performances by Kenny Lewis and Sean Glennon, each of whom earned fewer than 10yards, but picked up first downs on two plays.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{in front}} of the largest crowd to ever witness a game in Davis Wade Stadium, and with the Bulldogs wearing black jerseys {{for the first time in}} their history, Alabama cruised to a 31–3 victory over long-time rival Mississippi State. After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, Alabama scored a pair of touchdowns in the second to take a 14–0 lead. The first touchdown <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 45-yard Darius Hanks reception from Greg McElroy and the second on a 1-yard Mark Ingram run.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{ended their}} regular {{season with a}} win over the Dodgers and an undefeated record. The Browns began the game by scoring 31 {{unanswered}} points. The first score <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> short Dub Jones run that followed an 80-yard drive in the first quarter. The next score <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 76-yard drive in the second quarter. After a pair of passes and a 14-yard run by Edgar Jones, Graham completed a long touchdown pass to Lavelli, who sped away from defender Monk Gafford on the right sideline. Graham engineered another long drive just {{before the end of}} the first half, completing 18- and 20-yard passes to Speedie. The 90-yard march ended with a short touchdown run by Graham, giving Cleveland a 21–0 advantage at the half. Groza kicked a field goal at the beginning of the third quarter, and a fumble by Gafford on the ensuing kickoff led to a touchdown pass from Graham to Gillom, putting the Browns up by 31 points. With a comfortable lead, Brown took out his starters and substituted third-string players. The Dodgers proceeded to score three touchdowns, two of which came on long passes from Bob Chappuis, but the Browns won the game 31–21. The win left the Browns on top of the standings in the AAFC's Western Division ahead of San Francisco, which had lost only two games, both to the Browns. The perfect regular season record was the first in professional football since 1942, when the National Football League's Chicago Bears won all of their games. Chicago, however, lost the NFL championship that year.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{received}} {{the second half}} kickoff and mounted a record-setting drive. The opening drive ran for over 9 minutes (a Super Bowl record) and culminated in a 1-yard touchdown run by Ottis Anderson, giving the Giants a 17–12 lead. The signature play of the drive <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> third down play, when Giants receiver Mark Ingram appeared about to be tackled well short of a first down. However, Ingram evaded several tacklers, and dragged one defender just {{enough to get the}} Giants the first down, and kept the drive alive. By this time, the Giants strategy to handle the Bills offense had become clear: keep them off the field. Indeed, the Giants two touchdown drives consumed over 17 minutes.|$|E

The signature play of the drive <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> third-down play, when Giants receiver Mark Ingram appeared about to be tackled well short of a first down.

5|$|Though the Giants {{kept the}} game {{close in the}} first half, and went into halftime down 10–0, the Ravens {{dominated}} the second half. Their defense (led by game MVP Ray Lewis) frustrated Kerry Collins all game long, resulting in Collins turning {{in one of the}} worst playoff performances in Super Bowl history. Collins completed 15 of 39 passes for 112yards and 4 interceptions. The Ravens won the game 34–7 {{in one of the most}} lopsided Super Bowls ever. The lone Giants score <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Ron Dixon kickoff return for a touchdown. On the very next kickoff, the Ravens countered as Jermaine Lewis also returned a kickoff for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|After the Tigers' {{tied the}} game 17–17 on a 41-yard Colby Delahoussaye field goal {{to open the}} second half, the Crimson Tide went on their first of three {{consecutive}} touchdown drives. Their first touchdown <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> four-yard T. J. Yeldon run that capped a 14 play, 79-yard drive that included a successful fake punt. On their next possession, Yeldon scored on a one-yard touchdown run that extended Alabama's lead to 31–17. Odell Beckham Jr. then returned the kickoff that ensued 82-yards to the Crimson Tide 18-yard line. However, the offense was unable {{to capitalize on the}} good field position as the Alabama defense forced a turnover on downs. The Crimson Tide then drove 78 yards in eight plays, capping the drive with a three-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Jalston Fowler that made the score 38–17. The Alabama defense then closed the game with three consecutive sacks of Mettenberger, winning 38–17. For his 12 tackle performance, C. J. Mosley was recognized as both the SEC Defensive Player of the Week and as the Lott IMPACT National Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 48–25–5.|$|E
