40|$|Dedicated to {{the memory}} of Robert Miner Abstract. We develop the Lorentzian {{geometry}} of a <b>crooked</b> half-space in 2 + 1 -dimensional Minkowski space. We calculate the affine, conformal and isometric automorphism groups of a <b>crooked</b> halfspace, and discuss its stratification into orbit types, giving an explicit slice for the action of the automorphism group. The set of parallelism classes of timelike lines, or particles, in a <b>crooked</b> halfs-pace is a geodesic halfplane in the hyperbolic plane. Every point in an open <b>crooked</b> halfspace lies on a particle. The correspondence between <b>crooked</b> halfspaces and halfplanes in hyperbolic 2 -space preserves the partial order defined by inclusion, and the involu-tion defined by complementarity. We find conditions for when a particle lies completely in a <b>crooked</b> half space. We revisit the disjointness criterion for <b>crooked</b> planes developed by Drumm and Goldman in terms of the semigroup of translations preserving a <b>crooked</b> halfspace. These ideas are then applied to describe folia-tions of Minkowski space by <b>crooked</b> planes...|$|R

5|$|In December 1872, Colonel George <b>Crook</b> used Apache scouts {{to find a}} cave in Salt River Canyon {{that was}} being used by Guwevkabaya to mount attacks on White settlers. On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of the cave. 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at {{the roof of the}} cave, causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged gathered around the mouth of the cave, where soldiers (accompanied by <b>Crook)</b> pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group. The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by <b>Crook</b> that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones from the cave, and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.|$|E

On 7 December 2012, <b>Crooks,</b> along with James Burke, joined Radcliffe Borough on loan until mid-January. <b>Crooks</b> made an impressive display at the club, including when he scored a brace against Clitheroe.

5|$|Using a night {{march and}} diversions by other {{segments}} of the army, General <b>Crook</b> secretly positioned his infantry {{to the rear of}} the Confederate line. Averell's cavalry division, plus a division of infantry led by General James B. Ricketts, created the diversion that enabled Crook's two infantry divisions to remain concealed while they positioned themselves near Little North Mountain. Crook's fighters, who were experienced in fighting in mountainous terrain, flanked the west side of the Confederate line. Crook's surprise attack broke through the Confederate lines, and was the major reason for the Union victory. Powell's cavalry brigade pushed through the gap created by <b>Crook,</b> and chased rebels as they fled south. The chase continued throughout the evening.|$|E

Melvin was later commissioned as Adjutant general of Volunteers on the staff of Brigadier General Benjamin Franklin Kelley in the Department of West Virginia. On February 21, 1865, Melvin was captured in Cumberland, Maryland, along with General Kelley and Major General George <b>Crook,</b> by the Confederate partisans, McNeill's Rangers. Melvin, Kelley, and <b>Crook</b> were taken to Richmond where they were exchanged for Confederate general Isaac R. Trimble.|$|E

5|$|On May 27, 1862, Colonel Crook's 3rd Brigade routed rebel {{infantry}} in {{a conflict}} where the shooting lasted for only 27 minutes. Rebel casualties were 72 men killed, over 100 wounded, and 157 men taken prisoner. They also lost four cannon, 300 small weapons, and 25 horses. Crook's brigade lost 13 killed, 50 wounded (including <b>Crook,</b> who {{was shot in the}} foot), and 6 missing. The feat was accomplished by taking advantage of aggressive rebel soldiers and a hostile town. <b>Crook</b> had learned that a large rebel infantry under the command of General Henry Heth was moving toward Lewisburg. <b>Crook</b> positioned his brigade {{at the far end of}} the town, and sent a small group of pickets to the opposite end where the rebels would approach. Heth's rebels raced into town after the pickets, urged on by the pro-rebel local population. The rebels were quickly ambushed in a short action that ended after a charge by Union infantry and cavalry. The 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry battalion had been held out of the fighting, but was used to chase the fleeing rebels. The rebels escaped by burning the Greenbrier Bridge.|$|E

5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as a {{constellation}} called GAM, representing a scimitar or <b>crook.</b> However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The <b>crook</b> of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed {{from most of the}} stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.|$|E
