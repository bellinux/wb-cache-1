40|$|Abstract. Crack {{propagation}} in high purity alumina ceramics {{with different}} grain sizes was investigated with the Double Torsion method during static and cyclic fatigue. A compliance function, {{based on the}} variation of compliance with bridging stresses, is applied here to quantify the amount of <b>crack</b> <b>bridging.</b> It is shown experimentally that the reinforcement due to <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> {{is proportional to the}} compliance function. Under cyclic fatigue, a reduction of <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> is observed, followed by a decrease of the compliance function. During crack propagation under cyclic loading, the compliance is affected by the frictional degradation of bridges (due to repeated unloading and loading). At low loads, the crack growth rate is initially equal to zero, but <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> decreases monotonically with the number of cycles. After an ‘incubation ’ period, crack propagation initiates and new bridges are formed. This leads further to an equilibrium between crack shielding degradation and crack shielding accumulation...|$|E
40|$|A new {{mathematical}} procedure {{has been}} proposed for the determination of <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> stresses from perturbed crack opening displacements (COD) in fiber composites. The problem is an ill-posed inverse problem and the proposed procedure exploited concepts from functional analysis and the theory of inverse problems. The transformation from <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> stress into COD has been linearized, where the continuous <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> stresses functions of infinite dimensional vector spaces were approximated into finite dimensional subspaces. The coordinate representation of functions and the matrix of the transformation facilitated a numerical solution to the inverse problem.

40|$|The {{resistance}} of polycrystalline materials to intergranular cracking can {{be influenced by}} the microstructure. In sensitized stainless steels, for example, the grain boundaries prone to sensitization form paths of low resistance for intergranular stress corrosion cracking. The nonsensitized grain boundaries, such as twin boundaries, have been observed to encourage the formation of <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> ligaments. Computational models of intergranular cracking have been developed to investigate the consequences of <b>crack</b> <b>bridging,</b> through its effects on crack propagation in microstructures with different fractions of nonsensitized boundaries. This paper introduces the recently developed, two-dimensional model for intergranular cracking with <b>crack</b> <b>bridging,</b> and reports its application to investigate the effect of grain size. It is shown that the size of the <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> zone depends on the grain size, and the shielding contribution depends on the relative size of the bridging zone compared to the crack length. It is concluded that both grain refinement and increase in the fraction of resistant boundaries can improve microstructure resistance to intergranular cracking. These observations are consistent with the effects of grain boundary engineering on stress corrosion cracking resistance in sensitized stainless steels. Copyright © 2008 by ASME...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA fibrous {{composite}} beam {{with an edge}} crack is submitted to a cyclic bending moment and the <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> actions due to the fibers. Assuming a general elastic-linearly hardening <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> model for the fibers and a linear-elastic law for the matrix, the statically indeterminate bridging actions are obtained from compatibility conditions. The elastic and plastic shake-down phenomena are examined in terms of generalised cross-sectional quantities and, by employing a fatigue crack growth law, the mechanical behaviour up to failure is captured. Within {{the framework of the}} proposed fracture mechanics-based model, the cyclic <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> due to debonding at fiber–matrix interface of short fibers is analysed in depth.

40|$|The ingress {{of carbon}} dioxide and {{chloride}} ions into reinforced concrete can cause corrosion of the steel reinforcement. Cracks and poor quality cover can accelerate this process. Coating the surface of the concrete can increase the life of the structure. A coating must have the ability to bridge cracks that form in the substrate concrete and to accommodate any subsequent movement of that crack without failure. If the coating itself is damaged by substrate cracking then the coating becomes less effective as it no longer provides a barrier to the deleterious agents. There are currently few methods to assess the performance of a coating on a reinforced concrete surface subject to crack formation and subsequent movement. In this thesis a test specimen, machine and methodology are developed to evaluate the <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> and crack accommodation performance of these coatings. The specimen is 40 mm x 40 mm x 160 mm mortal prism, coated on one face and axially reinforced with an 8 mm steel bar. A crack in the specimen is opened by the application of a tensile load {{to the ends of the}} reinforcing bar by a pneumatically powered testing machine. Initial investigations confirmed that the testing machine was reliable and gave reproducible results. A testing program was then carried out to investigate the effects of temperature, coating thickness, artificial weathering and crack width on the <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> and crack accommodation behaviour of the coatings. It was found that increasing the thickness of a coating allowed wider cracks to be bridged. Crack accommodating behaviour was found to fall into three regions dependent upon the test temperature. At the lowest temperatures both <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> and crack accommodation did not occur. As the temperature was increased <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> and crack accommodation occurred but the crack accommodation behaviour was highly variable.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{mathematical}} modelling of the crack self-healing process. For self-healing modeling of <b>cracked</b> structures the <b>bridged</b> <b>crack</b> approach is used. In the frames of this approach is assumed: 1) there is a crack in a structure after service loading; 2) there are bonds between surfaces of a crack (which are induced by a healing mechanism, the interface layer); 3) this layer is considered {{as a part of the}} crack with distributed nonlinear spring-like bonds between surfaces of <b>crack</b> (<b>bridged</b> zone). The bonds properties define the stresses at the <b>crack</b> <b>bridged</b> zone, its size and, hence, the fracture toughness of the material. The main goal of the modeling consists in the computational analysis of the bridging stresses distribution and in the computing of the stress intensity factors which are the main characteristics of self-healing efficiency. The mathematical background of the stress problem solution is based on the singular integral-differential equations method and the boundary elements method.

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness and toughening mechanism of two epoxy matrices containing varying concentrations of pre-formed polyamide- 12 particles was investigated. The pre-formed thermoplastic modifier {{was used to}} keep the physical and morphological characteristics of the second phase constant while varying the matrix intrinsic toughness to simplify the interpretation of toughening results. We observed that these particles toughened the epoxies through a <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> mechanism involving large plastic deformation of the second phase. This mechanism {{was found to be}} effective independent of the potential of the matrix for plastic deformation since the increasing {{fracture toughness}} was accomplished without significant amounts of plastic deformation in the epoxy matrix. A quantitative model was adapted to account for the increase in toughness due to the <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> mechanism. From this model, it was possible to determine the factors which are most important when attempting to toughen a material through thermoplastic <b>crack</b> <b>bridging.</b> A better understanding of the specific factors which influence the efficiency of the <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> mechanism enables the fracture properties of brittle materials to be further improved with thermoplastic addition.

40|$|Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECCs) are {{a unique}} member of high {{performance}} fibre reinforced cementitious composites, featuring outstanding tensile strain-hardening capacity with superior tensile strain capacity and multiple microcracking with self-controlled tight crack width. Due {{to the importance}} of the tensile behaviour of the ECC, a hierarchical multiscale modelling method is developed for effective and efficient characterisation of the mechanical behaviour of ECCs under static and fatigue tensile loading. A generic analytical model is developed for <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> analysis in short fibre reinforced cementitious composites such as ECCs, which is the characteristic mechanical behaviour of ECCs at the microscale and lower mesoscale. The model predicts well the <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> stress-crack opening displacement relation. A representative volume element (RVE) model is proposed to model the joint response of the uncracked matrix and multiple cracks of ECCs at the upper mesoscale. The material randomness of ECCs is also considered in the RVE model. The RVE model is analysed by a hybrid cohesive zone model-extended finite element method (hybrid CZM-XFEM) method introduced in this work, which is used to simulate the multiple cracks adaptively as well as describe the crack cohesive behaviour using a simplified efficient cohesive model proposed based on the <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> analysis at the microscale and lower mesoscale. To characterise the mechanical behaviour of ECCs under fatigue tensile loading, degradation models of the micromechanical properties are proposed, and a cycle-dependent <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> relation, which accounts for both the interface degradation and fibre fatigue rupture, is developed based on the degradation models. The bridging stress degradation of ECCs under fatigue loading is modelled through a cyclic analysis based on the multiscale modelling method and the cycle-dependent <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> relation. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibre reinforced ECC (PVA-ECC) by using a local sand instead of the normally used fine silica sand is developed.

The current theoretical model for estimating <b>crack</b> <b>bridging</b> performance of Random Short Fiber Reinforced Cement Composites (RSFRCC) under tension is limited to specific constituent properties: friction dominant fiber-matrix interface and complete fiber pull-out from matrix without rupture. The new theory extends this model by accounting for two often encountered features in practice: fiber strength reduction and rupture in composites and chemical bond dominant fiber/matrix interface. The new theory was verified to capture important characteristics in bridging performance in comparison with composite tensile test data.

Measurements were performed at room temperature and, in the ter case, at elevated temperatures. This was carried out using qualitative observation of the crack growth morphology and quantitative measurements of the ply-by-ply fibre and matrix strain distributions {{in the vicinity of}} the crack, both as a function of crack growth and distance from the crack plane. Qualitative tomographic observations showed that the crack front bowed out between fibres and eventually reconnected further downstream. This led to some matrix bridging the crack even when the crack front was some way past a given fibre and to a more tortuous non-planar crack path, both of which could increase the fatigue resistance. The rate of crack growth slowed somewhat near the fibres, but the magnitude of crack opening displacements was relatively insensitive to the actual locations of the fibres.
