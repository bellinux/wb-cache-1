40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Two {{types of}} {{exogenous}} mortality factors, density-independent and density-dependent, were identified {{for the black}} vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus Fab., developing on <b>container</b> <b>grown</b> rhododendrons. The addition of the insecticide acephate, (O. S. - Dimethyl acetylphosphoramidothioate, Orthene®) 75 S) to the rhizosphere of rhododendrons in which larval O. sulcatus develop was categorized as a density-independent mortality factor. Acephate when applied as a drench, killed both early and late instar larvae. The mode of entry was primarily contact. Application of acephate drenches to control early instar (I-III) larvae prevents fatal injury (girdling) to <b>container</b> <b>grown</b> rhododendrons. A life table was constructed for the black vine weevil on <b>container</b> <b>grown</b> rhododendrons at three densities (beginning with 25, 75, and 150 eggs per plant) {{in the process of}} identifying mortality factors. The greatest mortality occurred during the first instar as the larvae become established on the root systems of host plants. At high larval densities (> 4 larvae per plant, in a 23 x 22 cm plastic container) the amount of available stem exoxylary tissue became a density-dependent mortality factor. This is because the larvae require exoxylary tissue to successfully complete development on rhododendron, although they do not feed on it prior to the fourth instar. Therefore, mortality increased with an increase in insect density because of competition for the limited amount of exoxylary tissue. The percent of stem exoxylary tissue removed (consumed) by larvae was dependent on the volume of rhododendron roots. Plants with large (1622 ± 223 ml) root volumes had significantly less (P< 0. 01) stem exoxylary tissue removed than plants with small (360 ± 265 ml) root volumes...|$|E

Supplying soilless media with Osmocote (26 % N) and other short term fertilisers {{proved to be a}} satisfactory method of studying the comparative nutrition {{of a wide range of}} <b>container</b> <b>grown</b> nursery plants using factorial experiments incorporating N, P, K and lime. Nutrient response surfaces were obtained using a central composite incomplete block design. Most Proteaceous shrubs were intolerant of high P levels due to excessive luxury consumption resulting in toxic foliar nutrient levels, especially in the presence of high N. Phosphorus sensitivity in plants appeared to correspond with the soil nutrient levels in their native habitat. This applied to species studied in the 2 main sub-families in the Proteaceae while similar findings were indicated for other Australian genera. A range of optimum N requirements in the Proteaceae was found – lowest needs for Protea which also had the greatest tolerance of very low fertiliser additions, compared to Grevillea robusta with much higher N requirements and strong foliage growth inhibition if nutrient levels are very low. Proteoid root growth on Grevillea rosmarinifolia only occurred at low nutrient levels and was not required for satisfactory foliage growth of <b>container</b> <b>grown</b> plants. Pot plants and seedlings, especially tomato, responded strongly to N and often there were positive NK interactions influencing foliage growth.

Terminal managers have to face with an increasing competitiveness among terminals, which require more and more efficiency in container operations both along the quayside and within the yard: the objective is usually to minimize ship’s turnaround time, one of the main indicators of the termi-nal performance for the shipping companies. Moreover the minimization of operational costs directly entails the achievement of competitive terminal fares, thus increasing the attractiveness for new customers. Operations research methods and techniques are therefore worth being used in optimizing terminal operations.

Therefore, researchers showed their interest in other organic materials like agricultural wastes which could be viable source of organic nutrients {{for the production of}} <b>container</b> <b>grown</b> plants. Agricultural waste such as rice hulls, coir, sawdust, and compost as growing media has been proved as an important substitute of simple soil for ornamental plant production (Younis et al. 2007; Wilson et al. 2009; Tariq et al. 2012) including gerbera. Furthermore, production of large sized gerbera flowers is entirely based on the structure, texture, pH, organic matter contents, as well as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels of the growth media (Rader 1998; Lang and Pannuk 1998). Organic media that are light in weight, rich in nutrients and well-drained considered ideal choices for growth and development of flowering plants like gerbera (Awang et al. 2009; Dubey et al. 2013), as these plants are notoriously ranked as heavy feeders and require abundant quantities of plant food for maximum development.

Ports with one or more container terminals are considered complex systems in which many resources, entities and transporters interact to achieve the objective of safely moving containers delivered by ships inland as well as loading containers delivered by trucks and rail onto ships. Ports with multimodal transportation systems are in particular complex as they typically operate with ships arriving to one or more terminals, multiple quay cranes, rubber tyred gantry cranes, trains, and trucks delivering containers of different types to terminals.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{project was}} to study tree establishment, both how it may be {{improved}} in urban areas {{and how it is}} measured and defined. The establishment phase of trees is a period of reduced tree vitality, and a successful establishment is crucial for long-term survival and prosperity of newly planted trees. However, failed plantings and poor establishment is a common problem in the often harsh growing conditions present in urban areas. Improving tree establishment is thus important for securing the presence of trees in urban environments. Another important part is to understand how the process of establishment is expressed in trees, so that the needs of the trees can be met. Tree nursery industry has recently developed production systems that aim to produce trees that are better prepared for transplanting. This study set out to investigate the effect nursery production systems might have on tree establishment success, and to examine different ways of assessing establishment, since the term is not consistently defined. Sweet cheery and red oak trees, cultivated as either bare-rooted (BR), balled & burlapped (B&B), root-pruned (RP), air-potted (AP) or fabric <b>container</b> (FC) <b>grown</b> were planted at one urban and one rural site in Southern Sweden. The trees were studied during the final nursery year and the four first post-transplant years. The production systems influenced total root length for both species, providing root systems with large differences in appearance. Shoot growth was restored to pre-transplant values for RP, FC and B&B sweet cherry trees at the rural site, three years after transplanting. Water status was significantly higher for AP trees than BR trees of both species, but only during the first year after transplanting, at the rural site. In general, effects of production system were more pronounced at the rural site with the higher water availability, indicating that none of the studied production systems was superior to use in urban plantings. Visual assessments of the establishment success of the trees were affected by leaf size, colour and shape. Leaf size was related to water status. Water status and shoot growth measurements were not correlated during the first years after transplanting. The term establishment can be used in different ways, and the differences might affect the outcome of an establishment assessment...|$|R
