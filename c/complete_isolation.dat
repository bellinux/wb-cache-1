5|$|We Don't Need to Whisper is {{the debut}} studio album by the American rock band Angels & Airwaves. Recorded at Neverpants Ranch in San Diego, California and {{produced}} by guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, {{the album was}} released on May 23, 2006 through Geffen Records. In February 2005, DeLonge (who desired {{to spend more time}} with his family) departed from his former band Blink-182 after months of heated exchanges and increasing tension within the trio and spent the following three weeks in <b>complete</b> <b>isolation,</b> contemplating his life, career, and future in music.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms from <b>complete</b> <b>isolation,</b> called sensory deprivation, {{often include}} anxiety, sensory illusions, or even distortions {{of time and}} perception. However, {{this is the case}} when there is no {{stimulation}} of the sensory systems at all, and not only lack of contact with people. Thus, by having other things to keep one's mind busy, this is avoided.|$|E
25|$|The Ilm-e-Kshnoom ('science of ecstasy', or 'science of bliss') is {{a school}} of Parsi-Zoroastrian {{philosophy}} based on a mystic and esoteric, rather than literal, interpretation of religious texts. According to adherents of the sect, they are followers of the Zoroastrian faith as preserved by a clan of 2000 individuals called the Saheb-e-Dilan ('Masters of the Heart') who are said to live in <b>complete</b> <b>isolation</b> in the mountainous recesses of the Caucasus (alternatively, in the Alborz range, around Mount Damavand).|$|E
25|$|With a {{long history}} of {{physical}} and economic isolation from mainland North Carolina, residents of Harkers Island and other Outer Banks islands, such as Ocracoke, have developed a distinct dialect of English, commonly referred to as High tider, that {{can be traced back to}} that of the Elizabethan period. The dialect of Harkers Island developed in almost <b>complete</b> <b>isolation</b> for over 250 years. Harkers Island English shares features with other regional dialects of the US Atlantic coast. Pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammatical constructions can be traced to eastern and southwestern England. The dialect has survived because the community continues to depend on traditional trades, like fishing, boat building, and decoy carving, and the coastal tourism trade developed on Harkers Island much later than islands like Ocracoke.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid <b>complete</b> <b>isolation</b> from the world, Mullan paid two of his men to travel {{back and forth to}} Fort Walla Walla with mail. Mail arrived twice a month, once a month in bad weather. Another man was sent to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, to buy {{replacement}} mules, while P.M. Engle was sent to Fort Benton to buy cattle and supplies. In early January, Mullan sent engineer Walter Whipple Johnson to back to Fort Walla Walla with instructions to proceed to Washington, D.C., and dispel rumors that the road crew was in crisis. During the winter, Mullan also reassessed his route. He realized that his road should have followed the north shore of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the Clark Fork River. Significantly over budget, Mullan told his crew that he {{might not be able to}} pay their wages. Five left.|$|E
25|$|This led to {{long periods}} of {{evolution}} in near <b>complete</b> <b>isolation.</b> The isolation of the island was not absolute, given {{the rise and fall}} of sea level caused by the ebb and flow of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between Tasmania and its neighbour, mainland Australia. Thus new species came to Tasmania while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Birds and bats swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. Other seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of such types.|$|E
500|$|Around {{three million}} years ago, during the Pliocene epoch, Central America {{emerged from the}} sea, {{effectively}} cutting off currents between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. The rerouting of ocean currents led to climatic changes as the Earth entered a glacial cycle. Cold water upwelling around the Cape of Good Hope and reduction in water temperature at Cape Horn formed coldwater barriers to migrating turtles. The result was a <b>complete</b> <b>isolation</b> of the Atlantic and Pacific populations of loggerheads. During the most recent ice age, the beaches of southeastern North America were too cold for sea turtle eggs. [...] As the Earth began to warm, loggerheads moved farther north, colonizing the northern beaches. [...] Because of this, turtles nesting between North Carolina and northern Florida represent a different genetic population from those in southern Florida.|$|E

50|$|Disruptive {{selection}} can initially rapidly intensify divergence; this {{is because}} it is only manipulating alleles that already exist. Often it is not creating new ones by mutation which takes a long time. Usually <b>complete</b> reproductive <b>isolation</b> does not occur until many generations, but behavioral or morphological differences separate the species from reproducing generally. Furthermore, generally hybrids have reduced fitness which promotes reproductive isolation.|$|R
500|$|Henderson's initial {{design for}} Fremantle Prison {{was based on}} the Pentonville Prison in Britain. Pentonville, {{designed}} by Joshua Jebb, used the [...] "separate system" [...] that kept prisoners in nearly <b>complete</b> <b>isolation,</b> to encourage reflection on their crimes. Jebb reviewed Henderson's plans in 1851, and to reduce the cost, he changed the two diagonal cell blocks that mimicked Pentonville into a four-storey linear structure, which would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began soon afterwards, supervised by Henderson, Manning, and Royal Engineer lieutenant Henry Wray, who had arrived with another convict ship. Within eighteen months of the Scindians arrival, the convict population had grown to almost 1000. In 1855 convicts began to be moved into The Establishment, as the prison was then known as, but the project would not be completed until 1859.|$|E
500|$|DeLonge {{underwent}} a complete reassessment of his prime {{concerns in the}} aftermath of the band's break-up—a move [...] "bearing the hallmarks of a nervous breakdown"—and went on a three-week [...] "spiritual journey" [...] in <b>complete</b> <b>isolation</b> away from his family, contemplating his life, career, and future in music. DeLonge was psychologically hurt by the band's dissolution, likening it to a divorce and calling it a [...] "traumatic experience" [...] and a [...] "disaster." [...] He had been known for his role in the Blink-182 as [...] "the low-brow prankster" [...] and wanted to restart his career without worrying whether fans would find him funny. The background of Angels & Airwaves was based on DeLonge's endorsement of John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election, travelling the political circuit with the Democratic Party candidate; DeLonge was inspired by Kerry's need for widespread reform and likened his presidential campaign to a drug, remarking later that it [...] "really changed [...]" [...] He rediscovered the epiphany developed during his tour with Kerry and applied it to the philosophy of Angels & Airwaves, while he redefined himself as he learned to play piano and self-produce and formed his own home studio.|$|E
500|$|Tufan Hashemi said Roksan {{sought to}} create {{equipment}} that would excel in high-quality musical reproduction {{and capable of}} involving the listener on an emotional level. Product characteristics were to include precision and transparency of the sound. Moghaddam, acting as chief designer, {{set out to find}} solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in the belt-driven suspended sub-chassis turntable design of Edgar Villchur, where the sub-chassis and tonearm are free to rotate. Moghaddam believed that the design generated undesirable torsional modes. One such torsional mode is said to be caused by [...] "groove drag" [...] – dynamic forces exerted by the stylus on the record as it tracked it. Moghaddam chose to attenuate the torsion by mounting the turntable-drive motor casing on its own bearing. The motor, mounted separately and tethered to a spring, is allowed limited rotation about its own axis; because the load varied with groove modulations, the increases in drag would thus be dampened by the spring-loaded motor, and the platter acceleration mitigated. In the words of Tufan Hashemi, Roksan Audio's managing director: [...] "We argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read, as the record itself would be floating. We said that the record surface should remain stationary and solid but in <b>complete</b> <b>isolation</b> {{from the rest of the}} deck, and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it." ...|$|E

500|$|When the Second World War commenced, Bodley {{immediately}} {{rejoined the}} King's Royal Rifle Corps {{and was given}} the rank of major. Regarded as too old for active service in the infantry, {{he was sent to}} work for the Ministry of Information in Paris. He was in Paris when the German army invaded in May 1940. According to the back cover of his book The Soundless Sahara, after the fall of Paris he went to work behind the German lines until he came under suspicion of the Gestapo, then escaped across the Pyrenees on foot. A 2013 biographical journal article on Bodley by William Snell of Keio University made no mention of this work or escape, instead saying that Bodley stayed with his mother and stepfather near Bayonne after the invasion. According to Snell, after his mother and stepfather refused to leave, Bodley and three other Britons entered Spain via car, {{with the aid of a}} friend of Bodley's who worked at the British embassy in Madrid. Snell concluded his article by saying that while Bodley's life was adventurous, he did tend to dramatise it at times. Bodley returned to the United States via Portugal. Upon his return he focused on a career in writing and lecturing. Bodley would go into <b>complete</b> <b>isolation</b> in order to write a book, spending about ten weeks to complete his work. He wrote several of his books in York Harbor, Maine. Bodley frequently gave lectures while travelling the United States, speaking in almost every state and referring to himself as [...] "Colonel" [...] or [...] "Major". Having reached the mandatory age for retirement, he ceased to be a member of the British Army on 3 March 1943. By 1944 he had become a US citizen and was an advisor to the Arabic desk of the US Office of War Information.|$|E
500|$|The {{metaphor of}} the MCU as [...] "the world's biggest TV show" [...] was {{discussed}} again, {{after the release of}} Captain America: Civil War, by Todd VanDerWerff of Vox, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, [...] "Viewed in <b>complete</b> <b>isolation,</b> the plot of Captain America: Civil War makes little to no sense ... when you think about where [...] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense." [...] VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many [...] "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" [...] such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack [...] "visual spark", or [...] "shoehorn in story elements" [...] that [...] "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that [...] "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks [...] "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryen—"both separated by long distances from everybody else." [...] He noted that this format was an extension of early [...] "TV-like" [...] film franchises such as Star Wars, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. [...] "I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, [...] "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's {{the end of the world}} if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although Wolbachia {{bacteria}} do {{not benefit}} their hosts in any way, they are maintained {{in the population}} because infected mothers pass them to their offspring through the ovum.

40|$|Using a weak {{migration}} and weak mutation approximation, I studied the average waiting time to parapatric speciation. The description of reproductive isolation used {{is based on}} the classical Dobzhansky model and its recently proposed multilocus generalizations. The dynamics of parapatric speciation are modelled as a biased random walk performed by the average genetic distance between the residents and immigrants. If a small number of genetic changes is su¤cient for <b>complete</b> reproductive <b>isolation,</b> mutation and random genetic drift alone can cause speciation on the time-scale of ten to 1000 times the inverse of the mutation rate over a set of loci underlying reproductive isolation. Even relatively weak selection for local adaptation can dramatically decrease the waiting time to speciation. The actual duration of the parapatric speciation process (that is the duration of intermediate forms in the actual transition to a state of <b>complete</b> reproductive <b>isolation)</b> is shorter by orders of magnitude than the overall waiting time to speciation. For a wide range of parameter values, the actual duration of parapatric speciation is of the order of one over the mutation rate. In general, parapatric speciation is expected to be triggered by changes in the environment...|$|R
