40|$|Discussed {{here are}} {{problems}} {{with the use of}} cowlings with radial air cooled engines. An XF 7 C- 1 airplane, equipped with service cowling and with narrow ring, wide <b>ring,</b> and exhaust <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> cowlings over the service cowling, was used. For these four cowling conditions, the rate of climb and high speed performance were determined, the cylinder conditions were measured, and pictures to show visibility were taken. The level flight performance obtained with an engine speed of 1900 r. p. m. for the service type, the narrow ring, the wide ring, and the exhaust <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> was 144. 4, 146. 6, 152. 8, and 155 mph, respectively. The rate of climb was practically the same for each type tested. The visibility was not materially impaired by the use of the wide or the narrow cowlings. With the narrow <b>ring</b> and exhaust <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> cowlings there was an increase in cylinder temperature. However, this increase was not enough to affect the performance of the engine.

50|$|When the {{electron}} beam scans the plate again, any residual {{charge in the}} granules resists refilling by the beam. The beam energy is set so that any charge resisted by the granules is reflected back into the tube, where it is collected by the <b>collector</b> <b>ring,</b> a ring of metal placed around the screen. The charge collected by the <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> varies {{in relation to the}} charge stored in that location. This signal is then amplified and inverted, and then represents a positive video signal.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a direct}} current {{is applied to}} the commutator, the coil will begin to rotate as a commutated {{electric}} motor and an alternating current can be taken out of the <b>collector</b> <b>rings.</b> This is called an inverted rotary converter (see Inverter).|$|E
50|$|BLSRs {{can operate}} within a {{metropolitan}} region or, often, will move traffic between municipalities. Because a BLSR does not send redundant copies from ingress to egress, the total bandwidth that a BLSR can support {{is not limited}} to the line rate N of the OC-N ring, and can actually be larger than N depending upon the traffic pattern on the ring. In the best case, all traffic is between adjacent nodes. The worst case is when all traffic on the ring egresses from a single node, i.e., the BLSR is serving as a collector ring. In this case, the bandwidth that the ring can support is equal to the line rate N of the OC-N ring. This is why BLSRs are seldom, if ever, deployed in <b>collector</b> <b>rings,</b> but often deployed in inter-office rings. The SDH equivalent of BLSR is called Multiplex Section-Shared Protection Ring (MS-SPRING).|$|E

The results indicate that at full open throttle at sea level, for the engine tested, a gain in thrust horsepower of 18 percent using separate stacks, and 9. 5 percent using a <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> and discharge nozzle, can be expected at an air speed of 550 miles per hour...|$|R
50|$|In {{unidirectional}} path-switched rings (UPSRs), two redundant (path-level) {{copies of}} protected traffic are sent {{in either direction}} around a ring. A selector at the egress node determines which copy has the highest quality, and uses that copy, thus coping if one copy deteriorates due to a broken fiber or other failure. UPSRs tend to sit nearer {{to the edge of}} a network, and as such are sometimes called <b>collector</b> <b>rings.</b> Because the same data is sent around the ring in both directions, the total capacity of a UPSR is equal to the line rate N of the OC-N ring. For example, in an OC-3 ring with 3 STS-1s used to transport 3 DS-3s from ingress node A to the egress node D, 100 percent of the ring bandwidth (N=3) would be consumed by nodes A and D. Any other nodes on the ring could only act as pass-through nodes. The SDH equivalent of UPSR is subnetwork connection protection (SNCP); SNCP does not impose a ring topology, but may also be used in mesh topologies.|$|E
40|$|Thesis for {{the degree}} of Bachelor of Science in {{electrical}} engineering. "Manuscript copy. Nearly every possible loss of power about a dynamo has been investigated more or less thoroughly and efforts made to eliminate such loss by careful design of the part in which the loss occurs. The losses at the brushes due to friction, electrical resistance, etc. have been investigated several times but {{the results of these}} tests do no always agree with each other and in so far as they do agree are not generally known. It is usual, in finding the losses of a machine, either experimentally or by calculation, to include the brush losses with the load losses. The actual value of the losses at the brushes is seldom known. Consideration of the lack of certain knowledge of this subject, led us to attempt this investigation. It was our original intention to investigate the voltage drop and contact resistance of several kinds of brushes at different current densities, different brush pressures, different speeds of rotation of the commutator or <b>collector</b> <b>rings,</b> different frequencies of alternating current, etc. Digitized at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia MU Libraries Digitization Lab in 2011...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the development of the induction machine as a generator for wind turbines {{from the middle of the}} 20 th centu-ry up to now. After a short history chapter the different energy conversion concepts are presented. At first a squirrel cage machine is direct coupled to the grid (Danish concept). To adjust the machine speed the second step is a wound rotor machine with <b>collector</b> <b>rings</b> to change rotor resistance. This concept allows the first adaption of the operating point of the wind turbine and the induction machine. Another concept is to connect the stator of a squirrel cage machine with a full inline voltage source converter to the grid to get the flexibility in rotational speed and to control the reactive power. The doubly fed induction machine is the latest development. This concept uses a bidirectional voltage source converter in the rotor circuit with a ra-ted power of only 30 % of the rated generator power. Now it is possible to change the rotational speed and the reactive power independently and in a wide range. A generalized control scheme of a modern doubly fed inducti-on machine (DFIG) is shown in the last part to explain the variability and the range of application. Today over 70 % of the wind turbines are build up with DFIG...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A Faraday probe {{with three}} {{concentric}} rings {{was designed and}} fabricated to assess the effects of gap width and probe geometry in a systematic study of the Hall thruster plume. The nested Faraday probe consisted of two concentric <b>collector</b> <b>rings</b> and an outer guard ring, which enabled simultaneous current density measurements on {{the inner and outer}} collector. Two versions of the outer collector were fabricated to create 0. 5 mm or 1. 5 mm gaps between the rings. Current density distribution of a Hall thruster ion source were studied at 8, 12, 16, and 20 thruster diameters downstream of the exit plane with four probe configurations at background pressures of 3 x 10 - 6, 1 x 10 - 5, and 3 x 10 - 5 torr. Several correction factors are proposed to account for the effective probe collection area and systematic measurement error associated with measuring an annular device as a point source. These corrections enable the investigation of beam expansion and ion migration from the central core, and result in a highly accurate estimate of divergence in the Hall thruster plume. Application of the correction factors and characterization of facility effects are shown to decrease the calculated beam current by 10 - 20 % compared to conventional analysis and reduce measurement uncertainty to ± 3 %...|$|E
40|$|With the {{widespread}} use of electric machines, there is a growing need to extract information from the machines to improve their control systems and maintenance management. The present work shows the development of an embedded system to perform the monitoring of the rotor physical variables of a squirrel cage induction motor. The system is comprised of: a circuit to acquire desirable rotor variable(s) and value(s) that send it to the computer; a rectifier and power storage circuit that converts an alternating current in a continuous current but also stores energy for {{a certain amount of time}} to wait for the motor’s shutdown; and a magnetic generator that harvests energy from the rotating field to power the circuits mentioned above. The embedded system is set on the rotor of a 5 HP squirrel cage induction motor, making it difficult to power the system because it is rotating. This problem can be solved with the construction of a magnetic generator device to avoid the need of using batteries or <b>collector</b> <b>rings</b> and will send data to the computer using a wireless NRF 24 L 01 module.
