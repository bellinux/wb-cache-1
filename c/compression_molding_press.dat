40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} are hybrid materials {{designed for}} the needs of the 21 st century. With their capability to form low weight structures, while preserving high stiffness and excellent damping, these composites provide solutions for a broad range of markets. Unfortunately, some of these advantages are not used in practice because there exist no fast and automated manufacturing processes for efficient production. In the research field of continuous-reinforced thermoplastic composites, industry is facing a challenge of high viscose polymer melt and thereby an imperfect fiber wet-out. As a result, synergy effects of fibers within a polymer could not be fully exploited. The topic of this work is to adapt new processing technologies for reactive thermoplastic polymers. On one hand, fast heating and cooling options offer processes with shorter cycle time, and on the other hand, low viscosity of reactive polymers impregnates the textile structures faster. This results in faster and cheaper manufacturing of composites that are yet to be realized for the market. All FRPCs were produced on a continuous <b>compression</b> <b>molding</b> <b>press.</b> As a noncontinuous technology, an inductive heated CageSystem® from RocTool has been selected. Entropically driven ring-opening cyclic oligomers form Cyclics with waterlike melt viscosities are chosen as reactive matrix. The viscosity of Cyclic Butylene Terephthalate (CBT*) was measured using a rheometer. The rheological behavior is determined under isothermal conditions for various temperatures. The chemical transformation from oligomer to macromolecule pCBT 1 was assessed by size exclusion chromatography. Based on these studies, a kinetic polymerization model was constructed which involved an Arrhenius-type equation. By using the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, it was possible to offer an exact mathematical solution for the prediction of isothermal conversion. A numerical solution of the Arrhenius equation helped to predict the polymerization for any timetemperature conditions. Furthermore, the polymerization model was extended to describe the chemo-rheology. Inserting specific material parameters, the bipartite model was able to provide a numerical prognosis for the viscosity with the input parameters time-temperature. All models were calibrated and validated with the experimental data. The continuous <b>compression</b> <b>molding</b> <b>press</b> was used to consolidate CBT-prepregs and PBT-prepregs. As reinforcing phase, a multiaxial non-crimp-fabric from Ahlstrom was used. This fabric contained glass fibers with a “CBT*-compatible” sizing. The design of experiments was mainly focusing on the variation in the temperature distribution in process direction with respect to process speeds. An extensive analysis, from optical to energy absorption, was performed on the resulting FRPC-product, called organic sheet. All test results showed a better performance for GF-pCBT compared to GF-PBT. Even for much higher process speed, the material properties of GF-pCBT did not deteriorate strongly in contrast to GF-PBT. The enhancement was traced to a better fiber-matrix interface (e. g., ILSS values) and to an excellent fiber wet-out with pCBT (e. g., SEM pictures). Viscosity and impregnation are the main factors behind the transversal visco-elastic impregnation model that was deduced. An arithmetic function that tracks the impregnation process for the classical thermoplastic PBT and its reactive pendant CBT* was derived. This was based on the dimensionless B-factor which was considered as technology independent performance indicator. The model was able to link the fast impregnation with CBT* - the viscosity of which is 10 - 5 magnitude lower than PBT - to all temperature-time-conditions. An optimization method was used to find process parameters to realize a minimum cycle time for the continuous process. This model was adapted to the non-continuous pressing technology to find the minimum cycle time. To evaluate the economic potential, a transparent process analysis was set up in form of a static cost calculation. In a first step, all monetary activities from each technology were identified and rated. The cycle time - as main capacity indicator - was based on the chemo-rheological model introduced above. Different break-even analyses and production costs highlighted the techno-economic potential of the related process-material-combination. A synergistic effect between innovative process technologies and reactive thermoplastic polymer was found. Faster and more efficient technologies for the production of fiber-reinforced plastics have been systematically developed and evaluated. The results were achieved with an intelligent combination of manufacturing technology and modern reactive thermoplastic polymers. Moreover, the approach of this work can be transferred to the other reactive thermoplastic matrix-based composites...|$|E
40|$|PNNL {{conducted}} a systematic optical modeling effort {{to study and}} compare retroreflector designs with respect to available optical materials. The optical Strehl ratio (SR) and cross section figures of merit were {{used to compare the}} performance of candidate optical designs. Further modeling was conducted to assess the relationships between standoff range and retroreflector diameter and cross section. Analysis showed that small diameter retroreflectors have very high optical link loss, since the net loss scales by retroreflector diameter to the 4 th power. Optical retroreflection efficiency is also important, but extracting ideal performance from a complicated design must be tempered {{by the fact that the}} effective retroreflector range varies only as the fourth root of the cross section. It's therefore imperative to maintain a reasonable retroreflector diameter, but striving for perfect optical performance may be a costly effort that does not merit the modest performance gain. Several promising designs were developed for visible and mid-infrared applications, which embraced lessons learned in the standoff range study. These designs included a polymer clad glass core approach for visible wavelengths and a concentric shell design using chalcogenide glass for the mid-infrared. Injection molding feasibility studies demonstrated that it was practical to fabricate visible polymer retroreflectors using this approach. Such an approach may be a practical solution for the LLNL project. Our primary focus is to develop mid-infrared designs; therefore compression molding chalcogenide glass was adopted for fabricating mid-infrared retroreflectors. A significant effort was focused on developing practical compression molding methods that provided reasonable device yield. A custom <b>compression</b> <b>molding</b> <b>press</b> was developed in collaboration with a private engineering firm. Many successful molding studies were conducted during this effort, but ultimately the fragile nature of the chalcogenide glass and the unfavorable thermal expansion properties limited the feasibility of fabricating the thin shell structures needed for this design. An alternative Cat's Eye retroreflector design was therefore adopted. This design is constructed using two hemispherical structures that can be fabricated by conventional grinding and polishing methods or by molding with high yield. The cross section of this design is very good (and can be further improved by applying a highly reflective coating to the rear surface), but has reduced field of view as a design trade off as well as the isotropic nature of Luneburg-style retroreflector...|$|E

A combination of Fourier Transform Infrared Radiation (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis were done to characterize the resultant organoclay.

EVA filled with organozeolite showed better tensile properties compared to EVA filled with unmodified zeolite, which might be an indication of enhanced dispersion of organophilic clay in the composites.

40|$|The {{performance}} of fibre-reinforced composites is, {{to a large}} extent, controlled by the properties of fibre-matrix interfaces. The interface chemistry and character is vital to a composite material. Good interfacial properties are essential to ensure efficient load transfer from matrix to reinforcement, which helps to reduce stress concentrations and improves overall sustainability of mechanical properties. The strength of composite materials depends {{not only on the}} substrate but also on the interface strength. The interface here does not have unique fracture energy unlike homogeneous materials. Consequently, there is a great interest in developing new concepts for tailoring the strength of fibre-matrix interface. Some of researchers have been reported the mechanisms responsible for improved fibre-matrix interface adhesion is removing weak boundary layer, and thereby improving wettability. However, a high performance composite functions because a weaker interface or matrix stops a crack running continuously between the strong brittle reinforcements. Fibre reinforced composite materials do, however, suffer some serious environmental limitations. Environmental exposures include temperature, moisture, radiations, UV and other different alkali treatments, which cause deterioration in the mechanical and/or physical behaviour, adhesion between fibre/matrix interface regions of the composite material over a period of time. The aim of the current investigation is to present the variation of mechanical properties of glass fiber/epoxy composite under the synergistic effect of temperature and rate of loading. In case of temperature we performed 2 types of cases as above and below glass transition temperature (Tg) and in second case abobe and below-ambient temperature. Glass fibre reinforced polymer composites (GFRP), carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites (CFRP) and Kevlar fibre reinforced polymer composites were fabricated by hand-lay up method followed by <b>compression</b> <b>molding</b> <b>press.</b> The composite specimens were subjected to elevated and high temperatures as + 60 °C,+ 100 °C,+ 150 °C and + 200 °C temperatures. 3 -Point short beam shear test and 4 -point short beam shear test were conducted in order to characterize the mechanical behavior of laminated composite and to determine the influence of loading rate on interlaminar shear strength. To understand the interactions between various failure mechanisms in the fiber, matrix and fiber/matrix interface, microscopic analyses were conducted. In second case we performed in-depth analysis of interlaminar shear test and failure mechanisms of glass fibre/epoxy, carbon fibre/epoxy and Kevlar fibre/epoxy composites under + 50 °C,- 50 °C,+ 100 °C and- 100 °C temperatures and different crosshead velocity. Different high and low temperature conditioning were performed using Instron with environmental chamber providing additional information regarding in-situ failure of laminated composites. Following the test, the fracture surfaces of the samples were scanned under SEM to understand the dominating failure modes. Microstructural assessments can also reveal the response of each constituent viz. fibre, matrix resin and the interface/interphase; under temperature and mechanical loading. This section comprehensively presents the mechanical behaviour and structural changes in fibrous polymeric composite systems during the mechanical loading under high and low temperature service environment. We specifically tailored this potential to describe the contradiction and confusion at polymer composite interface which may not be underestimated by material scientists. Fibre/matrix adhesion involves very complex physical and chemical mechanisms. One of the most important physical aspects is the geometry of reinforcing fibres, which influences adhesion between fibre and matrix, stress transfer and local mechanisms of failure. In addition to chemical bonding, the fibre/matrix bond strength in shear is largely dependent on the roughness of the fibre surface and the fibre/matrix contact area. At cryogenic temperatures, due to difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the fibre and the matrix phase, microcracks initiate and propagate through the laminated composites. Therefore, knowledge of the resistance to different failure modes of woven fabric composites laminates at cryogenic temperatures is essential to the materials scientist and design analyst. The aim of this investigation was to study deformation and mechanical behaviour of glass fibre/epoxy composites subjected to 3 -point short beam shear test at low and ultra-low temperature with different loading speeds. The laminates were tested at ambient (+ 27 °C) temperature and at (- 20 °C,- 40 °C,- 60 °C) temperatures using liquid nitrogen in an environmental chamber installed on an Instron testing machine. Testing was carried out in different loading covering low to high medium speeds. Following the test the fracture surfaces were scanned under SEM microscope. A need probably exists for an assessment of mechanical {{performance of}} such potentially promising materials under the influence of changing environment and loading speed. Using fractography study to characterize the onset and growth of failure modes has become generally accepted method. During thermal cycling differential coefficient of thermal expansions and residual stresses is a prime cause in fibre reinforced polymer composites (FRP) material. The behavior of the interfacial contact between fibre and matrix is strongly influenced by the presence and nature of residual stresses. GFRP and CFRP composite laminates are used to analyze the thermal cycle effect on the mechanical behavior with different loading rates. 3 -point short beam shear test was performed for the analyze the mechanical behavior. To study the failure modes which have great impact on mechanical behavior, Scanning electorn microscope (SEM) was used. The ensuing research revealed a number of key challenges regarding interface issues in producing polymer nanocomposites that exhibit a desired behavior. The greatest stumbling block to the large-scale production and commercialization of nanocomposites is the dearth of cost effective methods for controlling the dispersion of the nanoparticles in polymeric matrix. Current interest in alumina/epoxy nanocomposites, Cu nano particle and Multi walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) has been generated and maintained because nanoparticles filled polymers exhibit unique combinations of properties not achievable with conventional composites. In the present study, glass fiber reinforced composites filled with nanoparticle have been prepared. 3 -point short beam shear test was conducted to analyze the Interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) variation with different loading rate. Alumina nanoparticle was well dispersed in epoxy polymer matrix to achieved high mechanical performance. The results show {{that it is possible to}} improve the interlaminar shear strength with the loading rate variations. Clearly, no follow-up work in this area will be commendation for better understanding of effect of nanoparticle in FRP composites in assessment of loading rate sensitivity. Under these conditions, fibre reinforced polymer nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit two glass-transition temperatures, Tg: one associated with polymer chains far from the nanoparticles, and a second, larger Tg, associated with chains in the vicinity of the particles. To analyze different failure modes SEM analyses was conducted. Good interfacial properties are essential to ensure efficient load transfer from matrix to fillers, which helps to reduce stress concentrations and improves overall mechanical properties. Consequently, there is great interest in developing new concepts for improving the strength of fibre−matrix interface. ...|$|E

Fewer knit lines are produced and a smaller amount of fiber-length degradation is noticeable when compared to injection molding. Compression-molding is also suitable for ultra-large basic shape production in sizes beyond the capacity of extrusion techniques. Materials that are typically manufactured through <b>compression</b> <b>molding</b> include: Polyester fiberglass resin systems (SMC/BMC), Torlon, Vespel, Poly(p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS), and many grades of PEEK.|$|R
