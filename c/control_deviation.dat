The results of small group research by Schachter, and Sampson and Brandon are re-interpreted within a conceptual framework derived from the societal-reaction literature. These two stud-ies suggest that inclusive reactions to deviance attempt to <b>control</b> <b>deviation</b> through intense interactional pressure, accompanied by relatively low attitudinal hostility toward the deviant. Exclusive reactions to deviance reject the deviant as an outsider and are characterized by low levels of interaction, but high levels of covert hostility. Inclusive reactions tend to occur when deviance is attributed to a particular situation, whereas deviance attributed to the character of the deviant tends to result in exclusive re-actions. While labeling theorists have contributed a number of insights as to the social processes in-volved in deviance, they have not been much concerned with developing a clear and rigorous formulation of their theoretical position (Gibbs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{positioning}} system (DPS) maintains an offshore vessel's position and heading under various environmental conditions by using its own thrust. DPS {{is regarded as}} one of the most important systems in offshore vessels. So, efficient operation and maintenance of the DPS are important issues. To monitor the DPS, it is necessary to define an appropriate key performance indicator (KPI) that can express the condition of the DPS from the perspective of operational efficiency and maintenance. In this study, a new KPI for the DPS is proposed considering the efficiency of the machinery and controller, the energy efficiency, and the environmental conditions in which the DPS is operated. The KPI is defined as a function of <b>control</b> <b>deviation,</b> energy consumption, and environmental load. A normalization factor is used to normalize the effect of environmental load on the KPI. The KPI value is calculated from DPS simulation and model test data. The possibility of applying the KPI to monitoring of DPS condition is discussed by comparing the values. The result indicates the feasibility of the new KPI...|$|E

T-MPSP guidance uses state constraint and <b>control</b> <b>deviation</b> across the landing trajectory and optimizes the control requirement {{in the outer}} loop whereas the dynamic inversion technique is implemented in the inner loop control computation. The landing phase is divided into approach, glideslope and flare. Approach is considered as a circular trajectory {{as well as a}} straight line level flying phase. Glideslope and flare are ramp with a constant flight path angle and exponential trajectories respectively. T-MPSP technique uses a suitable control guess history computed from a standard reference for its first iteration and then provides correction in the guess history in the successive iterations and updates the control law until tracking reaches closer to the desired output. The control command with T-MPSP algorithm is computed at grid points across the trajectory. A sliding window approach is implemented in T-MPSP to compute the control wherein once the control is computed at a grid point the window slides forward.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} of electrohydraulic drives is relatively low dynamic load stiffness due to compressibility of oil. Sudden load variations can cause significant deviations {{of the position of}} the drive and, consequently, a reduced precision of the controlled process. This has led to a partial substitution of electrohydraulic drives by electromechanical drives in a low power range recently. One of the approaches to increase dynamic stiffness of a cylinder is to raise valve dynamics. Thus, the system can react to a <b>control</b> <b>deviation</b> and provide the cylinder with a compensating flow faster. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show the development of a stiff cylinder drive using a new high-response servovalve-the hybrid valve. In contrast to a conventional servovalve with an unmovable sleeve, the idea of the hybrid valve is to actuate both the spool and the sleeve simultaneously in opposite directions. Using a piezo-actuator as sleeve drive provides the hybrid valve with very high dynamics in the range of small valve opening, which should be sufficient to increase the disturbance rejection of the cylinder. The performance of the valve prototype and of the cylinder will be shown, and application fields will be discussed in this work...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Twenty-seven volunteers {{completed}} three simulated driving {{tests to}} determine test-retest reliability of performance on a low-cost, fixed-base computerized driving simulator. One retest was completed {{a few hours after}} the initial drive, and the final retest was completed 7 days following the initial test drive. Driving performance was compared using measures of vehicle control, speed, and reaction time to critical events. A measure of participants ’ ability to inhibit a pre-potent response was also assessed using an inhibition task during each drive, with the number of incorrect inhibition responses recorded. Practice effects were evident for measures of vehicle <b>control</b> (<b>deviation</b> of lane position and number of line crossings) and participants ’ ability to withhold responses to inhibition tasks. Good test-retest reliability was observed for measures of vehicle control, speed, reaction time, and variability measures. Poor test-retest reliability was observed for the number of stopping failures observed during driving. The findings from this study suggest that the driving scenario used provides reliable assessment tasks {{that could be used to}} track the effects of pharmacological treatments on driving performance.

40|$|Optimizing {{a manual}} {{measurement}} schedule (both frequency and pattern) for estimating annual soil respiration (R-S) {{is an important}} but unresolved issue. We hypothesized that (i) an optimal sampling setup can be found to obtain a reliable annual R-S, and (ii) if the desired outcome is a multi-year mean annual R-S, a lower sampling frequency might be adequate. Here we explored these issues using a three-year chamber-based dataset, with a sampling frequency of twice per week (defined as control), in an exotic slash pine (Pinus elliottii Englem.) plantation in subtropical China. The results showed that R-S during 9 : 00 - 11 : 00 a. m. represented diurnal mean R-S well. In order to obtain an annual R-S as reliable as the <b>control</b> (<b>deviation</b> within +/- 5 %), the optimal measurement strategy is a biweekly sampling across a year and not a trade-off sampling pattern (monthly sampling combined with weekly sampling depending on the seasons). Furthermore, despite an obvious inter-annual variability in R-S (548. 4 - 757. 5 g C m(- 2) year(- 1), CV = 16. 3 %), a monthly sampling was sufficient to obtain an unbiased multi-year mean annual R-S (deviation within +/- 5 %). Such findings are useful when easy looking for estimates of annual ecosystem carbon budgets. However, the generality needs to be examined in other ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the application of a new theory developed for distributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to a promising and exciting future domain for NMPC – that of dynamic management of supply chain networks. Recent work by the first author provides a distributed implementation of NMPC for application in large scale systems comprised of cooperative dynamic subsystems [1, 2]. The generic control objective is for the subsystems to cooperatively meet mutual objectives, e. g., a set of unmanned vehicles are required to realize a predefined formation while avoiding collisions. The nonlinear subsystems can be coupled through performance objectives and state constraints [1], as well as through their dynamics [2]. By the implementation, each subsystem optimizes locally for its own policy, and communicates the most recent policy to those subsystems to which it is coupled. Stabilization is guaranteed for arbitrary interconnection topologies, provided each subsystem not deviate too far from the previous policy (consistent with traditional <b>control</b> <b>deviation</b> penalties), and that the updates happen sufficiently fast. Simulations have demonstrated performance comparable to a centralized implementation [1]. A contribution of this paper will be to demonstrate the relevance and efficacy of the distributed NMPC approach in the venue of supply chain management. A supply chain can be defined as the interconnection (coupling) and evolution (dynamics) of a deman...|$|E

40|$|Risk and {{knowledge}} are two concepts and components of business management which {{have so far}} been studied almost independently. This is especially true where risk management is conceived mainly in financial terms, as, for example, in the banking sector. The banking sector has sophisticated methodologies for managing risk, such as mathematical risk modeling. However. the methodologies for analyzing risk do not explicitly include knowledge management for risk knowledge creation and risk knowledge transfer. Banks are affected by internal and external changes with the consequent accommodation to new business models new regulations and the competition of big players around the world. Thus, banks have different levels of risk appetite and policies in risk management. This paper takes into consideration that business models are changing and that management is looking across the organization to identify the influence of strategic planning, information systems theory, risk management {{and knowledge}} management. These disciplines can handle the risks affecting banking that arise from different areas, {{but only if they}} work together. This creates a need to view them in an integrated way.
