40|$|Japan's {{success in}} {{achieving}} sustainable development during the catch-up years {{up to the}} end of the 1980 s can be attributed to a high institutional elasticity that can be distinctly observed in a virtuous <b>cycle</b> <b>between</b> technological innovation and economic growth. Japan's domestic institutions functioned efficiently during the era of an industrial society driven by manufacturing industry. However, a new paradigm characterized by a shift to an information society emerged in the 1990 s and Japan's traditional institutions did not function as efficiently as they did in preceding decades. Consequently, a virtuous <b>cycle</b> <b>between</b> institutional elasticity and economic development changed to a vicious <b>cycle</b> <b>between</b> non-elastic institutions and economic stagnation that resulted in Japan losing its international competitiveness that reacted to further economic stagnation. Thus, Japan has been facing a dual vicious cycle leading to solid institutional elasticity. This paper analyzes the structural sources, which compelled Japan to lose its institutional elasticity...|$|R

Cyclers could also possibly make excellent cargo ships for resupply of a colony.|$|R
