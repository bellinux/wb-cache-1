50|$|Stealth banning (also called shadow banning, {{ghost banning}} or <b>comment</b> <b>ghosting)</b> is {{the act of}} {{blocking}} a user from an online community such that the user does not realize {{that they have been}} banned. By making a problem user's contributions invisible or less prominent to other members of the service, the hope is that in the absence of reactions to their comments, the problematic user will become bored or frustrated and leave the site. If the user never becomes aware that they were banned, it will not occur to them to attempt to circumvent that ban.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title is}} {{a quote from}} Hamlet (I.v.27-28), where the <b>Ghost</b> <b>comments</b> about his own death, [...] "Murder most foul as in the best it is/But this most foul, strange and unnatural." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 thriller writer Robert Harris quoted Crofts's ghostwriting book at {{the start}} of every chapter of his bestselling The Ghost. The book was {{subsequently}} filmed by Roman Polanski with Ewan McGregor playing the ghostwriter. Crofts, in turn, has <b>commented</b> that The <b>Ghost</b> was [...] "a gift from the gods. Harris did us all a huge favour." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1UP.com's Justin Haywald called Missile [...] "one of {{the most}} {{absolutely}} adorable characters in any game, ever, anywhere", <b>commenting</b> that <b>Ghost</b> Trick changed him from wanting a Welsh Corgi or a Pug to a Pomeranian. Siliconera editor Spencer presented a contrast between Missile and game protagonist Sissel - where Sissel takes the situation of Missile's death seriously, Missile accepts that he is dead by rationalizing that he, as a dog, doesn't {{know a lot of}} things. Adventure Gamers' Dante Kleinberg described him as [...] "cute and cuddly", while also using his death {{as an example of the}} darker elements found in Ghost Trick. Games TM, while finding some fault in the game's structure, noted the interaction between Sissel and Missile as [...] "amusing a concept as it is bizarre".|$|R
5000|$|Dickens did not {{explicitly}} say what Tiny Tim's illness was. However, {{renal tubular acidosis}} (type 1), which {{is a type of}} kidney failure causing the blood to become acidic, has been proposed as one possibility, another being rickets (caused by a lack of Vitamin D). Either illness was treatable during Dickens' lifetime, but fatal if not treated, thus following in line with the <b>comment</b> of the <b>Ghost</b> of Christmas Present that Tiny Tim would die [...] "only if the present remain unchanged".|$|R
5000|$|Ghost Stories {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 31 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard wrote the magazine's track-by-track {{review of the}} album, praising it as the band's [...] "most listenable album in years" [...] and describing it as [...] "an evocative concoction of sullen phrases, sparse arrangements and powerful themes." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly <b>commented</b> that <b>Ghost</b> Stories [...] "will likely {{be remembered as a}} transitional album" [...] and noted that [...] "while being solid, it feels like a prequel to something better". Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork wrote that the album is a [...] "subdued work that finds Chris Martin and his band crisply moping through mid-tempo soundscapes and fuzzy electronic touches that have the visceral impact of a down comforter tumbling down a flight of stairs." [...] Nick Hasted of The Independent wrote that Martin [...] "accepts his loss too meekly to approach the anguish of a great break-up album", but concluded that the band's [...] "step away from grand platitudes is still one in the right direction". Stephanie Benson of Spin wrote that [...] "its deep sea of synth-encrusted pop glistens under a halo of angelic ambient touches and Martinâ€™s ever-rosy perspective." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked by}} a TV Week {{reporter}} what was behind the apparition, Cherian said [...] "Rani is feeling guilty, as {{the last time they}} spoke, she told Priya she hated her. She didn't get the chance to tell her how much she loves her, and she almost feels that her mum didn't love her back. The ghost is a way for Rani to attempt to find some closure on the whole situation." [...] Rani is calm upon seeing the ghost of her mother and even talks to her. Priya later reappears in the kitchen and Gooneratne <b>commented</b> that her <b>ghost</b> is [...] "very unresponsive". Rani opens up to Ajay about her feelings, but does not tell him about Priya's ghost. She later sees Priya again, making it obvious that she still feels guilty about her death. The TV Week reporter explained that Gooneratne returned to the Neighbours set to film the episodes after her [...] "shock exit" [...] from the show.|$|R
