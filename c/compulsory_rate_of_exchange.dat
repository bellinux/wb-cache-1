Its effect is either the weakening of the export ability of the Polish economy or the arousing of inflation leading to the increase <b>of</b> the interest <b>rates.</b> The new <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> policy applied since 1998 did not solve the problems for which it was established overliquidity of the bank sector and the debt of Polish enterprises abroad.

This is explained by the fact, as announces Krugman(2006) that in "an inflationary economy, it is difficult to simply modify the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> real <b>exchange</b> by changing the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nominal <b>exchange,</b> insofar as the rise of the request which results from it quickly causes an interior inflation and thus a rise of the domestic prices". ...|$|R

CD spectroscopic studies showed that all polynucleotides always remain in the B-form under these conditions. An increase in the concentration of Tris and imidazole from 5 mu M to 20 mM caused an increase in the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> both fast-exchanging imino and slow-exchanging amino protons. The limiting <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> at infinite concentrations of catalysts were found to be different for fast (31 - 57 sec- 1) and slow (1 - 2 sec- 1) exchanging protons. These results indicate that imino and amino protons <b>of</b> B-DNA <b>exchange</b> asymmetrically from two different open states as observed for Z-DNA. An increase in the concentration of spermine from a ratio of 1 : 50 to 1 : 2 of positive charge/phosphate decreased the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> imino protons of calf-thymus DNA, poly(dG-dC), and poly(dG-me 5 dC), but increased the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> the imino protons of poly(dA-dT) without affecting the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the amino protons of any of the polynucleotides.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{overexploitation}} and unsustainability {{is a major}} issue in global fisheries. Marine reserves or protected no-take zones have been suggested as a possible solution that would maintain yield and protect stocks indefinitely. A key factor in the effectiveness of a marine reserve-fishery system is the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> biomass between reserve and fishery: if the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is too low then the fishery is not viable, but if the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is too high then stocks may be exploited unsustainably and the reserve is rendered ineffective. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is determined by both the physical design and shape of the reserve, and the movement and dispersal behaviour of both the adult and larval-stage fish. Previous models looking at optimal reserve design usually only consider a diffusive population scale movement and dispersal, even though most animal movement is more realistically modelled as being correlated at the individual level. In this article, a deliberately simple simulation of a theoretical marine reserve-fishery system is used to demonstrate the danger of making predictions using only a population-level simplistic diffusive movement model. Further predictions based on the population average of a more realistic correlated movement model are also shown to be inaccurate. This result is due to both the high levels of individual variability in movement behaviour, and the heterogeneity of the environment. This suggests that in future studies, individual-based (rather than population-level) simulations and models are likely to give more useful insights into the dynamics of the marine fishery environment. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.

The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> by 1 mg of protein is in granules 30 – 50 times as great (according to the kind of preparation) as in the highly purified fibrils and actomyosin solutions. 5.
