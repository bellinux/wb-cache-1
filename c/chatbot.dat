(In practice, from 2009â€“2012, the Loebner Prize chatterbot contestants only managed to fool a judge once, and that was only due to the human contestant pretending to be a <b>chatbot.)</b> He further {{predicted that}} machine learning would be an important part of building powerful machines, a claim considered plausible by contemporary researchers in artificial intelligence.|$|E
40|$|The rise of <b>chatbots</b> poses new {{possibilities}} to link social interactions within instant messengers with third-party systems and business processes. While many companies use <b>chatbots</b> within the enterprise {{in the form}} of Slack apps and integrations, little is known about their affordances. Grounded in a qualitative research endeavour, we conducted 12 explorative interviews in 8 organizational settings to inductively gain rich contextual insights. Our results reveal 14 functional affordances in 4 categories, elucidating how their actualization leads to the perception of higher level affordances and constraints. First, we discuss how <b>chatbots</b> augment social information systems with affordances of traditional enterprise systems, and therefore, enable bottom-up automation. Second, we elaborate on how the actualization of an affordance by one user may facilitate its perception by other users. Thus, we contribute towards {{a better understanding of how}} <b>chatbots</b> create value...|$|R

40|$|Blind {{students}} are an underrepresented group in computer science. In this paper, we describe our experience preparing and leading the computer science track at the National Federation of the Blind Youth Slam. As {{part of this}} workshop, fifteen blind high school students created and personalized instant messaging <b>chatbots,</b> a project designed to be completely accessible to blind students. <b>Chatbots</b> enable students to infuse their own personalities into a sociallyoriented program that incorporates ideas from artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and web services. We first outline the <b>chatbots</b> project and curriculum, which has wide appeal for all students, and then offer general design principles used to create it that can help ensure the accessibility of future projects. Students created their <b>chatbots</b> using a real programming language and were guided by both blind and sighted mentors. By programming from the start in a supportive environment, our students will gain the confidence to persevere in computer science in the future...|$|R
40|$|Conversational {{systems have}} come a long way after decades of {{research}} and development, from Eliza and Parry in the 60 's and 70 's, to task-completion systems as in the ATIS project, to intelligent personal assistants such as Siri, and to today's social <b>chatbots</b> like XiaoIce. Social chatbots' appeal lies in not only their ability to respond to users' diverse requests, but also in being able to establish an emotional connection with users. The latter is done by satisfying the users' essential needs for communication, affection, and social belonging. The design of social <b>chatbots</b> must focus on user engagement and take both intellectual quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) into account. Users should want to engage with the social chatbot; as such, we define the success metric for social <b>chatbots</b> as conversation-turns per session (CPS). Using XiaoIce as an illustrative example, we discuss key technologies in building social <b>chatbots</b> from core chat to visual sense to skills. We also show how XiaoIce can dynamically recognize emotion and engage the user throughout long conversations with appropriate interpersonal responses. As we become the first generation of humans ever living with AI, social <b>chatbots</b> that are well-designed to be both useful and empathic will soon be ubiquitous...|$|R

40|$|Internet of Things (IoT) is {{emerging}} as a significant technology in shaping the future by connecting physical devices or things with internet. It also presents various opportunities for intersection of other technological trends which can allow it to become even more intelligent and efficient. In this paper we focus our attention on the integration of Intelligent Conversational Software Agents or <b>Chatbots</b> with IoT. Literature surveys have looked into various applications, features, underlying technologies and known challenges of IoT. On the other hand, <b>Chatbots</b> are being adopted in greater numbers due to major strides in development of platforms and frameworks. The novelty of this paper lies in the specific integration of <b>Chatbots</b> in the IoT scenario. We analyzed the shortcomings of existing IoT systems and put forward ways to tackle them by incorporating <b>chatbots.</b> A general architecture is proposed for implementing such a system, as well as platforms and frameworks, both commercial and open source, which allow for implementation of such systems. Identification of the newer challenges and possible future directions with this new integration, have also been addressed. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, 5 Use Case...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chatbots,</b> {{known as}} {{pedagogical}} agents in educational settings, {{have a long}} history of use, beginning with Alan Turingâ€™s work. Since then online <b>chatbots</b> have become embedded into the fabric of technology. Yet understandings of these technologies are inchoate and often untheorised. Integration of <b>chatbots</b> into educational settings over the past five years suggests an increase in interest in the ways in which <b>chatbots</b> might be adopted and adapted for teaching and learning. This article draws on historical literature and theories that to date have largely been ignored in order to (re) contextualise two studies that used responsive evaluation to examine the use of pedagogical agents in education. Findings suggest that emotional interactions with pedagogical agents are intrinsic to a userâ€™s sense of trust, and that truthfulness, personalisation and emotional engagement are vital when using pedagogical agents to enhance online learning. Such findings need to be considered in the light of ways in which notions of learning are being redefined in the academy and the extent to which new literacies and new technologies are being pedalled as pedagogies in ways that undermine what higher education is, is for, and what learning means...|$|R

50|$|Other {{companies}} explore ways {{how they}} can use chatbots internally, for example for Customer Support, Human Resources, or even in Internet-of-Things (IoT) projects. Overstock, for one, has reportedly launched a <b>chatbot</b> named Mila to automate certain simple yet time-consuming processes when requesting for a sick leave. SAP partnered with Kore Inc, a US-based <b>chatbot</b> platform vendor, to build enterprise-oriented chatterbots for certain SAP products like SAP Hana Cloud Platform, SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C), SAP SuccessFactors and Concur. Other large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Renault and CitroÃ«n are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact. A SaaS <b>chatbot</b> business ecosystem has been steadily growing since the F8 Conference when Zuckerberg unveiled that Messenger would allow chatbots into the app.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{element of}} {{scripting}} is the rule. A rule {{consists of a}} type, a label (optional), a pattern, and an output. There are three types of rules. Gambits are something a <b>chatbot</b> might say when it has control of the conversation. Rejoinders are rules that respond to a user remark tied to what the <b>chatbot</b> just said. Responders are rules that respond to arbitrary user input which is not necessarily tied to what the <b>chatbot</b> just said. Patterns describe conditions under which a rule may fire. Patterns range from extremely simplistic to deeply complex (analogous to Regex but aimed for NL). Heavy use is typically made of concept sets, which are lists of words sharing a meaning. ChatScript contains some 2000 predefined concepts and scripters can easily write their own. Output of a rule intermixes literal words {{to be sent to}} the user along with common C-style programming code.|$|E

40|$|Many social robots in {{the forms}} of {{conversation}} agents or <b>Chatbots</b> have been put to practical use in recent years. Their typical roles are online help or acting as a cyber agent representing an organisation. However, there exists {{a new form of}} devious <b>chatbots</b> lurking in the Internet. It is effectively an interactive malware seeking to lure its prey not through vicious assault, but with seductive conversation. It talks to its prey through the same channel that is normally used for human-to-human communication. These devious <b>chatbots</b> are using social engineering to attack the uninformed and unprepared victims. This type of attacks is becoming more pervasive with the advent of Web 2. 0. This survey paper presents results from a research on how this breed of devious Malware is spreading, and what could be done to stop it...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of <b>chatbots,</b> the most common techniques used for simulating conversation has been different pattern matching-techniques.

As the research of natural language processing is rapidly progressing, {{the aim of this}} report is to clarify current techniques and what could possibly be achieved by adapting recent findings on the area. A combination of part-of-speech tagging, methods for information retrieval and known methods for generating language are covered and described of how it could be of use. An implementation is reviewed and compared to traditional programs. The final conclusion states that the implementation is not as satisfying as <b>chatbots</b> using elaborated pattern matching-techniques. However, it is concluded that the new methods covered {{are more likely to be}} part of future <b>chatbots</b> considering the progress of natural language processing...|$|R
