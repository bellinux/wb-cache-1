40|$|Abstract. Oil {{pipelines}} usually {{pass through}} suburbs areas and urban areas. When the pipeline occupy some private properties, the compensation to private properties owners is necessary. In fact, the <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> arrangement is very complicated when the unit cost in suburbs and urban areas is different. Hence the <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> arrangement scheme with compensation conditions is proposed {{to study the}} complicated problem. The model shows that compensation cost can affect the pipeline arrangement very sensitively. The model can obtain the optimal scheme to construct <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> when given different compensation cost...|$|R

Because the pipe was put under the ground deeply, the higher {{strength}} and sealing are request. Therefore, the accuracy and strength of the connecting thread are required. Moreover, because of the oil wells need to be repaired frequently when they work, the shackle times are the important factor of the production life of the <b>oil</b> <b>pipe.</b> The development of the <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> is always blocked by the phenomenon of oil's gluing. As the remarkable feature of the Laser heat treatment process technology and the increasing of productions of the domestic laser devices, the laser heat treatment process technology {{was applied to the}} surface of the oil threaded to improve the integrated mechanical properties of <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> products and to extend its work life...|$|R

40|$|Metal {{materials}} can inevitably show deteriorated properties by the factors of stress, temperature, and environmental erosion in distinct operating environments. Without proper protection, the service {{life would be}} shortened or even deadly danger would be caused. This study aims to apply Finite Element Method and Boundary Element Method to analyzing the effects of corroded petrochemical pipes on the fatigue life and the fracture form. The research results of nondestructive testing and software analyses show that cracked <b>oil</b> <b>pipes</b> with uniform corrosion bear larger stress, mainly internal pressure, on the longitudinal direction than the circumferential direction. As a result, the maximal fatigue loading cycle of a circumferential crack is {{higher than that of}} a longitudinal one. From the growing length and depth of a crack, the final aspect ratio of crack growth appears in 2. 42 – 3. 37 and 2. 71 – 3. 42 on the circumferential and longitudinal direction, respectively. Meanwhile, the ratios of loading cycles of circumferential and longitudinal crack are 26. 23 on uncorroded and 20. 54 on general metal loss <b>oil</b> <b>pipe.</b> The complete crack growth and the correspondent fatigue loading cycle could be acquired to determine the service life of the <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> being operated as well as the successive recovery time...|$|R
