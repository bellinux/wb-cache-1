50|$|The Australian Repco V8 F1 engine being {{based on}} Buick 215 block is {{technically}} a common misconception, as the Rover/Buick V8 had only 5 <b>cylinderhead</b> studs around each cylinder unit and that cannot accommodate the 6 stud Repco RB620 heads. The Repco V8 {{was based on}} Oldsmobile 215 block of the same era, which was very similar in appearance, size and material, but used 6 <b>cylinderhead</b> studs per cylinder. The subtle difference in block design/head clamping originated in Oldsmobile's intention to produce the higher power, turbo-charged Jetfire version of the small/light V8, however, the public/press tended not {{to be aware of}} the internal difference.|$|E
50|$|Due the {{comparative}} simplicity of <b>cylinderhead</b> design (lacking intake valves) {{it is somewhat}} easier to implement in two-stroke engines. From the late 90s on up models which expand on this idea have been available, such as from Yamaha, which dynamically vary {{the size of the}} combustion chamber. As of late (in the 2000s) this technology has seen some renewed interest, due it being able to burn a wide range of fuels (e.g. including alcohols) such as the Lotus Omnivore.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies {{condition}} monitoring technique {{of a small}} four strokes, single cylinder petrol engine using vibrationsignal analysis based on time domain, crank angle domain, and signal energy. Vibration signals are acquired from the <b>cylinderhead</b> of the engine and used to describe engine processes such as intake/exhaust valve operations, ignition process, andcombustion process. In this study, vibration signals have been applied to monitor various fault conditions in the engine suchas intake and exhaust valve clearance faults. Vibration signals acquired in time domain could be mapped onto crank angledomain using top dead center signal. Time domain techniques were used to analyze vibration signals so that the main eventsrelated to the engine operations could be described easily. Using energy analysis technique, all fault conditions could bealso identified. For future work, signal analysis techniques must be developed and the detected signals should be comparedwith other signals such as pressure signal in order to verify {{the accuracy of the}} results...|$|E
50|$|Aston Martin {{retained}} Callaway {{to help it}} re-engineer its then 30-year-old Tadek Marek 2v V-8. Callaway's brief was for 4v <b>cylinderheads,</b> increased power, {{and single}} configuration worldwide emissions compliance.|$|R
50|$|As {{launched}} in 1970 the Triumph V8 had several innovative features. As {{well as its}} unusual construction (the crankcase and cylinder block were made from chromium iron whilst the cylinder heads were aluminium alloy), the engine featured a unique arrangement of studs and bolts attaching the <b>cylinderheads</b> that allowed the <b>cylinderheads</b> to be removed (in design, not in reality) without firstly removing the overhead camshafts and disturbing the valveplay adjustment. The water pump, oil pump and distributor were all driven at their required speeds from a single jackshaft driven from the timing chain via sets of skew-cut gears. The cooling fan was a 16-blade plastic item driven through a hydraulic viscous coupling that limited fan speed to 2,500 rpm to reduce noise as well as controlling the fan speed in relation to engine temperature.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, stricter {{regulations}} on emissions and higher demands for more fuel efficient vehicles {{have led to}} a greater focus on increasing the efficiency of the internal combustion engine. Nowadays, there is increasing interest in the recovery of waste heat from different engine sources such as the coolant and exhaust gases using, for example, a Rankine cycle. In diesel engines 15 % to 30 % of the energy from the fuel can be lost to the coolant and hence, does not contribute to producing work on the piston. This paper looks at reducing the heat losses to the coolant by increasing coolant temperatures within a single cylinder Scania D 13 engine and studying the effects of this on the energy balance within the engine as well as the combustion characteristics. To do this, a GT Power model was first validated against experimental data from the engine. Using a Water-PEG mixture as coolant, the coolant temperature was then varied from 60 °C to 200 °C for both the liner and the <b>cylinderhead.</b> This sweep was done for multiple combinations of engine loads and speeds as well as for different air-fuel ratios. It was found that at the higher air-fuel ratios, an increase in coolant temperature led to an increase in indicated efficiency as well as an increase in exhaust gas temperature and enthalpy. However at lower air-fuel ratios there is a decrease in indicated efficiency with higher coolant temperatures. It was also seen that ignition delay at higher temperatures was shorter with the combustion duration being longer. The change in combustion phasing was found to be dependent on engine load. While the higher coolant temperature simplifies heat recovery from the coolant itself, the consequently higher exhaust gas temperatures observed means that the heat losses are moved more towards the exhaust where energy recovery is easier...|$|E
