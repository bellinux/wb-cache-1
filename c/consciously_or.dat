5|$|Lambert's {{essay about}} metaphysics, Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"), is another autobiographical reference. Balzac wrote the essay {{himself as a}} boy, and – as in the novel – it was confiscated by an angry teacher. Lambert's genius and {{philosophical}} erudition are reflections of Balzac's self-conception. Similarly, some critics and biographers have suggested that Lambert's madness reflects (<b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> not) Balzac's own unsteady mental state. His plans to run for parliament and other non-literary ambitions led observers {{at the time to}} suspect his sanity.|$|E
5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

25|$|Burmese orthography {{continued}} {{to follow the}} antique square format developed for aristocratic stone inscriptions, rather than the cursive format that took hold from the 17th century, when popular writings led to wider use of palm leaves and folded papers known as parabaiks. The Burmese language and script {{continued to}} affect other languages and scripts in the Irrawaddy valley. Since the 15th century, Mon inscriptions had adopted Burmese orthographic conventions and to incorporate, <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> not, large numbers of Burmese loan words. Various Tai-Shan scripts were developed based on the Burmese script.|$|E
25|$|The Bene Gesserit are {{notable for}} their {{extensive}} skill in seduction, sex and sexual imprinting. The most talented and most highly trained {{are known as}} Imprinters. Men {{in a position of}} power or future power, or those with specific qualities that the order wishes to incorporate into their breeding program, are typical targets of a Bene Gesserit imprinter. Men seduced by an imprinter are permanently affected (imprinted) by the intense sexual experience and are thereafter <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> subconsciously favorable to the Sisterhood. An imprinter can be successfully resisted if the subject has been psychologically pre-conditioned to do so, and the subject's automatic defensive response may even be entirely subconscious.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} way to list candidates on a ballot paper is alphabetically, {{though they may}} also be grouped by party. However, any fixed ordering will give some candidates an unfair advantage, because some voters, <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> otherwise, are influenced in their ordering of candidates by the order found on the ballot paper. For example, studies conducted in the Republic of Ireland, where candidates are listed alphabetically, have shown that candidates whose surnames begin with an early letter in the alphabet enjoy a small electoral advantage over candidates with later letters. To solve this problem some systems involve a random ordering of candidates, or an ordering that changes from one ballot paper to another (the latter is often called the Robson rotation, after Neil Robson, a Tasmanian MHA who championed such a system).|$|E
50|$|Latent {{homosexuality}} is an erotic inclination toward {{members of the}} same sex that is not <b>consciously</b> experienced <b>or</b> expressed in overt action.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the dérive has its origins in the Letterist International, an avant-garde and Marxist {{collective}} based in Paris.

500|$|In 1957 he {{returned}} to his earlier theme on the failings of officer training, in a three-part exposition on the Dardanelles Campaign for The Naval Review, the journal he had helped found over forty years previously. [...] In the concluding article, published in October, 1957, Dewar wrote that the failure of the Navy to adequately support the Army at Gallipoli [...] "is {{to be found in the}} system of training officers which <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> unconsciously suppressed independent thought and suggestions from subordinates." [...] Despite his later close association with Churchill, he criticised the former First Lord's unrealistic expectations and also Lord Fisher's inability to rein him in for want of a naval staff; and Admiral of the Fleet (at the time Commodore) Roger Keyes for actively trying to gain support for forcing the straits again instead of acting as chief of staff and only advising the Naval Commander at the Dardanelles.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, the {{claimant}} (Paul Jones) {{was involved in}} a road traffic accident and later brought a claim for damages for physical and psychiatric injury. [...] His solicitors instructed the defendant, Dr Sue Kaney (a consultant clinical psychologist), in 2003 to advise and report on the claim. [...] She expressed her initial view was that he was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [...] However, the view taken by the psychiatrist instructed by the insurers defending the claim was that Jones was exaggerating the effects of his physical injuries, either <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> unconsciously. [...] The two experts held a discussion in November 2005 to see what if any agreement they could reach. [...] The joint statement signed by both experts after the discussion showed that Kaney had conceded ground on a number of issues, weakening the claim considerably. [...] She agreed that {{the claimant}}'s psychological reaction was only an adjustment reaction, not PTSD, and she further stated that Jones had been [...] "very deceptive and deceitful in his reporting", suggesting that he might be consciously giving incorrect information to the experts.|$|E
500|$|The opera was {{described}} by its creators as a commedia lirica. McDonald commented in 2009 that Falstaff is very different – a stylistic departure – from Verdi's earlier work. In McDonald's view most of the musical expression is in the dialogue, and {{there is only one}} traditional aria. The result is that [...] "such stylistic economy – more sophisticated, more challenging than he had employed before – is the keynote of the work." [...] McDonald argues that <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> unconsciously, Verdi was developing the idiom that would come to dominate the music of the 20th century: [...] "the lyricism is abbreviated, glanced at rather than indulged. Melodies bloom suddenly and then vanish, replaced by contrasting tempo or an unexpected phrase that introduces another character or idea". In McDonald's view the orchestral writing acts as a sophisticated commentator on the action. It has influenced at least one of Verdi's operatic successors: in 1952 Imogen Holst, musical assistant to Benjamin Britten, wrote, after a performance of Falstaff, [...] "I realised for the first time how much Ben owes to [...] There are orchestral bits which are just as funny to listen to as the comic instrumental bits in A. Herring!" ...|$|E

5000|$|In psychology, mentalization is {{the ability}} to {{understand}} the mental state, of oneself or others, that underlies overt behaviour.Mentalization {{can be seen as a}} form of imaginative mental activity that lets us perceive and interpret human behaviour in terms of intentional mental states (e.g., needs, desires, feelings, beliefs, goals, purposes, and reasons). It is sometimes described as [...] "understanding misunderstanding." [...] Another term that David Wallin has used for mentalization is [...] "Thinking about thinking". Mentalization can occur either automatically <b>or</b> <b>consciously.</b> Mentalization ability, <b>or</b> mentalizing, is weakened by intense emotion.|$|R

500|$|The Smiths left Borley on 14 July 1929 and {{the parish}} had some {{difficulty}} {{in finding a}} replacement. The following year the Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster (1878–1945), a first cousin of the Bulls, and his wife Marianne (née Marianne Emily Rebecca Shaw) (1899–1992) moved into the rectory with their adopted daughter Adelaide, on 16 October 1930. Lionel Foyster wrote an account of various strange incidents that occurred between the time the Foysters moved in and October 1935, which was sent to Harry Price. These included bell-ringing, windows shattering, throwing of stones and bottles, wall-writing and the locking of their daughter {{in a room with}} no key. Marianne Foyster reported to her husband a whole range of poltergeist phenomena that included her being thrown from her bed. On one occasion, Adelaide was attacked by [...] "something horrible". Foyster tried twice to conduct an exorcism, but his efforts were fruitless; {{in the middle of the}} first exorcism, he was struck in the shoulder by a fist-size stone. Because of the publicity in the Daily Mirror, these incidents attracted the attention of several psychic researchers, who after investigation were unanimous in suspecting that they were caused, <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> unconsciously, by Marianne Foyster. She later said that she felt that some of the incidents were caused by her husband in concert with one of the psychic researchers, but other events appeared to her to be genuine paranormal phenomena. She later admitted that she was having a sexual relationship with the lodger, Frank Pearless, and that she used paranormal explanations to cover up her liaisons. The Foysters left Borley in October 1935 as a result of Lionel Foyster's ill health.|$|E
