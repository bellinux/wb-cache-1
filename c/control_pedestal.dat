50|$|Analysis of {{the digital}} flight data {{recorder}} revealed that the rudder trim {{had moved to the}} far left limit, while the plane was parked at the gate. Since power to the DFDR was off, while parked at the gate, the NTSB could not determine what caused that rudder trim to move to that extreme limit. It was speculated that someone was sitting in the jumpseat (which is located directly behind the <b>control</b> <b>pedestal)</b> had rested their feet on it and inadvertently toggled the trim knob. This knob used to have a raised flat and straight portion protruding from it. Subsequent to this event, all 737's were retrofitted with a rounded rudder trim knob - and a higher ridge around the aft section of the pedestal in an effort to prevent a similar occurrence. That mistrim of the rudder should have been discovered when the Before Takeoff checklist was read, but the pilots failed to ensure the rudder was in the zero trim (neutral) position at that time. The captain also failed to detect that the rudder pedals were unequally displaced by 4¼ inches and the nose wheel steering was turned to 4 degrees left, during the taxi out from the gate to the takeoff position on the runway.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} the output beam collimation of GaAs-based vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers {{by means of}} self-aligned polymer microlenses deposited on SU- 8 pedestals using a cantilever-based spotter. We show that this fabrication technique ensures a reproducible lens shape because the contact angle and the deposited volume are constant for a given surface. Device properties are presented and compared to optical beam propagation modeling results. We demonstrate that the final beam divergence is only <b>controlled</b> by <b>pedestal</b> design parameters and can be reduced with this method by a factor 10 (to 1. 2 ° for single-mode devices) with no significant lasing performance modification...|$|R
40|$|Summary form only given, as follows. A General Purpose Microprocessor Controller GPMC {{has been}} {{developed}} for applications where CAMAC modules with complex control functions are needed. Each application requires an appropriate Interface Module (IM) {{to be connected to}} the GPMC. The GPMC consists of a 6800 Microprocessor, 16 K EPROM, 2 K RAM, CAMAC I/O ports and interface, a RS 232 C serial interface, an Advanced Data Link controller and a port for controlling the IM, GPMC and IM are housed in a 2 -U wide CAMAC module. A special IM has been designed, which has 1 K bute of RAM with its own control and which allows autonomous setting and reading analog voltages through a DAC and ADC. The GPMC can take control of the IM memory and set new voltages. This system is used to <b>control</b> <b>pedestals</b> and gains of a driftchamber readout system, which is housed in a 5 -U wide CAMAC module, holding 24 data cards corresponding to 24 sense wires. The data card receives pulses from the left and right end of a sense wire, amplifies and integrates the pulses over a fixed time. The two pulses are digitized by a Siemens SDA 6020 Flash Encoder, using the reference inputs, hence giving the position along the wire. Optionally, the sum of the two pulses can be digitized by a second SDA 6020, yielding a DE/DX measurement. The GPMC/IM system interacts with the readout via an analog multiplexer in each data card, which permits the reading of the reference inputs and the changing of the DC levels of these inputs, thus guaranteeing a high stability of <b>pedestals</b> and <b>control</b> of the gains during the operation of this system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present initial {{simulations}} of <b>pedestal</b> <b>control</b> by Lithium Granule Injection (LGI) in NSTX. A model for small granule ablation has been {{implemented in the}} M 3 D-C 1 code [1], allowing the simulation of realistic Lithium granule injections. 2 D simulations in NSTX L-mode and H-mode plasmas are done {{and the effect of}} granule size, injection angle and velocity on the pedestal gradient increase are studied. For H-mode cases, the amplitude of the local pressure perturbation caused by the granules is highly dependent on the solid granule size. In our simulations, reducing the granule injection velocity allows one to inject more particles at the pedestal top...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSome {{studies have}} {{reported}} deficits in amblyopia for global form and motion integration, whereas other studies have shown global integration of form and motion information to be normal in amblyopia. Here, we attempt to resolve this discrepancy by showing that amblyopes only exhibit selective performance deficits on global tasks that contain noise as well as signal. We hypothesized that signal integration is normal, but noise segregation is not. We used comparable global orientation and motion direction discrimination tasks to measure integration performance {{in the presence of}} <b>controlled</b> amounts of <b>pedestal</b> noise (i. e., elements whose orientations or directions were randomly selected). We modelled the performance using an equivalent noise model, which has the parameters of internal noise and number of samples. Our results show that amblyopic eyes can integrate form (i. e., orientation) and motion information (i. e., motion direction) similarly to normals when all the information is signal (i. e., no pedestal noise). However, introducing pedestal noise perturbs the performance of the amblyopic eyes significantly more than that of the normal eyes...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 04 - 07, 1991 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThe primary {{objective}} of the Advanced Telemetry Tracking System Integration and Development program at WSMR was the development and evaluation of an advanced, almost totally digital servo tracking and control system. This was satisfied by replacing the aging analog servo tracking and control system in one of WSMR’s seven Transportable Telemetry Acquisition Systems (TTAS) with a Digital Control Unit (DCU), an Antenna Control Unit (ACU), and other related equipment, and then evaluating {{the performance of the}} resultant digital tracking system, referred to as the Advanced TTAS (TTAS-A). The ACU is the primary interface between the operator and the DCU. Through the ACU, the TTAS-A operator has independent <b>control</b> over each <b>pedestal</b> axis (elevation and azimuth) involving the selection of tracking mode and servo bandwidth. The DCU reports various servo system status and warning conditions back to the operator through the ACU. In this paper, a discussion of the TTAS-A servo system, with emphasis upon hardware external to the DCU, is presented. This includes the operation of servo position and rate loops, system status and warning conditions, and a description of the operator-to-system interface via the ACU display and control functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{have made}} two {{significant}} discoveries in our {{recent studies of}} quiescent H-mode (QH-mode) plasmas in DIII-D. First, {{we have found that}} we can <b>control</b> the edge <b>pedestal</b> density and pressure by altering the edge particle transport through changes in the edge toroidal rotation. This allows us to adjust the edge operating point to be close to, but below the ELM stability boundary, maintaining the ELM-free state while allowing up to a factor of two increase in edge pressure. The ELM boundary is significantly higher in more strongly shaped plasmas, which broadens the operating space available for QH-mode and leads to improved core performance. Second, {{for the first time on}} any tokamak, we have created QH-mode plasmas with strong edge co-rotation; previous QH-modes in all tokamaks had edge counter rotation. This result demonstrates that counter NBI and edge counter rotation are not essential conditions for QH-mode. Both these investigations benefited from the edge stability predictions based on peeling-ballooning mode theory. The broadening of the ELM-stable region with plasma shaping is predicted by that theory. The theory has also been extended to provide a model for the edge harmonic oscillation (EHO) that regulates edge transport in the QH-mode. Many of the features of that theory agree with the experimental results reported either previously or in the present paper. One notable example is the prediction that co-rotating QH-mode is possible provided sufficient shear in the edge rotation can be created. 1...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1993 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaWith {{the advent}} of {{high-speed}} parallel-to-serial conversion interface standards reaching the 1. 6 gigabit per second region, {{it is now possible}} to remote entire telemetry tracking systems over long distances without the need to maintain receivers, combiners, computers and antenna control units at the pedestal. In addition, it will soon be possible to digitize the RF signal(s) with high-speed flash-video analog-to-digital converters and transfer the data over these same links. This coupled with the improvements in fiber-optic L. E. D. and laser transmitters/ receivers and the constantly decreasing cost of fiber-optic cable, will allow for the eventual elimination of copper cabling for these interfaces. This will net a cost savings for the end user, provide for easier installations and increase the reliability of the overall system. This paper gives a brief history of the development of high-speed fiber-optic interface links, then expands into current interface standards and their utilization (such as MIL-STD- 1553 B, fiber data distributed interface (FDDI), HIPPI, etc.). Finally, a glimpse into the future of telemetry systems and the possibilities to soon be realized as major manufacturers of fiber-optic interfaces push well into the gigabit region. Topics include: • Replacement of existing copper cables between controller and pedestal using fiber-optic cable with interfaces that are not software-based intensive (black boxes); • Multiplexing <b>pedestal</b> <b>control</b> and status lines, RF feed commands, scan reference signals, and boresite video camera control; • Connecting and controlling multiple controllers and/or pedestals through one common interface cable; • Operating multiple tracking stations through one remote antenna controller; • Digitized RF telemetry signals sent along with pedestal, feed, video commands and status...|$|R
5000|$|The Do 217 usually {{carried a}} crew of four. Included were a pilot, an observer/bomb aimer/forward gunner, dorsal gunner/radio {{operator}} and a flight engineer/ventral gunner. As with the Dornier Do 17, the crew were positioned in the cockpit cabin forward of the engines and leading edge. The pilot sat on the port side, with a spectacle-type control column mounted on a swinging arm centered in the instrument panel. The entire arm could be swung 180deg to starboard, placing the yoke {{in front of the}} bombardier, in case of emergencies. In the later Do 217K with stepless windscreen, the center pivot was mounted on a rocking <b>control</b> arm or <b>pedestal,</b> rather than a sliding piston, since the instrument panel itself was eliminated (replaced with smaller panels holding the gauges, hung {{from the edge of the}} fueslage wall and from the glazing frames above the yoke, respectively.) The bomb aimer sat on his immediate right, slightly below and behind. In combat he could move forward into the nose and operate the bomb release gear or aim the forward machine gun (or 20 mm cannon). On the right side of the nose, the bomb aimer's window penetrates the cockpit and is visible as a bulge on the exterior. Back-to-back with the bombardiers seat, the flight engineer/ventral gunner sat on the port side, his seat facing to the rear. The seat of the ventral gunner/flight engineer was next to the radio operator facing forward, behind the bomb aimer. During operations the ventral gunner/engineer would lie on his stomach facing aft, his post as a gunner taking immediate and first priority.The radio-operator/dorsal gunner sat in a pivoting seat in the extreme rear, above the ventral gun position. His head was inside the B-Stand gun position, and the instruments mounted in a semi-circle around his torso level. The pilot had a curved shield of Armour plating, 8.5 mm thick, placed behind his seat. His seat had a further 5mm ( [...] in) of armour and another 5mm ( [...] in) plate above his head, installed in the top of the cockpit roof. The dorsal gunner was also protected by armour plating.The Funkgerät or FuG radio communication device compartments were located in the extreme rear of the cockpit, near the leading edge. The automatic pilot panel was located next the FuG boxes. In the right-rear of the cockpit the piping that was also attached to the de-icing ducts in wings also entered the cockpit, as part of a single heating system to emit warm air to heat the cabin if needed.The FuG X, 16, navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 2 blind landing devices were used in the E-2.|$|R
