50|$|Agent {{studies are}} used to {{determine}} whether a substance exhibits cytotoxicity or cytostasis. A cytotoxic agent will shrink a tumor, while, a <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agent</b> slows or stops tumor growth and metastases. It is important to determine which of these effects an agent poses so that a proper clinical trial can be designed. For example, a study with a cytotoxic agent will look for tumor shrinkage vs. dose. It is much harder to develop a clinical trial for a <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E

40|$|Conventional dose-finding {{methods in}} {{oncology}} are mainly developed for cytotoxic agents {{with the aim}} of finding the maximum tolerated dose. In phase I clinical trials with <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents,</b> such as targeted therapies, designs with toxicity endpoints alone may not work well. For <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents,</b> the goal is often to find the most efficacious dose that is still tolerable, although these agents are typically less toxic than cytotoxic agents and their efficacy may not monotonically increase with the dose. To effectively differentiate doses for <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents,</b> we develop a two-stage dose-finding procedure by first identifying the toxicity upper bound of the searching range through dose escalation and then determining the most efficacious dose through dose de-escalation while toxicity is continuously monitored. In oncology, treatment efficacy often takes a relatively long period to exhibit compared with toxicity. To accommodate such delayed response, we model the time to the efficacy event by redistributing the mass of the censored observation to the right and compute the fractional contribution of the censored data. We evaluate the operating characteristics of the new dose-finding design for <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents</b> and demonstrate its satisfactory performance through simulation studies.

50|$|Phase I {{trials are}} used to {{determine}} the maximum tolerated dose of an agent. This dose is then used in the Phase II trials. Maximum tolerated dose is based on the measured toxicity in cytotoxic agents. Cytostatic agents have been demonstrated to show biologic effects while also being nontoxic.

40|$|SUMMARY. -Selection of <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents</b> for {{intrathecal}} administration {{is the subject}} of this paper. Both the toxic side effects-destruction of blood-brain barrier and change of body weight-and the cytostatic effects on intracranially transplanted Yoshida ascites sarcoma were investigated of {{intrathecal administration}} of various <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents.</b> As a result, it may be concluded that Methotrexate and Endoxan and lower dose of mitomycin C are suitable drugs for intrathecal chemotherapy. Based on these findings, clinical cases of malignant brain tumours were treated with intrathecal chemotherapy. Grateful acknowledgement is made to Professor Dennosuke Jinnai for his constant interest and guidance in this investigation. FOR the chemotherapy of brain tumours, administration techniques of <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents</b> are usually divided into three routes: systemic, intra-arterial, and intrathecal or intratumoral administration. Intrathecal administration, however, is not so frequently used, for this route of application may subject the normal brain tissue to the action of the drug and be liable to cause severe neurological dysfunction (Heppner, Diemath and Jenkner...|$|R

50|$|The {{inherent}} growth inhibitory {{properties of}} many anti-cancer agents make these drugs ideal {{candidates for the}} prevention of restenosis. However, these same properties are often associated with cytotoxicity at doses which block cell proliferation. Therefore, the unique cytostatic nature of the immunosuppressant rapamycin was the basis for the development of zotarolimus by Johnson and Johnson. Rapamycin was originally approved {{for the prevention of}} renal transplant rejection in 1999. More recently, Abbott Laboratories developed a compound from the same class, zotarolimus (formerly ABT-578), as the first <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agent</b> to be used solely for delivery from drug-eluting stents to prevent restenosis.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a growing}} {{recognition}} that successful long-term therapy {{for the treatment of}} HIV infection should not only reduce viral replication, but also limit the hyper-activation of the immune system now proposed as the cause of the eventual progression to AIDS. AV-HALTs are designed to accomplish two goals - the reduction of viral load (decreased viral load) and the reduction of immune system hyperactivation (decreased markers of cellular activation and proliferation). First generation AV-HALTs accomplish this by combining an antiviral drug (e.g. didanosine) with a <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agent</b> (e.g. hydroxyurea). Second generation AV-HALTs emerging from drug discovery combine antiviral and anti-immune system hyperactivation in a single molecule.|$|E
50|$|Inspired {{research}} {{and a close}} eye for detail led the UK clinician and pharmacologist Kurt Hellmann to discovery of the unique cytostatic, cytoprotective and antimetastatic biological activities of bisdioxopiperazines in his laboratory at ICRF's Cancer Chemotherapy Unit in the early 1970s.These agents were synthesised as derivatives of EDTA by the ICRF chemist Andrew Creighton and their characteristics and chemistry were excellently summarized by Eugene Herman in 1982. Following Karrer, Goldin and Humphreys' description of the Lewis lung (3LL) carcinoma {{as a model for}} metastases Hellmann set up the 3LL as a screen for antimetastatic compounds in 1968. The first compound to be tested in this first antimetastatic drug screen was the <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agent</b> razoxane 159. As serendipity would have it, it showed almost total suppression of metastases without seeming to affect the growth of the primary implant, thus making razoxane the first fully antimetastatic drug.This work was regarded as a major breakthrough when published in a landmark paper in the BMJ in early 1972. This study, by Le Serve & Hellmann clearly showed {{for the first time that}} a drug which 'normalised the tumour-induced pathologic vasculature', in that it blocked intra-tumoural haemorrhage and hence the spread of cancer cells, prevented lethal metastasis.Such an observation pre-dated by many years the current interest in conversion of tumour vasculature to a more normal morphology and function as a therapeutic approach. In the clinical context the orally active Razoxane subsequently was shown to prevent liver metastases in adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer. More recently it has been demonstrated to potentiate certain schedules of chemoradiotherapy and suppress metastasis in soft tissue sarcomas,in part by improvement of oxygen and drug delivery.|$|E

Their 50 Â % cytostatic concentrations were generally in the higher nanomolar range and were approximately 20 - to 50 -fold lower for these tumor cell types than for any other tumor cell line or non-tumorigenic cells.

In our opinion, this approach is unlikely to be of benefit because of selection bias, lack of standardized data collection in many histor-ical series, as well as the recent change in criteria for response and progression developed in part by CTEP investigators. ...|$|R

Studies suggest that dose-dense temozolomide schedules and addition of <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents</b> may further improve efficacy. This factorial design phase I/II protocol tested dose-dense temozolomide alone and combined with <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents.</b> Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma received fractionated XRT to 60 Gy concomitant with temozolomide (75 mg/m 2 /day for 42 days). In the phase I portion, patients with stable disease or radiologic response 1 month after chemoradiation were randomized to adjuvant temozolomide alone (150 mg/m 2 /day, 7 / 14 -day schedule) or with doublet combinations of thalidomide (400 mg/day), isotretinoin (100 mg/m 2 /day), and/or celecoxib (400 mg twice daily), or all 3 agents. Toxicity was assessed after 4 weeks. Among 54 patients enrolled (median age, 52 years; median Karnofsky performance status, 90), adjuvant treatment was not administered to 12 (22 %), primarily because of disease progression (n = 10).

40|$|Objective: New {{strategies}} {{are required to}} rapidly identify novel <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents</b> before embarking on large randomized trials. This study investigates whether a change in rate of rise (slope) of serum CA 125 from before to after starting a novel agent {{could be used to}} identify <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents.</b> Tamoxifen was used to validate this hypothesis. Methods: Asymptomatic patients with relapsed ovarian cancer who had responded to chemotherapy were enrolled and had CA 125 measurements taken every 4 weeks, then more frequently when rising. Once levels reached 4 times the upper limit of normal or nadir, they started continuous tamoxifen 20 mg daily, as well as fortnightly CA 125 measurements until symptomatic progression. Because of the potentially nonlinear relationship of CA 125 over time, it was felt that to enable normal approximations to be utilized a natural logarithmic standard transformation [ln(CA 125) ] was the most suitable to improve linearity above the common logarithmic transformation to base 10. Results: From 235 recruited patients, 81 started tamoxifen and had at least 4 CA 125 measurements taken before and 4 CA 125 measurements taken after starting tamoxifen, respectively. The mean regression slopes from using at least 4 1 n(CA 125) measurements immediately before and after starting tamoxifen were 0 I 0149 and 0 I 0093 [ln(CA 125) /d], respectively. This difference is statistically significant, P = 0 I 001. Therefore, in a future trial with a novel agent, at least as effective as tamoxifen, using this effect size, the number of evaluable patients needed, at significance level of 5 % and power of 80 %, is 56. Conclusions: Further validation of this methodology is required, but there is potential to use comparison of mean regression slopes of ln(CA 125) as an interim analysis measure of efficacy for novel <b>cytostatic</b> <b>agents</b> in relapsed ovarian cancer.
