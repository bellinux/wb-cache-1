40|$|Using {{data from}} the Two Dimensional XMM-Newton Group Survey (2 dXGS), we have {{examined}} the abundance profile properties of both cool core (CC) and non cool core (NCC) galaxy groups. The ten NCC systems in our sample represent a population which to date has been poorly studied in the group regime. Fitting the abundance profiles as a linear function of log radius, we find steep abundance gradients in cool <b>core</b> (<b>CC)</b> <b>systems,</b> with a slope of - 0. 54 +/- 0. 07. In contrast, non cool core (NCC) groups have profiles consistent with uniform metallicity. Many CC groups show a central abundance dip or plateau, and we find evidence for anticorrelation between the core abundance gradient and the 1. 4 GHz radio power of the brightest group galaxy (BGG) in <b>CC</b> <b>systems.</b> This may indicate the effect of AGN-driven mixing within the central ~ 0. 1 r_ 500. It {{is not possible to}} discern whether such behaviour is present in the NCC groups, due to the small and diverse sample with the requisite radio data. The lack of strong abundance gradients in NCC groups, coupled with their lack of cool core, and evidence for enhanced substructure, leads us to favour merging as the mechanism for disrupting cool cores, although we cannot rule out disruption by a major AGN outburst. Given the implied timescales, the disruptive event must have occurred within the past few Gyrs in most NCC groups. Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|The <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> is a {{proposed}} standard for a device-independent graphics system. The {{concept of a}} device-independent system was first developed in 1977 by the Graphics Standards Planning Committee (GSPC) of ACM Siggraph and later refined in 1979 [1, 2]. The <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> design has received favorable reviews and has been implemented by various vendors at several universities, and other computing facilities (e. g. [3, 7]). The main objectives of the <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> are to provide uniformity, compatibility, and flexibility in graphics software. Three advantages that the <b>CORE</b> <b>system</b> provides over non-standard graphics systems are device independence, program portability, and functional completeness. A large number of different graphics hardware devices currently exist {{with a wide range}} of available functions. The <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> provides device independence by shielding the applications programmer from specific hardware characteristics. The shielding is at the functional level: the device-independent (DI) system uses internal routines to convert the application programmer 2 ̆ 7 s functional commands to specific commands for the selected hardware device driver (DD). The progammer describes a graphical world to the <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> in device-independent normalized device coordinates. The programmer also specifies the viewport on the logical view surface (output device) where a picture segment is to be placed. As the <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> becomes the accepted standard graphics package, program portability will become more feasible. Program portability means the ability to transport application programs between two sites without requiring structural modifications. The <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> was designed for functional completeness so that any graphics function a programmer desires is either included within the system or can be easily built on top of <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> routines...|$|R
40|$|Statement of problem: Techniques and {{recommendations}} {{for the restoration of}} endodontically treated teeth have changed from the use of custom cast metal post and <b>core</b> <b>system</b> to glass fiber-reinforced (GFRC) post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> Has this latest prefabricated glass fiber reinforced post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system</b> increased the fracture resistance of teeth and reduced the incidence of unrestorable root fractures. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the incidence of root fracture and mode of failure of endodontically treated teeth restored with two different post and <b>core</b> <b>systems.</b> Material and methods: Forty maxillary central incisors were randomly divided into two groups. (n= 20). All teeth received endodontic treatment. First group was restored with custom cast post and <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> Second group was restored with glass fiber post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> In Both the groups posts were cemented with adhesive resin cement. Compressive load was applied at an angle of 130 to the long axis of teeth at a cross head speed of 1 mm/min until fracture occurred. Data were analyzed with student 't' test P<. 001. Results: The mean value for fracture resistance was (331. 4025) N in Group -I Custom cast Ni-Cr post and core and (237. 0625) N in Group -II Glass fiber reinforced post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> Students 't' test shows the significant difference in fracture resistance of two groups. Conclusion: This study showed that the incidence of root fracture was significantly higher in custom cast Ni-Cr post and <b>core</b> <b>system</b> than glass fiber post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> A more favourable mode of failure was observed in teeth restored with Group II glass fiber post system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the 2001, China {{carried out}} the {{drilling}} techniques research and developed conventional and wire-line pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> for oceanic gas hydrate exploration. The <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> was used for pilot testing in the hole. The test successfully demonstrated {{the operation of the}} wire-line pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system.</b> Since 2001, Institute of Exploration Techniques made significant progress on gas hydrate drilling and coring. In 2005, China started research on the drilling <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> and drilling techniques for its application to the permafrost gas hydrate. In the 2008, first testing of drilling and coring with the new wire-line pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> for the permafrost gas hydrate in Qing-Tibet Plateau, Qilian Mountain, above sea level of 4200 m was conducted to collect gas hydrate samples from 130 m to 400 m depth [...] In order to confirm the presence of gas hydrate, drilling and coring continued in 2009 and 2010, and additional gas hydrate samples were acquired and tested in the laboratory. In order to use the gas hydrate resource, additional testing of the gas hydrate in the permafrost was conducted with depressurization and reservoir heating in September, 2011. During this testing, electro-magnetic, solar energy and vapor heating methods were used, and the reservoir pressure was decreased by the submarine pump by bringing the subsurface water to the surface. The testing was considered successful. The pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system,</b> the drilling and the production processes and the results are described in the paper...|$|R
