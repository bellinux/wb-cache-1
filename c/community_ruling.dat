This marks a new development in the balance between the conflicting imperatives of economic inclusion and political exclusion in Israel’s relations with the Palestinians, and legitimizes practices of citizenship where formal political space is denied.

In the village, a ruling caste controls local {{political and religious}} institutions. For children who {{do not belong to}} the ruling caste, migration is a strategy to increase social mobility, a process that is enhanced by formal schooling. Since formally educated migrants tend not to return to the home <b>community,</b> the <b>ruling</b> caste seeks to develop family loyalty by choosing religious education instead.

Indeed, agronomists usually focus on the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. Now, ecological modellers can link food web models with soil–plant models to create innovative frameworks. Here, we advocate that food webs must be included in simulations of production and in studies of emerging properties. We emphasize the role of trophic chains in the regulation of pests. Emerging properties include aboveground and belowground interactions, pest control, and positive feedbacks on soil properties. We propose a conceptual structure for this framework and discuss how the structure of linked food web/cropping system models can account for the specific properties of agroecosystems. The proposed structure includes a process-based approach to link food webs with crop models. Such comprehensive models address the issue of trade-offs between ecosystem services, including regulation of crop pests by the ecosystem community, nutrient cycling, and crop production...|$|R

5000|$|For {{many years}} the FCC's {{policies}} to give opportunities, {{and sometimes even}} preference, to new minority run stations in underserved areas went unchallenged. In 1983, two companies applied for the same television broadcasting license in the Orlando area. The broadcasting license was initially granted to Metro Broadcasting, Inc., but then the license was reviewed and given to another company, Rainbow Broadcasting because it was under 90% Hispanic-American ownership, therefore meeting the qualifications for being minority owned. This initial granting, and then revoking, the license caused a quick reaction. Metro Broadcasting sued the FCC and case, known as Metro Broadcasting v. FCC, eventually came to the Supreme Court. The charges were that the FCC policy of favoring minorities violated the equal protection clause. [...] The Supreme Court ruled that, “The The FCC policies do not violate equal protection, since they bear the imprimatur of longstanding congressional support and direction and are substantially related to {{the achievement of the}} important governmental objective of broadcast diversity Pp. 563-601”. Therefore, the court found that the FCC policy did not violate equal protection because it was promoting a long held goal of not just the FCC but also Congress and the United States government in promoting broadcasting outlets that speak to all the people represented in a <b>community.</b> This <b>ruling</b> was also significant in that it confirmed the constitutionality of affirmative action policies that promoted diversity rather than simply redressing past discrimination.|$|R

However, racism towards the Indians has received little public attention.
