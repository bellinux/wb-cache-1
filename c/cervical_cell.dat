An 8q24 copy number increase was detected by CGH. Dual-color FISH with a c-MYC probe mapping to 8q24 revealed colocalization with HPV18 at all integration sites, indicating that dispersion and amplification of the c-MYC gene sequences occurred after and was most likely triggered by the viral insertion at a single integration site.

An immunohistochemical assay, using a polyclonal antiserum raised against benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-DNA adducts, was performed to evaluate PAH-DNA adducts in <b>cervical</b> <b>cells</b> collected from 16 volunteers who smoked at least 20 cigarettes/day and 16 nonsmokers. The mean adduct level, determined as relative staining intensity by an optical density image analyzer, was significantly higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers (AOD x 1000 +/- SD = 98 +/- 32 and 73 +/- 25, respectively) (P = 0. 04). These results demonstrate that this immunohistochemical assay, much simpler than other methodologies used to evaluate PAH-DNA adducts in cervical tissue, is sufficiently sensitive for quantitative adduct evaluation in single epithelial <b>cervical</b> <b>cells,</b> as already verified for other exfoliated material.

40|$|The {{upstream}} regulatory region (URR) of {{the human}} papillomaviruses HPV 16 and 18 contains a sequence with a seven out of eight base match to the consensus binding site for octamer binding transcription factors.

In contrast the HPV octamer motif activates promoter activity in <b>cervical</b> <b>cells.</b> Here we show that <b>cervical</b> <b>cells</b> express the activating form of the Oct- 2 transcription factor, Oct 2. 1 and that this factor can transactivate promoter activity via the HPV 16 octamer.

40|$|CR 3 -mediated {{endocytosis}} is {{a primary}} mechanism by which Neisseria gonorrhoeae elicits membrane ruffling and cellular invasion of the cervical epithelia. Our data indicate that, upon infection of cervical epithelia, N. gonorrhoeae specifically releases proteins, including a phospholipase D (PLD) homolog, which facilitate membrane ruffling. To elucidate the function of gonococcal PLD in infection of the cervical epithelia, we constructed an N. gonorrhoeae PLD mutant. By comparative association and/or invasion assays, we demonstrated that PLD mutant gonococci are impaired {{in their ability to}} adhere to and to invade primary cervical cells. This defect can be rescued by the addition of supernatants obtained from wild-type-infected cell monolayers but not by exogenously added Streptomyces PLD. The decreased level of total cell association (i. e., adherence and invasion) observed for mutant gonococci is, in part, attributed to the inability of these bacteria to recruit CR 3 to the <b>cervical</b> <b>cell</b> surface with extended infection. Using electron microscopy, we demonstrate that gonococcal PLD may be necessary to potentiate membrane ruffling and clustering of gonococci on the <b>cervical</b> <b>cell</b> surface. These data may be indicative of the inability of PLD mutant gonococci to recruit CR 3 to the <b>cervical</b> <b>cell</b> surface.

The algorithm consisted of contrast stretching and morphological opening operations.
