40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{study the effects of}} noise on the {{parameters}} characterizing the size and roughness of <b>contact</b> <b>edges</b> when they are measured by the analysis of top-down SEM images. The applied methodology is based on the modelling of rough <b>contact</b> <b>edges</b> with controlled roughness parameters and the generation of synthesized top down SEM images with several <b>contact</b> <b>edges</b> and a distribution of Critical Dimension (CD) values (CD nonuniformity). The sources of noise can be the shot noise of SEM electron beam (Poisson-type) and the microscope electronics (Gaussian-type). First, we check out the validity of the model and then we apply it to evaluate the effects of noise in synthesized SEM images with smooth and images with rough <b>contact</b> <b>edges.</b> The results show that in all cases, noise lowers CD and correlation length while it increases the rms value. CD variation is increased with noise in images with smooth and identical contacts whereas it remains almost unaltered in images including rough contacts with CD nonuniformity. Furthermore, we find that the application of a noise smoothing filter before image analysis is able to rectify the values of CD (at small filter parameter) and of rms and correlation length (at larger filter parameters), whereas it leads to larger deviations from the true values of CD variation. Quantitative assessment of the model predictions reveals that the noise induced variations of CD and CER values are inferior to those caused by process stochasticity and material inhomogeneities. © 2012 SPIE...|$|R

Using high-resolution live-cell imaging, biosensors, and small molecule inhibitors, we investigate how Rac 1 and RhoA regulate actin dynamics during de novo contact formation between pairs of epithelial cells. Active Rac 1, the Arp 2 / 3 complex, and lamellipodia are initially localized to de novo contacts but rapidly diminish as E-cadherin accumulates; further rounds of activation and down-regulation of Rac 1 and Arp 2 / 3 occur at the contacting membrane periphery, and this cycle repeats as a restricted membrane zone that moves outward with the expanding contact. The cortical bundle of actin filaments dissolves beneath the expanding contacts, leaving actin bundles at the <b>contact</b> <b>edges.</b> RhoA and actomyosin contractility are activated at the <b>contact</b> <b>edges</b> and are required to drive expansion and completion of cell–cell adhesion.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel method {{to model the}} stress gradient effect in fretting-fatigue. The analysis of the mechanical fields in {{the proximity of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>edges</b> allows to extract nonlocal intensity factors that take into account the stress gradient evolution. For this purpose, the kinetic field around the contact ends is partitioned into a summation of multiple terms, each one expressed as the product between nonlocal intensity factors, Is, Ia, Ic, depending on the macroscopic loads applied to the mechanical assembly, and spatial reference fields, ds, da, dc, depending on the local geometry of the part. This description is obtained through nonintrusive post-processing of FE computation and is conceived in order to be easily implementable in the industrial context. By using as input the macroscopic load, the procedure consists in computing a set of nonlocal stress intensity factors, which are an index of the severity of the stress field in the proximity of the <b>contact</b> <b>edges.</b> This description has two main advantages. First, the nonlocal stress intensity factors are independent from the geometry used. Secondly, the procedure is easily applicable to industrial scale FE model. ...|$|R

It is found that the <b>contact</b> <b>edge</b> roughness(CER) parameters(RMS, ξ) merge when they are plotted versus the final CD value revealing the critical role of contact CD in the dependence of CER on PAG and sensitizer.

40|$|Fatigue limit, Abstract. The {{stress and}} {{displacement}} fields near the bonding edge, sharp notch, and <b>contact</b> <b>edge</b> show singularity behaviours, so methods of evaluating {{the strength of}} these points using maximum stresses calculated by a numerical stress analysis, such as the finite element method, are generally not valid. We have previously presented a new method of evaluating the strength of these singular points using two stress singularity parameters H and λ. In this paper we have developed a method of formularizing critical stress-singularity parameter Hth for each order of stress singularity λ by utilizing critical distance stress theories (point method and line method), which {{can be derived from}} two typical strength parameters, namely, fatigue limit σw 0 and threshold stress-intensity factor range ∆Kth. These estimated critical Hth (λ) value agreed well with the experimentally measured value.
