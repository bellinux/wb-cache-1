40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} <b>of</b> <b>varroasis</b> has {{not been}} fully explained despite intensive research. Earlier studies suggested that parasitic infections caused by Varroa destructor mites were accompanied by immunosuppression in the host organism. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyse the influence <b>of</b> <b>varroasis</b> on one <b>of</b> the immune pathway in Apis mellifera measured by the expression of the prophenoloxidase (proPO) gene and the enzymatic activity of this gene’s product, phenoloxidase (EC 1. 14. 18. 1). An evaluation was done of five developmental stages of honey bee workers and drones. The relative expression of proPO decreased in infected individuals. The only exceptions were worker prepupae (PP) and drone pupae with brown eyes and dark brown thorax (P 5) where propo gene expression was 1. 8 -fold and 1. 5 -fold higher, respectively, than in the control. Phenoloxidase (PO) activity was 2. 8 -fold higher in infected pp workers and 2 -fold higher in p 5 drones in comparison with uninfected bees. Phenoloxidase activity was reduced in the remaining developmental stages of infected workers and drones. The relative expression of proPO was positively correlated with the relative PO activity in both workers (r = 0. 988) and drones (r = 0. 996). The results of the study indicate that V. destructor significantly influences the phenoloxidase-dependent immune pathway in honey bees...|$|R
40|$|Varroa destructor, in Czech {{language}} {{known as}} kleštík včelí, is a parasitic mite (of eastern bee and honeybee) which causes the disease called varroasis. Kleštík {{is like a}} black passenger {{on the body of}} bees and drones, which commonly penetrate foreign hives, and because of that they can be considered the main vector of parasite. In the Czech Republic we fight this parasite using methods every since its discovery in the early 80 s of the 20 th century. Some methods are defined by the Veterinary Institute in the Czech Republic and the others were disovered by the beekeepers themselves. The main purpose of this thesis was to determine what are current methods to suppress or to completely obliterate the infection caused by Varroa destructor. What methods have proved to be most effective, and what new methods were invented from the time of its discovery. I conducted a field experiment bee hives belonging to beekeeping organizations Trhové Sviny during the 2015 and the 2016. The practical part of my research (i. e. occurrence and also the review <b>of</b> <b>varroasis</b> disease treatment) had little effect on normal activities of beekeepers. The process of Varroa destructor presence, its treatment and the methods of treatment researched. Based on the collected samples sent to Veterinary Administration for testing to find out whether are the Varroa counter measures effective or not. The conclusion of my reasearch ist he unificated treatment and detection of Varroa are of the main importance. That goes not only for the beekeeping associations but also by unregistered beekeepers. Because the amount of bee colonies here in the Czech Republic is huge, the use of alternative treatment and suppresing procedures as well as the intentional breeding for resistance against Varroa are rather unrealistic, the only viable option fort he moment, is to follow Veterinary Services guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Issues {{important}} in rotorcraft flight control are discussed. A perceptual description is suggested {{of what is}} believed to be the major issues in flight control. When the task is considered <b>of</b> a pilot <b>controlling</b> a helicopter in flight, the task is decomposed in several subtasks. These subtasks include: (1) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> altitude, (2) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> speed, (3) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> heading, (4) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> orientation, (5) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> flight over obstacles, and (6) the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> flight to specified positions in the world. The first four subtasks can be considered to be primary control tasks as they are not dependent on any other subtasks. However, the latter two subtasks can be considered hierarchical tasks as they are dependent on other subtasks. For example, the task <b>of</b> flight <b>control</b> over obstacles can be decomposed as a task requiring the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> speed, altitude, and heading. Thus, incorrect <b>control</b> <b>of</b> altitude should result in poor <b>control</b> <b>of</b> flight over an obstacle...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at generalizing the {{theoretical}} provisions on <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing in enterprise: to clarify the place <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing within the management system, constituents, goals, tasks, and functions. The <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing was considered in terms of concepts such as management of enterprise, management of marketing, operative management <b>of</b> marketing, <b>controlling,</b> strategic and operational <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing, and operative management of marketing costs. The constituents and tools <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing at the strategic and the operational levels have been defined.
