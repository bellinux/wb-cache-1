25|$|After {{winning the}} gold medal in the 2010 FIBA World Championship, Gordon was geared towards a {{breakout}} season. Gordon was on a scoring tear earlier in the season but was slowed down in his game against the Golden State Warriors, with a hard foul committed by Andris Biedriņš, which forced Gordon (who was averaging 24.1 points per game before the injury) to be sidelined for 18 games. It was later revealed that Gordon had a sprained wrist with a bone <b>chip</b> <b>fracture.</b> Returning from an 18-game absence, Gordon had a solid performance with a win against the Houston Rockets with 24 points. Gordon re-aggravated his sprained wrist the second game back against the Denver Nuggets, this time a hard foul committed by Timofey Mozgov, which gave Gordon a 6-game absence.

The microfilled composite resins enjoy a smooth finish and high luster. This offers advantages in areas where smoothness is paramount.

50|$|Bone heals by {{formation}} of a callus over the defective area. Speed and quality of healing {{is directly related to}} the blood supply and fracture stability. Rest is required immediately following injury to reduce movement of the fracture site. Stability may be improved through use of surgical implants or casting, depending on the location of extent of the fracture. Shock wave therapy is sometimes employed in the case of splint bone fracture or stress fractures to the cannon bones, to improve blood flow to the area. Fractures within a joint, such as <b>chip</b> <b>fractures</b> in the knee, hock, or fetlock, require arthroscopic surgery to prevent secondary arthritis of that joint.|$|R

50|$|Inflammatory products, such as {{inflammatory}} mediators and cytokines, damage {{articular cartilage}} {{and have been}} shown to weaken intraarticular ligaments. Therefore, treatment of joint disease should not only address the primary injury producing inflammation, but also the inflammatory cycle that leads to further tissue damage. Cryotherapy, joint lavage, systemic anti-inflammatories, or intra-articular medications are used to reduce joint inflammation. In the case of severe joint pathology such as an osteochondral chip, intraarticular fracture, osteochondritis dissecans lesion, or ligamentous or meniscal injury, arthroscopy may be required to ensure normal function of that joint. Debris within the joint, such as from a <b>chip</b> <b>fracture,</b> can cause long term damage to the synovium and articular cartilage leading to osteoarthritis, and is therefore best removed. Following acute injury, joints often benefit from specialized physical therapy, such as swimming, to prevent the loss of range of motion associated with joint capsule fibrosis.|$|E

40|$|The surface {{generation}} mechanisms of WC/Co and Reaction-bonded SiC/Si (RB-SiC/Si) composites under high spindle speed grinding (HSSG) were investigated {{in the present}} work, compared with quasi-static indentation test The results showed that {{surface generation}} mechanism for WC/Co and RB-SiC/Si varied under both quasi static indentation and dynamic grinding. Only plastic deformation occurred for WC/Co indicating its higher toughness, while pop-out effect induced by phase transformation in RB-SiC/Si would prompt the chipping at phase boundaries under indentation. Under dynamic grinding, WC/Co underwent plastic deformation, grain dislodgement and WC particles crush, while ductile removal, phase boundaries crack (along the grinding direction) and <b>chipping</b> <b>fracture</b> occurred for RB-SiC/Si {{with the increase of}} cutting depth. It was found that the binder in the bulk WC/Co and RB-SiC/Si played a decisive role on the material removal mode, and the mechanics of grain dislodgement for WC/Co and RB-SiC/Si were analyzed based on a geometrical model. Besides, three types of grinding wheel wear appeared, including grit dislodgement, flattening and splintering, which bear an obvious influence on the surface generation.

40|$|Ceramics {{have been}} widely used for {{esthetic}} and functional improvements. The resin cement is the material of choice for bonding ceramics to dental substrate and it can also dictate the final esthetic appearance and strength of the restoration. The correct use of the wide spectrum of resin luting agents available depends on the dental tooth substrate. This article presents three-year clinical results of a 41 years old female patient B. H. C complaining about her unattractive smile. Two all-ceramic crowns and two laminates veneers were placed in the maxillary incisors and cemented with a self-adhesive resin luting cement and conventional resin luting cement, respectively. After a three-year follow-up, the restorations and cement/teeth interface were clinically perfect with no <b>chipping,</b> <b>fractures</b> or discoloration. Proper use of different resin luting cements shows clinical appropriate behavior after a three-year follow-up. Self-adhesive resin luting cement may be used for cementing all-ceramic crowns with high predictability of success, mainly if there is a large dentin surface available for bonding and no enamel at the finish line. Otherwise, conventional resin luting agent should be used for achieving an adequate bonding strength to enamel. (Eur J Dent 2011; 5 : 478...|$|R
