5|$|Maya stelae were {{worked with}} stone <b>chisels</b> and {{probably}} with wooden mallets. Hammerstones were fashioned from flint and basalt and {{were used for}} shaping the softer rocks used to make stelae, while fine detail was completed with smaller <b>chisels.</b> Originally most were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours using mineral and organic pigments. At Copán and some other Maya cities, some traces of these pigments were found upon the monuments.|$|E

Iron was also used to make swords, halberds, arrowheads and scale armor for the military.|$|E
40|$|Combination <b>chisel</b> plows {{are used}} {{extensively}} in crop production {{areas in the}} United States as part of conventional, reduced, and mulch-tillage systems. Use of combination <b>chisel</b> plows in corn residue can reduce surface residue cover to levels that afford little protection from soil erosion processes. Changes in the operation and setup of the equipment, however, can significantly affect the amount of residue that is incorporated into the soil. The objective of this project was to evaluate operational effects of a combination <b>chisel</b> plow equipped with coulter gangs on corn residue cover. Variables included timing of <b>chisel</b> plowing, <b>chisel</b> point selection, speed and depth of <b>chiseling,</b> and coulter gang engagement. Fall <b>chisel</b> plowing left higher levels of residue cover than did spring <b>chiseling.</b> The difference was negated, however, when overwintering losses following fall <b>chiseling</b> were accounted for. Only three of eight treatments during spring <b>chiseling</b> left residue cover greater than 30...|$|R

South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Taíno used conch shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and <b>chisels),</b> jewelry, cookware and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.|$|E

5|$|In {{the year}} 1890, Edwin B. Young, a {{descendant}} of United Empire Royalists and a colonel in the King's Royal, was made superintendent of the grounds. A particular wealthy family, the Gardners, had large granite vaults built very visibly to pedestrians along then Bergenwood Road. It was reported by the New York Sun that grave robbers had broken into various vaults at Grove Church. The Gardner vault had been found opened, which required the vandal to smash locks as well as break the iron railing, which {{was believed to be}} achieved by the use of hammers and <b>chisels</b> stolen from on adjoined marble yard. Robert Gardner's metallic coffin was found opened, removed from the shelf upon which it sat. The investigation, led by Superintendent Young, left those involved unsure of why the perpetrators would have broken in, and with no apparent objective or reason, they concluded that it may have been done simply to desecrate the resting place of the dead. Young held that position of superintendent until 1899, for the pursuit of real estate.|$|E
5|$|The process {{required}} {{a range of}} equipment. Some of this was protective equipment to allow the workforce and horses to operate safely on ice, including cork shoes {{for the men and}} spiked horse shoes. Early in the 19th century only ad hoc, improvised tools such as pickaxes and <b>chisels</b> were used {{for the rest of the}} harvest, but in the 1840s Wyeth introduced various new designs to allow for a larger scale, more commercial harvesting process. These included a horse-drawn ice cutter, resembling a plough with two parallel cutters to help in marking out the ice quickly and uniformly, and later a horse-drawn plough with teeth to assist in the cutting process itself, replacing the hand saw. By the 1850s, specialist ice tool manufacturers were producing catalogues and selling products along the east coast. There were discussions over the desirability of a circular cutting saw for much of the 19th century, but it proved impractical to power them with horses and they were not introduced to ice harvesting until the start of the 20th century, when gasoline engines became available.|$|E

At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and <b>chisels</b> dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages. Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise the alarm he collapsed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Mechanical {{harvesting}} {{has increasingly}} {{been used in}} sugarcane production units, and it has often resulted in reduced structural quality of the soil due to soil compaction caused by machine traffic. Thus, sugarcane ratoon crops have often been <b>chiseled</b> to overcome such a problem. The aim {{of the current study}} is to assess some physical properties of a Latossolo Vermelho Distroférrico (Rhodic Hapludox) that was <b>chiseled</b> after the third harvest in a sugarcane ratoon crop. The study was conducted in a commercial crop area throughout the 2011 / 2012 crop year. A randomized block experimental design was used, with five replications. The treatments consisted of five <b>chiseling</b> operations in sugarcane ratoon crops, namely: T 1 - single-shank ripper with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 15 m; T 2 - single-shank ripper with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 30 m; T 3 - two-bar ripper with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 15 m, T 4 - two-bar ripper with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 30 m; and T 5 - control group, with no <b>chiseling.</b> Overall, soil <b>chiseling</b> is effective for improving the physical quality of the soil to a depth of 0. 15 m, regardless of the equipment and the depth. Two-bar-ripper-based soil <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 30 m provides increased sugarcane yield...|$|R
5|$|Stelae {{have become}} {{threatened}} {{in modern times}} by plundering for sale on the international art market. Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact. Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport, including power saws, <b>chisels,</b> acid and heat. When a monument is well preserved, the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport. Even when successful, this results in damage to inscriptions {{on the sides of}} the stela. At worst, this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale. Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by American museums and private collectors in the past. When such monuments are removed from their original context, their historical meaning is lost. Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution, no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location. After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the New York art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen pre-Columbian sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date. In the early 1970s some museums, such as that of the University of Pennsylvania, responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history, including place of origin, previous owners and an export license. Harvard University also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s.|$|E
