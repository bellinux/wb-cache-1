In this report, the OA and UA accumulation characteristics were investigated in 47 cultivars of <b>Chinese</b> herbaceous <b>peony</b> (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) and were followed in three cultivars over different developmental stages as measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). OA and UA levels in leaves and stems demonstrated an overall upward trend from May 1 to September 15 except for UA in the leaves of ―Hong Feng‖. The maximum values of OA and UA in leaves of ―Yangfei Chu Yu‖, ―Fen Zhu Pan ‖ and ―Hong Feng ‖ were 852. 98, 575. 60, 290. 48 μg/g FW and 924. 94, 827. 36, 432. 67 μg/g FW, respectively.

OA and UA contents in leaves of 47 different herbaceous peony cultivars ranged from 66. 73 – 618. 12 and 36. 23 – 665. 14 μg/g FW, respectively, with average values of 171. 62 and 227. 57 μg/g FW, respectively. The results suggested that the aboveground parts of herbaceous peony may be used as an alternative source of OA and UA for medicinal purposes in addition to its ornamental purposes...|$|R
