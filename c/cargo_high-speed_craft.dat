40|$|A {{pitch and}} surge coupled dynamic {{model of a}} <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> is not {{available}} for dynamic trim control applications in the literature. The existing fluid-structure interaction models of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> are not adequate for simulations and control applications, since they require {{a great deal of}} computation time, for example more than 20 - 40 sec. depending on a vessel particulars. Hence, in this work, we aimed to obtain a dynamic model of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> for surge and pitch motions. Then the obtained model will be utilized to design an automatic controller which adjust the command signal on a <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> to increase fuel efficiency, safety and comfort of passengers in a vessel. The coupled pitch and surge motion of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> with trim tabs/interceptors was modelled by using full scale sea trial data. The linear parametric modelling using System Identification (SI) Methods and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling were carried out and the comparisons of both the training and validation results are given. High correlation coefficients and low average values of absolute errors in surge and pitch dynamics were obtained by using ANN Method. The ANN model can be improved for further control designs on a marine vessel’s operations...|$|R
40|$|<b>High-speed</b> <b>craft</b> are in {{high demand}} in the {{maritime}} industry, for example, in maintenance operations for offshore structures, for search and rescue, for patrolling operations, or as leisure craft to deliver speed and excitement. Design and operation of <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> are often governed by the hydrodynamic phenomena of slamming, which occur when the craft impact the wave surface. Slamming loads affect the <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> system; the crew, the structure and various sub-systems and limit the operation. To meet the ever-increasing demands on safety, economy and reduced environmental impact, {{there is a need}} to develop more efficient <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft.</b> This progression is however limited by the prevailing semi-empirical design methods for <b>high-speed</b> planing <b>craft</b> structures. These methods provide only a basic description of the involved physics, and their validity has been questioned. This thesis contributes to improving the conditions for designing efficient highspeed craft by focusing on two key topics: evaluation and development of the prevailing design methods for <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> structures, and development towards structural design based on first principles modeling of the slamming process. In particular a methodological framework that enables detailed studies of the slamming phenomena using numerical simulations and experimental measurements is synthesized and evaluated. The methodological framework involves modeling of the wave environment, the craft hydromechanics and structural mechanics, and statistical characterization of the response processes. The framework forms the foundation for an extensive evaluation and development of the prevailing semi-empirical design methods for <b>high-speed</b> planing <b>craft.</b> Through the work presented in this thesis the framework is also shown to be a viable approach in the introduction of simulation-based design methods based on first principles modeling of the involved physics. Summarizing, the presented methods and results provide important steppingstones towards designing more efficient <b>high-speed</b> planing <b>craft.</b> QC 20160907 </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} in structural {{design and construction}} of <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> has been extensive during the last decades. Environmental and economical issues have increased {{the need to develop}} more optimized structures, using new material concepts, to reduce weight and increase performance efficiency. However, both lack of, and limitations in design methodology, makes this a difficult task. In this thesis a methodological framework which enables detailed studies of the slamming loads and associated responses for <b>high-speed</b> planing <b>craft</b> in irregular waves is established. The slamming loads can either be formulated based on numerical simulations, or on experimental measurements and pressure distribution reconstruction. Structure responses are derived in the time-domain using finite element analysis. Statistical methods are used to determine design loads and lifetime extreme responses. The framework is applied to perform phenomenological studies of the slamming loading conditions for <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft,</b> and used to highlight and quantify the limitations in the prevailing semi-empirical method for design load determination with respect to slamming. A number of clarifications regarding the original derivation and the applicability of the prevailing semi-empirical method are presented. Finally, several potential improvements to the method are presented and the associated implications discussed. The long-term goal of the research project is to establish a method for direct calculation of loads and response for <b>high-speed</b> planing <b>craft,</b> which can enable design of truly efficient craft structures. The methodology and the results presented in this thesis are concluded to be important stepping-stones towards this goal.   In page VII, Paper B is wrong title.

40|$|Hydroelastic {{effect in}} bottom {{slamming}} problem of <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> {{is one of}} the most challenging issues in structural design. In this paper, numerical method is used to investigate the hydroelastic effect in bottom-water impact analysis of <b>high-speed</b> monohull <b>craft.</b> Slamming with two viewpoints of rigid and elastic structures (hydroelastic effect) is modelled by coupled computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and finite element method (FEM) techniques. The results showed that considering hydroelastic effect, especially in high-impact speed, reduces the structural deformations and stresses compared with quasi-statistic analysis. The effect of different parameters, such as boundary condition, plate properties, wedge deadrise angle, and impact velocity in slamming problem, was investigated. The results for aluminium and steel plate with the same bending strength showed that dynamic characteristic of plate material is a major parameter in hydroelastic analysis result. Finally, a simplified method is used to apply the effect of hydroelasticity in bottom plate design.

40|$|The {{state of}} the art of fast {{propeller}} design codes is mainly based on classical vortical theories by Lerbs. Their crude simplifications make them often insufficiently accurate in the case of modern fast propellers geometries having highly skewed blades, non-conventional profiles, mixed type of cavitation and strict constraints about pressure pulses and radiated noise. Advanced design tools, based on (more) accurate flow solvers able to deal with the multi-objective nature of any modern design are, definitely, required. In light of this, the design of a propeller for a <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> is addressed by using a multi-objective numerical optimization approach, based on a fast and reliable BEM, a parametric description of the geometry and a genetic algorithm. The new propeller is designed to improve the propulsive efficiency, reduce the cavitation extension, increase the inception speed and simultaneously maximize the ship speed.

The centre consoles are normally constructed to fit the mean height of the operators to cover as many end users as possible. Issues might therefore arise for the operators who deviate from the mean height. This master thesis report covers the design, implementation and evaluation of a set of mechanisms which are to enable the operator work space of an 8 -meter high speed craft to be longitudinally movable as well as ergonomically adjustable for operators with a length 160 to 200 cm, which include more than 90 % of the Swedish population.

The thesis examines the profits gained in terms of economic, comfort and environmental investment. The current study aims to illustrate the impact of interceptors in planing ships, by simulating a steady state model of the dynamic running position.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference in the level of fatigue induced by <b>high-speed</b> maritime <b>craft</b> operation between the day- and night-shift officers. The demographic and work-related factors that contribute to fatigue were also explored. A total of 93 <b>high-speed</b> maritime <b>craft</b> officers participated in the survey, of whom 35 worked a day shift (Mean age= 48. 3 years) and 58 worked a night shift (Mean age= 45. 8 years). Fatigue experience was measured with the Chinese version of the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory (SOFI-C) at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the work shift. Information on age, work experience, perceived voyage difficulty and duty schedule was obtained. The study found that the night-shift officers seemed to manifest an overall higher level of perceived fatigue than the day-shift officers, while the day-shift officers demonstrated a fatigue carry-over effect across the two workdays. Besides the shift pattern, age, experience in operating <b>high-speed</b> maritime <b>craft</b> and perceived voyage difficulty were the significant factors contributing to the officers’ fatigue experience. The finding that the fatigue experience associated with <b>high-speed</b> maritime <b>craft</b> operation has a rapid and accumulative nature suggests that different occupational safety and health guidelines should be devised for these two groups of officers.
