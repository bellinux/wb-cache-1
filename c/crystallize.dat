5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to <b>crystallize</b> in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which <b>crystallize</b> in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E

Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E

40|$|Past {{studies that}} have {{examined}} the relationship between Openness and <b>crystallized</b> ability have failed to account statistically for the fact that subtests commonly regarded as measures of <b>crystallized</b> intelligence (e. g., Vocabulary) are contaminated substantially by general intelligence. A method using residuals derived from a regression is proposed as a means to estimate <b>crystallized</b> ability. Further, self-reported intelligence was hypothesized to moderate or mediate the correlation between Openness and <b>crystallized</b> intelligence. It was found that two factors (General and Objective) could be derived from a principal components analysis (PCA) of the six Openness facets and that only Objective Openness correlated with intelligence. Using the residual approach to estimating <b>crystallized</b> ability, it was found that Objective Openness correlated with only g and not <b>crystallized</b> ability. The self-report intelligence measure correlated only with the General Openness factor. Based on {{the results of this study}} and a review of the empirical literature, it is argued that Openness should be correlated with g and that this correlation should exist based on theory.

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to <b>crystallize</b> (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E
5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should <b>crystallize,</b> starting at its center.

In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase, latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E
