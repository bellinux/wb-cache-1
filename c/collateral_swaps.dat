5000|$|In {{addition}} to using repo as a funding vehicle, repo traders [...] "make markets". These traders have been traditionally known as [...] "matched-book repo traders". The {{concept of a}} matched-book trade follows closely {{to that of a}} broker who takes both sides of an active trade, essentially having no market risk, only credit risk. Elementary matched-book traders engage in both the repo and a reverse repo within a short period of time, capturing the profits from the bid/ask spread between the reverse repo and repo rates. Currently, matched-book repo traders employ other profit strategies, such as non-matched maturities, <b>collateral</b> <b>swaps,</b> and liquidity management.|$|E

40|$|Critics of {{financial}} regulation sing a classic refrain, associated with Friedrich Hayek’s theories: Regulation cannot match the temporality of capitalism, {{as it is}} based on analysis of what has already transpired in markets that are perpetually evolving. In Collateral Knowledge, Annelise Riles disrupts the Hayekian critique {{of financial}} regulation. She presents collateral in derivatives markets as a technique and an aesthetic practice and then contends that state actors also can deploy private actors’ techniques in response to the temporal nature of markets. There is nothing inherently private about the methods of self-governance that private actors use to accommodate temporality. This review (i) describes Riles’s conception of <b>swap</b> <b>collateral,</b> and (ii) offers a framework for vetting her contentions about financial regulation, using examples of legal techniques from the securitization context...|$|R
40|$|Conditional {{performance}} guarantees with risky collaterals {{are specific}} bonding instruments {{that are not}} credit extensions or require only a service fee. Instead, they resemble a credit default swap (CDS) that is essentially an insurance contract and can thus be priced accordingly. A CDS-based model is proposed here for pricing these instruments. The model incorporates both contractor default probability and the recovery risk of collateral. It also allows for explicit specification of bonding parameters such as the promised amount of payment {{in the event of}} default. For model implementation, a quasi-KMV-Merton approach is proposed for the estimation of contractor default probability. The historical market prices and basic accounting data of publicly traded construction firms in the Taiwan Economic Journal Database (TEJD) are used to test the model. The model demonstrates effective statistical power to distinguish categorized samples of the firms. It shows that the current industrial practice of asking a standard service rate of 1 % tends to charge too little for financially distressed firms and too much for normal ones.
