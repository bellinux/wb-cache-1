40|$|The {{performance}} of OFDM systems (e. g. IEEE 802. 11 g system) can severely degrade due to partial band interference (e. g. from Bluetooth devices). Therefore, we propose a novel <b>cross</b> <b>coding</b> {{scheme based on}} erasure codes {{to mitigate the effect}} of partial band jamming (PBJ). The key element of this coding scheme is to discard the part of channel that is corrupted by PBJ. By transmitting a packet over a single sub-carrier, the original data can be reconstructed with the assistance of erasure codes. In comparison with the Wiener beamforming technique, the proposed coding scheme has a power gain (i. e. at least 50 % power saving) in the wireless receiver, and also has a performance gain in terms of the corrupted bandwidth and SIR. At SIR = 0 dB, it endures 1 MHz larger corrupted bandwidth than using beamforming, allowing one more Bluetooth device to coexist with the IEEE 802. 11 g system. Furthermore, it has a SIR gain of around 4 dB over the beamforming algorithm when only one Bluetooth interferes the IEEE 802. 11 g system (i. e. the corrupted bandwidth = 1 MHz) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{wireless}} OFDM-based systems, coding jointly {{over all}} the sub-carriers simultaneously performs better than coding separately per sub-carrier. However, the joint coding is not always optimal because its achievable channel capacity (i. e. the maximum data rate) is inversely proportional to the dynamic range of the channel. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>cross</b> <b>coding</b> scheme to increase the maximum data rate (i. e. the noise floor) achieved in frequency selective channels. The proposed OEC-II is based on fountain codes. The key element in OEC-II is to exchange the modulation order with the discarded subcarriers. In such case, the system can increase the noise floor by only {{taking care of the}} sub-carriers with high energy. By transmitting a fountain-encoded packet over a single sub-carrier, the packets can be discarded if they have encountered a low-energy channel. Fountain codes can recover the source data by only using the surviving packets. With the same effective transmission data rate (i. e. 10. 8 Mbits/s), OEC-II with QAM- 16 has a SNR gain of around 7 dB over the FEC layer from the IEEE 802. 11 a standard, around 8 dB over the FEC layer from the IEEE 802. 11 n standard, around 7 dB over OEC-II with QPSK and around 3 dB over OEC-II with QAM- 64...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} the obersvation-reaction time of pedestrians at uncontrolled crossing locations such as where pedestrian routes cross a carriageway, and near institutional and commercial complexes, bus stops and uncontrolled junctions. It Is intended to be of assistance in the analysis and geometric design of roads, pedestrian crossings, and operational features. The principles described may also apply to controlled crossings and pedestrian facilities in general. The concept embodies the measuring and recording of 'minimum required' values of observation-reaction time when the pedestrian is not pressured into possibly hurried or incomplete observations due {{to the presence of}} vehicular traffic, but who otherwise completes the observations as quickly as possible. This differs from concepts of pedestrian 'delay' and 'gap acceptance' times measured under actual site conditions which may reflect hurried decisions, and the absence in sampling of pedestrians who may be deterred from crossing due to traffic or infrastructure-related concerns. The concept includes consideration of pedestrians' saccadic head movements, focussing, and a reaction time up to the point of starting to walk across the carriageway. The Green <b>Cross</b> <b>Code</b> is adopted as a commonly understood, repeatable, sequence of actions used to determine a minimum yet complete observation process. The study indicates that the 85 th percentile total time to fully but expeditiously observe the Green <b>Cross</b> <b>Code</b> for a two-way carriageway can take up to nearly 4 seconds for a mature adult with no disability. Implications for sightline locations and distances, intervisibility, and differingcategories of pedestrian are addressed briefly, together with suggestions for further investigations...|$|R
