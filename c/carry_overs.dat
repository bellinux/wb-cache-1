5000|$|H1C had CDI {{ignition}} {{instead of}} points as found on an H1B, and a front drum brake {{as opposed to}} the disk brake on the H1B model. The H1C carried over the stainless fenders from 1971 along with the complete fork assembly and gauge style. Engines and exhaust were also <b>carry</b> <b>overs</b> from the 1971 model making it a true hybrid of the new 72 H1B and the 71 H1 models.|$|E

50|$|Changes {{included}} the front grille, {{that would become}} the shape of all future Aston Martin models, a new instrument panel, and available Girling disc brakes. The hydraulically operated clutch was new as well, and an optional Laycock-de Normanville overdrive that {{was attached to the}} STD 4 speed gearbox after the 1st 100 cars or even an automatic transmission were available. Worm-and-sector steering and a live axle rear end were <b>carry</b> <b>overs.</b> At the rear, the DB2/4 Mark II's tailfins (after the 1st few early cars) were altered to use the rear lights from the Humber Hawk.|$|E

40|$|Task {{demands that}} {{influence}} scanning behaviour in one task can cause that behaviour to persist {{to a second}} unrelated task (<b>carry</b> <b>over).</b> This can also affect performance on a second task (e. g., hazard perception ratings), and {{has been attributed to}} a process of attentional bias that is modulated by top-down influences (Thompson & Crundall, 2011). In a series of experiments we explored how these top-down influences impact upon <b>carry</b> <b>over.</b> In all experiments, participants searched letters that were presented horizontally, vertically, or in a random array. They were then presented with a driving scene and rated the hazardousness of the scene. <b>Carry</b> <b>over</b> of eye-movements from the letter search to the scene was observed in all experiments. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect influenced hazard perception accuracy. The magnitude of <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> was correlated with task switching abilities, attentional conflicting, and attentional orienting (Experiment 1), and was affected by predictability of the primary task (Experiment 2). Furthermore, direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal areas affected the magnitude of the effect (Experiment 3). These results indicate that <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> is modulated by the specific ability to orient attention and disengage from this orientation. Over orienting leads to increased <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> and insufficient task switching is detrimental to task performance. As a result the current experiments provide evidence that the <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect is strongly influenced by attentional processes, namely orienting, inhibition, and task switching...|$|R
5000|$|The PS2000 {{achieved}} {{important changes}} to resource management and budgets that increased flexibility and efficiency. Single operating budgets were introduced which allowed for better efficiency and even delegating discretion of spending to front-line units. Year-end <b>carry</b> <b>overs</b> were also increased from 2% to 5% which reduced departmental stress {{to use up}} all funds {{before the end of}} the year. As well, departments were allowed to retain either part or all of the funds they generated as a way to encourage cost-recovery, although this is not the case for all departments so that budgets do not fluctuate on the basis of a departments ability to generate revenue. The PS2000 also proposed multi-year budgets and increasing the threshold for establishing votes, but these recommendations were never implemented.|$|E
