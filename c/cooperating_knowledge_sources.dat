This paper describes experiences gained while successfully applying this architecture {{to the problem of}} speech understanding. The major conclusions are: 1. The paradigm of viewing problem solving in terms of hypothesize-and-test actions distributed among distinct representations of the problem {{has been shown to be}} computationally feasible. 2. A global working memory (the &quot;blackboard&quot;), in which the distinct representations are integrated in a uniform manner, has made it convenient to construct and integrate the individual sources of knowledge needed for the problem solution. 3. The use of a uniform data-directed structure for controlling knowledge-source activity has made the system easy to understand and modify. 4. A solution has been demonstrated to the problem of focusof-attention in this type of control environment. This solution does not need to be modified when the sources of knowledge in the system are changed...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{control in}} a {{multi-level}} <b>cooperating</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>source</b> problem solver (such as Hearsay-II) requires {{the system to}} reason about the relationships among competing and <b>cooperating</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>source</b> (KS) instantiations (both past and potential) that are working on different aspects and levels of the problem. Such reasoning is needed to assess {{the current state of}} problem solving and to develop plans for using the system's limited processing resources to the best advantage. The relationships among KS instantations can be naturally represented when KS activity is viewed simultaneously from a data-directed and a goal-directed perspective. In this paper we show how data- and goal-directed control can be integrated into a single, uniform framework, and we present an example and experimental results of sophisticated focusing using this framework. ...|$|R

The breadth of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> refers to the amount of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> used within the firm. The depth of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> is the amount of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> intensively used by the firm. This study is aimed at answering the following questions. a) What <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> are mainly used? b) What type of innovation is frequently conducted? c) What are the effects of the breadth and the depth of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> on the innovation capabilities among Indonesian restaurants and cafés? The resource-based view and resource dependency theory are used to understand the role of internal and external knowledge on innovation within a firm. We distributed a semi-structured questionnaire to 101 owners/managers, using a purposive, in several cities in Indonesia, such as Bandung, Denpasar Bogor, Malang, Yogyakarta and other cities in East Java.

40|$|There {{have been}} few results {{regarding}} unique issues of verification and validation of blackboard-based systems. This paper attempts to mitigate this limitation in the literature by focusing on a particular blackboard architecture. In solution-based focusing blackboard systems, problem solving starts by specifying {{that one of the}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> be instantiated and then iteratively different <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources,</b> typically based on order, are chosen for assistance in developing a solution.

The extant literature primarily examines the causal relationship between external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> and product innovation performance or to identify factors which moderates the relationship between external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> and product innovation. Non-technological innovations, such as organization and marketing innovations, intervene {{in the process of}} external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> to product innovation to market performance but has not been extensively examined.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address the {{limitations}} of prior views regarding <b>knowledge</b> <b>source</b> exploitation by proposing a phenomenological approach to managerial attention and the antecedents of exploiting <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> within the multinational corporations (MNC) network. Design/methodology/approach: A phenomenological approach to attention is taken to explain the antecedents of managerial attention in <b>knowledge</b> <b>source</b> exploitation behavior. This approach provides an alternative way of conceiving of <b>knowledge</b> <b>source</b> remoteness and familiarity, on the one hand, and exclusion and inclusion on the other. Findings: Drawing on a phenomenological approach to attention, the merits and limits of prior studies of attention and knowledge seeking/exchange behavior are addressed and three modes of managerial attention are proposed - relative attention, mimetic attention, implicit attention - to explain the antecedents of managerial attention to MNC <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources.</b> Originality/value: This approach to <b>knowledge</b> <b>source</b> exploitation and attention provides a rich conceptualization of taken-for-granted assumptions in extant literature on managerial attention and knowledge-seeking behavior.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{development}} of embedded systems the context is of vital importance, as embedded systems interact with the context through sensing and actuation. Information about the system’s context is contained within different <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> and must be elicited and negotiated during embedded systems development. Examples for such <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> may be: laws, standards, internal process specification, systems in operation as well as stakeholders.

Therefore, this paper sketches an approach that addresses the documentation of the context of knowledge, to make <b>knowledge</b> about the <b>sources</b> of contextual information comprehensibly persistent.

They also represent the beginning of a process of exploitation which may result in an improvement in the performance of the innovating business. This recursive process of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing,</b> transformation and exploitation comprises the innovation value chain. Modelling the innovation value chain for a large group of manufacturing firms in Ireland and Northern Ireland highlights the drivers of innovation, productivity and firm growth. In terms of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing,</b> we find strong complementarity between horizontal, forwards, backwards, public and internal <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> activities. Each of these forms of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> also makes a positive contribution to innovation in both products and processes although public <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> have only an indirect effect on innovation outputs. In the exploitation phase, innovation in both products and processes contribute positively to company growth, with product innovation having a short-term 'disruption' effect on labour productivity. Modelling the complete innovation value chain highlights the structure and complexity of the process of translating knowledge into business value and emphasises the role of skills, capital investment and firms' other resources in the value creation process.
