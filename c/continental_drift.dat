5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year.

5|$|The {{publication}} of Alfred Wegener's (1880–1930) theory of <b>continental</b> <b>drift</b> 1912 gave additional impetus to comparative physiology {{and the study}} of biogeography while ecology in the 1930s contributed the important ideas of plant community, succession, community change, and energy flows. From 1940 to 1950 ecology matured to become an independent discipline as Eugene Odum (1913–2002) formulated many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, emphasising relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) as key factors in the field. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of the geography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E

50|$|Plume {{tectonics}} is a geophysical {{theory that}} finds {{its roots in}} the mantle doming concept (which did not accept major plate movements and <b>continental</b> <b>drifting)</b> which was especially popular during the 1930s, and survived throughout the seventies up till today in various forms and presentations. It has slowly evolved into a concept that recognises and accepts large scale plate motions such as envisaged by plate tectonics, but placing them in a framework where large mantle plumes are the major driving force of the system.|$|R
5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of <b>continental</b> <b>drift</b> in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of <b>continental</b> <b>drift,</b> the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is {{overwhelmingly}} oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the sundew genus {{stretches}} from Alaska in the north to New Zealand in the south. The centers of diversity are Australia, with roughly 50% of all known species, and South America and southern Africa, each with more than 20 species. A few species are also found in large parts of Eurasia and North America. These areas, however, can be considered to form {{the outskirts of the}} generic range, as the ranges of sundews do not typically approach temperate or Arctic areas. Contrary to previous supposition, the evolutionary speciation of this genus is no longer thought to have occurred with the breakup of Gondwana through <b>continental</b> <b>drift.</b> Rather, speciation is now thought to have occurred {{as a result of a}} subsequent wide dispersal of its range. The origins of the genus are thought to have been in Africa or Australia.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} study of water and Earth's water cycle is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is oceanography. This began as {{the study of the}} shape of the ocean's currents but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field: it examines the properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies marine life. The subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as physical oceanography. Marine biology (biological oceanography) studies the plants, animals, and other organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. Both are informed by chemical oceanography, which studies the behavior of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing acidification of seawater. Marine and maritime geography charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological oceanography) has provided evidence of <b>continental</b> <b>drift</b> and the composition and structure of the Earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{plays a part}} in {{the water}} cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the {{atmosphere}} as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain or snow) again, and then largely returns to the sea. Even in the Atacama Desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca blow in from the sea and support plant life. In large land masses, geologic features can block the access of some regions to the main sea. These endorheic basins, particularly in central Asia, sometimes build up permanent salt lakes as inflowing waters evaporate and their dissolved minerals accumulate over time. The largest of these is the Caspian Sea, although it is sometimes counted as a proper sea owing to its basin of (now-landlocked) oceanic crust. Other notable examples include the Aral Sea in central Asia and the Great Salt Lake in the western United States. The waters of these basins still eventually return to the sea through evaporation, the flow of ground water, and (over geologic time) the opening up of the basins by <b>continental</b> <b>drift.</b>|$|E

25|$|The British {{geologist}} Arthur Holmes {{championed the}} theory of <b>continental</b> <b>drift</b> {{at a time when}} it was deeply unfashionable.

25|$|However, {{his ideas}} were not taken seriously by many geologists, who {{pointed out that}} there was no {{apparent}} mechanism for <b>continental</b> <b>drift.</b> Specifically, they did not see how continental rock could plow through the much denser rock that makes up oceanic crust.

40|$|Abstract Background Microhylidae is a {{geographically}} widespread {{family of}} anurans. Although several extensive molecular analyses {{have attempted to}} elucidate their subfamilial relationships, and correlate these with Mesozoic and Cenozoic <b>continental</b> <b>drifts,</b> consensus has not been reached. Further, generic level relationships have not been well investigated in some microhylid subfamilies, and therefore subfamilial affiliations of some genera are still unclear. To elucidate the phylogenetic positions of two mysterious Asian genera, Gastrophrynoides and Phrynella, and {{to better understand the}} trans-continental distributions of microhylid taxa, we performed molecular phylogenetic and dating analyses using the largest molecular dataset applied to these taxa to date. Results Six nuclear and two mitochondrial genes (approx. 8 kbp) were sequenced from 22 microhylid frog species representing eight subfamilies. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses could not fully elucidate the subfamilial relationships, suggesting a rapid radiation of these taxa between 85 and 66 million years ago. In contrast, generic relationships of Asian microhylines were generally well resolved. Conclusion Our results clearly showed that one of two problematic Asian genera, Phrynella, was nested in the clade of the Asian subfamily Microhylinae. By contrast, Gastrophrynoides occupied the most basal position of the Australian-New Guinean subfamily Asterophryinae. The estimated divergence of Gastrophrynoides from other asterophryine was unexpectedly around 48 million years ago. Although a colonization scenario via Antarctica to the Australian-New Guinean landmass has been suggested for Asterophryinae, our finding suggested a novel colonization route via Indo-Eurasia. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{convection}} of the Earth's mantle is {{a chaotic}} process (in {{the sense of}} fluid dynamics), which {{is thought to be}} an integral part of the motion of plates. Plate motion should not be confused with <b>continental</b> <b>drift</b> which applies purely to the movement of the crustal components of the continents. The movements of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle are coupled since descending lithosphere is an essential component of convection in the mantle. The observed <b>continental</b> <b>drift</b> is a complicated relationship between the forces causing oceanic lithosphere to sink and the movements within Earth's mantle.|$|E

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{representation of}} gravity and magnetic fields shows that the mathematical expressions describing these fields {{are the result of}} the convolution of factors which depend on the geometry of the causative body, the physical properties of the body and the type of field being observed. If a field is known then it is possible to remove or alter these factors to map other fields or physical parameters which are linearly related to the observed field. The transformations possible are: continuation, reduction to the pole, converting between gravity and magnetic fields, converting between components of measurement, calculation of derivatives and mapping magnetization and density distributions and relief on interfaces. Digital Wiener filters, designed using a least squares error criterion, provide an accurate method for effecting these transformations If the field to be transformed is contaminated by noise anomalies, Whose average autocorrelation function can be estimated, then the Wiener filter can be optimized to suppress this noise. The British Isles resulted, in Lower Palaeozoic times, from the collision of two continental masses.

30|$|The WCMI {{is made up}} of the Kutch, Cambay and Narmada rift basins that {{developed}} during the breakup of the Indian continent from Gondwanaland during the Mesozoic era. These basins were formed by rifting along with the three major Precambrian tectonic trends of western India, Dharwar (NNW–SSE), Aravalli–Delhi (NE–SW) and Satpura (ENE–WSW), that controlled the tectonic style of the basins, and these rifting events were synchronous with the major events of Indian <b>continental</b> <b>drifting</b> history (Biswas 1982, 1987 and references therein). These trends can be seen as metamorphic belts, which represent the three major orogenic cycles. The Aravalli–Delhi and Dharwar trends represent the oldest orogenic cycle and are followed by the Satpura. The Narmada-Son lineament developed along the Satpura trend by dividing the Indian shield into two blocks. The NNW–SSE Dharwar trend swings eastwards and syncs with the ENE–WSW Precambrian orogenic trends. The extension of the NNW–SSE trend parallel to the WCMI {{in the western part of}} the peninsular Indian shield led to the formation of the Cambay basin during the Mesozoic period. Though the formation of the basin took place during the Mesozoic, the Cambay basin is named a Tertiary basin because of its higher rate of subsidence during the Tertiary. The NNW–SSE-trending Cambay rift basin extends from Barmer in the north to the offshore region in the south (Gupta 1981). Initially, the basin started rifting perpendicular to the eastern and western faults, which formed parallel to the axis of the basin. The rift is wider on its southern side and narrow in the northern Barmer and Sanchore regions. The NE–SW Aravalli–Delhi trend splits into three directional components in the western margin of India. The main NE–SW Aravalli trend continues across the Cambay basin into Saurashtra, while the Delhi trend swings E–W by forming a series of step faults, continuing into the Kutch basin. The third component bends counterclockwise and merges with the ENE–WSW Satpura trend.|$|R

The oceanic basins that surround the Seychelles - Amirante region are of various ages and reflect a complex seafloor spreading pattern. The structural analysis of the Seychelle - Amirante - Mascarene region reflects the tectonic evolution of the western equatorial Indian Ocean. It is suggested that due to the seafloor spreading during a tectonic stage, the Seychelles <b>continental</b> block <b>drifted</b> southwestwards to collide with the oceanic crust of the Mascarene Basin, forming an elongated folded structure at first, and then a subduction zone.

[...] The currents were even shown to be stronger than they are today, shortening the rafting time to approximately 30 days or less, making the crossing much easier for a small mammal. [...] Over time, as the <b>continental</b> plates <b>drifted</b> northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed.|$|R

40|$|The climate {{record of}} glacially transported sediments in prograded wedges around the Antarctic outer {{continental}} shelf, and their derivatives in <b>continental</b> rise <b>drifts,</b> {{may be combined}} to produce an Antarctic ice sheet history, using numerical models of ice sheet response to temperature and sea-level change. Examination of published models suggests several preliminary conclusions about ice sheet history. The ice sheet's present high sensitivity to sea-level change at short (orbital) periods was developed gradually as its size increased, replacing a declining sensitivity to temperature. Models suggest that the ice sheet grew abruptly to 40 % (or possibly more) of its present size at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary, mainly {{as a result of}} its own temperature sensitivity. A large but more gradual middle Miocene change was externally driven, probably by development of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Polar Front, provided that a few million years' delay can be explained. The Oligocene ice sheet varied considerably in size and areal extent, but the late Miocene ice sheet was more stable, though significantly warmer than today's. This difference probably relates to the confining effect of the Antarctic continental margin. Present-day numerical models of ice sheet development are sufficient to guide current sampling plans, but sea-ice formation, polar wander, basal topography and ice streaming can be identified as factors meriting additional modelling effort in the future...|$|R
