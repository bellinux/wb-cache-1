Indeed, marine ascaridoids are the etiological agents of the fish-borne zoonosis anisakidosis. Due to an increase of new cases reported worldwide, a continuous monitoring of infection in fish is mandatory. The study was aimed to evaluate the risk of infection by larval ascaridoids in fishes from Mediterranean Sea. Two species of fishes among those representing a major potential threat for human health were selected. Epidemiological and molecular study was carried out. At Milan Fish Market, Italy, 179 anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) and 84 <b>chub</b> <b>mackerels</b> (Scomber colias) caught in different fishing areas in the Mediterranean Sea were sampled and inspected {{for the presence of}} larvae.

50|$|Blue {{mackerel}} {{are often}} mistaken for <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel.</b> In fact, blue mackerel {{were believed to}} be a subspecies of <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> until the late 1980s. Though they are both in the same genus (Scomber), blue mackerel set themselves apart by differing structural genes than those of the <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel.</b> Other, more obvious, characteristics set these two apart, like the longer anal spine of the blue mackerel, and the amount of the first dorsal spines. Mackerels have a round body that narrows into the tail after the second dorsal fin, similar to a tuna fish.The blue mackerel is known as a voracious and indiscriminate feeder, and they devour microscopic plankton and krill, live anchovy, engulf dead cut bait, and strike readily on lures and other flies. When in a school and in a feeding frenzy, they will strike at nonfood items such as cigarette butts and even bare hooks. While relatively small in size, pound for pound, mackerel score high for their fighting ability.Blue mackerel are carnivores, eating smaller fish in their same region of the upper layer of the ocean, the pelagic zone. Due to their eating habits and their diurnal lifestyles, blue mackerel have adapted a higher sensitivity in their retinas, allowing better eyesight even during the night to catch their prey. Another adaptation of blue mackerels is their eye size. They typically have larger eyes than herbivores in their same region.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{school like}} Atlantic mackerel, and their feeding habits are much the same, eating {{the same species}} of pelagic {{crustaceans}} and Sagittae that the mackerel had taken {{at the same time}} and place, while specimens taken at Woods Hole ate chiefly copepods, to a lesser extent on amphipods, salps, appendicularians, and young herring. They follow thrown bait as readily and bite quite as greedily as Atlantic mackerel do. Their breeding habits have not been studied.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> is a long, {{streamlined}} {{fish with}} a deeply forked tail.

50|$|The Humboldt current {{produces}} some of {{the most}} successful commercial fisheries in the world. The major catches include: sardines, anchovies, mackerel, hake, and squid. Three major stocks of anchoveta are distributed between 4’S and 42’S within the HCS.  North-Central Peru’s fishery is primarily composed of one stock of anchoveta. Sardines, <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and bonito are also common catches, but not as prominent, in Peru. Southern Peru and Northern Chile host a major sardine fishery. Other common stocks include: a second anchoveta stock, jack mackerel, tuna, and swordfish. Anchoveta, jack mackerel, and sardines are the primary commercial stocks in central Chile.|$|E
50|$|The {{coasts of}} the Yellow Sea are very densely populated, at {{approximately}} 250 /km2. The sea waters {{had been used}} for fishing by the Chinese, Korean and Japanese ships for centuries.

5000|$|The <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> has a {{well-developed}} {{swim bladder}} attached with the esophagus, which the [...] "true mackerels" [...] in the Scomber genus lack, and a characteristic color difference is seen between the chub and the Atlantic chub, {{the latter being}} silvery-sided below the midline, whereas {{the lower part of}} the sides of the chub (otherwise colored somewhat like the Atlantic) are mottled with small dusky blotches, and the chub has a larger eye than the Atlantic. Less obvious differences are that the dorsal fins are closer together in the chub and only 9 or 10 spines are in its first dorsal fin instead of 11 or more, which is the usual count in the Atlantic mackerel. In most species, the mackerel is known to travel in large schools. It is a smaller fish than its better-known relatives, growing to a length around 8 to 14 in.|$|E
50|$|Living marine {{resources}} covered by SEAFO including fish (such as orange roughy Hoplostethus atlanticus, alfonsino Beryx splendens, Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, hake Merluccius paradoxus, horse mackerel Trachurus capensis, <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> Scomber japonicus, cardinalfishes Epigonus species, oreo dories and armourhead Pseudopentaceros species, some shark species and rays), molluscs (such as octopus and squid) and crustaceans (such as {{deep sea red crab}} Chaceon maritae). Some {{of the most}} notable commercially important species are orange roughy, alfonsino - harvested by bottom trawling, and deep sea red crab - capture by pots or traps and Patagonian toothfish caught by longlining. Highly migratory fish stocks such as tuna, swordfish, marlin and sharks in the region are covered by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Most of SEAFO fish resources are found in deep waters (greater than 500 m depth) and tend to be slow grower, long-lived, late-matured and therefore could be vulnerable to over-exploitation. Their biological and ecological dynamics are not well known and there are no good historic time series.|$|E

Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery.

[...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|E

40|$|In {{the northwestern}} Pacific area, the fish {{alternation}} phenomena amongst sardine, anchovy and <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{have been observed}} in the cycle of about fifty years. The sardine biomass has been drastically increased in 1930 s and 1980 s. <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> biomass has in 1970 s, and anchovy has in 1960 s and 1990 s. It has been gradually clear that these phenomena are as a biological response to the atmospheric and oceanographic regime shifts. In order to derive fisheries management theory under these situations, we analyzed the inter-relationships amongst resource dynamics of the species, economic dynamics of purse seine fishery, and fisheries production. We found that the intensive capital investment during the sardineabundant periods (1980 s) had became economic burden after sudden declines of sardine in 1990 s, and prevent the broom of <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> in 2000 s. In order to discuss management options which take species alternation into account, we estimated the effects of hypothetical governmental interventions around the sardine-abundant period (1980 s) in terms of fish biomass, economic efficiency, and food supply in the later years...|$|E

The distribution and dynamics of <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) are compared and species interactions are discussed. From 2007 to 2009, <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> biomass, as measured acoustically, ranged between 69000 and 238000 t concentrated off the western coast (~ 50 %) and in the Gulf of Cadiz (~ 30 %). Portuguese landings have varied with periods of high landings around 1970 and in recent years. Since 1986 landings have been between 4000 and 23000 t. Both survey catches and commercial landings are taken mainly off the southwestern coast and one- to two-year-old individuals (20 - 24 cm) predominate in both. Scarcity of larger individuals may be a consequence of their deeper distribution and avoidance of fishing gear, migration of older individuals {{or a combination of}} both. In years with high abundance, the fishery expands to the northwestern areas of the Iberian Peninsula. The expansion appears to be caused by improved recruitment although other factors might have contributed (such as targeting to compensate for low sardine catches and the appearance of new markets). The complementary spatial distribution of <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> and sardine and the inverse correlations between their frequency of occurrence, landings and recruitment indices suggest some interaction between the dynamics of the two species, possibly associated with climatic variation...|$|E
