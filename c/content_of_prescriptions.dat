40|$|Objective: To {{learn how}} physicians' {{prescribing}} habits {{contribute to the}} rational use of medicine (RUM). We investigated the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> written out in different provinces. Material and Method: A total of 3201 prescriptions written in Bartin, Bayburt, Cankiri, Denizli, Eskisehir, Gumushane, Karabuk, Kirsehir, Nevsehir and Nigde were collected from pharmacies. Prescriptions were analyzed using some indicators such as average number of medicines per-prescription (NMPP), average cost per-prescription (CPP) etc. Prescriptions indicating anxiety, hypertension, osteoarthritis, acute (A) otitis media, A. sinusitis, A. tonsillopharyngitis, A. cystitis, diabetes mellitus, dyspepsia and A. diarrhea were evaluated by provinces. Results: Except in three provinces, respiratory drugs were the most commonly written agents. NMPP was highest in Denizli (3. 21 ± 0. 95), lowest in Cankiri (2. 65 ± 1. 09). CPP was highest in Denizli (133. 35 ± 650. 92 TRL), lowest in Bartin (42. 54 ± 49. 91 TRL). As for gold standard-compatibility, the prescribed medicines in 4 / 10 indications seemed better in Cankiri and Gumushane. Injections, antibiotics, analgesics and gastroprotectives were most commonly prescribed in Denizli (14. 1 %), Kirsehir (43. 3 %), Gumushane (48. 1 %) and Bayburt (19. 8 %) respectively. Conclusion: In the provinces, there were substantial differences in the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions.</b> Generally, rational drug prescribing performance was found quite low. These findings {{should be considered in}} the activities to the extension of RUM. (Marmara Medical Journal 2011; 24 : 160 - 71...|$|E

40|$|Statements about fictional characters, such as “Gregor Samsa {{has been}} changed into a beetle,” pose {{the problem of how}} we can say {{something}} true (or false) using empty names. I propose an original solution to this problem that construes such utterances as reports of the “prescriptions to imagine” generated by works of fiction. In particular, I argue that we should construe these utterances as specifying, not what we are supposed to imagine—the propositional object of the imagining—but how we are supposed to imagine. Most other theories of thought and discourse about fictional characters either fail to capture the intentionality of our imaginings, or else obscure the differences between imaginings directed toward fictional characters and those directed toward real individuals. I argue that once we have an account <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> to imagine about real individuals, we can adapt the same framework to specify the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> to imagine about fictional characters, and thereby to account for the truth (or falsity) of statements about fictional characters...|$|R

30|$|The <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> a <b>prescription</b> are {{influenced}} by a prescribers’ training, their attitude towards the disease being treated {{and the type of}} healthcare system within which they work. The results of the current study revealed that the average number <b>of</b> drugs per <b>prescription</b> were 2.3 (SD =  1.3) (Table  1). This value is higher than the admissible range of 1.6 – 1.8 drugs per encounter. In contrast to our findings, the average number of drugs prescribed was lower in Malawi (1.8) (Gelders and World Health Organization 1992) and Zimbabwe (1.3) (Hogerzeil et al. 1993). However, the studies conducted in Afghanistan (3.9) (Ahmad et al. 1995) and India (5.6) (Akhtar et al. 2012) reported a relatively higher number <b>of</b> drugs per <b>prescription</b> which could be attributed to multiple reasons. Incompetency on the part of physicians, absence of evidence-based guidelines, incentives to the prescribers, lack of continuous medical education of the prescribers and the shortage of therapeutically correct drugs provide a few reasons. Having a higher number <b>of</b> drugs per <b>prescription</b> can adversely influence treatment outcomes as patients {{are more likely to be}} non-compliant and are at greater risk of interactions and adverse events. Moreover, prescribed medicines that are not warranted lead to fiscal implications for national healthcare systems including budget blowouts (Atif et al. 2016 b).|$|R
40|$|National audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{relevance}} of several pharmaceutical databases (PDBs) to be integrated in a computerized prescription system for hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty medical prescriptions were designed as tests. They were supposed to answer to a security or a relevance assessment item. They were analyzed using four French PDBs (Claude-Bernard, Thériaque, Thésorimed, Vidal), available online. The outcome was the rate of conformity with the expected answers. RESULTS: The rate of conformity was: 31 % for Claude-Bernard, 30 % for Thériaque, 26 % for Vidal, and 20 % for Thésorimed (no statistical significance). DISCUSSION: The PDBs easily detect interactions between different pharmacological class drugs but redundancies and illogical situations are poorly intercepted. They seem to manage medicines only by the active ingredient, irrespective of the dose or the indication. The knowledge of the patient profile and the context are not really enriched by the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prescription.</b> CONCLUSION: The efficacy of these PDB has to be improved...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{incorporate}} behavioural {{insights into}} the user-centred design <b>of</b> an inpatient <b>prescription</b> chart (Imperial Drug Chart Evaluation and Adoption Study, IDEAS chart) and to determine whether changes in the <b>content</b> and design <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> charts could influence prescribing behaviour and reduce prescribing errors. Design: A mixed-methods approach was taken in the development phase of the project; in situ simulation {{was used to evaluate}} the effectiveness of the newly developed IDEAS prescription chart. Setting: A London teaching hospital. Interventions/methods: A multimodal approach comprising (1) an exploratory phase consisting of chart reviews, focus groups and user insight gathering (2) the iterative design <b>of</b> the IDEAS <b>prescription</b> chart and finally (3) testing of final chart with prescribers using in situ simulation. Results: Substantial variation was seen between existing inpatient prescription charts used across 15 different UK hospitals. Review <b>of</b> 40 completed <b>prescription</b> charts from one hospital demonstrated a number of frequent prescribing errors including illegibility, and difficulty in identifying prescribers. Insights from focus groups and direct observations were translated into the design of IDEAS chart. In situ simulation testing revealed significant improvements in prescribing on the IDEAS chart compared with the prescription chart currently in use in the study hospital. Medication orders on the IDEAS chart were significantly more likely to include correct dose entries (164 / 164 vs 166 / 174; p= 0. 0046) as well as prescriber's printed name (163 / 164 vs 0 / 174; p< 0. 0001) and contact number (137 / 164 vs 55 / 174; p< 0. 0001). Antiinfective indication (28 / 28 vs 17 / 29; p< 0. 0001) and duration (26 / 28 vs 15 / 29; p< 0. 0001) were more likely to be completed using the IDEAS chart. Conclusions: In a simulated context, the IDEAS prescription chart significantly reduced a number of common prescribing errors including dosing errors and illegibility. Positive behavioural change was seen without prior education or support, suggesting that some common prescription writing errors are potentially rectifiable simply through changes in the <b>content</b> and design <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> charts...|$|R
40|$|As {{national}} resources for health decline, so dependence on inter{{national resources}} {{to finance the}} capital and recurrent costs is increasing.

The PLLR requires an evaluation of available information about a product's use in pregnancy and provides an opportunity to update labeling when new information about use of a vaccine in pregnancy becomes available. Implementation of the provisions articulated in the PLLR, as they apply to vaccine product labeling, will require close collaboration between FDA and the vaccine manufacturer for both currently licensed vaccines and those in development...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of cultural conformity on subjective well-being in Mauritius, with a specific focus on cultural prescriptions about success. Many studies show that cultural conformity has {{a positive effect on}} well-being, but few explore which factors, if any, mediate this effect and why. Most theorists suggest that cultural conformity boosts subjective well-being by generating more positive appraisals of the self and more positive interactions with others. However, this research examines the degree to which individuals 2 ̆ 7 motivational investment in cultural prescriptions mediates the link between conformity and well-being. Based on a field study conducted in Mauritius (2005 - 2006), this dissertation argues that the positive effects of cultural conformity depend on (1) the degree to which cultural prescriptions are internalized by individuals, and (2) the content and practical consequences of cultural traits, beliefs, and prescriptions for personal and group well-being. Results indicate that cultural conformity may positively (or negatively) affect well-being regardless of internalization when cultural prescriptions have practical and not just symbolic import. This research shows that conformity positively affects well-being when cultural prescriptions are adaptive in particular social and ecological contexts, indicating that the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>prescriptions</b> is an important mediating factor. These issues are explored in the unique social and cultural context of Mauritius, where ethnic and class distinctions arising from the island 2 ̆ 7 s colonial history offer an opportunity to examine variation in cultural conformity, internalization, and well-being. The results suggest a need to consider the content rather than just the symbolic importance <b>of</b> cultural <b>prescriptions</b> in future studies of conformity, social learning, and subjective well-being. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is concern}} {{regarding}} the irrational production, <b>prescription</b> and use <b>of</b> drugs in India. This study aimed {{to describe the}} quality <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> by medical practitioners, including both the layout <b>of</b> the <b>prescription</b> and the type and number of drugs prescribed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey <b>of</b> all <b>prescriptions</b> dispensed at a busy pharmacy {{in the state of}} Goa, India, was carried out over a consecutive seven-day period. Each prescription was rated {{on the basis of a}} priori and pilot-tested variable list. The prescriptions by private practitioners were compared with those from practitioners in the public healthcare system. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety prescriptions were collected. The majority (83. 9 &#x 0025;) were from private practitioners. The quality of the layout <b>of</b> the <b>prescriptions</b> was unsatisfactory: information to identify the practitioner was incomplete in more than a third <b>of</b> the <b>prescriptions</b> and information to identify the patient was incomplete in more than half. Clarity of written instructions on how to take the medicines was unsatisfactory in the majority <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions.</b> Polypharmacy was the norm, with more than half (52. 7 &#x 0025;) the prescriptions containing at least 3 medicines. Forty per cent <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> included a vitamin or tonic preparation and a quarter <b>of</b> the <b>prescriptions</b> included an antibiotic and an analgesic. Over 90 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> contained only branded medicines.

40|$|The {{media has}} the power to {{influence}} what gender norms people internalize. When prescription direct-to-consumer advertisements (DTCA) use gender stereotypes to market and sell drugs, dominant gender notions of what is appropriate are reinforced. While previous studies analyzed prescription DTCA and media reinforcements of gender stereotypes separately, this study added to the literature by addressing the intersection of these two fields. This study was <b>content</b> analysis <b>of</b> 152 <b>prescription</b> product advertisements in four magazines whose readership is highly gendered, Cosmopolitan, Family Circle, WIRED, and Popular Mechanics, from January 2014 to December 2014. Based on the theory of social constructionism and medicalization, this paper analyzed the types <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> products being advertised to women as compared to men and how these advertisements portrayed gender stereotypes through the status positions of the characters displayed. The results of this study indicated that prescriptions directed to Cosmopolitan’s readers were predominately for preventing pregnancy, relegating women’s health to reproduction issues. Prescription advertisements in Family Circle were for a diverse range of products aimed at a diverse patient population, which implies that women have the primary responsibility over not only their own health but also the health of other family members, including their children and even family pets. Only the magazines with predominantly female readership included mental health advertisements, which points towards the tendency of associating women with emotional problems. This bias may also reinforce stigmas associated with men seeking psychiatric help. Prescription drugs marketed directly to men had a higher percentage of lifestyle products than any other type <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> for both male-targeted magazines analyzed in this study. The findings indicate that the types <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs advertised to men reinforce stereotypical notions of masculinity through assertions that the medical maintenance of sexual prowess should be valued over treatments for other types of diseases. While 75 % of the men in WIRED were in paid professional status positions, women’s status positions more frequently portrayed them as multiple status positions, with a substantial number of advertisements associating women with motherhood.

MethodsLiterature review on the relevant articles/material with the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the nurse's right <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> home and abroad. Semi-structured depth interview method was used to interview 18 experts on whether the nurses can participate in the graded nursing decision and whether nurses with certain ability can make the decision. Using the self-made questionnaire “Nurses involved in graded nursing decision-recognition questionnaire”, 553 nurses completed questionnaires on willingness to nurse decision-making grading. Using the analytic hierarchy process, the 23 experts' judgment on {{the main body of}} the graded nursing was rated. Using semi-structured depth interview method, 17 experts were interviewed on the graded nursing quality assessment and training outline. The form of expert personal judgment and the “grading nursing qualification experts predict questionnaire” were used as a preliminary designing tool, 32 experts were asked to predict the graded nursing quality. The relatively important factors that might promote implementation of right of Chinese nurse prescribing weights setting were obtained by analytic hierarchy process. Using Delphi method, 2 rounds of consultation to 291 experts/times were performed, and determined its content on the fields of graded nursing decision, nurses' job description, decision making nurse in graded nursing work process and related management system, decision-making main body of clinical nursing, nurse authority <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> application qualification, clinical nurses, diabetes specialist nurses, tumor specialist nurses, nurses in emergency department, community nurses in certain circumstances writing prescription, and nursing undergraduate added with nurse authority <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> related courses.

40|$|Background and purpose: Medical {{nutrition}} therapy at Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar consists <b>of</b> diet <b>prescription,</b> food labelling, food portion, and food serving. Nutrition assessment {{has been carried}} out based on the minimum service standards of Sanglah Hospital Denpasar in 2013, but agreement assessment of energy and protein contents has never been performed in the provision of medical {{nutrition therapy}}. The study was conducted to determine the compatibility of energy and protein <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the diet <b>prescription</b> until the food is served in hospitalized patients who received medical nutrition therapy at Sanglah Hospital Denpasar. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study involving 50 samples of food served with prescribed diet by clinical nutrition specialists at Sanglah Hospital selected by consecutive sampling. Data were collected using observation sheets filled by surveyors and analyzed using Bland Altman Test. Results: There was compatibility <b>of</b> the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> energy and protein in the provision of medical nutrition therapy <b>of</b> diet <b>prescription</b> with food labelling (energy r= 0. 43; p= 0. 04, protein r= 0. 48; p= 0. 02), food labelling with food portion (energy and protein r= 1. 00; p= 0. 00), food portion with the food serving (energy r= 0. 48; p= 0. 03, protein r= 0. 50; p= 0. 01), and from diet prescription until the food is served (energy r= 0. 52; p= 0. 04, protein r= 0. 57; p= 0. 02). Although there is a strong agreement, there is mean value difference which is clinically acceptable. Conclusion: Energy and protein content in the prescribed diet until the food is served at Sanglah Hospital were compatible. The medical nutrition therapy is appropriate and should be evaluated continuously {{to improve the quality of}} services at the tertiary level...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{normative}} {{economics is}} built {{on the assumption that}} people act as if seeking to satisfy coherent and a priori preferences. This model has however been challenged by many empirical works highlighting the existence of systematic deviations from the behaviour predicted by the neoclassical theory. The development of behavioural economics therefore questions the validity of the results developed by normative economists. Reconciling behavioural and normative economics needs in particular a clarification <b>of</b> the normative <b>content</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>prescriptions,</b> since it appears that the assumption of rational preferences enabled economists to overstep this question, the different interpretations of the current normative criterion of preference-satisfaction leading in fine to the same prescriptions. In this paper, we want to highlight that libertarian paternalism is probably the most natural solution to the reconciliation problem for neoclassical economists, since its current formulation relies on the existence of a rational homo oeconomicus trapped within each individual. We can however find within the current formulation of libertarian paternalism the same difficulties than the ones of Pareto's theory of the homo oeconomicus. We therefore suggest a reformulation of libertarian paternalism based on a normative criterion of individual autonomy rather than preference-satisfaction, and defend its relevance in the specific context of common-pool resources, by showing that the normative prescriptions generated by our principle of individual autonomy present strong similarities with the institutional design principles of Ostrom (1990) enabling a sustainable management of common-pool resources...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To give an {{overview}} of the data collection and <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the Norwegian <b>Prescription</b> Database (NorPD). In addition, key figures and results from different studies using data from NorPD are presented. Methods: From 1 st January 2004 the Norwegian Institute of Public Health receives monthly data on prescriptions dispensed and collected at all Norwegian pharmacies. Results: Overall, during the four year period (2004 - 2007) over 4. 2 million unique individuals have been recorded in NorPD with at least one prescription medication dispensed from a pharmacy. In each year about two-third of the entire Norwegian population had at least one prescription dispensed, 75 % of the women and 61 % of the men. The age-specific prevalence was lowest in both genders in those aged 10 - 14 years. Among 0 - 17 years old children and adolescents 45 % had one or more prescriptions issued in 2007. About 30 % of the girls and 38 % of the boys had a prescription issued before they were 1 year old. About 90 % of individuals aged 70 years and older received prescription medications. Conclusion: NorPD covers the entire nation, 4. 75 million inhabitants, and is a valid and reliable data source for studying use <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs. New areas for pharmacoepidemiological research in Norway are made possible with NorPD, like doing longitudinal studies and record-linkage studies with health surveys and other registers in Norway. It also clearly offers a sound basis of knowledge for national decisionmaking in the field of drug utilisation. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Research {{has so far}} not {{approached}} the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> corporate code of ethics from a strategic classification point of view. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} paper is to introduce and describe a framework of classification and empirical illustration to provide insights into the strategic approaches of corporate code <b>of</b> ethics <b>content</b> within and across contextual business environments. Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarizes the <b>content</b> analysis <b>of</b> code <b>prescription</b> and the intensity of codification in the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> 78 corporate codes of ethics in Australia. Findings - The paper finds that, generally, the studied corporate codes of ethics in Australia are of standardized and replicated strategic approaches. In particular, customized and individualized strategic approaches are far from penetrating the ethos of corporate codes <b>of</b> ethics <b>content.</b> Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to Australian codes of ethics. Suggestions for further research are provided in terms of the search for best practice of customized and individualized corporate codes <b>of</b> ethics <b>content</b> across countries. Practical implications - The framework contributes to an identification of four strategic approaches of corporate codes <b>of</b> ethics <b>content,</b> namely standardized, replicated, individualized and customized. Originality/value - The principal contribution of this paper is a generic framework to identify strategic approaches of corporate codes <b>of</b> ethics <b>content.</b> The framework is derived from two generic dimensions: the context of application and the application <b>of</b> <b>content.</b> The timing <b>of</b> application is also a crucial generic dimension to the success or failure of codes <b>of</b> ethics <b>content.</b> Empirical illustrations based upon corporate codes of ethics in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s top companies underpin the topic explored. <br /...|$|R
