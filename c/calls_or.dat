5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take telephone <b>calls</b> <b>or</b> look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her to go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E
5|$|Some {{practitioners}} of Falun Gong {{both inside and}} outside China are also involved in the promotion of the Tuidang movement, a dissident phenomenon catalyzed by an editorial series in The Epoch Times in late 2004. The movement encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, including ex post facto renunciations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. Practitioners of Falun Gong outside China make phone <b>calls</b> <b>or</b> faxes to mainland China to inform citizens of the movement and solicit renunciation statements.|$|E

In contrast, the philosophical concept of ma, which superficially describes the space between drum strikes, is also important in shaping rhythmic phrases and creating appropriate contrast.|$|E

30|$|Students in {{this study}} {{overwhelmingly}} reported that when instructors practiced cold <b>call</b> <b>or</b> random <b>call</b> in large-enrollment science courses, it only increased their anxiety and never decreased their anxiety. Thirty-two students (61.5 %) mentioned cold call during their interview. Thirty-one students (59.6 %) reported that cold <b>call</b> <b>or</b> random <b>call</b> increased their anxiety and one student (1.9 %) said it did not affect their anxiety. In contrast to the other active learning practices explored {{in this study}}, not a single student mentioned that cold <b>call</b> <b>or</b> random <b>call</b> could decrease their anxiety.|$|R
5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their <b>calls</b> <b>or</b> by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} its last album, in November 2008, Guns N' Roses {{released}} Chinese Democracy exclusively via the electronics retailer Best Buy. Rose did {{not contribute to the}} album's promotion; by December, he had reportedly been missing for at least two months and had not returned phone <b>calls</b> <b>or</b> other requests from his record label. In a subsequent interview, Rose stated that he felt he had not received the necessary support from Interscope Records. A year after the album's release, in December 2009, Guns N' Roses embarked on another two-and-a-half years of touring, including a headlining performance at Rock in Rio 4. Rose was subsequently sued by former band manager Irving Azoff, who sought $1.87million in unpaid fees related to the tour. In a countersuit, Rose alleged Azoff had deliberately mismanaged the band and their album's promotion to force him to join his former bandmates for a reunion tour. Both cases were settled. According to Rose in 2011, part of the settlement agreement dictated that Rose and the current Guns N' Roses had to do a number of performances with Azoff's company Live Nation as the promoter.|$|E

One notable feature of TEX was {{the ability to}} <b>call</b> <b>or</b> goto labels in other files.

25|$|The FidoNet {{system was}} best adapted to an {{environment}} in which local telephone service was inexpensive and long-distance <b>calls</b> (<b>or</b> intercity data transfer via packet-switched networks) costly. Therefore, it fared somewhat poorly in Japan, where even local lines are expensive, or in France, where tolls on local calls and competition with Minitel or other data networks limited its growth.|$|E
25|$|South West Trains had Quiet Zones, {{similar to}} the Quiet Coaches on trains {{operated}} by certain other Train Operating Companies. Quiet Zones are available on most outer-suburban services and on some express services and are indicated by notices in the windows and signs on the doors.

The show often references 1980s culture, using music and electronic devices from that era because many factors from the decade left a positive influence on Quintel. The show also makes references to modern social trends such as viral internet videos.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 25 November, {{resistance}} people got a few hours' notice before the scheduled arrests and deportation of all Jews in Norway. Many {{did their best to}} notify the remaining Jews who were not already detained, usually by making brief phone <b>calls</b> <b>or</b> short appearances on people's doorsteps. This was more successful in Oslo than other areas. Those who were warned only had a few hours to go into hiding and days to find {{their way out of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|Weill, {{shortly after}} graduating from Cornell University, got his first job on Wall Street in 1955 – as a runner for Bear Stearns. In 1956, he became a {{licensed}} broker at Bear Stearns. Rather than making phone <b>calls</b> <b>or</b> personal visits to solicit clients, Weill found he was far more comfortable sitting at his desk, poring through companies' financial statements and disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For weeks his only client was his mother, Etta, until Joan persuaded an ex-boyfriend to open a brokerage account.|$|E

25|$|Swallows {{are able}} to produce many {{different}} <b>calls</b> <b>or</b> songs, which are used to express excitement, to communicate with others of the same species, during courtship, or as an alarm when a predator is in the area. The songs of males {{are related to the}} body condition of the bird and are presumably used by females to judge the physical condition and suitability for mating of males. Begging calls are used by the young when soliciting food from their parents. The typical song of swallows is a simple, sometimes musical twittering.|$|E
25|$|The behavioral-based {{approach}} to detecting rootkits attempts to infer {{the presence of}} a rootkit by looking for rootkit-like behavior. For example, by profiling a system, differences in the timing and frequency of API <b>calls</b> <b>or</b> in overall CPU utilization can be attributed to a rootkit. The method is complex and is hampered by a high incidence of false positives. Defective rootkits can sometimes introduce very obvious changes to a system: the Alureon rootkit crashed Windows systems after a security update exposed a design flaw in its code. Logs from a packet analyzer, firewall, or intrusion prevention system may present evidence of rootkit behaviour in a networked environment.|$|E
25|$|Mobile phone use on {{aircraft}} {{is starting}} to be allowed with several airlines already offering {{the ability to use}} phones during flights. Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their in-plane announcements that this prohibition is due to possible interference with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics. The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even on planes that allow <b>calls</b> <b>or</b> messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.|$|E
