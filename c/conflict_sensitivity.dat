Efforts in post-conflict physical reconstruction and economic development, especially after 2009, demonstrate their positive capacity as well as their <b>conflict</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Although the Sri Lankan government initially had to be forced by international donors to include <b>conflict</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in its projects, more recently this has changed.

40|$|The associational {{sector has}} gained recent prominence, and {{scholars}} increasingly recognize the dualistic potential {{of civil society}} and social capital to promote either peace or violence. However, research to date gives {{little attention to the}} large proportion of associations that influence conflict unintentionally, as an externality produced during the pursuit of other goals. This emergent cluster of theory, which centers on the work of Robert Putnam and Ashutosh Varshney, tends to generalize the nature and causes of such externalities in ways that overlook associational complexity and dynamism. Therefore this thesis explores the applicability of <b>conflict</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> an organizational planning approach that originated in the humanitarian aid sector, for understanding and improving the social impact of religious associations in conflict-vulnerable multifaith societies. The author undertook action research with two local interfaith associations in Mindanao and Singapore to test the usage of the ‘Do No Harm’ <b>conflict</b> <b>sensitivity</b> framework among religious audiences in settings of ethno-religious conflict. More than 160 Protestant, Roman Catholic and Muslim leaders contributed empirically through participatory social analysis, surveys and interviews. The study finds that ‘Do No Harm’ holds relevance and usefulness for religious associations, yet it requires conceptual and practical adaptation of its impact analysis components. Further, while the data support the importance in existing theory of bridging or intercommunal associational structures, there is strong evidence that individual mindsets and intentional human agency are equally central in shaping associational impact. Further, the public prominence of religion in Southeast Asia contrasts with Western-influenced liberal democratic assumptions, exposing a ‘religion gap’ in existing associational theory. Religious culture is shown to be a major influence shaping the formation and incipient change of group identities through associational life. Thus it is argued that wherever religion plays a public role, it should be consistently integrated into studies of associational social impact...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores whether {{dialogue}} between {{a company and}} a non-profit organisation (NPO) can influence a company’s way of working towards being more conflict sensitive. As a case-study I analysed the {{dialogue between}} the French oil and gas company, Total S. A. (Total), and the US based NPO, CDA Collaborative Learning Projects (CDA) relating to the company’s operations in Myanmar/Burma. The objectives of the research were to ascertain if dialogue had a positive impact, and if so, {{what it was about}} the dialogue that enabled change, what was the process of change that could be observed and how embedded such change was. Drawing on post-modernism, systems thinking and complexity thinking, I have built on organisational change, conflict transformation, dialogue and cross-sector partnership literature to examine the role of dialogue as an enabler of change. While highlighting parallels in the discourses, I analyse the process and degree of change within the company through two conflict transformation models, one by Lederach (1997) and the other by Lederach, Neufeld and Culbertson (2007), which I feel best synthesise these parallels. The research is a longitudinal case-study (2002 - 2012), based on semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The study adds to the limited academic research on <b>conflict</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in general, and on the implications for a company’s way of working in particular. Although I find that within the business sector, the notion of <b>conflict</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is assumed in the wider concept of corporate social responsibility, noteworthy is the relevance of dialogue in change processes. Dialogue is an essential enabler as it sparks transformational levers also recognised in the literature reviewed. However it is not sufficient. The research illustrates that the dialogue between CDA and Total has {{played a critical role in}} facilitating a shift in the company’s way of working, with the contribution of other influences at play. As such, I draw attention to the complexity of the change process and discuss the current nature of the drivers of change within Total...|$|E

While much effort has been spent on identifying this limit, so-called redirected walking thresholds, these thresholds are more a general guideline than being personalized for each user. Since individuals' differences in perception play an important role in users's experience in a redirected VE, there is potential to optimize the thresholds using these differences. In this paper, we propose an investigation on the relationship between redirected walking thresholds (RDTs) and perception traits such as visual dependency, susceptibility to visual-vestibular <b>conflicts,</b> and <b>sensitivity</b> to internal body changes, which can be measured in postural sway, rod-and-frame, vection and interoception tests.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I attempt a {{critical}} {{examination of the}} multi-system or dual-process view of moral judgment. This view aims to provide a psychological explanation of moral sensitivity, and in particular an explanation of <b>conflicting</b> moral <b>sensitivities</b> in dilemma cases such as the crying baby scenario. I argue that proponents of the multi-system view owe us a satisfactory account of the mechanisms underlying “consequentialist” responses to such scenarios. For one thing, the “cognitive” processes involved in consequentialist reasoning only seem to play a subserving role {{with respect to the}} final judgment (providing non-moral inputs to judgment, or exerting additional strength to override the immediate “deontological” response). In this sense, Greene and colleagues fail to identify a peculiar system of moral judgment specularly opposed to the affective “deontological” one. For another, Greene and colleagues’ work on the emotion-cognition dichotomy and the distinction between alarm-bell and currency emotions, though promising, still falls short of providing an adequate and consistent picture of the psychological mechanisms underlying “cognitive” evaluations and verdicts in dilemma scenarios. It is suggested that alongside further experimental work, proponents of this view should {{pay more attention to the}} conceptual underpinnings of their distinctions...|$|R

The choice of a particular prior distribution to represent the available prior knowledge is, however, often debatable, especially when prior knowledge is limited or data are scarce, as then posterior inferences are highly dependent on the choice of prior. Robust Bayesian analysis accounts for this issue by inquiring whether posterior inferences change substantially when the prior distribution is varied within a set of distributions that contains all `reasonable' priors. Similar, but slightly different in scope, is the imprecise probability approach, formalising the idea that sets of probability distributions {{should be taken to}} model prior knowledge more accurately. Imprecise probability allows to model prior-data conflict sensitivity: Ranges of posterior inferences should be substantially larger when prior and data are in conflict.

40|$|The {{processes}} {{responsible for}} land surface subsidence in the Mississippi Delta (MD) have been vigorously debated. Numerous studies have postulated a dominant role for isostatic subsidence associated with sediment loading. Previous computational modeling of present-day vertical land motion {{has been carried}} out in order to understand geodetic data. While the magnitudes of these measured rates have been reproduced, the model parameter values required have often been extreme and, in some cases, unrealistic. In contrast, subsidence rates in the MD on the 103 [*]year timescale due to delta loading estimated from relative sea level reconstructions are an order of magnitude lower. In an attempt to resolve this <b>conflict,</b> a <b>sensitivity</b> analysis was carried out using a spherically symmetric viscoelastic solid Earth deformation model with sediment, ice, and ocean load histories. The model results were compared with geologic and geodetic observations that provide a record of vertical land motion over three distinctly different timescales (past 80 kyr, past 7 kyr, and past ~ 15 [*]years). It was found that glacial isostatic adjustment {{is likely to be the}} dominant contributor to vertical motion of the Pleistocene and underlying basement. Present-day basement subsidence rates solely due to sediment loading are found to be less than ~ 0. 5 [*]mm[*]yr− 1. The analysis supports previous suggestions in the literature that Earth rheology parameters are time dependent. Specifically, the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere may be < 50 [*]km on a 105 [*]year timescale, but closer to 100 [*]km over 103 to 104 [*]year timescales...|$|R
40|$|SO 2 {{variability}} over a {{large concentration}} range and interferences from other gases have been major limitations in industrial SO 2 emission monitoring. This study demonstrates accurate industrial SO 2 emission monitoring through a portable multichannel gas analyzer with an optimized retrieval algorithm. The proposed analyzer features a large dynamic measurement range and correction of interferences from other coexisting infrared absorbers such as NO, CO, CO 2, NO 2, CH 4, HC, N 2 O, and H 2 O. The multichannel gas analyzer measures 11 different wavelength channels simultaneously to correct several major problems of an infrared gas analyzer including system drift, <b>conflict</b> of <b>sensitivity,</b> interferences among different infrared absorbers, and limitation of measurement range. The optimized algorithm uses a third polynomial instead of a constant factor to quantify gas-to-gas interference. Measurement results show good performance in the linear and nonlinear ranges, thereby solving the problem that the conventional interference correction is restricted by the linearity of the intended and interfering channels. The results imply that the measurement range of the developed multichannel analyzer can be extended to the nonlinear absorption region. The measurement range and accuracy are evaluated through experimental laboratory calibration. Excellent agreement was achieved, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 99977 with a measurement range from approximately 5 to 10   000 ppmv and a measurement error of less than 2 %. The instrument was also deployed for field measurement. Emissions from three different factories were measured.
