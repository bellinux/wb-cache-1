40|$|Abstract. The {{concrete-filled}} {{glass fiber}} reinforced gypsum wall panel {{is a kind}} of panel that the inside cavums of the glass fiber hollow gypsum panel is filled with concrete. The experimental results indicate that the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall panel which has a better performance of the force and can be used to be the bearing wall of a building can form a novel structural system. When the beams supporting the wall panels, the wall panels which under the beams is in local state of compression. It were gained that when the wall panels are in the local compression state, local pressure loads are primarily borne by the concrete core columns and fiber gypsum board will damage in advance through the eighteen experimental wall panel specimens which in local compression. The test results show that the final destruction of the concrete is caused by being crushed and the contribution of the gypsum wall panel to local <b>compression</b> <b>bearing</b> is small. Compressive stress can only spread in the local loading on concrete core columns, cannot be expanded into an adjacent stud. Finally, the local <b>compression</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity calculation formula of the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall panel is obtained by analysis of the test results...|$|E
40|$|The load {{carrying}} capacity and failure mechanism of 8 square columns strengthened with high-performance ferrocement laminate (HPFL) and bonded steel plates (BSP) were analyzed {{on the basis of}} experiments on the axial compression performance of these columns. Results show that the reinforcing layer worked together with the original columns as a whole, and the load-bearing capacity significantly increased. When failure of the strengthened column occurred, the mortar and concrete were crushed and bulged outward {{in the middle of the}} columns, the angle bars and longitudinal steel bars buckled, and some stirrups were pulled out. The chamfering of angle bar momentously affected the primary damage of steel strand. The values of the strength reduction factor and pressure effective utilization coefficient of the mortar were suggested. Based on the experiments and existing tests of 35 columns strengthened with HPFL, equations for the axial <b>compression</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity were proposed and all calculation results agreed well with testing results. Therefore, the calculation method could be used in the capacity design of axial compression strengthened columns...|$|E

40|$|Helical piles are {{environmentally}} friendly and economical deep foundations that, due to environmental considerations, are excellent additions {{to a variety}} of deep foundation alternatives available to the practitioner. Helical piles performance depends on soil properties, the pile geometry and soil-pile interaction. Helical piles can be a proper alternative in sensitive environmental sites if their bearing capacity is sufficient to support applied loads. The failure capacity of helical piles in this study was measured via an experimental research program that was carried out by Frustum Confining Vessel (FCV). FCV is a frustum chamber by approximately linear increase in vertical and lateral stresses along depth from top to bottom. Due to special geometry and applied bottom pressure, this apparatus is a proper choice to test small model piles which can simulate field stress conditions. Small scale helical piles are made with either single helix or more helixes and installed in fine grained sand with three various densities. Axial loading tests including compression and tension tests were performed to achieve pile ultimate capacity. The results indicate the helical piles behavior depends essentially on pile geometric characteristics, i. e. helix configuration and soil properties. According to the achievements, axial uplift capacity of helical model piles is about equal to usual steel model piles that have the helixes diameter. Helical pile <b>compression</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity is too sufficient to act as a medium pile, thus it can be substituted other piles in special geoenvironmental conditions. The bearing capacity also depends on spacing ratio, S/D, and helixes diameter...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} {{an increase in}} the transportation infrastructure damage caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes, high winds, floods, as well as man-made disasters. Such damages result in a disruption to the transportation infrastructure network; hence, limit the post-disaster relief operations. This led to the exigency of developing and using effective deployable bridge systems for rapid post-disaster mobility while minimizing the weight to capacity ratio. Recent researches for assessments of mobile bridging requirements concluded that current deployable metallic bridge systems are prone to their service life, unable to meet the increase in vehicle design loads, and any trials for the structures’ strengthening will sacrifice the ease of mobility. Therefore, this research focuses on developing a lightweight deployable bridge system using composite laminates for lightweight bridging in the aftermath of natural disaster. The research investigates the structural design optimization for composite laminate deployable bridge systems, as well as the design, development and testing of composite sandwich core sections that act as the <b>compression</b> <b>bearing</b> element in a deployable bridge treadway structure. The thesis is organized into two parts. The first part includes a new improved particle swarm meta-heuristic approach capable of effectively optimizing deployable bridge systems. The developed approach is extended to modify the technique for discrete design of composite laminates and maximum strength design of composite sandwich core sections. The second part focuses on developing, experimentally testing and numerically investigating the performance of different sandwich core configurations that will be used as the <b>compression</b> <b>bearing</b> element in a deployable fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bridge girder. The first part investigated different optimization algorithms used for structural optimization. The uncertainty in the effectiveness of the available methods to handle complex structural models emphasized the need to develop an enhanced version of Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) without performing multiple operations using different techniques. The new technique implements a better emulation for the attraction and repulsion behavior of the swarm. The new algorithm is called Controlled Diversity Particle Swarm Optimizer (CD-PSO). The algorithm improved the performance of the classical PSO in terms of solution stability, quality, convergence rate and computational time. The CD-PSO is then hybridized with the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to redirect the swarm search for probing feasible solutions in hyperspace using only the design parameters of strong influence on the objective function. This is triggered when the algorithm fails to obtain good solutions using CD-PSO. The performance of CD-PSO is tested on benchmark structures and compared to others in the literature. Consequently, both techniques, CD-, and hybrid CD-PSO are examined for the minimum weight design of large-scale deployable bridge structure. Furthermore, a discrete version of the algorithm is created to handle the discrete nature of the composite laminate sandwich core design. The second part focuses on achieving an effective composite deployable bridge system, this is realized through maximizing shear strength, compression strength, and stiffness designs of light-weight composite sandwich cores of the treadway bridge’s compression deck. Different composite sandwich cores are investigated and their progressive failure is numerically evaluated. The performance of the sandwich cores is experimentally tested in terms of flatwise compressive strength, edgewise compressive strength and shear strength capacities. Further, the cores’ compression strength and shear strength capacities are numerically simulated and the results are validated with the experimental work. Based on the numerical and experimental tests findings, the sandwich cores plate properties are quantified for future implementation in optimized scaled deployable bridge treadway...|$|E

The computed local stresses were used with appropriate failure criteria to analyze the observed failure modes and strengths. An unexpected interaction {{of the effect of}} the bypass and bearing loads was found for the onset of <b>compression</b> reacted <b>bearing</b> damage. The interaction was caused by a decrease in the bolt-hole contact arc and a corresponding increase in the severity of the bearing loads. The amount of bolt-hole contact had a significant effect on local stresses and, thus, on the calculated damage-onset and ultimate strengths.

ObjectiveTo perform in vivo pressure measurements of different <b>compression</b> bandages <b>bearing</b> different technical characteristics with different application methods. MethodInterface pressure was measured {{on the lower}} limb of 20 healthy women at 3 different points (B 1, C and F) using 6 compression techniques (stockings, non-elastic bandage, elastic bandages with 2 technical characteristics and 3 application methods), and in 3 positions. ResultsAll elastic compression bandages respected the principle of graduated pressure {{along the length of}} the limb (P< 0. 0001), but not the non-elastic bandage. The pressures increase significantly (P< 0. 0001) between the supine position and the sitting or standing position, especially with the non-elastic compression bandage. There is a marked variation in pressures between subjects for some bandages (non-elastic and elastic applied using the figure-of-eight technique).

40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} analytical {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of bolt-hole contact on the bearing bypass strength of a graphite-epoxy laminate. Tests were conducted on specimens consisting of 16 -ply quasi-isotropic T 300 / 5208 laminates with a centrally located hole. Bearing loads were applied through a clearance-fit steel bolt. Damage onset strength and damage mode were determined for each test case. A finite element procedure was used to calculate the bolt-hole stresses and bolt contact for each test case. A finite element procedure was used to calculate the bolt-hole stresses and bolt contact for each measured damage-onset strength. For the tension bearing-bypass cases tested, the bolt contact half-angle was approximately 60 degrees at damage onset. For compression, the contact angle was 20 degrees as the bypass load increased. A corresponding decrease in the bearing damage onset strength was attributed to the decrease in contact angle which made the bearing loads more severe. Hole boundary stresses were also computed by superimposing stresses for separate bearing and bypass loading. Stresses at the specimen net section were accurately approximated by the superposition procedure. However, the peak bearing stresses had large errors because the bolt contact angles were not represented correctly. For <b>compression,</b> peak <b>bearing</b> stress errors of nearly 50 percent were calculated...|$|R
40|$|Composite parts can be {{manufactured}} to near-net shape with minimum wastage of material; however, {{there is almost}} always a need for further machining. The most common post-manufacture machining operations for composite materials are to create holes for assembly. This thesis presents and discusses a thermally-assisted piercing process {{that can be used}} as a technique for introducing holes into thermoplastic composites. The thermally-assisted piercing process heats up, and locally melts, thermoplastic composites to allow material to be displaced around a hole, rather than cutting them out from the structure. This investigation was concerned with how the variation of piercing process parameters (such as the size of the heated area, the temperature of the laminate prior to piercing and the geometry of the piercing spike) changed the material microstructure within carbon fibre/Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) laminates. The variation of process parameters was found to significantly affect the formation of resin rich regions, voids and the fibre volume fraction in the material surrounding the hole. Mechanical testing (using open-hole tension, open-hole <b>compression,</b> plain-pin <b>bearing</b> and bolted bearing tests) showed that the microstructural features created during piercing were having significant influence over the resulting mechanical performance of specimens.

Thereby a concrete slab {{is added to}} the timber beams. Both parts of the construction are connected by using special shear connectors. In this case timber is mainly loaded in tension and concrete is generally loaded in <b>compression.</b> The <b>bearing</b> capacity as well as the serviceability of the ceiling can be improved by this composite construction.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{research}} vertical in-plane <b>compression</b> load <b>bearing</b> capacity of a glass panel combined with wood. The basis of my research is the idea to use glass {{as a part of}} the load bearing construction of buildings. A test of in-plane compression of a life-sized glass panel has been carried out in the laboratory of Chair for material and construction testing at the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering. The aim was to determine the panel's load bearing capacity, its performance under in-plane compression force, what kind of bending occurs when failure happens and what the failure is like. Considering the information available in literature the glass is expected to withstand high in-plane compression force and that its slenderness is a problem. Since the glass has very low tensile strength the buckling of the compressed elements represents crucial failure mode because bending occur and as such tensile deformations. In the first part of my thesis the history of glass, different types of glass and their production as well as existing development are described. I focused on the types of glass which are used in construction, namely laminated and heat-treated glass. This is followed by a presentation of glass production and its use in construction in the world market. It also includes a catalogue of the world's biggest glass producers and their market shares. Before thoroughly describing the laboratory test my thesis displays the newest architectural views using examples of buildings that have incorporated glass as a part of load bearing construction.

These correspond to frequencies of interest in physiological loading. The loads that were applied were a static load of 390 N, corresponding to an equivalent body weight load for UKR, and a dynamic load of ± 293 N.

Materials and Methods: POP casts were divided into three Groups A, B and C with 2, 3 and 8 layer for POP bandage, respectively (n= 6 in each group). Handling characters, technical easiness or difficulties, setting time, weight, diameter and thickness of the casts were recorded for different groups. The casts were mounted on universal testing machine and axial load was applied @ 10 mm/min until failure. The load deflection graphs were plotted. The maximum force at which failure of the casts occurred was recorded. Stress, strain, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and stiffness of casts were calculated. Result: Construction of POP bandage cast was messy and required 45 - 60 min for hardening. 8 layer POP cast was comparatively heavier in weight and thicker in cross section than 3 layer cast followed by 2 layer cast. Under axial <b>compression,</b> the load <b>bearing</b> capacity of 8 layer POP casts was more than 2 and 3 layer cast.

The aim of this research is to evaluate the engineering properties of Batu Pahat Soft Clay (BPSC) mixed with three types of admixtures. This research presents the stabilization of BPSC using admixtures lime, cement and natural sodium bentonite at varying binder contents (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %). The basic soil properties such as compaction, unconfined <b>compression</b> strength, California <b>bearing</b> capacity and permeability testing methods were used to gauge the behavior and performance of the stabilized soils. From the tests conducted, the researcher has found that the addition of lime, cement and natural sodium bentonite decreased the maximum dry density and increased the optimum moisture content. The tests conducted gave some indication that the unconfined compressive strength increased with the percentage of stabilizer and curing periods for cement treated sample compared to lime and bentonite treated sample. It also showed that an increase in the binder content and curing periods results in a reduction of the permeability of the stabilized soils.

40|$|Currently in Brazil, as {{in other}} parts of the world, the concern is great with the {{increase}} of degraded agricultural soil, which is mostly related to the occurrence of soil compaction. Although soil texture is recognized as a very important component in the soil compressive behaviors, there are few studies that quantify its influence on the structural changes of Latosols in the Brazilian Cerrado region. This study aimed to evaluate structural changes and the compressive behavior of Latosols in Rio Verde, Goiás, through the modeling of additional soil compaction. The study was carried out using five Latosols with very different textures, under different soil compaction levels. Water retention and soil <b>compression</b> curves, and <b>bearing</b> capacity models were determined from undisturbed samples collected on the B horizons. Results indicated that clayey and very clayey Latosols were more susceptible to compression than medium-textured soils. Soil compression curves at density values associate with edaphic functions were used to determine the beneficial pressure (&# 963; b), i. e., pressure with optimal water retention, and critical pressure (&# 963;crMAC), i. e., pressure with macroporosity below critical levels. These pressure values were higher than the preconsolidation pressure (&# 963;p), and therefore characterized as additional compaction. Based on the compressive behavior of these Latosols, it can be concluded that the combined preconsolidation pressure, beneficial pressure and critical pressure allow a better understanding of compression processes of Latosols...|$|R

This region was divided into a surface portion (sp), which is {{in direct contact with}} the bone and into a deep portion (dp), which is the layer opposite the articulating surface. The purpose of this work was to analyse the distribution and organisation of the collagen bundles and proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix in sp and dp. Toluidine-blue-stained sections were analysed under a polarising microscope. Strong basophilia and metachromasia were observed in sp, demonstrating accumulation of proteoglycan in a region <b>bearing</b> <b>compression,</b> but the intensity was reduced the further layers were from the bone. Linear dichroism confirmed that the glycosaminoglycan molecules were disposed predominantly parallel to the longest axis of the collagen fibrils. Birefringence analysis showed a higher molecular order and aggregation of the collagen bundles in areas where the tension was more prominent. The crimp pattern was more regular in dp than in sp, probably as a requirement for tendon stretching. The optical anisotropy exhibited by the collagen bundles also confirmed the helical organisation of the collagen bundles in the tendon. Hyaluronidase digestion caused a decrease in the basophilia, but this was not eliminated, supporting the idea that in the matrix, proteoglycans are not completely available to the enzyme action...|$|R
40|$|Solutions {{are given}} for the tensile {{stresses}} in the steel reinforcing shims of elastomeric isolators. The method makes use of generalized plane stress and uses a stress function approach, treating the shim as a thin plate with body forces generated by surface shears {{on the top and}} bottom of the plate. It is shown that the pressure in the rubber acts as a potential for these body forces. The solutions are applicable to low and moderate shape factor bearings where it is acceptable to assume that the elastomer is incompressible, and also to the more common current situation when the shape factor is so large that the compressibility of the rubber must be included. The stress state in the steel reinforcing plates is calculated for both pure <b>compression</b> of the <b>bearing</b> and for when the bearing is loaded by a bending moment. These two cases, separately and in combination, are the typical situation in current practice. While a solution for the stress state in the shims of a circular isolator, assuming incompressibility and under pure compression, has been available using an analogy with the stresses in a rotating circular plate, the use of the stress function method is new and suggests a method to extend the solutions to other shapes of isolator other than circular.

The incidence of stroke after cesarean delivery is high [15]. Stocks et al. [16] reported a patient with cerebral vein thrombosis that was misdiagnosed as PDPH. Hashimoto et al. [17] reported that epidural blood patch induced impairment of consciousness in a patient with an intracranial problem. Again, in the present case, the patient complained of neck stiffness on the second postoperative day and MRI {{was performed on the}} fourth postoperative day. It may have been better to perform MRI or CT on the day that neck stiffness appeared. In the present case, headache related to ADP may have been masked by the analgesics administered for incisional pain or may have already been compensated by the SDH that developed earlier after the surgery. It is important to follow up slight symptoms such as neck stiffness. We performed epidural blood patch for treatment. In a case series reported by Zeidan et al. [8], many patients with a postdural puncture headache complicated by subdural hematoma following spinal or epidural anesthesia, especially patients with a neurological deficit or severe headache, were treated by surgical resection, whereas treatment by epidural blood patch was rare. In the present case, we decided to treat our patient with epidural blood patch because she had no neurological deficit. Two cases of subdural hematoma found after epidural blood patch were reported and one of the cases developed seizure immediately after the epidural blood patch [18, 19]. Even though sealing of the dura defect and restoration of CSF pressure are expected by epidural blood patch, there is a possibility of rebound intracranial hypertension and neurological deterioration. A case series reported by Hashizume et al. [20] indicated the possibility that SDH may enlarge or reoccur after epidural blood patch and may require hematoma evacuation [20]. Patients should be monitored carefully after epidural blood patch.|$|R
40|$|Carbon Fiber / Epoxy Laminates are {{increasingly}} {{being used in the}} primary structure of aircraft. To make effective use these materials, it is necessary to consider the ability of a laminate to resist damage, as well as material strength and stiffness. A possible means for improving damage tolerance is the use of non-traditional composite laminates, in which the longitudinal 0 plies are replaced with 5 or 10 plies. The main objectives of this collaborative Georgia Tech / Boeing research was the characterization of these non-traditional laminates, and the determination of appropriate lamina-level analytical techniques that are capable of predicting the changes caused by the use of slightly off-axis longitudinal plies. A quasi-isotropic [45 / 90 /- 45 /theta/ 45 / 90 /- 45 /-theta]s and hard [45 /theta/- 45 /theta/ 90 / 45]s lay-up, where theta = 0, 5 or 10, were tested in open hole tension, filled hole tension, open hole <b>compression,</b> single shear <b>bearing,</b> and unnotched tension. These coupon level tests illustrated the effects of lay-up, notch constraint, and load type on traditional and non-traditional laminates. Die penetrant enhanced in-situ radiography was performed {{to determine the extent of}} damage suppression. The use of non-traditional laminates was found to reduce longitudinal ply cracking and delamination, with significant effect on the stress distribution around the notch. The use of non-traditional laminates also resulted in a 15 %- 20 % improvement in bearing strength of the traditional laminates. Several predictive techniques were implemented to evaluate their ability to predict the effect of slight changes in ply orientations. A progressive damage model was written to compare Tsai-Wu, Hashin, and Maximum Stress unnotched strength criterion. Additionally, several semi-empirical failure theories for notched strength prediction were compared with linear and bi-linear cohesive zone models to determine applicability to non-traditional laminates.

Foot orthoses {{have been used for}} many years to treat various pathologies. While these orthoses can be effective, the mechanism of how plantar soft tissues and skeletal structures interface with the orthosis is not well understood. Studies have been conducted which examine tissue properties of the heel pad, including the use of ultrasound, but analysis of the midfoot is limited. This study aims to quantify displacement and stiffness of the plantar soft tissues of the midfoot under a known load through the use of ultrasonography in weight bearing and non- weight bearing conditions. Twenty -five subjects were recruited for the study ranging in age from 23 - 56 (Mean = 36. 08) years old, consisting of 12 females and 13 males. Simple demographic information was recorded and a Foot Posture Index (FPI) examination was performed on all subjects. A force application apparatus was designed that utilizes a stepper-motor-driven linear actuator. The test set-up consisted of load cell mounted to the actuator which could drive an ultrasound transducer into the plantar surface of the midfoot to a maximum load of 40 N. The results show plantar foot tissue stiffness exhibits a non-linear "toe" region at low force values, while increased force causes a shift to a linear stiffness profile. Midfoot plantar tissues are significantly stiffer in weight bearing conditions than in nonweight bearing conditions (p< 0. 05). Observations and measurements from ultrasound videos indicate that soft tissue between the skin and skeletal structure experiences greater change in <b>compression</b> in non-weight <b>bearing.</b> However, muscle tissue appears to have a greater change in deformation under non-weight bearing, while the connective tissue between skin and muscle display greater change in deformation under weight bearing conditions. The disparity in amount of deformation between tissues during different weight bearing conditions shows that stiffness properties in the foot are dynamic. The aim for future research is to develop a map of plantar soft tissue properties in all regions of the foot for clinical reference in selecting compatible orthotic interface materials.

40|$|Compressed {{flexures}} have a downwards-tunable stiffness {{in their}} compliant directions; their stiffness can theoretically {{be reduced by}} up to four orders of magnitude. The compression-stiffiness relation is linear {{for most of the}} loading, and this behavior can be taken advantage of to use the flexure as a tunable spring, opening up new design possibilities. Compressed flexures present the possibility of developing more sensitive flexure-based instruments such as accelerometers. The purpose of this research was to characterize the behavior of compressed flexures and develop guidelines for their design. Tradeoffs were assessed when substituting compressed flexures for conventional flexures and their suitability for use in a precision system. An experimental setup was designed and built to test a stage guided by four compressed flexure <b>bearings.</b> <b>Compression</b> was applied to the test flexures via a displacement input that was deamplified by a wedge pair to increase preload resolution. The motion in each of the stage's six degrees of freedom in response to flexure compression and in response to a voice coil actuator acting in the flexure's compliant direction was measured by seven capacitance probes arranged around the test stage, and a seventh capacitance probe measured the input displacement. With the experimental setup it was found that a stiffness reduction of a factor of 7 was possible. The magnitude of parasitic motions in the test stage were found to increase linearly with flexure compression. When being actuated in the compliant direction, parasitic motions were evident with magnitudes of the same order of magnitude as the sensor noise. Compressed flexures are highly sensitive to thermal variations; a 0. 5 C temperature increase resulted in an 11 % increase in stiffness. A model developed in this thesis predicts that deviations from column straightness of 2 % of the flexure thickness limit the stiffness reduction to a factor of 1. 2, while a deviation of 0. 2 % allows for a stiffness reduction of 10, 000. by Aaron E.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} how to construct a system to measure load in a mobile unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) bearing. In vivo loads have been measured in a total knee replacement (TKR), but with TKR the kinematics {{are different from those}} of the normal knee, whereas they are close to normal in a mobile UKR, so the loads measured by an instrumented UKR would be more representative of the normal knee. On the principle of measuring compression of an object under load, the load may be estimated. Compression measurement using a capacitive sensor was the optimal solution to measure load, based on life expectancy of the sensor and bearing integrity. A capacitive sensor within a polyethylene (UHMWPE) bearing has not been used before. The visco-elastic and temperature dependent properties of UHMWPE were determined with experiments. UHMWPE had an approximately linear response after ten minutes of applying a constant load. A temperature sensor should be used in vivo to compensate for temperature effects acting on the elastic modulus of UHMWPE. Finite element modelling demonstrated that positioning the sensor under the centre of the bearing concavity resulted in the largest capacitive change. The influence of various dimensional parameters on sensor output was simulated, and the conclusion was that the sensor only needs to be calibrated once. An electronic module inserted into a bearing had less than 5 % influence on <b>bearing</b> <b>compression.</b> Capacitive sensors were made from polyimide, using standard production methods, and embedded within a UKR bearing using the standard compression moulding process. The embedded sensor had a second order low pass frequency response, with a corner frequency of 9 Hz, twice the frequency required for typical functional loading such as gait. Physiological load signals, gait and step up/down, were applied to the bearing. The capacitance to load response was approximately linear. Load was estimated using a linear method and a dynamic method. The linear method performed best, with an accuracy of force estimation better than 90 %. In vitro tests were performed using a commercially available transceiver, two stan- dard antennas and a custom antenna, designed to be incorporated in the bearing. Wireless communication between an implanted custom antenna and an external an- tenna was shown to be feasible. Experiments were also performed that demonstrate that inductive powering of the bearing was feasible. In addition to load measurement, a proposal for dynamic measurement of the orien- tation angles of both the tibia and the femur was made. Power and volume calculations showed that it is possible to place an electronic module within the bearing. This thesis has not only demonstrated that it is feasible to make an instrumented bearing for UKR but has also provided a basic design for manufacturing.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of detailed investigation of the possible use of stabilised sludge and brown coal fly ash as raw material ingredients for road construction and manufacture of building bricks. The thesis is organised into seven chapters including a general introduction chapter. A literature review of solid waste management practices employed in Australia and some selected countries are discussed (chapter 1) together with waste generation from power stations. Particular attention is given to industrial waste disposal into Victorian landfills and the current waste management system in the state is compared with international best practices. The sampling program and sample collection methods used in this study are described in chapter 2. The results of the preliminary waste characterisation of treated solid industrial wastes from waste treatment plant, mainly slurry (liquid sludge), filter cake and stabilised sludge are presented in this chapter to provide a "snapshot" of the organic and inorganic composition of the waste materials. It also enabled the identification of key target analytes of concern for further study. The methodologies and analytical instruments employed in the sampling plan and analyses used are also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 focuses on elemental, organic and ionic chemical analysis of filter cake and stabilised sludge from industrial waste treatment plant using different analytical techniques. This chapter also contains elemental characterisation of brown coal fly ash from power stations in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia. The leachability of heavy metals from filter cake and stabilised sludge samples are also presented in this chapter and the identified components that can impact on the potential reuse/recycle of the solids were examined by using different analytical techniques to improve the treatment performance in terms of transfer of contaminants from liquid to solid phases. The principles and applications of XRD, TGA and SEM techniques to the analysis of environmental samples are discussed in chapter 4. XRD and TGA analyses were conducted on filter cake and stabilised sludge from industrial waste treatment plant,whereas SEM analysis were performed on fly ash, mixture of fly ash and stabilised sludge, bricks produced from sludge/fly ash and clay fired at 1000 °C. Characterisation of the waste materials with these techniques revealed that phase, thermal and morphological properties are useful to understand the complex mineral composition and the performance of waste materials for certain end use applications. The suitability of stabilised sludge and brown coal fly ash mixtures as road base and sub-base material (chapter 5) was investigated by measuring index properties, pH and electrical conductivity, compaction, unconfined <b>compression</b> strength, California <b>bearing</b> ratio, triaxial shear stress and permeability tests. This chapter also discussed the physical and mechanical properties of the individual waste streams (sludge and fly ash) as a first step in identifying its potential application for reuse/recycle as raw material ingredient in road construction. The results obtained in this chapter indicate that the addition of fly ash to the stabilised sludge and curing time were the most important factors to improve the physical/mechanical properties of the waste materials. The combination of stabilised sludge and fly ash as raw material ingredients for making building bricks was considered in chapter 6. The characteristics of bricks made from these waste materials in different mixtures were investigated. The successful development of a new process for making bricks is detailed in this chapter and the product is referred to as "Enviro-brick". This process provides an opportunity for reducing the environmental impact of solid industrial wastes from waste treatment plants and power stations. The conclusions and implication for further research are presented in chapter 7...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 50 % - 80 % of the {{population}} will experience disabling low back pain {{at some point in}} their life. Assessing and developing interventions based on “lumbar stability” and/or joint stiffness to reduce low back pain has been a common research focus. Specific focus has been on identifying which muscles influence lumbar stability/stiffness, with one argument being between focusing training on the transverse abdominis and lumbar multifidus muscles versus broader training approaches involving the entire abdominal wall and erector spinae muscles. However, there has not been research on whether pain reduction was due to increased stability/stiffness or another mechanism. The main goals of this thesis were to determine the effect of individual muscles on stability/stiffness through a two phase process. In the first phase, a model sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the interactions of variables that influence the quantification of stability. Stability was quantified via the eigenvalues (EV) of the Hessian matrix of potential energies at each lumbar level and axis of rotation, for a total of 15 EVs (3 axes of rotation x 5 joints). In phase 2, assessment of clinical interventions on patients with low back pain designed to alter biomechanics was conducted to assess factors in stability/stiffness quantification and mechanisms of action in pain modulation. More detail of the study phases are described below, in order to test the following hypotheses: 1) 	It was hypothesized that individual muscles affect specific EVs, but no one muscle can be associated with one EV level. 2) 	It was hypothesized that specific muscles do affect specific planes of stability/stiffness. 3) 	It was hypothesized that EVs are affected by posture. 4) 	It was hypothesized that overactivating muscles by increasing muscle activation to 100 % MVC negatively affects the EVs. 5) 	It was hypothesized that the relationship between muscles and specific EVs obtained during simulation remains with real subjects performing loaded tasks. 6) 	It was hypothesized that coaching and cueing specific movement patterns and motor patterns would alter pain in low back pain patients. 7) 	If hypothesis 6 is true, then it was hypothesized that changes in pain would be reflected in changes in EVs. Methods for Phase 1 The first phase involved a sensitivity analysis using an anatomically detailed spine model. Theoretical data including posture, motion and muscle activity were synthesized to include 23 static spine postures, including neutral, 0 ° - 50 ° flexion, 0 ° - 30 ° extension, 0 ° - 30 ° right and left lateral bend, and 0 ° - 40 ° right and left axial twist, all in increments of 10 °. For each posture, all eleven muscles included in the model, some with several fascicles, were artificially activated to 50 % MVC. A knockout approach ensued whereby activity in single muscles were systematically reduced to 0 % MVC or increased to 100 % MVC. The relationships between the 15 EVs and the changes in muscle activity and posture were assessed. This muscle knockout model was repeated with actual muscle activity values obtained from electromyographic (EMG) signals and postures obtained from four subjects who performed a walking task with a 15 kg load in each hand. Results for Phase 1 	The sensitivity analysis showed that the abdominal muscles contribute a greater stabilizing effect on the L 4 and L 5 EVs, while the multifidus and erector spinae muscles contribute a greater effect on the L 1, L 2 and L 3 EVs. When examining the effect of muscles on a specific plane in terms of influencing stability/stiffness, it was found that the abdominal muscles contribute a greater effect on the bend axis and twist axis EVs than the flexion axis EVs, while the erector spinae muscles contribute the greatest effect on the flexion axis EVs. Posture was found to have a biologically significant effect on EVs, with the 50 ° flexion and 30 ° extension postures having the most detrimental effect in terms of compromising stability/stiffness. In addition, when there was a 10 ° excursion in any axis, there was little change in the EVs, while postures at angles greater than this were often associated with decreases in stability/stiffness in some EVs. Increasing the muscle activation from 50 % MVC to 100 % MVC did not have a large effect on most EVs, but when there was a meaningful change, as defined by a change of 10 % or greater in the EV, the 100 % MVC activation level always resulted in more stability/stiffness at that particular EV. Finally, using actual EMG and lumbar angle patterns resulted in similar results as the theoretical data, as expected. Interpretation of these findings is limited by the following. Even though EVs changed, there is no guarantee that the magnitude of change in one EV could be interpreted to equal a similar magnitude of change in another EV, nor may it be assumed that EVs have a linear relationship with stability/stiffness. These results suggest that when the goal is to increase lumbar stability, a neutral spine should be maintained and activating the larger abdominal muscles is more important than activating the transverse abdominis or multifidus, as proposed by some clinical groups. Methods for Phase 2 	 Four case studies of individuals with chronic low back pain were recruited from whom kinematic, kinetic and EMG data were collected in addition to a measure of pain intensity using an 11 -point verbal numerical rating scale. Pain provocation tests were performed by a clinician (professor Stuart McGill) to identify the motions, postures and loads that exacerbated their pain. Then these tasks were repeated while the motion and EMG data was collected. This was followed by interventions coached by the clinician that could include the abdominal brace (stiffening the abdominal wall), latissimus dorsi stiffening, incorporating a hip-hinge motion rather than spine bending, or any combination of these. The intention of the intervention was to immediately reduce pain intensity. These tasks arranged in a repeated measures design were assessed with the anatomically detailed spine model to calculate stability/stiffness from evaluation of the 15 EVs, lumbar compression and lumbar shear forces. Results for Phase 2 	The results from phase 2 suggest that pain was sometimes reduced by altering motions, postures and load, but the mechanism of what proved effective and the degree of success was variable from patient to patient. In most situations, the EVs, lumbar compression forces and lumbar shear forces increased due to the intervention that was chosen. In addition, the lumbar flexion angle typically trended to a more neutral posture and in tasks where spine motion occurred, there was less spine motion when using the suggested intervention. Further, the biomechanical variable that would be expected to change based on clinical assessment did not always react in the expected way (i. e. a compression intolerant individual would be expected to have decreased compression linked with decreased pain, but this did not occur). While the stability/stiffness increased, the associated compression was tolerated suggesting that the increase in concomitant stiffness enhanced the <b>compression</b> load <b>bearing</b> tolerance. Overall Conclusions 	This thesis showed that careful examination of the EVs did not offer substantial insight into links between changes in individual EVs and individual muscles, as muscle activity was not reflected in the EVs. Specifically, single muscles contributions were not reflected in specific EVs as was hypothesized. Further, it was difficult to interpret the EVs collectively because of the inherent non-linearity between EV magnitude and changes in muscle activation/stiffness; it can only be said that there was more or less stability/stiffness with each change in an EV, not how much. In addition, pain reduction appeared to be due to a combination of altered motions, postures and loads, but this did not result in systematic EV changes. Globally, the present work provides evidence supporting the idea that maintaining a neutral posture and activating the abdominal muscles results in less pain and larger EVs, suggesting an increase in stability/stiffness. This work has potential for informing clinicians on possible options for immediate reduction in low back pain...|$|R
