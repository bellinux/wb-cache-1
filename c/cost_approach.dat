The most common approaches to estimate the fundamental or fair value of the intellectual property are defined as the following: 1. Cost approach: The <b>cost</b> <b>approach</b> is based on the economic principle of substitution. This principle states that an investor will pay no more for an asset than the cost to obtain, by purchasing or constructing, a substitute asset of equal utility. There are several <b>cost</b> <b>approach</b> valuation methods, the most common being the historical cost, replacement cost, and replication cost.|$|E
50|$|The {{appraiser}} has {{to think}} about the way that most buyers usually buy a given type of property. What appraisal method do most buyers use for the type of property being valued? This generally guides the appraiser's thinking on the best valuation method, in conjunction with the available data. For instance, appraisals of properties that are typically purchased by investors (e.g., skyscrapers, office buildings) may give greater weight to the Income Approach. Buyers interested in purchasing single family residential property would rather compare price, in this case, the Sales Comparison Approach (market analysis approach) would be more applicable. The third and final approach to value is the <b>Cost</b> <b>Approach</b> to value. The <b>Cost</b> <b>Approach</b> to value is most useful in determining insurable value, and cost to construct a new structure or building.|$|E

In this paper we develop an Activity Based <b>Costing</b> <b>approach</b> for the determination of procurement strategies.

To this end we develop a mathematical programming model where decisions involve the selection of vendors and the determination of order quantities. The system computes the total cost of ownership, thereby increasing the objectivity in the selection process and giving the opportunity for various kinds of sensitivity analysis.
