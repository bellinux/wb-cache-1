40|$|Although {{the effects}} on {{biodiversity}} in woodland managed for conservation have been studied {{for a range of}} species, there is very little empirical data on the potential impacts of <b>commercial</b> <b>woodland</b> management on biodiversity in the UK. This study measured species richness and abundance of diurnal butterflies as a proxy for the habitat quality of three different woodland management techniques in the Morecambe Bay limestone woodland region. Butterflies were sampled at two sites; Gait Barrows and Witherslack, where three woodland management techniques were carried out: low management woodland (woodland with no recent intervention); traditional coppice management for conservation; and <b>commercial</b> <b>woodland</b> management. Both coppice management for conservation and commercial management had significantly higher butterfly species richness and abundance when compared to low management woodland; neither butterfly species richness nor abundance were significantly different between the traditional coppice management for conservation and <b>commercial</b> <b>woodland</b> management. UK Biodiversity Action Plan fritillary species (high brown fritillary Argynnis adippe; pearl bordered fritillary Boloria euphrosyne; and small pearl bordered fritillary Boloria selene) were not significantly different between the traditional coppice management for conservation and commercial management...|$|R

5000|$|Just to {{the north}} of the town is the wooded signal-beacon hill, {{naturally}} named Beacon Hill, but originally called Penrith Fell. It last use was probably in 1804 in the war against Napoleon. Traditionally, the Beacon Pike was used to warn of approaching danger from Scotland. Today, although surrounded by a <b>commercial</b> <b>woodland</b> owned by Lowther Estates, the hill still contains some natural woodlands and is a popular local and tourist attraction. On a clear day the majority of the Eden Valley, the local fells, Pennines and parts of the North Lakes can be seen. It is almost certain that the Beacon Hill gave Penrith its name - in Celtic - of [...] "red hill".|$|R

5000|$|The {{building}} was designed in 1913 by architect W.H. Weeks, architect {{of many other}} landmarks in Woodland such as the Woodland Opera House and the Yolo County Courthouse. Construction bids were accepted and Earle L. Younger of San Jose (later a Woodland resident) was the lowest bidder. The building's exterior includes buff-colored Roman brick with elaborately decorated cornice and an arched entrance way that leads into the building's lobby. The building had many modern amenities that were rare for its era, {{some of which were}} [...] "firsts" [...] for Woodland, including an electric elevator, steam heating system, and telephone service in each office. The successful completion of this major construction project was of great benefit to Younger, and helped him become one of the more popular <b>commercial</b> builders in <b>Woodland</b> until the 1940s.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{report is}} designed to be used in conjunction with 1 : 10 000 Geological Sheet TG 22 NE. Uncoloured copies of the map may be purchased fiom the Survey's offices at Keyworth. The district covered by the map is included in 1 : 50 000 Geological Sheets 147 (Aylsham) and 148 (North Walsh). It formed part of Old Series One-Inch sheet 68 E, and was surveyed at a scale of 1 : 63 360 by H B Woodward in 1879. An accompanying memoir was published (Reid, 1882). The district was resurveyed at 1 : 10 000 scale by the present author in 1996 - 7, with Dr I R B a s h as regional geologist. The area lies to the north of Norwich (Figure 1). The market town of North Walsham extends onto {{the northern part of the}} sheet, and Worstead into the south-eastern corner. Apart fiom this the area is predominantly rural, with the small settlements of Westwick, Swanton Abbott and Skeyton in the south. In the north of the area the land rises to a plateau, with maximum altitudes of over 40 m OD at Lord Anson's Wood [26 281 and North Walsham [28 291. Small streams drain this plateau to the west, south and east, including Skeyton Beck in the northwest and Stakebridge and Westwick becks in the south. All are tributaries of the River Bure, which flows into the area known as the Norfolk Broads and ultimately drains to the sea at Great Ymouh. In the east the ground drops away rapidly into the valley of the River Ant, a major tributary of the Bure. In general the high plateau formed by the sands of the Corton Formation, which is very well drained, forms poor agricultural land and is traditionally grazed by sheep, hence the importance in medieval times of cloth manufxture in the village of Worstead. Nowadays much of this higher land is given over to <b>commercial</b> <b>woodland</b> and pheasant rearing. The remainder is wed for arable crops but requires intensive irrigation. However, some areas of the Corton Formation outcrop, particularly at lower levels, are covered by up to rather more than a metre of cover silt, and these areas, along with the outcrop of the Crag Group, produce excellent agricultural land, neither too heavy nor too light. Large crops of wheat, barley, sugar beet and potatoes are grown, and owing to the water-retentive properties of the cover silt, little artificial irrigation is required despite the low rainfall in this part of the country. The alluvium and peat outcrops of the Stakebridge Beck and Westwick Beck are given over to woodland and permanent pasture, grazed by cattle, sheep and horses. National Grid References in this report are given in square brackets; these all fall within 100 - kilometre square TG. All depths and thicknesses in the report are given in metres. The nonconfidential water wells and boreholes in the district are shown on Figure 2; identification numbers quoted are those of the BGS records collection, in which they are prefixed TG 22 NE.

5000|$|In March 1998, the Mansion House at Bagshot Park, {{including}} {{a block of}} stables and Sunningdale Lodge, was leased by the Crown Estate to Prince Edward for 50 years. The Mansion House was renovated as a residence for the prince. The renovation was partly funded by the Crown Estate and partly by Prince Edward. The renovation was originally estimated to cost £2.18m, with £1.6m from the Crown Estate and the remainder being paid by the prince. The National Audit Office (NAO) report on the transaction states that the final cost of renovations was £2.98m; the Crown Estate paid £1.6m and the estimated excess of £1.38m was paid by Prince Edward. The Crown Estate had previously received £1.8 million from the Ministry of Defence in respect of dilapidations by the Royal Army Chaplains' Department which offset {{the cost of the}} Crown Estate's share of the renovation costs. The prince rented it from the Crown Estate initially for £5,000 a year then after renovation rising to £90,000 a year subject to 15-year rent reviews linked to RPI. According to the NAO report, the property leased by the prince does not include <b>commercial</b> farmland or <b>woodland.</b> The lease agreement permits subletting of the stable block. [...] The prince is allowed to sell the lease or sub-lease the property after 8 years from the date of completion of the rectification works; the lease may not be assigned in the last 3 years of its life.
