40|$|Student Number : 9608998 A - MSc {{dissertation}} - School of Electrical and Information Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentThe {{history of}} <b>flux</b> <b>compression</b> is relatively short. One of the founders, a Russian physicist, Sakharov developed {{the idea of}} compressing a magnetic field to generate high magnetic fields and from this he also developed a generator to produce current impulses. Most of this initial work was performed in military research laboratories. The first open source literature became available in the 1960 s and from there {{it has become an}} international research arena. There are two types of <b>flux</b> <b>compression</b> generators, field generators and current generators. These are discussed along with the basic theory of <b>flux</b> <b>compression</b> generators and related physics. The efficiency of generators is often quite low. However in many generators high explosives are used and because of their high energy density, the current or field strength produced is substantially greater then the initial source. This of course limits the locations possible for experimental work and subsequently limits the industrial applications of <b>flux</b> <b>compression</b> generators. This research presents a theoretical design for a non-explosive <b>flux</b> <b>compression</b> generator. The generator is designed to produce a current impulse for tests in laboratory and remote locations. The generator has the advantage of being non-destructive, therefore reducing costs, and allowing for repeatable experiments. The design also reduces the possibilities or many of the loss mechanisms...|$|R

For that purpose, an exhaustive computational MHD analysis is a necessary step. This master thesis investigated the possibility of using PLUTO to estimate the ideal-MHD of a multi-coil parabolic reaction chamber. PLUTO is a freely-distributed and modular code for computational astrophysics that, although not originally programmed for engineering applications, has demonstrated great adaptation capabilities: implementing the boundary conditions to effectively emulate a magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>compression</b> reaction chamber has eventually been possible. Besides, the attained results are in accordance with theoretical projections and previous numerical analyses. However, the outcomes pointed out that ideal-MHD could be an over-simplified model: relativistic conditions, that are not properly reproduced by the ideal-MHD equations, have been identified in several locations of the computational domain. In addition, some aspects of the real system physics have yet to be thoroughly investigated as well as mathematically described. Therefore, further investigations are required. According to this research, no other computational analyses of a multi-coil parabolic reaction chamber (i. e. the latest and most promising magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>compression</b> reaction chamber concept) have been found in the literature.
