The ERL BPM consists of four 9. 33 mm diameter buttons mounted at 90 degree spacing in a cube with 1. 875 inch inside diameter. The buttons were designed by BNL and fabricated by Times Microwave Systems. Libera brilliance single pass BPM electronic modules with 700 MHz bandpass filter, manufactured by Instrumentation Technologies, {{will be used to}} measure the transverse beam positions at 14 locations around the ERL. The wire scanner assembly provides the ability to measure the BPM button response to a pulsed wire, and evaluate and calibrate the Libera position measurement electronics.

40|$|Abstract. A low-current GMAW {{experimental}} {{system is}} established using a constant current power supply and a <b>controlled</b> <b>wire</b> feed system. The metal transfer {{behavior and the}} droplet growing process in low-current GMAW are investigated by using a high-speed camera, and the welding current and voltage are monitored by a data acquisition set. The metal transfer in low-current GMAW can be classified into three modes: short-circuiting transfer, long-arc short-circuiting transfer and large globular transfer. The arc voltage is the primary factor that affects the metal transfer mode. The droplets growing in low-current GMAW are observed and analyzed. The maximum detaching size of the droplet and the corresponding growing time with different welding current are calculated from the recorded image sequences of metal transfer. Based on such results, a prediction model of the droplet size is thus established, which {{will be used in}} the future research on pulsed laser-enhanced GMAW...|$|E

The simplest {{example of such}} a reconfigurable metamaterial is a nanowire grid metasurface with subwavelength wire spacing. Recently we demonstrated computationally that such a metadevice with individually <b>controlled</b> <b>wire</b> positions could be used as dynamic diffraction grating, beam steering module and tunable focusing element. Here we report on the nanomembrane realization of such a nanowire grid metasurface constructed from individually addressable plasmonic chevron nanowires with a 230 nm x 100 nm cross-section, which consist of gold and silicon nitride. The active structure of the metadevice consists of 15 nanowires each 18 microns long and is fabricated by a combination of electron beam lithography and ion beam milling. It is packaged as a microchip device where the nanowires can be individually actuated by control currents via differential thermal expansion...|$|E
40|$|Assured {{safety and}} {{operational}} reliability of post-tensioned concrete components {{of nuclear power}} plants are of great significance to the public, electric utilities, and regulatory agencies. Prestressing tendons provide principal reinforcement for containment and other structures. In {{this phase of the}} research effort, the feasibility of developing a passive surveillance system for identification of ruptures in tendon wires was evaluated and verified. The concept offers high potential for greatly increasing effectiveness of presently-utilized periodic tendon condition surveillance programs. A one-tenth scale ring model of the Palo Verde nuclear containment structure was built inside the Structural Laboratory. Dynamic scaling (similitude) relationships were used to relate measured sensor responses recorded during <b>controlled</b> <b>wire</b> breakages to the expected prototype containment tendon response. Strong and recognizable signatures were detected by the accelerometers used. It was concluded that the unbonded prestressing tendons provide an excellent path for transmission of stress waves resulting from wire breaks. Accelerometers placed directly on the bearing plates at the ends of tendons recorded high-intensity waveforms. Accelerometers placed elsewhere on concrete surfaces of the containment model revealed substantial attenuation and reduced intensities of captured waveforms. Locations of wire breaks could be determined accurately through measurement of differences in arrival times of the signal at the sensors. Pattern recognition systems to be utilized in conjunction with the proposed concept will provide a basis for an integrated and automated tool for identification of wire breaks...|$|E
40|$|Nanofluids are {{engineered}} colloids {{composed of}} nano-size particles dispersed in common fluids {{such as water}} or refrigerants. Using an electrically <b>controlled</b> <b>wire</b> heater, pool boiling Critical Heat Flux (CHF) of Alumina and Silica water-based nanofluids of concentration {{less than or equal}} to 0. 1 percent by volume were measured. Silica nanofluids showed CHF enhancement up to 68 % and there seems to be a monotonic relationship between nanoparticle concentration and magnitude of enhancement. Alumina nanofluids had CHF enhancement up to 56 % but the peak occurred at the intermediate concentration. The boiling curves in nanofluid were found to shift to the left of that of water and correspond to higher nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficients in the two-phase flow regime. SEM images show a porous coating layer of nanoparticles on wires subjected to nanofluid CHF tests. These coating layers change the morphology of the heater's surface, and are responsible for the CHF enhancement. The thickness of the coating was estimated using SEM and was found ranging from 3. 0 to 6. 0 micrometers for Alumina, and 3. 0 to 15. 0 micrometers for Silica. Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses were also attempted to quantify the mass of the particle deposition but the results were inconsistent with the estimates from the SEM measurement. by Bao H.

40|$|The unique {{properties}} {{exhibited by}} bismuth antimony (Bi 1 -xSbx) nanostructures and the theoretical predictions on their enhanced thermoelectric efficiency {{two decades ago}} triggered {{the development of a}} wide variety of growth and characterization methods aiming at measuring the thermoelectric properties of Bi 1 -xSbx nanowires. However, the experimental demonstration of a size-dependent thermoelectric efficiency is still challenged by the difficulties to fabricate well-defined nanowire systems and to achieve reliable and stable electrical and thermal contacts. In this work, Bi 1 -xSbx nanowire arrays with <b>controlled</b> <b>wire</b> composition (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) and diameter (from 750 to 40 nm) were synthesized by pulsed electrodeposition in etched ion-track membranes. The thermoelectric properties of Bi 1 -xSbx are strongly influenced by the anisotropic structure of the material. Thus, special consideration was taken in studying the influence of the electrodeposition conditions on the crystallographic orientation and composition of the wires for various diameters. To characterize the wires several methods were applied, including X-ray diffraction and both scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using such pre-characterized Bi 1 -xSbx nanowires, measurements of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistance were performed in the temperature between 300 and 20 K and for a systematic variation of the composition and diameter of the wires. The Seebeck coefficient values show a non-monotonic behavior when decreasing the wire diameter, which is explained by taking into account the existence of surface states as well as quantum- and finite-size effects. Finally, the chemical and thermal stability of the Bi 1 -xSbx nanowires was investigated in air both at room and moderate temperatures, revealing the rapid formation of a metal oxide phase. The oxidation process causes an increase of the nanowires surface roughness at low annealing temperatures, and the formation of protuberances at 250 °C. Our results on oxidation explain the diverse and high resistance values available in literature and the difficulties to electrically contact single Bi 1 -xSbx nanowires reported by other group...|$|E

The establishment of structure-property relationships {{is central to}} molecular science and this principle applies equally well to the developing field of molecular and organic/polymer electronics. My dissertation research centers on studying the structure-property relationship of charge transport in molecular wires. In particular it involves demonstrating a long-standing prediction of a mechanistic transition from tunneling to hopping as the lengths of molecular wires are varied. In analogous conceptual and technical frameworks, my research has continued to examine hopping conduction {{as a function of}} precisely controlled chain architectures. These experiments directly address variable rates of intrachain hopping conduction upon a change of structural entities, which will provide guidance in designing highly conductive molecular wires as well as understanding transport in bulk organic devices. In this work, we provided direct evidence for a change in transport mechanism from tunneling to hopping in molecular junctions based on three conjugated systems; oligophenyleneimine (OPI) wires ranging in length from 1. 5 - 7. 3 nm, oligonaphthalene-fluoreneimine (ONI) wires from 2. 3 - 10. 1 nm, and oligotetrafulvalenepyromellitimide-imine (OTPI) wires from 2. 5 - 20. 2 nm. Our experimental approach involved contacting molecular wires that were grown from one electrode using controlled aryl imine addition chemistry; a metal-coated atomic force microscope tip is used to make the second contact. We showed that near 4 or 5 nm in length the mechanism of transport in the wires changes abruptly, as evidenced by striking changes in length, temperature and electric field dependence of the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. For longer wires, {{we have been able to}} analyze the bias dependence to establish at least three different regimes of transport, and we were also able to estimate the single wire conductivity and the hopping energy for each wires, which shows the great sensitivity of hopping transport to the precisely <b>controlled</b> <b>wire</b> architectures in solid-states for the first time. Overall, these experiments open significant opportunities to probe the physical organic chemistry of molecular conduction, e. g. the roles of specific functional groups and bonding architectures on hopping transport in molecular wires...|$|E
