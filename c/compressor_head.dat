The test results were obtained using an air-source heat pump set-up with enhanced surface tubing under various magnetic field conditions. Performance tests were conducted according to the ARI/ASHRAE Standards. The test results demonstrated that as magnetic field force increases, <b>compressor</b> <b>head</b> pressure and discharge temperature slightly increase as well as less liquid refrigerant is boiling in the compressor shell. This has a positive effect in protecting the compressor. The effect of magnetic field on mixture behaviour varies from one mixture to another depending upon the mixture’s composition and its boiling point. Furthermore, the use of magnetic field {{appears to have a}} positive influence on the system COP as well as thermal capacities of condenser and evaporator. Copyright # 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Mobile air {{conditioning}} circulating oil concentration and compressor start-up torque were experimentally investigated {{to develop a}} control strategy to improve compressor reliability. An installed electronic expansion valve provided the control actuation. Realtime circulating oil concentration data were obtained for steady-state, quasi-steady, and start-up operating regimes with an installed optical concentration sensor. A two-phase refrigerant-oil model was developed for R 134 a and polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil to predict oil film thickness, average film velocity, and interfacial shear between the refrigerant vapor and the refrigerant-oil liquid film. Experimental and model results were analyzed and compared. Evaporator superheat reduced the circulating oil concentration due {{to an increase in}} the oil film thickness {{on the walls of the}} evaporator and suction line. The model predicted oil film thickness to increase by a factor of four as refrigerant quality approaches one. Increasing the refrigerant-mass flow rate only exhibited secondary effects due to slightly thinner oil films and a correspondingly higher circulating oil concentration. The influences of charge distribution, expansion valve position, <b>compressor</b> <b>head</b> pressure, and refrigerant charge level on start-up torque and initial capacity were investigated. Closing the expansion valve while the compressor clutch is disengaged was found to reduce the start-up torque by retaining the refrigerant in the system high side and preserving a pressure gradient across the expansion valve.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{development}} of a microcompressor (MC) theoretically capable of delivering pressure ratios from 16 : 1 to 25 : 1 for design flow rates, of about 0. 15 std. cm 3 /s, intended to provide flow for a mixed refrigerant Joule-Thomson (J-T) microcryocooler. The J-T microcryocooler supports on-chip cooling applications, such as terahertz and infrared imaging sen-sors operating at about 77 K that require less than 5 mW of net refrigeration. The high pressure ratio of the compressor is enabled by minimizing dead volume and using a 10 mm diameter metal-ized polyamide membrane 500 μm thick that is actuated by a lead zirconium titanate piezoelectric (PZT) stack. With a stroke of about 28 μm and a swept volume of about 2 mm 3, the design flow rate could be achieved with a drive frequency of about 100 Hz. The entire microcryocooler, compressor module, sensor, and thermal integration module are expected to occupy less than 10 cm 3 volume. At present the compressor module demonstrates a pressure ratio of 21 : 1 when blanked off and has a volume less than 2 cm 3. Numerous design iterations to achieve the 21 : 1 ratio, studies comparing stroke and volume vs. frequency to achieve design flow rates, and measured power consumption as a function of drive frequency are discussed. Design alternatives for the valves in the <b>compressor</b> <b>head,</b> including passive micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) and active PZT, with prepara-tions to measure pressure ratios and flow rates with both valve types also presented...|$|E
40|$|LectureThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) ?Performance Test Code on Compressors and Exhausters,? ASME PTC 10 - 1997, {{has served}} {{worldwide}} {{as the standard}} for determining centrifugal compressor thermodynamic performance during factory acceptance and field performance testing. The methodology applied in PTC 10 {{is based upon the}} original work of Schultz (1962) which utilizes a polytropic model of the compression process. Recent efforts associated with the selection and testing of compressors for high pressure carbon dioxide/hydrocarbon mixture reinjection compression services have revealed that the application of PTC 10 can result in significant errors in the estimation of <b>compressor</b> polytropic <b>head</b> and efficiency. The defined evaluation procedures use compressor suction and discharge pressures and temperatures along with gas composition to determine the thermodynamic properties necessary to derive the estimated head and efficiency. While it is recognized that these properties vary continuously from suction to discharge, average properties are used along with a correction factor proposed by Schultz (1962) to correct for variations in these properties along the actual compression path followed. Previous investigations by Mallen and Saville (1977), Huntington (1985), and Hundseid, Bakken and Helde (2006) have identified errors in some compressor applications and have proposed methods to address these issues, however, they have not fully identified the root cause nor the conditions under which these errors become significant. The results of this effort will: 1. Illustrate those portions of the test code procedures that are subject to errors caused by unique process conditions. 2. Identify those gas conditions where the errors incurred in the application of the code are significant. 3. Propose an alternate evaluation method of test results and predictions that will reduce errors in the calculation of derived properties relevant to determination of compressor performance parameters. Actual factory and field test data have been utilized where appropriate and available to support the theoretical principles developed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Turkey {{is located}} between Europe, which has {{increasing}} demand {{for natural gas}} and the geographies of Middle East, Asia and Russia, which have rich and strong natural gas supply. Because of the geographical location, Turkey has strategic importance according to energy sources. To supply this demand, a pipeline network configuration with the optimal and efficient lengths, pressures, diameters and number of compressor stations is extremely needed. Because, Turkey has a currently working and constructed network topology, obtaining an optimal configuration of the pipelines, including an optimal number of compressor stations with optimal locations, {{is the focus of}} this study. Identifying a network design with lowest costs is important because of the high maintenance and set-up costs. The quantity of compressor stations, the pipeline segments` lengths, the diameter sizes and pressures at compressor stations, are considered to be decision variables in this study. Two existing optimization models were selected and applied to the case study of Turkey. Because of the fixed cost of investment, both models are formulated as mixed integer nonlinear programs, which require branch and bound combined with the nonlinear programming solution methods. The differences between these two models are related to some factors that can affect the network system of natural gas such as wall thickness, material balance <b>compressor</b> isentropic <b>head</b> and amount of gas to be delivered. The results obtained by these two techniques are compared {{with each other and with}} the current system. Major differences between results are costs, pressures and flow rates. These solution techniques are able to find a solution with minimum cost for each model both of which are less than the current cost of the system while satisfying all the constraints on diameter, length, flow rate and pressure. These results give the big picture of an ideal configuration for the future state network for the country of Turkey...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 77 - 92 Operating and {{maintaining}} key rotating equipment in a petrochemical service and tight economic constraints requires an indepth evaluation in performance deterioration of key gas turbines and {{axial flow compressor}} parameters. By upgrading the required instrumentation on a gas turbine and an axial flow compressor, and indepth performance simulation and evaluation {{can be made in}} order to determine the overall thermodynamic performance and mechanical deterioration of the train. With the proper instrumentation, critical parameters in the gas turbine such as component efficiencies, power, head, turbine firing temperature, heat rate, and heat balance can be computed. On the axial flow <b>compressor,</b> section efficiencies, <b>head,</b> power, flow, and head coefficients can be computed. By understanding all the performance parameters and obtaining a good running history on these parameters, one can easily determine the condition of the rotating equipment at any given time. Based on these results, operation and maintenance techniques can be instituted. Major rotating equipment overhaul intervals can be identified by closely monitoring the performed deterioration parameters of any gas turbine or axial flow compressor. This enables the unit to be operated with confidence through a planned major overhaul. On a separate occasion, a costly emergency shutdown was avoided by constantly monitoring the mechanical and thermodynamic performance of the compressor train until operations created an outage time. The outage time was based on preparation to minimize the downtime, as well as take into consideration product delivery schedules. Detail analysis of the gas turbine and axial flow compressor train computer simulation is presented to enable the reader to fully evaluate their own compressor train under various operating parameters such as molecular weight, speed, and varying inlet conditions, both process as well as ambient...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} four existing {{gaps and}} missing {{facilities in the}} route to improve the capabilities to model an entire oil and gas field extending from the reservoir to the field sales point. Such a model, referred by {{the oil and gas}} industry as Integrated Asset Model (IAM), enables mathematical assessments of the trade-offs between design, operational alternatives and mathematical optimization subject to the entire system constraints. The gaps and issues addressed are divided into the following chapters: Chapter 1 - Describes the basics of the IAM approach and software packages throughout used in this research. Chapter 2 - Describes a methodology to develop a low cost field simulator tool where coupling a hydrocarbon production system, from reservoir to the sales point is presented. A gas-condensate reservoir has been chosen, scaled-up by previous researchers. The study undertakes a compositional characterization of the reservoir fluids, and calculations of flow in reservoir, wells, surface network, and LNG plant. Some of the challenges faced have been the coupling and transfer of information of thermodynamic models and fluid properties from the reservoir to the production network system. Linking reservoir and process simulator to get a field production simulator can be a very useful tool but it still need to be improved on running the simulator for each Reservoir time step and Process Simulator and reservoir fluid updates before moving to the next reservoir time step. Chapter 3 - Proposes the development of a tool inside the Process Simulator Hysys that applies the Huntington method (1985) for calculation of a subsea <b>compressor</b> polytropic <b>head</b> (Wet Gas <b>Compressor).</b> The current methods available in the process simulator Hysys are valid only for dry gas. For wet gas these models fail. Previous authors(For example Hundseid 2006 - 2008) have worked on the topic before but none of them developed it as a routine and made available as a tool in the process simulator where it is easier to use even for those that are not familiar with the complex calculations. Implementing a routine in the process simulator, would make available a tool for wet gas compressor calculation. Chapter 4 - Presents a model-based study for accelerated production of an oil field. It combines two mature Enhanced Oil Recovery technologies: Miscible of Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) injection and a down hole Electric Submersible Pump (ESP). The field used as test case was a Multi-well oil field undergoing WAG, originally studied by Killough and Kossack (1987). The integrated approach proposed for field production strategy with the ESP is relevant with regard to the achievable early production. Gas-Alternating-Water recovery method with the installation of an ESP has shown accelerating oil recovery although the investment costs can be high Chapter 5 - Deals with the fluid dynamic and thermodynamic aspects of Chokes. The first part of the chapter presents predictions of the outlet temperature. Different combinations of thermodynamic processes, containing expanders and valves, have been considered to identify the configuration that better represents the experimental data (gathered by a previous researcher) in a process simulator. There are recognized areas governed by gas, oil and water, and some differences among the configurations of the model. It was observed that the pressure drop across the Choke is not fully isenthalpic as there was enthalpy variation. The biggest variation was observed in the gas dominated zone. The second part of the chapter deals with the prediction of mass flow from wells using chokes, based on available inlet and outlet measurements –pressure and temperature. The simple Bernoulli equation adapted for multiphase outperformed some of well known models used in {{the oil and gas industry}}. Because of its good performance, this new technology could reduce costs with the installation of physical multiphase flowmeters in subsea wells. With those models included in an IAM tool a reliable and low-cost tool can be available for field development studies, field planning and operations...|$|R
