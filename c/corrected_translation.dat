5000|$|Another scholar, April D. DeConick, a {{professor}} of Biblical studies at Rice University, opines in an op-ed in The New York Times that the National Geographic translation was critically faulty in many substantial respects, and that based on a <b>corrected</b> <b>translation,</b> Judas was actually a demon, truly betraying Jesus, rather than following his orders. DeConick, after re-translating the text, published The Thirteenth Apostle: What the Gospel of Judas Really Says to assert that Judas was not a daimon in the Greek sense, but that [...] "the universally accepted word for 'spirit' is 'pneuma' — in Gnostic literature 'daimon' is always taken to mean 'demon'". She further stated that [...] "Judas is not set apart 'for' the holy generation, as the National Geographic translation says, he is separated 'from' it." [...] DeConick went on to ask, [...] "Were they genuine errors or was something more deliberate going on?" [...] The National Geographic Society responded that [...] "virtually all issues April D. DeConick raises about translation choices are addressed in footnotes in both the popular and critical editions".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for on-line nonlinear filtering based on wavelet thresholding. Online multiscale (OLMS) rectification applies wavelet thresholding to {{data in a}} moving window of dyadic length to remove random errors. Gross errors are removed by combining wavelet thresholding with multiscale median filtering. Theoretical analysis shows that OLMS rectification using Haar wavelets subsumes mean filters of dyadic length, while rectification with smoother boundary corrected wavelets is analogous to adaptive exponential smoothing. If the rectified measurements are not needed on-line, the quality of rectification can be further improved by averaging the rectified signals in each window. The resulting approach overcomes the boundary effects encountered in translation invariant (TI) rectification of Coifman and Donoho (1995), and is called boundary <b>corrected</b> <b>translation</b> invariant (BCTI) rectification. Examples based on synthetic and industrial data demonstrate {{the benefits of the}} on-line multiscale and boundary <b>corrected</b> <b>translation</b> invariant rectification methods. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Correspondence to {{this article should be addressed}} to Bhavik R.

40|$|Abstract. Translation Validation is an {{approach}} of ensuring compilation correctness {{in which each}} compiler run {{is followed by a}} validation pass that proves that the target code produced by the compiler is a <b>correct</b> <b>translation</b> (implementation) of the source code. In this work, we extend the existing framework for translation validation of optimizing compilers to deal with procedural programs and define the notion of <b>correct</b> <b>translation</b> for reactive programs with intermediate inputs and outputs. We present an Interprocedural Translation Validation algorithm that automatically proves <b>correct</b> <b>translation</b> of the source program to the target program in presence of interprocedural optimizations such as global constant propagation, inlining, tail-recursion elimination, interprocedural dead code elimination, dead argument elimination, and cloning. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. View {{updating}} is a {{long standing}} difficult problem. Given a view defined over base data sources and a view update, there are several different updates over the base data sources, called translations, that perform the update. A translation {{is said to be}} correct if it performs the update {{and at the same time}} does not update any portion of the view not specified in the update (no view side-effects). The view update prob-lem finds a <b>correct</b> <b>translation</b> for a given view update if one exists. In the relational scenario, previous research has attempted to study the view update problem either by utilizing only the schema knowledge, or by directly examining the base data. While utilizing only the schema knowledge is very efficient, we are not guaranteed to find a <b>correct</b> <b>translation</b> even if one exists. On the other hand, examining the base data is guaranteed to find a <b>correct</b> <b>translation</b> if one exists, but is very time-consuming. The view update problem is even more complex in the XML context due to the nested hi-erarchical structure of XML and the restructuring capabilities of the XQUERY view specification. In this paper we propose a schema-centric framework, named HUX, for efficiently updating XML views specified over relational databases. HUX is com-plete (always finds a <b>correct</b> <b>translation</b> if one exists) and is efficient. The efficiency of HUX is achieved as follows. Given a view update, HUX first exploits the schema to determine whether there will never be a <b>correct</b> <b>translation,</b> or there will always be a <b>correct</b> <b>translation.</b> Only if the update cannot be classified using the schema, HUX will examine the base data to determine if there is a <b>correct</b> <b>translation.</b> This data-level checking is further optimized in HUX, by exploiting the schema knowledge extracted in the first step to significantly prune the space of potential translations that is explored. Experiments illustrate the performance benefits of HUX over previ-ous solutions. ...|$|R

These variegated states are now understood to be different stages along a common evolutionary path. An overview is proposed, beginning with the earliest stages of monosyllabicization, before the generalization of a strictly monosyllabic phonological structure. The well-documented processes of consonantal depletion which {{lead to the development}} of phonation-type registers and tones are set out within a general model. Lastly, phonological evolutions observed at advanced stages of segmental depletion are discussed. The concluding note concerns the aftermath of segmental depletion: the re-creation of polysyllables. 亚洲语言显示出一种音系结构连续体：从接近双音节结构的'一个半音节'结构（sesquisyllabic structure）到高度衰减的单音节。历史语言学研究证明，这些不同的状态处于共同演变路径上的不同阶段。本文从单音节化的最早阶段谈起，阐明辅音弱化的过程如何导致发声态音域和声调的产生，最后分析在音段衰竭晚期所观察到的音系演变现象。结语论及音段衰竭的后果：多音节的再生...|$|E

Experimental results show that our method is effective.
