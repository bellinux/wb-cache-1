Thirteen major bacterial phyla were identified of which Firmicutes, Chloroflexi and Thermi were dominant in Jakrem and Proteobacteria in Yumthang. The dominant genera were Clostridium, Chloroflexus and Meiothermus at Jakrem (water temperature 46  °C, pH 9) and Thiobacillus, Sulfuritalea at Yumthang (water temperature 39  °C, pH 8) hot springs.

In our study, tests were carried out using dolomite from Granada, Spain, that was previously calcined and sulphurised at high temperature with a gas similar to that produced in gasification facilities. To approximate real-scale results, a relatively large amount of substance was used for each sample (100 – 150 g) and the samples were used in a fixed-bed position. The influence of different conditions, such as grain size, composition of the oxidation gas, gas velocity, bed length and temperature, was them investigated. The final solid products were characterised by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis and the CO 2, SO 2, H 2 S and COS concentrations in the gases produced during oxidation were analysed by gas chromatography.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} hearth operation and the factors influencing the total quality of hot metal, especially its carbon and sulphur contents. Regarding the hot metal quality there are many sources of disturbances starting from raw materials, continuing through the blast furnace process and ending the hot metal casting. The carbon content of hot metal {{is an important part of}} the total quality of hot metal. Nearly 80  % of the total reaction energy in the BOF process comes from the oxidation of carbon in hot metal. Therefore, a high and stable carbon content of hot metal is most beneficial. Sulphur in hot metal is known to retard the carbonisation of hot metal. The sulphur content in hot metal is controlled by the sulphur load in the coke and other fuels as well as the slag basicity and low level of unreduced iron oxides. Both carbonisation and desulphurisation are strongly dependent on the hearth operation. To secure a proper hearth operation the hearth coke, the deadman should neither be clogged nor get inactive. Good hearth operation prolongs the campaign life of the hearth lining improving thus the total economy. In this work the factors influencing the hot metal carbon content have been investigated. The carbonisation of solid iron starts in the shaft by CO gas and also by coke carbon when the metal melts down. Hot metal does not get saturated with carbon. The difference between the saturation and actual carbon contents was observed to be around 0. 7  % in average and it increases with increasing sulphur content. The carbon content of hot metal can be maintained on a high level by keeping the sulphur content of hot metal below 0. 05  % which can be attained with a sufficient slag basicity, e. g. CaO / SiO =  1. 2. A progressive vicious circle in blast furnace operation was observed. Problems may start with some disturbance in the hearth operation gradually resulting in low permeability or total clogging of the deadman. The raceways become shorter which leads to a hanging cohesive zone. A hanging cohesive zone transfers insufficiently reduced iron oxides into the slag. Desulphurisation of hot metal weakens due to a higher FeO content in the slag. A high sulphur content in hot metal promotes the precipitation of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide.</b> <b>Calcium</b> <b>sulphide</b> together with other compounds with high melting point may clog the hearth further. There are several factors which strengthen vicious circle like a low heat level, an overfilled hearth, too acid slag etc. Different factors influencing the hearth phenomena and start up of the vicious circle including CaS precipitation were observed and analysed in this work. Early warning symptoms of a clogged hearth and methods to identify an inactive deadman were collected. Measures to cure an inactive deadman were developed and practised as well. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study on mineral layer formation at the coke-iron boundary during coke dissolution {{has been carried}} out.

In this article the formation of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide</b> at the coke-iron boundary is discussed.

The ratios of calcium and aluminium found in the mineral layer indicate that the layer is composed of alumina, CA 6, CA 2 and CA.

40|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>sulphide</b> is an {{undesirable}} {{product from}} both FBC and topping cycle gasifiers. Unfortunately, its direct oxidation in a FBC environment is made difficult {{due to the}} fact that unreacted CaS is protected from further reaction with O 2 by formation of a CaSO 4 shell. In previous work it was often implied that oxidation of CaS occurred solely by reaction with O 2. However, this study shows that CO 2 can be an effective oxidant for CaS at temperatures above 600 °C. Furthermore, it appears that the principal gas phase products are SO 2 and CO, and direct attempts to measure COS using mass spectrometry suggest that its formation is negligible. Somewhat surprisingly SO 2 /CO molar ratios are in the range of 0. 4 to 0. 5, which is problematic, if the dominant reaction is CaS+ 3 CO 2 =CaO+ 3 CO+SO 2, unless CO 2 is reacting to form elemental carbon, which appears unlikely, or side reactions occur, leading to a variety of gaseous products. These results also suggest that CO itself has no significant part in the oxidation process at least up to 850 °C or more. Reaction with H 2 O also begins above 600 °C, but it is a much less effective oxidant, and experiments with CO 2 /H 2 O further support the idea that CO 2 is the more important oxidant in that system and might be used to destroy CaS from the topping cycle gasifier...|$|E

The inclusion populations were found to increasewith ladle age (number of heats ladle being used) beforealuminium deoxidation and before casting. A substantialincrease in inclusion population was noticed after a certainladle age. The analyses of the steel samples from thesolidified ingot revealed a non-uniform distribution ofinclusions. The inclusion populations in the final productswere also found to increase with the ladle age. Totally four types of inclusions, viz. Type- 1 (MgO), Type- 2 (an oxide solution), Type- 3 (spinel), and Type- 4 (spinel in thecenter surrounded by the oxide solution of Type- 2) wereobserved before deoxidation. Thermodynamic calculation revealedthat the Type- 2 and Type- 4 inclusions were generated by thereactions between EAF slag and ladle glaze. Three types ofinclusions were found before casting, viz. Type- 6 (spinel inthe center surrounded by the oxide solution of Type- 7), Type- 7 (oxide solution with low contents of MgO and SiO 2), and Type- 8 (small MgO islands embedded in anoxide solution). Inclusions of both Type- 6 and Type- 7 were theproducts of the reaction between inclusions of Type- 3 and theliquid metal. On the other hand, the occurrence of pieces ofMgO having sharp edges in the oxide solution suggested that theType- 8 inclusions were generated by the ladle glaze. In thesteel samples during mould fillings, totally three types ofinclusions namely, Type- 6, Type- 7, and Type- 9 (alumina basedinclusions) were found. The Type- 9 inclusions were originatedfrom {{the erosion of the}} nozzles and the closing gates duringthe mould filling. The steel samples after casting were foundto contain inclusions of Type- 6, Type- 7, Type- 9, Type- 10 (alumina-silicate oxide solution), and Type- 11 (spinel phasewith <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide).</b> The types of inclusions were found tovary with the position in the ingot. In the final productsType- 6, Type- 7, and Type- 11 inclusions were found. While almostall the inclusions in the final products were originated in theladle before casting, sulphur was detected in all types ofinclusions. The increase in the sulphur activity of the steelmelt during casting was the cause of the formation ofoxide-sulphide and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide</b> phases in the inclusionsdetected after casting and in the final products. A preliminary examination on the possibility of inclusionseparation by bubble floatation using cold models was alsocarried out. Deionised water and silicon oil were used as thebulk phase.

The examination of thecharcoal-water-gas system indicated that the positivefloatation coefficient was not a sufficient condition for theinclusion separation. The experimental results were found to bein contradiction with the prediction of a typical model thatconsiders interfacial energies. The omitting of the drag forcewas believed to be the reason causing the failure of the modelprediction in the charcoal-water-gas system.

The aim of this paper was advanced removal of these compounds. Dolomite, which reacts with H 2 S to yield <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide,</b> was chosen from among several earth-alkaline compounds for research due to its properties and low cost in reducing the presence of H 2 S in coal gasification.

40|$|In steelmaking, {{commonly}} used calcium treatment has {{the benefit of}} modifying inclusion composition, and the shape and size of these inclusions are also adjusted. Two of the main advantages of calcium treatment are not only {{the improvement of the}} castability but also the improvement of the final properties of the steels' machinability, toughness and surface quality. The effects of calcium are mainly based on its strong ability to form sulphides and oxides. In aluminium deoxidised steels, the inclusion population will generally include alumina inclusions and maybe some silicates and manganese sulphides. After calcium treatment, the inclusions are restricted mainly to calcium aluminates (CaO-Al 2 O 3) and the sulphur in the steel is associated with these inclusions as <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide.</b> The topic of the present study concerns the basic mechanism and kinetics of the transformation process of alumina inclusions in steel when calcium is introduced into the steel e. g., by wire feeding or powder injection. To clarify the mechanisms, several types of model experiments were performed in laboratory furnaces and on an industrial scale. Reactions between only Al 2 O 3 and CaO were studied in a laboratory furnace. The phases formed during the reaction between Al 2 O 3 and CaO were examined by SEM-EDS, and a discussion of the proposed reaction sequence of Al 2 O 3 ⇒CA 6 ⇒CA 2 ⇒CA⇒CAx (liquid) was based on the experimental observations and thermodynamic equilibrium examinations.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{body of work}} exists around coke dissolution into liquid iron, however {{there are}} key aspects of this important reaction that are not well described. This study was focused on gaining {{the answers to the}} questions “How does the coke mineral matter behave during coke dissolution?” and “Can the effects of sulphur and oxide layer formation on the dissolution rate be separated and quantified?”. Issues that must be addressed if the understanding of the kinetics of this reaction is to be advanced and coke 2 ̆ 7 s use in the blast furnace further optimised. To this end, a detailed investigation was conducted examining the influence of coke mineral matter on coke (carbon) dissolution into liquid iron. This project was focused on the mineral matter layer that forms at the coke/iron interface and how the presence of this layer affects the kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke into the liquid iron. A range of experimental techniques were used to identify and characterise the mineral layer as it formed at the coke/iron interface and to assess the layers influence on the carbon dissolution kinetics. Carbon dissolution experiments, utilising a carburiser cover technique, were carried out where carbon and sulphur transfer to an iron-carbon melt was measured over time at temperatures of 1450 °C, 1500 °C and 1550 °C. This technique allowed fundamental data on the dissolution rate constant to be calculated, and the effects of temperature, melt sulphur and different carbonaceous materials to be explored. Development of the mineral layer at the coke/iron interface as a function of both time and temperature was studied utilising a quenched carbon dissolution technique that was developed during the project. This technique had the additional benefit of allowing the composition of the melt to be determined for a larger range of elements than the dissolution experiments. The quenched carbon dissolution experiments complemented the carbon dissolution experiments and allowed direct comparisons between the dissolution behaviour measured in the dissolution experiments and the composition and morphology of the mineral layer observed in the quenched samples. The dissolution studies were further complemented by sessile drop measurements of the wetting behaviour of iron on the mineral phases that were identified in the mineral layer present at the coke/iron interface, thermodynamic modelling utilising the MTDATA software package and a conceptual model of the interfacial mineral layer. A mineral layer was observed to have formed at the coke/iron interface during coke dissolution into liquid iron at experimental temperatures ranging from 1450 °C to 1550 °C. The mineral layer was solid at these temperatures and persistent at the interface. The amount of mineral matter present in the mineral layer was observed to be increasing with increased reaction time. The composition and structure of the mineral layer changed with both experimental time and temperature. The composition of the mineral layer was principally composed of oxides of aluminium and calcium, present as various calcium aluminates and calcium sulphides. Initially the mineral layer was a loose agglomeration of particles of which a majority were alumina particles. As the dissolution reaction proceeded, the loose agglomeration of particles was replaced by an open acicular layer that was predominantly the calcium aluminate CaO. 6 Al 2 O 3 (CA 6). As the dissolution reaction continued further, the calcium aluminates became increasingly richer in calcium oxide, with the predominate phase present in the mineral layer progressing through the calcium aluminates phases CA 6 to CaO. 2 Al 2 O 3 (CA 2) and onto CaO. Al 2 O 3 (CA). The apparent calcium enrichment of the mineral layer was observed to occur more rapidly as the experimental temperature increased. Accompanying the compositional changes in the mineral layer, the morphology of the mineral layer was also observed to change. The mineral layer was formed as an initial loose agglomeration of alumina particles, changing to an open acicular structure consisting of CA 6 /CA 2 before being converted to a dense layer as the dissolution reaction proceeded and the composition of the mineral layer changed to CA and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide</b> (CaS) appeared at the interface. It was found that the formation of the <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide</b> layer was preceded by the formation of the calcium aluminate layer. Only after the calcium aluminate layer had experienced progressive calcium enrichment and the CA and CA 2 phases had formed did the CaS phase appear at the iron interface. Thermodynamic analysis of the experimental results confirmed that the formation of the calcium enriched calcium aluminates, CA 2 and CA, were a necessary requirement to stabilise the <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide</b> layer for the coke composition studied. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke to the liquid iron were observed to be dependent on the structure of the interfacial mineral layer. This dependence was manifest as two stage behaviour in the first order mass transfer plots. The initial stage, characterised by rapid carbon dissolution, was observed while the mineral layer was developing or had the open acicular structure of the CA 6 /CA 2 layer. The second stage was characterised by a significant reduction in the rate of carbon dissolution. The onset of the second stage was coincident with the change in the composition of the mineral layer from CA 6 /CA 2 to CA 2 /CA and the associated densification of the mineral layer. In stating that the nature of the mineral layer affects the dissolution kinetics, a change in the reaction control mechanism is implied. This represents a change in the coke dissolution kinetics from simple mass transfer control to a mixed control regime where both mass transfer and the mineral (product) layer are active. In an attempt to overcome the problems associated with the heterogeneity of coke a coke analogue was developed. In the coke analogue the composition and dispersion of the carbonaceous and mineral matter (oxides) are controlled and the porosity is fixed. When single phase calcium aluminates were introduced into the coke analogues, calcium enrichment of the resulting calcium aluminate mineral layer was observed. The observed carbon dissolution kinetics were dependant on the structure of the interfacial calcium aluminate layer. Consistent with the coke dissolution studies, the calcium aluminate layer formed at the coke analogue iron interface during carbon dissolution was at least in part rate controlling the carbon dissolution reaction for the coke analogues studied. Utilising the sessile drop experimental technique the wettability with liquid ironcarbon-sulphur alloys of the predominate phases that were observed in the mineral layer were measured. It was observed that the contact angle decreased as the proportion of lime (CaO) in the calcium aluminate increased. Further it was observed that while the presence of sulphur in the melt increased the contact angle for the alumina and CA 6 substrates, on the CA 2 and CA substrates the contact angle was decreased. The improvement in the wetting of the CA 2 and CA substrates with sulphur was attributed to the formation of CaS at the substrate/droplet interface. This study has produced new fundamental data on the growth and development of the mineral layer and the wettability of the predominate calcium aluminates observed in the mineral layer. These detailed studies have illuminated the changing nature of the layer in terms of both composition and morphology and found that the kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke to the liquid iron were dependant on the structure of the interfacial mineral layer...|$|E

The hazard property HP 12 is defined as “Release of an acute toxic gas”: waste which releases acute toxic gases (Acute Tox. 1, 2 or 3) in contact with water or an acid. When a waste contains a substance {{assigned to one of}} the following supplemental hazards EUH 029, EUH 031 and EUH 032, it shall be classified as hazardous by HP 12 according to test methods or guidelines (EC, 2014 a, 2014 b). When the substances with the cited hazard statement codes react with water or an acid, they can release HCl, Cl 2, HF, HCN, PH 3, H 2 S, SO 2 (and two other gases very unlikely to be emitted, hydrazoic acid HN 3 and selenium oxide SeO 2 – a solid with low vapor pressure). Hence, a method is proposed : - 1. Measurement of the volume of gases emitted into contact with water or an acid (solid/liquid ratio of 10 L water or acid/kg raw waste, acid 2. 5 M HNO 3). - 2. If gas is emitted at a rate higher than 0. 1 L of gas/kg waste in 5 min (limit of quantification of the automated calcimètre used here), checking if one of the cited gases is emitted with electrochemical detection probes or simple qualitative colorimetric methods. - 3. If one of these gases is detected, speciation of the emitting substance(s) (calculation by the “worst case” method from elements concentrations, or by specific analytic methods) and checking whether they have a hazard statement code EUH 029, EUH 031 or EUH 032 (a list is provided). For a set of 49 waste, water addition did not produce gas. Nearly all the solid waste produced a gas in contact with hydrochloric acid in 5 min in an automated calcimeter with a volume > 0. 1 L of gas per kg of waste. Since a plateau of pressure is reached only for half of the samples in 5 min, 6 h trial with calorimetric bombs or glass flasks were done and confirmed the results. Identification of the gases by portable probes showed that most of the tested samples emit mainly CO 2. Toxic gases are emitted by four waste: metallic dust from the aluminum industry (CO), two air pollution control residue of industrial waste incinerator (H 2 S) and a halogenated solvent (organic volatile(s) compound(s)). HF has not been measured in these trials started before the present definition of HP 12. According to the definition of HP 12, only the H 2 S emission of substances with hazard statement EUH 031 is accounted for. In view of the calcium content of the two air pollution control residue, the presence of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide</b> (EUH 031) can be assumed. These two waste are therefore classified potentially hazardous for HP 12, from a total of 49 waste. They are also classified as hazardous for other properties (HP 7, 10 and 14 for one of them, and HP 10 and 14 for the other one respectively). Given these results, it can be assumed that few common household and industrial waste will be classified hazardous only by HP 12...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Precipitated calcium {{carbonate}} (PCC) is a material {{of great interest}} due to its large range of applications in polymer composites, as rubber filler, additive for plastics, paints and paper, and in pharmaceuticals. PCC {{is also known as}} purified or synthetic {{calcium carbonate}} and has the same chemical formula (CaCO 3) as other types of calcium carbonate such as limestone, marble and chalk. CaCO 3 crystallizes in several different schemes of atomic arrangements, called polymorphs. The typical morphologies of CaCO 3 polymorphs are generally classified as rhombohedral calcite, spherical vaterite and needle-like aragonite. The application of PCC is mainly determined by a number of strictly defined parameters, such as purity, particle morphology, and structure. On industrial scale, limestone rock is the preferred raw material for the production of PCC. However, gypsum is an industrial solid waste product generated in various industrial processes such as phosphoric, hydrofluoric, citric and boric acid production, treatment of waste from desulphurisation of flue gases from coal-fired power stations, ore smelting, and acid mine water treatment. Large stockpiles of gypsum waste exist with little or no usage and commercial applications. The objective of the research was to investigate the possibility of producing high-purity PCC from <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphide</b> (CaS), an intermediate product in the process of the recovery of elemental sulphur from waste gypsum. At first, the suitability of a direct aqueous CaS carbonation (one-step) process was tested. Although only a low-grade CaCO 3 product (86 - 88 mass% as CaCO 3) could be produced, experimental results on the characteristics of CaS in the presence of CO 2 in the CaS-H 2 O-CO 2 system showed that the reaction proceeded in two distinct stages. In the first stage, CaS dissolution took place, with H 2 S stripping occurring in the second stage. Calcium carbonation and the resulting precipitation of CaCO 3 were concurrent with the CaS dissolution and the H 2 S stripping reactions. Because the production of high-purity CaCO 3 could not be obtained via the direct aqueous CaS carbonation process, a two-step or indirect carbonation process route was also developed and tested. In the first step, either CO 2 gas or H 2 S gas was used to induce CaS dissolution. This was followed by the separate carbonation of the solubilized calcium (in the form of Ca(HS) 2 solution). The indirect process using CO 2 as ‘CaS dissolution catalyst’ produced two separate CaCO 3 products of different grades, i. e. a low-purity CaCO 3 product ( 99 mass% as CaCO 3) in the second step. Importantly, the H 2 S-based process was successful in producing a single CaCO 3 product, which formed in the second step and was of high purity (> 99 mass% as CaCO 3). The effects of various process conditions and experimental techniques were applied in order to control the morphology, structure and characteristics of the formed PCC. The control of the purity and the crystal structure of the carbonate products derived from waste gypsum in a mineral carbonation process were demonstrated. The indirect carbonation process when H 2 S gas was used for CaS dissolution, yielded only one carbonate product {{in the form of a}} high-purity CaCO 3 (> 99 mass% as CaCO 3) product, which was often made up of two polymorphs, calcite and vaterite, in varying proportions. Approximately 0. 62 kg of the high-grade CaCO 3 was produced from every 1 kg CaS processed, while 0. 43 kg residue was generated. The use of calcium-rich solid wastes (gypsum in this study) as primary material in replacement to mined limestone for the production of PCC could not only alleviate waste disposal problems but could also convert significant volumes of waste materials into marketable commodities.
