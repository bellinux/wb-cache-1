50|$|Due to the {{acquisition}} of the old flour mills, which became the main Tonedale Mills site, the older Tone Mills, a few hundred metres further north, became the <b>cloth</b> <b>finishing</b> works. Sitting {{on the banks of}} the River Tone, the mills originally used water wheels on the river for power generation, the housing for which are still in place. Later with the introduction of steam and then electric power, the water was used as part of the <b>cloth</b> <b>finishing</b> process, and was managed more carefully with the introduction of a reservoir and sluice gates. Within the reservoir, the water was treated before its use. The finishing works and dye factory were both on this site. The former had a boiler house attached, while the latter had an engine house added.|$|R

In 1958, the Miroglio Group broadened its sphere of activity by opening a modern dyeing, special <b>cloth</b> <b>finishing</b> and textile-printing plant, thereby completing the fabric-to-garment production chain.|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Throughout antiquity, much of the population was employed in cloth-related industries from fiber production to laundering finished clothing. Fulling, (in a Roman context this includes both <b>finishing</b> <b>cloth</b> from the loom and laundering soiled clothing) and dying are particularly interesting as they are the most archaeologically visible textile trades. The technical bases and economic impact of these related trades are well studied and several debates {{in the last five years}} have raised interest in the social position of Roman cloth finishers. Interpersonal relationships between individuals in these trades are rarely studied, however, due to a perceived lack of evidence. This thesis attempts to contribute to those debates by surveying the available literary, epigraphic, and art historical evidence for the personal relationships of Roman cloth finishers and then developing a methodology to investigate opportunities for communication and social contact available to Roman cloth finishers through an analysis of the archaeological remains of <b>cloth</b> <b>finishing</b> workshops. The methodology developed in this work uses the biological limitations of the human field of view to determine what may have been visible from particularworkstations, in concert with historical and sociological studies of communication to establish the importance of non-verbal communication to work relationships in the Roman period. Visibility analysis is then applied to a selection of the well-preserved <b>cloth</b> <b>finishing</b> workshops from the imperial Roman cities of Pompeii and Ostia, which are evaluated comparatively to highlight the ways that the physical arrangement of the workspace can influence communication among the workers...|$|R

In the past, modelling of tearing strength of cotton woven fabrics was based on untreated cotton woven fabric but not in durable <b>pressed</b> <b>finished</b> fabric. In this paper, a mathematical model was established to demonstrate the tearing strength mechanism of durable <b>press</b> <b>finished</b> cotton woven fabrics by dimensional analysis based on yarn diameter, cover factor, Young's modulus and fabric elongation. The proposed model agreed well with experimental results and the proposed model can be used for optimizing durable <b>press</b> <b>finishing</b> process of cotton woven fabric.

50|$|In {{the last}} two years of Hewett's life the Clothworkers' Company, of which he had become the senior figure, plunged into {{parliamentary}} action. Clothworkers were suffering from a loss of exports, since the Merchant Adventurers (who received their new Charter from Elizabeth in 1564) increasingly exported unfinished <b>cloth</b> for <b>finishing</b> in Antwerp, cutting out their trade. The Company appealed to the Privy Council in June 1565 seeking to establish a fixed proportion of <b>finished</b> <b>cloth</b> exports and to obtain rights of search to ensure such regulations were obeyed. Their claim to produce cloth of equal standard however proved inconclusive, and in October 1566 they introduced a bill in Parliament to compel merchants to export at least one <b>finished</b> <b>cloth</b> for every four unfinished. After a confrontation with the Merchant Adventurers a revised bill, reducing the proportion to one in ten, was introduced in December and was passed by both Houses, but with inadequate rights of search the Company gained little benefit from it.|$|R

40|$|This study uses ‘operational {{sequence}} analysis’ {{to examine}} the technical processes, methods and strategies that Korean potters have used in the adoption and rejection of new pottery technologies. We contend that {{the introduction of new}} technical elements weakens the relationship between the traditional agents of the pottery-makingprocess. In particular, potters are compromising traditional techniques by using modern technology. On the one hand, potters still use traditional tools such as the bottom flattener, the wooden paddle, the anvil and <b>cloth</b> <b>finishing</b> strips {{while at the same time}} using improved kilns and electronic potters’ wheels. This compromise has arisen because of changes in technical knowledge about making pottery which have resulted in this synthesis of traditional and modern methods. Anthropological studies will explain pottery-making techniques and knowledge relating to the craft in Korea on both macro and micro levels...|$|R
