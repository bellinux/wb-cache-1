Once the onions have softened, niter kebbeh (or, in the case of vegan dishes, {{vegetable}} oil) is added. Following this, berbere is added to make a spicy keiy wat or keyyih tsebhi. Turmeric is used instead of bebere for a milder alicha wat or both are omitted when making vegetable stews, atkilt wat. Meat such as beef (ሥጋ, səga), chicken (ዶሮ, doro) or derho), fish (ዓሣ, asa), goat or lamb (በግ, beg or beggi) is also added.

40|$|Red {{onion is}} one of the main horticultural {{commodities}} in Indonesia. Generally <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> is cultivated by using tuber as a source of seeds. The weakness of the use of tuber as a source of seeds, besides the high cost also the quality of seed is less well guaranteed because it almost always carries of the pathogen disease. To overcome the weakness of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> cultivation with tuber, the alternative is the cultivation with the seed of botani (True Seed of Shallot/TSS). The weakness of botanical seeds as a source of seed is the low germination/growing power. Therefore, to solve the problem of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> cultivation with TSS, has been done research on the modification of growing medium and giving of plant growth regulator to produce seeds of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> origin of botanical seed (TSS). Botanical seeds (TSS) of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> treated with coconut water and seeded on mixed soil + compost medium, soil + husk charcoal and soil + compost + chaff charcoal produce growing percentage and vegetative growth of optimum seeds.

40|$|Red Onion (Allium Ascolanicum) is a non-substituted {{commodity}} for Indonesian consumer. It is {{a well-known}} situation in Indonesia, where the fluctuation supply of some agriculture products like rice and also <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> may causes the economic inflation in one region.

Nagari Saning Baka {{is a well-known}} village in Solok Regency as a center of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> production in West Sumatera Province. However, since around 1980 s, secondary data from local government showed significant decreased of production area of this crop.

This study have tried to identified factors that influence the production risk of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> in this region by using regression analysis to test some hypothetical input factors, like numbers of seed, fertilizer, volume of pesticides, frequency of pesticides applied, labor, and variety of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> itself. The production risk as dependent variable is identified by calculating the variance of production for each farmer. This study uses cross section data by collecting information from 70 farmers as sample. As a result, the risk analysis showed that <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> farmers are facing high risk in their farm, and higher risk in hot season compare to rainy season. The expected production of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> is only 3. 2 Ton/Ha per planting season. The result for regression analysis showed that only three input factors have showed high significance in influencing the production risk of <b>red</b> <b>onion,</b> are; the use of single fertilizer, leaf fertilizer and the uses of pesticides...|$|R

Seven Tropea <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> samples and three commercial cultivars of different coloured onions were evaluated. Amplification of genomic DNA using random primers highlighted a good clustering differentiating Tropea <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> cultivar from commercial reference samples used in this study. The total antioxidant activity {{and the content of}} quercetin- 3, 40 -O-diglucoside (3, 40 Qdg) and quercetin- 40 -Omonoglucoside (40 Qmg) were measured using photochemiluminescence method (Photochem 1) and capillary electrophoresis, both very interesting because of their very short measuring times. The difference in antioxidant activity and quercetin contents between Tropea <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> and commercial sample and also the difference within Tropea cultivar suggested that the nutrient composition did not depend only on particular genetic characters but was probably connected to the intrinsic pedological soil and climate features...|$|R

Three of them are subspecies of Allium cepa L. (ssp. <b>red</b> <b>onion,</b> ssp. white onion and ssp. green onion), the other three species are Allium sativum L. (garlic), Allium porrum L. (leek) and Allium kurrat L. (kurrat baladi). The results exhibited that A. cepa (ssp. <b>red</b> <b>onion)</b> and A. porrum have the highest phenolic contents. On the other hand, in vitro antioxidant activity using three methods, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, phosphomolybdate and reducing power assays revealed that A. cepa (ssp. <b>red</b> <b>onion)</b> and A. porrum have high antioxidant activities. Moreover, there was positive correlation between the antioxidant activity and total phenolic contents of the tested Allium species.
