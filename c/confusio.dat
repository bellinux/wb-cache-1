40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} {{report the}} complications of pallidotomy and to tenta-tively determine the incidences of complications of pallidotomy, possible influencing factors, and the acceptability of symptomatic hemorrhage rates for microelectrode-guided pallidotomy. METHODS: Clinical events were analyzed for 1116 patients with Parkinson’s disease who underwent microelectrode-guided pallidotomies at our center. Complications included visual field deficits, weakness, fatigue, hypersomnia, drooling, dysphagia, speech disorders, hiccups, hemorrhage, seizures, apraxia, coma, infection, mental confusion, and impaired memory. Complication rates for bilateral pallidotomy and double-lesion groups were compared with those for unilateral pallidotomy and single-lesion groups, respectively. RESULTS: Among the total of 1116 patients, the incidences of visual field deficits, weakness, fatigue, hypersomnia, drooling, dysphagia, and speech disorders were 0. 4, 4. 2, 19. 9, 12. 4, 7. 0, 3. 7, and 11. 9 %, respectively.

Visual uniqueness of a brand enhances the speed with which it can be identified in crowded purchase environments and the accuracy with which it can be differentiated from its competitors. Consequently, marketers have stressed the importance of managing and protecting the visual characteristics of a branded product (Aaker, 1991; Keller, 1993), and trademark laws have been promulgated to limit the ability of new entrants to imitate the appearance (or "trade-dress") of an incumbent brand.

40|$|The {{simplest}} cosmology [...] - the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker-Lemaître (FRW) model [...] - {{describes a}} spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe where the scale {{factor is the}} only dynamical parameter. Here we consider how quantized electromagnetic fields become entangled with the scale factor in a toy version of the FRW model. A system consisting of a photon, source, and detector is described in such a universe, and {{we find that the}} detection of a redshifted photon by the detector system constrains possible scale factor superpositions. Thus, measuring the redshift of the photon is equivalent to a weak measurement of the underlying cosmology. We also consider a potential optomechanical analogy system that would enable experimental exploration of these concepts. The analogy focuses on the effects of photon redshift measurement as a quantum back-action on metric variables, where the position of a movable mirror plays the role of the scale factor.

Responsum 55 concerns a forced loan that had been accorded by the chapter of Saint Gudula in Brussels to the Calvinist-led magistrate in February 1580. After 1585, the chapter of Saint Gudula asked repayment. Questions on the liability of the new magistrate for contracts of its rebellious predecessors are raised and solved by our Brabantian jurist.

40|$|The law {{governing}} the admission, against a criminal accused, {{of what is}} referred to – sometimes inaccurately- as “similar fact evidence ” {{has been allowed to}} acquire a complexity which is not wholly justified. This complexity has arisen as the result of two errors which have operated in tandem for the best part of two centuries. The first is to regard all instances in which a criminal accused’s additional (usually prior) misdeeds are disclosed to a court as “similar fact evidence”, when in fact many such disclosures involve facts which are far from similar.

Are such words really a danger for the non-native speaker of English and then are there ways of avoiding the confusion? Key words: false friends, avoiding confusion, meaning, differentiated evolution. The concept of "false friend" False friends or false cognates are words that may sound similar in two or more languages but in actuality mean different things. The concept was born bearing precisely this idea that the English word seems to be "friendly" to the learner. That {{is to say that}} being very similar to some notion already known by the speaker from his/her language, the English word helps him/her to produce communication in English too, relatively easier than when using totally new and unknown words. So, these words are seen as helping "friends".

Thus, they finally prove to be "false", pretended, and very much less friendly than expected. Sources of <b>confusio...</b>|$|E

One {{approach}} to designing usable and enjoyable computer applications {{is to say}} that designers need better methods and tools to understand users and their contexts, and to encode this understanding into closed computer systems. Another is to acknowledge that there will always be unattended user needs, and that the way to increase users ’ satisfaction is to help them modify systems in order to meet constantly changing requirements. Different techniques are proposed in one approach usually without reference to the other. We present an overarching perspective of human–computer interaction where both meet, and provide a semiotic characterization of designers ’ and users ’ activities that clarifies the tradeoffs involved in designing and choosing techniques in either approach. Central to this characterization is the role of intentions in what users mean to say and do when using computers. Our characterization is in line with a broader concept of usability, in which systems must support users ’ improvisation and creativity. 1.

Surveys indicate inconsistent application of traditional waveform descriptors. This study reviews literature to identify areas of confusion. Publications were reviewed to determine whether triphasic, biphasic, and monophasic terms were defined; if biphasic was linked with diastolic flow reversal; whether pandiastolic flow was associated with biphasic or monopha-sic terminology; and whether waveform illus-trations had a zero baseline. Ninety-four publications were reviewed. Triphasic and monophasic were defined in 81 %, biphasic in 48 %. Biphasic was classified with flow reversal in 38 %. Pandiastolic flow was not addressed in 57 % but associated with monophasic in 47 % and biphasic in 5 %. Twenty-one percent of the publications had an illustration without a zero-flow baseline.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new, {{scalable}} approach {{for the task}} of object based image search or object recognition. Despite the very large literature existing on the scalability issues in CBIR {{in the sense of}} retrieval approaches, the scalability of media and scalability of features remain an issue. In our work we tackle the problem of scalability and structural organization of features. The proposed features are nested local graphs built upon sets of SURF feature points with Delaunay triangulation. A Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) framework is applied on these graphs, giving birth to a Bag-of-Graph-Words representation. The nested nature of the descriptors consists in scaling from trivial Delaunay graphs - isolated feature points - by increasing the number of nodes layer by layer up to graphs with maximal number of nodes. For each layer of graphs its proper visual dictionary is built. The experiments conducted on the SIVAL data set reveal that the graph features at different layers exhibit complementary performances on the same content. The nested approach, the combination of all existing layers, yields significant improvement of the object recognition performance compared to single level approaches.
