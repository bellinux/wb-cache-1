5000|$|The primary <b>{{cognitive}}</b> <b>technology</b> that is {{used for}} cognitive shifting is called [...] "focus phrase" [...] methodology.

40|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>technologies</b> are {{developing}} {{more rapidly than}} ever before. This trend affects also traditional legal service industry, which is based largely on bespoke (custom made) manual work with hourly billing. The business model based on billable hours contains a paradox of productivity – {{in order to become}} more productive in terms of billable hours the firm has to become less productive in terms of actual efficiency. This study focuses on the role of <b>cognitive</b> <b>technologies</b> in the value creation of law firms. The study researches how law firms could benefit from <b>cognitive</b> <b>technologies</b> (products of the field of artificial intelligence) even though it seems that <b>cognitive</b> <b>technologies</b> and automation of legal work would be conflicting with the interests of law firms. This leads to the research question: how could business law firms create value with <b>cognitive</b> <b>technologies?</b> The study is broken down into four subthemes: value creation in law firms, <b>cognitive</b> <b>technologies,</b> challenges of using <b>cognitive</b> <b>technologies</b> in legal work, and estimated impact on the industry. The study builds on the theoretical framework of value creation processes of professional service firms by Løwendahl et al (2001). The study is made from the managerial perspective. The empirical research is concluded by interviewing partners and managers of Finnish and Estonian law firms, and other professionals working between law and technology. The results state that {{there are several ways to}} create value for the clients of the law firms. These can be categorized around three main drivers: 1) improving service delivery technologies, 2) improving knowledge flow, and 3) redefining constraints and enablers of legal value creation. The law firms can create value to themselves if they are willing to change and align their interests with the inevitable development of technology. The study is a description of its time and gives practical managerial implications how to benefit from the change...|$|R

50|$|There {{are other}} systems being {{developed}} {{that are working}} on automatically inferring the context of user queries based {{on the content of}} other documents they view or edit. IBM's Watson Project aims to create a <b>cognitive</b> <b>technology</b> that dynamically learns as it processes user queries. When presented with a query Watson creates a hypothesis that is evaluated against its present bank of knowledge based on previous questions. As related terms and relevant documents are matched against the query, Watson's hypothesis is modified to reflect the new information provided through unstructured data based on information it has obtained in previous situations. Watson's ability to build off previous knowledge allows queries to be automatically filtered for similar contexts in order to supply precise results.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{dynamically}} and efficiently allocate resources {{to meet the}} need of growing diversity in services and user behavior marks the future of wireless networks, giving rise to intelligent processing, which aims at enabling the system to perceive and assess the available resources, to autonomously learn {{to adapt to the}} perceived wireless environment, and to reconfigure its operating mode to maximize the utility of the available resources. The perception capability and reconfigurability are the essential features of <b>cognitive</b> <b>technology</b> while modern machine learning techniques project effectiveness in system adaptation. In this paper, we discuss the development of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>technology</b> and machine learning techniques and emphasize their roles in improving both spectrum and energy efficiency of the future wireless networks.

We discuss powerful machine learning algorithms that enable spectrum- and energy-efficient communications in dynamic wireless environments. We also present practical applications of these techniques to the existing and future wireless communication systems, such as heterogeneous networks and device-to-device communications, and identify some research opportunities and challenges in <b>cognitive</b> <b>technology</b> and machine learning as applied to future wireless networks...|$|E
