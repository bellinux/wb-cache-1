30|$|In {{previous}} reported literature [4, 19, 21, 25, 28], {{many researchers}} prepared mesophase pitches from petroleum residues, coal tar pitches and pure aromatic compounds using Lewis acid. AlCl 3 and HF/BF 3 are extensively used catalysts to prepare spinnable mesophase pitch from aromatic hydrocarbons. Among these, AlCl 3 {{was not completely}} recovered from resulting pitch, whereas HF/BF 3 was easily recovered. Most of the previous works on catalyzing mesophase formation have focused on either minimizing {{the impact of the}} retained catalyst or on recovering the catalyst from the product. In our previous paper [9], we have used cobalt and nickel salts in petroleum residues (paraffinic <b>clarified</b> <b>oil</b> and aromatic heavy extract) to enhance the mesophase contents, pitch yields and other physico-chemical properties. Among these petroleum residue paraffinic <b>clarified</b> <b>oil</b> having very low bureau of mines correlation index (BMCI), i.e., 51 is produced a pitch contained mesophase contents below countable limit and pitch yield being quite low (11.88 wt %). Although, the presence of transition metal salts (Co and Ni) in paraffinic <b>clarified</b> <b>oil</b> enlarged the size of mesophase spheres, i.e., increased the mesophase contents, pitch yield and other physico–chemical properties. Here, the recovery of catalysts has done by refluxing higher-density part of pitch which was settled down bottom of the reactor with ethanol. As we know that mesophase pitches are used as a precursor material for premium-quality petroleum coke. This premium-quality petroleum coke is used for making graphite electrode for steel industries. Most of the premium-quality petroleum coke in India is imported from foreign countries for making graphite electrode and other carbon products. Keeping this in view, we are trying to explore different types of transition metal catalysts which enhance the mesophase formation in paraffinic <b>clarified</b> <b>oil.</b> This study will help petroleum refiners for production of mesophase pitch/premium-quality petroleum coke.|$|E

Mite infested alfalfa was treated just prior to first irrigation after cutting in spring 2003, and numbers of spider mites and western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) were obtained at weekly intervals thereafter for the next seven weeks. Data for plant parameters (stem widths, numbers of leaves, internode lengths) were obtained at harvest, as were hay yields and quality. The milbemectin treatment resulted in quickest reduction of spider mites (88. 5 % at 5 days after application) and also resulted in significantly higher yields than the untreated check (0. 18 tons of hay/acre), attributed to the longer internodes and resultant tallest plants and significantly thicker stems than the untreated check. <b>Clarified</b> neem <b>oil</b> and chlorpyrifos plus dimethoate treatments did not control spider mites as quickly as milbemectin and yields were increased by only 0. 04 - 0. 05 tons hay per acre in this experiment compared with the untreated check.

30|$|In {{the present}} work, {{we have made}} {{attempts}} to prepare petroleum pitches from paraffinic-rich <b>clarified</b> <b>oil</b> (CLO) by giving thermal treatment at 370  °C {{in the presence of}} Cu and Cr catalysts. The feed CLO is predominantly paraffinic in nature, so it takes fairly large thermal soaking time (21  h) to convert into pitch having mesophase content below countable limits. To increase the mesophase content in the pitch or to make mesophase pitch, 3 wt % transition metal catalysts (Cu and Cr) were added to CLO. Addition of transition metal catalysts not only enhances mesophase formation but also helps to reduce thermal treatment time by promoting polymerization and condensation reactions at a faster rate. The mesophase formation pattern reveals that Cu and Cr catalysts increase the mesophase content from below countable limit to 12 and 9 vol %, respectively. This indicates that Cu and Cr showed better catalytic activity for mesophase formation growth. The effect of transition metal catalysts on physico-chemical properties (softening point, coking value, toluene insolubles and quinoline insolubles) as well as the optical texture and physical properties of mesophase pitches were investigated by optical microscope, FT-IR, SEM, NMR, TG/DTG and XRD.|$|E

Liners were aged in three different ways: (1) on a small farm milking twice a day for three hours at a time, (2) on a large dairy milking three times per day for six hours at a time, and (3) by soaking liners in <b>clarified</b> butter <b>oil</b> at 100 °C. The physical liner measurements were: mouthpiece lip flex, mounted liner tension, mouthpiece bore, outside barrel diameter, collapsed thickness of barrel walls, barrel length, and total weight. Each group was measured new and at intervals during aging. Similarities and differences among the three different aging methods were noted. The change in mouthpiece flex, mounted tension, barrel length and total weight appeared to be the best predictors of change in liner condition. Artificial aging of a liner for two days in 100 °C <b>clarified</b> butter <b>oil</b> resulted in changes in mouthpiece lip flex and mounted tension similar to 840 cow milkings on a dairy farm milking for three hours at a time, twice daily.

30|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to {{synthesize}} petroleum mesophase pitches from paraffinic <b>clarified</b> <b>oil</b> by transition metal catalysts (i.e., Cr and Cu) as precursor material for advanced carbon products and also study {{the effect of these}} catalysts on physico-chemical properties. Generally, paraffinic hydrocarbons are undesirable for making mesophase pitches but their attachments on aromatic molecules are necessary because they generate free radicals for polymerization reaction. Optical microscopic results show that Cu and Cr enhance the growth of mesophase spheres and also increase the mesophase contents. Therefore, Cu and Cr promote the parallely stacked aromatic mesophase formation in pitches through a series of reactions such as cracking, polymerization, condensation, etc. The higher value of crystallite thickness of CLO-Cu- 3 and CLO-Cr- 3 as compared to CLO- 0 - 0 also indicates that there is a high degree of polymerization. NMR, FT-IR and CHNS analyses also support the higher degree of polymerization for CLO-Cu- 3 and CLO-Cr- 3 mesophase pitches. In addition, SEM images clearly indicated that catalysts increase the size of pitch flakes but they are not attached on the surface of pitch molecules. Therefore, the present study shows that Cu and Cr catalysts have higher catalytic activity for mesophase formation growth. It was further observed that Cu and Cr catalysts are also helpful for increasing physico-chemical properties of mesophase pitches.|$|E

In 1112 CE, Jain poet Nayasena of Mulugunda, Dharwad district, in his Champu work Dharmamrita, a book on morals, warns writers from mixing Kannada with Sanskrit by comparing it with mixing of <b>clarified</b> butter and <b>oil.</b> He has written it using very limited Sanskrit words which fit with idiomatic Kannada. In 1235 CE, Jain poet Andayya, wrote Kabbigara Kava (Poet's Defender), also called Sobagina Suggi (Harvest of Beauty) or Madana-Vijaya and Kavana-Gella (Cupid's Conquest), a Champu work in pure Kannada using only indigenous (desya) Kannada words and the derived form of Sanskrit words – tadbhavas, without the admixture of Sanskrit words. He succeeded in his challenge and proved wrong those who had advocated {{that it was impossible}} to write a work in Kannada without using Sanskrit words. Andayya may be considered as a protector of Kannada poets who were ridiculed by Sanskrit advocates. Thus Kannada is the only Dravidian language which is not only capable of using only native Kannada words and grammar in its literature (like Tamil), but also use Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary (like Telugu, Malayalam, Tulu, etc.) The Champu style of literature of mixing poetry with prose owes its origins to the Kannada language which was later incorporated by poets into Sanskrit and other Indian languages.|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} reactions occurring {{during the}} formation of shale oil are investigated with Huadian oil shale pyrolysis by solid heat carrier in a newly devised moving bed with internals (MBI). The effect of secondary reactions, which are mainly vapor-phase cracking, on shale oil property and yield at different temperatures is characterized {{on the basis of}} ultimate, C- 13 NMR and GC-MS analyses of the produced oil. The increases in the production rate of hydrocarbon gas species and related molar ratios <b>clarify</b> that the <b>oil</b> vapor cracking, rather than coking, is the main secondary reactions at pyrolysis temperature over 495 degrees C. Ultimate analysis of shale oil shows that cracking increases the carbon and nitrogen contents of oil but decreases its hydrogen and oxygen contents. There are obvious decreases in the atomic H/C and O/C ratios of shale oil with increasing the pyrolysis temperature. NMR analysis shows that the aromaticity of shale oil increases considerably due to secondary reactions. Selective concentration of existing aromatics and aromatization of aliphatics are of roughly equal importance. The GC-MS results indicate that the aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes) are the main detected components in shale oil and represent 75 % of the detected peak areas. Via oil vapor cracking, a part of long-chain aliphatics is transformed into short-chain alkanes, alkenes and gas species to increase the low-carbon hydrocarbons. The increase in aromatic proportion with raising temperature is due to the selective concentration by cracking aliphatics and aromatization reactions such as dehydrogenation and their subsequent reactions.

40|$|Textile dyeing {{effluents}} {{present a}} substantial environmental problem, primarily because such wastewaters contain {{high concentrations of}} waste dyes, dye by-products, and variable salt concentrations originating from printing or dyeing processes. Such wastewater streams often do not meet regulatory standards for wastewater discharge even after undergoing treatment by conventional means. The decolorization of textile wastewaters is a worldwide problem. Various processes have been utilized to remove the colored colloidal bodies and suspended solids and to reduce the associated high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). ^ Currently, no single treatment system is adequate to degrade the dye structures in wastewaters. A significant disadvantage of the current processes is their high capital and operating expenditures. Oxidation methods for example, are only effective in wastewater with a very low concentration of organic color while the adsorption process by active polymer resin is expensive {{and it is difficult}} to regenerate the adsorbent. ^ Palygorskite is a crystalloid hydrous magnesium-aluminum silicate mineral with very good colloidal properties such as specific features in dispersion high temperature endurance, salt and alkali resistance, and a high adsorbing and de-coloring capability. The structure of palygorskite was first proposed by Bradley (1940), who described a theoretical formula of [Si 8 Mg 5 O 20 (OH) 2] (H 2 O) 4. 4 H 2 O. Due to its sorptive properties, Palygorskite has been effectively applied in decolorizing and <b>clarifying</b> mineral <b>oils</b> and fats, as a carrier in pesticides, in the filtration of special products, as a sorbent on factory floors, and in the pharmaceutical industry. Its ability to adsorb indigo waste and other contaminants from textile effluents however has not been studied. Palygorskite is one of the two constituents of Maya Blue, a material of unprecedented stability with potential application in paints and coatings. The properties and quality of the pigments synthesized from the recovery products compares favorably to pigments synthesized from pure products. ^ The primary objective of this research was to demonstrate the ability of palygorskite to recover waste indigo dye from blue denim wastewater and to use the recovery products as a substrate for the synthesis Maya-blue pigment, a by-product with potential commercial applications. A secondary objective was to demonstrate the simultaneous removal of salts from the wastewater without substantially compromising the quality of the synthesized pigment. Salt reductions of up to over 60 per cent were achieved. Removal of the color and salts from the wastewater essentially opens up opportunities for possible reuse of the wastewater. ^ We demonstrate the effectiveness of palygorskite to concurrently remove indigo dye and salts from the wastewater without significantly compromising the quality of the synthesized by-product. Given that over a billion pairs of blue jeans are manufactured every year and the inordinate quantities of indigo dye used and released as effluent in the stonewash process, the possibility to apply the process on a commercial scale would have substantial economic and environmental implications. ...|$|R

Due to scarcity of firewood in the district, waste lorry tyres and mesocarp fibres are used in place of firewood generating a lot of smoke with serious health risk to processors and other mill workers and the environment. Constraints in the small scale processing industry include inaccessibility to remunerative market especially during the peak fruit production period of February to May, lack of credit and skills and knowledge in good processing practices. The financial appraisal of palm oil production shows that in the peak fruit production period of April-May, processors make a loss of 38 % of every cedi in sale in their operations and that the production of palm oil can be a profitable venture only during the lean fruit production season (from September – December) when oil is relatively scarce. The study suggests that to improve the income of small scale processors, there is the need to help the processors change their practices through research {{but at the same time}} it also requires work to create entry into the existing value chains through policy (e. g. bye-laws).   </p...|$|R
40|$|In the {{cultivation}} of rape, the oil content of seed must {{be regarded as a}} important factor as well as the seed yield. This studies aimed to research the basic materials in relation to cultivating technic and breeding for the increase of oil production, and were concerned with the ecological changes of the oil formation in rape seed under various conditions during seed development. I. Relation of oil formation to the morphological development of seed under several condition (1) In autumn seeded rape, oil formation was accelerated especially in later half period during seed development, and continued untill 55 days after flowering when dry weight of seed reached maximum. Iodine value and refractive index of oil decreased as seed matured. (2) The flowering period continued for about a month in autumn seeded rape, and therefore, as flowering was later, the rate of development of pod, seed and embryo and of oil formation became more rapidly. But oil content of seed was lower in later flowering. It was confirmed that iodine value of oil decreased as seed matured. (3) In spring seeded rape at the high land, the rate of seed development and oil formation was extremly promoted because of high temperature even at the early stage of seed development. But the seed harvested had very low oil. Iodine value of oil, which was very low at the earliest stage of the oil formation, increased rapidly until the middle stage, and then decreased gradually. (4) It was <b>clarified</b> that <b>oil</b> formation in rape seed was closely combined with the development of seed, especially of embryo or cotyledon in which oil was synthesized and accumulated. The difference in the change of iodine value between autumn and spring seeded rapes was discussed. It was suggested that percent constitution of each fatty acid during oil formation was both influenced by the environmental and hereditable factors. II. Influence of natural environmental conditions on the oil formation of seed (1) It was confirmed experimentally that high temperature during seed development decreased the yield and oil content of seed. (2) When 50 % of the natural sun light was shaded during seed development, oil content of seed decreased about 10 %. Shading from 30 to 15 days before maturation most profoundly effected on the oil content and yield of seed. (3) Excessive soil moisture decreased both the oil content and yield of seed. Under dry condition of soil, oil content was not lower than under moderate condition, but seed yield decreaced remarkably. (4) Year variation of oil content in rape seed was evident in similar variety at similar station. Relationship between this variation and weather condition of each year was discussed. Relatively low temperature, much sunshine and moderate precipitation during seed development may be favourable both for the high yield and the high oil content of seed. III. Influence of cultivating conditions on the oil formation of seed (1) Oil content of seed was low on the area of high soil productivity, and was high on the area of low soil productivity. There {{was no significant difference in}} oil content between areas where soil productivity was shown to be uniform. It was considerable that available nitrogen was rich in such high productive soil. (2) With the increase of nitrogen application, seed yield increased and oil content of seed decreased. In this case, increased application of potassium fertilizer with nitrogen did not decreased the oil content. (3) The oil content of seed tended to behigher in direct sowing cultivation than in transplanting. Effect of delay in sowing time on the oil content of seed seemed to be variable owing to the weather conditions during growing season and the varieties. Early type may be preferable in oil content to the later type under various conditions. Density of sowing had a little effect on the oil content of seed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} improving the engine oil cooler performance for future vehicle applications, from ideas to simulated concepts. Increasing market expectations of high engine power, low fuel consumption and high towing capabilities results in an ever rising pressure on the cooling system in modern cars. The desire to prevent a future situation where the engine oil could become too hot, {{formed the basis for}} this thesis. The thesis was performed during 10 weeks from March to June 2015, at Volvo Car Corporation in Gothenburg. The working process started with literary studies where the theory behind automotive cooling systems and heat exchangers were studied to increase the general knowledge about the theory. Studies of engine oil, heat transfer and the overall design of engine cooling systems were performed. An important part was to <b>clarify</b> why the <b>oil</b> must not exceed a certain temperature limit. This gave answers to how the oil and engine components would be affected, if the oil did exceed the set temperature limit. To get a clear target and measurable parameters, the goal of this thesis was defined by estimating what the heat transfer demands could be in the future. A competitor analysis was made to examine how and if, the competitors to VCC use a different kind of oil cooling. Generation of concept ideas were made continuously during the early stage of the work process. Concepts that proved to be interesting were analysed more deeply with performance simulations and packaging studies. Five concepts were analysed and the performance simulations indicated that all the presented concepts can reach the heat transfer goal set early in the process. They do however use different methods, and meet the goal with different levels of efficiency. All concepts are listed with their heat transfer performance results and their advantages and disadvantages. The concept that showed to be the most promising in an oil cooling perspective, was to connect an additional heat exchanger in series after the current plate heat exchanger. This is a solution which will support the current engine oil cooler by handling the additional heat produced during certain driving scenarios. The best concept reached a heat transfer rate of 40 kW at half the air flow required by the second best concept. The concepts that has been presented will implicate an alteration of the current oil cooling system design. The lack of available space in the cars will also result in some rearranging of components in order to make space for an additional heat exchanger. The purpose with the concept generation is to present a good foundation from which Volvo can base their future decisions on...|$|R
40|$|Spent nickel {{catalyst}} (SNC) {{have the}} potential of insulting {{the quality of the}} environment in a number of ways. The disposal of SNC will have a pollution effect. Optimum recovery of fat from SNC, could save the environment and reduce the oil loss. Hexane has been the solvent of choice for oil extraction. Alternative solvents that are considered safer have been evaluated. Hexane, isopropanol, ethanol, and heptane were examined using soxhlet extraction. While hexane was more efficient in oil recovery from SNC, isopropanol proved to be very good, to <b>clarifying</b> separation of <b>oil</b> from waste material and also provide high solvent recovery compared to other solvents. Isopropanol extraction with chill provided separation of miscella into two phases: lower oil&# 226;&# 128;&# 147;rich and an upper solvent &# 226;&# 128;&# 147; rich. It saved much energy of vaporization for distilling. An aqueous extraction process with immiscible solvent assisted was tested. Solvent like hexane added to SNC, and water added later with continuous stirring. The mixture was stirred for about 30 minutes, prior to centrifugation. Aqueous process extracted less amount of oil compared to solvent extraction.
