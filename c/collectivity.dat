5|$|Shira Chess {{argues that}} the Slender Man exemplifies the {{similarities}} between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, {{the fact that the}} Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: <b>collectivity</b> (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).|$|E
5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a <b>collectivity</b> and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E
40|$|France, {{one of the}} {{founding}} members of the European Union, is a unitary state from the administrativeterritorial point of view, based on deep centralism. Having territorial <b>collectivities</b> with highly complex structure (communes, departments, regions, sui-generis <b>collectivities</b> and overseas <b>collectivities),</b> France committed itself to cooperation not only between its own administrative structures, but also to cross-border cooperation within the European Union. After showing reluctance to external actions underwent by territorial <b>collectivities,</b> France ended up with acknowledging this right of its territorial <b>collectivities</b> within the «decentralized cooperation», expressly brought under regulation by the Law of 6 February 1992. According to the law, {{there is no need for}} any ratification on behalf of the State to allow cooperation between territorial <b>collectivities,</b> within the boundaries of their competence. The Law of 1992 thus authorized the territorial <b>collectivities</b> to close agreements with other <b>collectivities</b> from abroad. Furthermore, the Law of 4 February 1995 allowed several treaties with the border states to be signed, thus creating the SAAR-LOR-LUX region (an European cross-border region that made way for cooperation between Germany, France and Luxembourg). The French legislation also allowed several European districts to be created, acting as local groups for cross-border cooperation, created on the initiative of territorial <b>collectivities.</b> The aim of our study is to identify the main relationship between territorial <b>collectivities</b> in France and EU and to analyze the cooperation instruments used by the French <b>collectivities</b> in order to foster the cross-border cooperation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{persistent}} rural poverty, an incomplete agrarian transition, the predominance of small and marginal farms and an emerging feminization of agriculture, this paper argues for a new institutional approach to poverty reduction, agricultural revival and social empowerment. It {{makes a strong case}} for a group approach to agricultural investment and production through promoting <b>collectivities</b> of the poor which, it argues, would be much more effective on all these counts than the traditional individual-oriented approaches. The <b>collectivities</b> proposed here, however, are small-sized, voluntary, socio-economically homogeneous, and participatory in decision-making, and in keeping with the principles emphasized in a human-rights approach to development. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} largely failed historical efforts at early socialist collectivization, and some similar thrusts in non-socialist developing countries in the 1960 s and 1970 s, which were massive in scale, top-down, and typically coercive and non-participatory. The paper outlines the potential benefits of bottom-up agricultural production <b>collectivities</b> and describes a range of successful cases from the transition economies and South Asia. It also reflects on the contexts in which such <b>collectivities</b> may be expected to succeed, and how these efforts could be replicated for wider geographic coverage and impact.
