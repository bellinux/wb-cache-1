At the federal level, Medicaid expansion costs are replaced with $716 billion <b>in</b> <b>cuts</b> to <b>Medicare</b> which means fewer resources for the elderly.

50|$|Expert panels {{across the}} {{political}} spectrum have argued for a combination of revenue increases and expense reductions to reduce the budget deficit and future debt increases. However, the nature and balance of these measures varies considerably. Economist Bruce Bartlett wrote in 2009 that without benefit <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>Medicare</b> and Social Security, federal taxes would have to increase by 8.1% of GDP now and forever to cover estimated program shortfalls, while avoiding debt increases. The 30-year historical average federal tax receipts are 18.4% of GDP, so this would represent a substantial increase in tax receipts as a share of GDP relative to historical levels in the United States. However, such an increase would still leave tax revenues relative to GDP substantially lower than other developed nations like France and Germany (see: List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP).|$|E

The national network [...] with 36 states and 61 researchers [...] is led by the Rockefeller Institute of Government, the public policy research arm of the State University of New York, the Brookings Institution, and the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania. Although the ACA will no doubt have real financial consequences for insurers, hospitals, and health care providers, at this early stage in implementation, it is difficult to calculate precise gains and losses. For example, the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania supported the ACA, believing, in part, that reform was necessary to reduce current levels of uncompensated care and to reduce reliance on emergency care for patients who put off treatment {{for as long as possible}} to avoid out-of-pocket costs. The association agreed to significant <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>Medicare</b> and Medicaid to support the bill's passage. However, because cost savings from universal coverage have not yet been realized, hospitals reported cutting staff in April 2014 to offset the loss of Medicaid and Medicare funding.

Hospital charges, the cost of providing services, revenue, and net income from all services provided through June 2006. A total of 120 patients were reviewed whose initial procedure was EUS (48), ERCP (53), or EMR (19). Although income was lost by performing the endoscopic procedures, revenue was generated by the subsequent clinical care derived from EUS (mean $ 7093 per patient, standard deviation [SD] $ 23, 686, range $ 12, 316 -$ 117, 984 per patient); a loss of revenue was incurred in the clinical care of both patients who underwent ERCP (mean -$ 5028 per patient, SD $ 12, 565, range -$ 33, 648 -$ 47, 481) and patients who underwent EMR (mean -$ 931 per patient, SD $ 6515, range -$ 11, 245 -$ 12, 196). The most lucrative activity arising from initial endoscopic referral was surgery. Revenue was lost for these procedures in Medicare patients compared with non-Medicare patients. Indirect costs are institution specific and may not be generalizable to other centers. EUS is the most remunerative resource-intensive endoscopic procedure. Centralizing these resource-intensive procedures into multispecialty practice sites that provide surgical and oncologic care allows downstream revenue from patient treatment to offset procedural losses. Even taking account of downstream revenues, performing these procedures on Medicare patients is not financially viable.
