50|$|The play {{opens with}} this ruined Greek philosopher. Whenever he smiles his teeth are {{so bad that}} you see the Acropolis. He lives in a Greek take out paper cup with the Acropolis on it. And then there’s Malvina Falkland who has buck teeth: she throws them into the ocean so the Penguins can escape to the Antarctic. She {{is in love with}} this Ghetto type character; he’s a {{vineyard}} owner and then Attila the Hun comes in wearing <b>carrier-ship</b> battle shoes and she dances with the five headed general who always talks you to death. Then there’s the boy who’s just seen the abyss and can’t get over it.|$|E
40|$|Hemophilia A is {{the most}} common {{hereditary}} severe disorder of blood clotting. In families affected with hemophilia, genetic analysis provides opportunities to prevent recurrence of the disease. This study establishes a diagnostic strategy for <b>carrier-ship</b> determination in Pakistani population using an extragenic polymorphic marker for the first time. The analysis of St 14 VNTR (DXS 52) was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in order to determine its informativeness in terms of heterozygosity in Pakistani population. This may be a milestone for further analysis of other polymorphic markers for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia. Seventy eight blood samples (Hemophiliac = 23, Normal = 55) from 15 families were analyzed for determining informativeness of St 14 VNTR in carrier detection of hemophilia A. A total of nine alleles (2400, 2100, 1750, 1690, 1630, 1570, 1390, 1300, 1220 bp) was detected in the pool of subjects. 19 out of 40 females were found to be carriers with respect to the St 14 VNTR polymorphic marker. The marker was informative in 73. 33 % of families. The expected heterozygosity rate of the St 14 VNTR was 0. 86 while the observed heterozygosity was 0. 7. This shows that St 14 VNTR is 70 % informative in our population, allowing it to be a useful marker in carrier detection, as informativeness is the direct reflection of heterozygosity of a polymorphic marker...|$|E
40|$|A family {{presented}} with three affected children with Leigh syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Analysis of the OXPHOS complexes in muscle of two affected patients showed {{an increase in}} activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and a decrease of complex V activity. Mutation analysis revealed the T 9176 C mutation in the mtATPase 6 gene (OMIM 516060) and the mutation load was above 90 % in the patients. Unaffected maternal relatives were tested for <b>carrier-ship</b> and one of them, with a mutation load of 55 % in blood, was pregnant with her first child. The possibility of prenatal diagnosis was evaluated. The main problem {{was the lack of}} data on genotype–phenotype associations for the T 9176 C mutation and on variation of the mutation percentage in tissues and in time. Therefore, multiple tissues of affected and unaffected carriers were analysed. Even-tually, prenatal diagnosis was offered with understanding by the couple that there could be considerable uncertainty in the interpretation of the results. Prenatal diagnosis was carried out twice on cultured and uncultured chorion villi and amniotic fluid cells. The result was a mutation percentage just below the assumed threshold of expression (90 %). The couple decided to continue the pregnancy and an apparently healthy child was born with an as yet unclear prognosis. This is the first prenatal diagnosis for a carrier of the T 9176 C mutation. Prenatal diagnosis for this mutation is technically reliable, but the prognostic predictions are not straightforward. Key words: Leigh syndrome/mtDNA/PGD/prenatal diagnosi...|$|E
