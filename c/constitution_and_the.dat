5|$|Thio {{also argued}} that without a constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that it is}} unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.|$|E
5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament ("NCMP") is a {{candidate}} of an opposition political party who, despite having lost in a general election, is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ("MP") by virtue of provisions in the <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status.

In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of judicial review now applied to internal security matters.|$|E

5|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the {{plaintiff}} {{argued that the}} 1989 amendments to the Constitution had violated the basic features of the Constitution by breaching the principle of separation of powers by usurping judicial power, and contravening the rule of law. The Court rejected {{the application of the}} basic features doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Constitution,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fact that the framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament's power of amendment. The Court also held that, in any case, there had been no violation of the Constitution's basic features on the facts of the case. On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds, and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore.|$|E

The governor's veto can be overridden by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature. The 1891 constitution empowered the governor with a line-item veto, but its use was forbidden on constitutional amendments and laws related to the classification of property for tax purposes.|$|E
