40|$|We {{have tested}} a {{relative}} spectral lag (RSL) method suggested earlier as a luminosity/redshift (or distance) estimator, using the generalized method by Schaefer & Collazzi. We find the derivations from the luminosity/redshift-RSL (L/R-RSL) relation are comparable with the corresponding observations. Applying the luminosity-RSL relation to two different GRB samples, {{we find that}} there exist no violators from the generalized test, namely the Nakar & Piran test and Li test. We also find that about 36 per cent of Schaefer's sample are outliers for the L/R-RSL relation within 1 σ confidence level, but no violators at 3 σ level within the current precision of L/R-RSL relation. An analysis of several potential outliers for other luminosity relations shows they can match the L/R-RSL relation well within an acceptable uncertainty.

40|$|Doubly special {{relativity}} (DSR), with both an invariant velocity and an invariant length scale, elegantly preserves {{the principle of}} relativity between moving observers, and appears as a promising candidate of the quantum theory of gravity. We study the modifications of photon gas thermodynamics {{in the framework of}} DSR with an invariant length |λ|, after properly taking into account the effects of modified dispersion relation, upper bounded energy-momentum space, and deformed integration measure. We show that with a positive λ, the grand partition function, the energy density, the specific heat, the entropy, and the pressure are smaller than those of {{special relativity}} (SR), while the velocity of photons and the ratio of pressure to energy are larger. In contrast, with a negative λ, the quantum gravity effects show up in the opposite direction. However, these effects only manifest themselves significantly when the temperature is larger than 10 ^- 3 E_ P. Thus, DSR can have considerable influence on the early universe in <b>cosmological</b> <b>study.</b> Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, final version for publication in AP...|$|R

40|$|Large planned {{photometric}} surveys {{will discover}} {{hundreds of thousands}} of supernovae (SNe), outstripping the resources available for spectroscopic follow-up and necessitating the development of purely photometric methods to exploit these events for <b>cosmological</b> <b>study.</b> We present a light-curve fitting technique for SN Ia photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation in which the redshift is determined simultaneously with the other fit parameters. We implement this "LCFIT+Z" technique within the frameworks of the MLCS 2 k 2 and SALT-II light-curve fit methods and determine the precision on the redshift and distance modulus. This method is applied to a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 296 SNe Ia from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey and 37 publicly available SNe Ia from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). We have also applied the method to a large suite of realistic simulated light curves for existing and planned surveys, including SDSS, SNLS, and LSST. When intrinsic SN color fluctuations are included, the photo-z precision for the simulation is consistent with that in the data. Finally, we compare the LCFIT+Z photo-z precision with previous results using color-based SN photo-z estimates. Comment: accepted by Ap...|$|R

From the spectra alone, 20 candidates are spectrally classified as SNe Ia with redshifts ranging from z= 0. 212 to z= 1. 181. Of the remaining 19 candidates, 1 might be a Type II supernova and 11 exhibit broad supernova-like spectral features and/or have supernova-like light curves. The candidates were discovered in 8 separate ground-based searches. In those searches in which SNe Ia at z ~ 0. 5 were targeted, over 80 % of the observed candidates were spectrally classified as SNe Ia. In those searches in which SNe Ia with z > 1 were targeted, 4 candidates with z > 1 were spectrally classified as SNe Ia and later followed with ground and space based observatories. We present the spectra of all candidates, including those that could not be spectrally classified as supernova. Comment: 30 pages, 43 figures. Accepted by A&A.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} <b>cosmological</b> <b>study</b> of a universe {{in which the}} visible sector is coupled, albeit very weakly, to a hidden sector comprised of {{its own set of}} particles and interactions. Assuming that dark matter (DM) resides in the hidden sector and is charged under a stabilizing symmetry shared by both sectors, we determine all possible origins of weak-scale DM allowed within this broad framework. We show that DM can arise only through a handful of mechanisms, lending particular focus to Freeze-Out and Decay and Freeze-In, as well as their variations involving late time re-annihilations of DM and DM particle anti-particle asymmetries. Much like standard Freeze-Out, where the abundance of DM depends only on the annihilation cross-section of the DM particle, these mechanisms depend only on a very small subset of physical parameters, many of which may be measured directly at the LHC. In particular, we show that each DM production mechanism is associated with a distinctive window in lifetimes and cross-sections for particles which may be produced in the near future. We evaluate prospects for employing the LHC to definitively reconstruct the origin of DM in a companion paper. Comment: 32 pages, 19 figures; v 2 : references added, published versio...|$|R
