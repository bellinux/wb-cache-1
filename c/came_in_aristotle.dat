40|$|The author explores and criticises two {{arguments}} from ambiguity: S. Pinker’s argument from ambiguity {{in support of}} the ‘Language of Thought’ hypothesis, and the argument from ambiguity proposed by K. P. Parsons against Davidsonian ‘semantics of truth-conditions’. Leaning primarily on G. Harman and D. Davidson he aims to demonstrate that the Pinker/Parsons arguments share a common strategy, on the one hand, and imply and/or suggest, as he claims, an implausible view of ambiguity, on the other. Discussing Pinker’s argument he further attempts to elucidate {{the ways in which the}} modifications of public and inter-subjectively accessible aspects of the use of language reflect the differences in interpretations of an ambiguity. His exploration of the argument against ‘semantics of truth-conditions’ then aims to explain, contra Parsons, the sense in which talk about the truth conditions for ambiguity does not implicate a threat to Davidson’s perspective on the theory of meaning. Finally, the author argues for the view of ambiguity as a kind of ignorance/undecidability that, as he contends, represents both more realistic and more plausible theoretical option than the one on which both Pinker and Parsons found their arguments and which also <b>comes</b> out <b>in</b> <b>Aristotle</b> (under an interpretation), K.

(Internal Comments) Other {{parts of}} the abstract, need clean up and transcription: In the first chapter, I defend {{the view that the}} ei estin? Question bears on the existence, and not just the being or “subsistence”, of the objects of science. In the second chapter, I argue that hypotheses, for Aristotle, are {{assumptions}} of the existence of the primary elements of the science, which also includes nominal definitions of the primary elements of the science and of their per se attributes among the syllogistic premises. These definitions are nominal not because they fail to be truth-valuable (as on the usual understanding of the contrast between definitions and hypotheses), but only because they do not, of themselves, afford knowledge of the existence of their definienda. I Aristotle's scientific syllogism that goes back to the Greek and' Medieval commentators. In Chapter 6, I provide a kind of rationale for my interpretation of the ei esti-ti esti distinction" in terms of existence and essence by indicating how the notion of existence as a locative predicate may be implicit in the Aristotelian,’framework. I then go on to discuss the "place" of the objects_of science according to Aristotle. I argue. that after having dismissed Plato's noetos topos a n d 'the • doctrine of separation that went with it,- Aristotle presents., a rather complex account of his own-as to where the objects. 1 of science are located.. 1 In the conclusion o f - my thesis, I show how the existence essence distinction-enters Aristotle's Metaphysics. This provides the basis for some comparative observations concerning Aristotle's notion of being in the Posterior Analytics' and his doctrine in the Metaphysics. I argue that <b>in</b> the Metaphysics,x <b>Aristotle</b> tends to conflate existence, with essence and that both of these <b>come</b> together <b>in</b> <b>Aristotle's.</b> concept of substantial form...|$|R
