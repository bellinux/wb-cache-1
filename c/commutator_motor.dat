40|$|The {{first goal}} of this work is to analyse the most {{important}} problems connected with the present <b>commutator</b> <b>motors</b> that {{are made in the}} ETA company, to use a suitable method of vibration and commutation measurement at the present ETA 0986 aggregates, and to apply this measuring method in conditions of mass production. The vibration procedures were tested under exactly stated conditions. After testing in practice we think this method of measurement is quite suitable. The objective method of commutative measurement hasn't been known yet. That is why we suggest to measure voltage at motor brushes during the analysis of the correct commutation. This voltage would be analysed by means of special asynchronous and synchronous methods. On the basis of this measurement results it is possible to deduce the necessary relation for correct commutation. This measuring system enables the commutation analysis of small <b>commutator</b> <b>motors.</b> There are some problems concerning the measurement under conditions of mass production, because the commutation procedure is influenced with following aspects considerably: room humidity; quality of carbons, commutator; motor positioning; time of testing. We cannot influence the room humidity and time of testing during mass production and so this system doesn't provide exact results in this case.

40|$|The work {{concerns}} the constructive characteristics optimization of brushless D. C. (direct current) motors used in electromechanical spacecraft drives. The spacecraft electromechanical drives and units use rather widely the brushless D. C. motors {{in which a}} <b>motor</b> <b>commutator</b> is replaced with more reliable semiconductor commutator controlled by the rotor position sensors. However, these motors are of low power. Electrohydraulic actuators (EHA) use simple permanent-magnet motors (PMM) of rather high power and <b>commutator</b> <b>motors</b> with graphite brush variable contacts. High reliability of brush motors, and, therefore a reliability of EHA in general, substantially depends {{on the quality of}} <b>motor</b> <b>commutator</b> operation. There are different reasons for a possible impact on the normal <b>motor</b> <b>commutator</b> operation. One of them is brush wear. Sparking brushes and burning commutator bars are possible in case brushes are poorly grinded to fit, brushes cannot freely move true in the brush holder box, and in case an incorrect force to clamp brushes to the commutator is chosen. It is established that drive wear resistance and operability depends on the gas environment composition being under sealed motor housing. In dry nitrogen environment brush wear suddenly raises because of the changing tribological performances of the commutator thus leading to essentially falling isolation resistance and no motor start. It is recommended to fill a space under sealed motor housing with air. Positive experience of operating spacecraft device containers with mobile electromechanical couples allowed us to find that in this case a dew point of filled air must be minus 20 ˚C.

It has control simplicity and control accuracy although <b>commutator</b> <b>motor</b> has some inherent drawbacks due to its mechanical commutator. Normally, the older the motor, the higher the effects of some drawbacks. This dissertation is based on "Replacing an old DC drive system with a new AC drive system" in order to eliminate prevailing practical problems arisen due to aging of the drive system. The DC drive system being less reliable, that results high down time of the relevant machine effecting loss in production.. Briefing on new AC drive system, other than the existing control functions, some functional improvements are also adopted assuring far better running performance of the machine than present.

40|$|Electric {{propulsion}} {{of ships}} has experienced steady expansion for several decades. Since the early 20 th century, icebreakers have employed the flexibility and easy control of direct current (dc) motors {{to provide for}} ship operations that split ice with {{back and forth motion}} of the ship. More recently, cruise ships have employed diesel-electric propulsion systems {{to take advantage of the}} flexibility of diesel, as opposed to steam engines, and because the electric plant can also be used for hotel loads. Research vessels, ferries, tankers, and special purpose vessels have also taken advantage of increased flexibility and fuel efficiency with electric propulsion. Today, the U. S.

40|$|The {{structures}} of modern traction vehicles {{are based on}} new generation devices. Technical progress {{within the field of}} power transmission concerns such elements as sources of power supply, electric devices and energy electronic solutions in power transmission systems. The prototypes of traction vehicles being currently drawn up are hybrid vehicles using different kinds of sources of power supply of power transmission systems, the most important of which are combustion engines, contact systems, supercapacitors (ultracapacitors), accumulators and fuel cells. Main engines are usually electric machines. In energy electronic starting systems it is permissible to use all kinds of main electric engines, for example, direct-current <b>motors</b> (inline engines, <b>commutator</b> <b>motors</b> with permanent magnets or non-commutator motors) or three-phase motors of alternating current (induction and synchronous). This means a complete change of rules in energy managing in a vehicle. Sources of energy can have the function of basic power supply (contact system, combustion engine or combustion cell) or the function of power supply support (supercapacitors, accumulators or fuel cell). New functions of drive operation will be available, namely, leveling of basic power supply load, recuperation of braking energy of the whole train set, driving at the temporary disconnection of basic power supply (short-term application of accumulator as basic power supply).
