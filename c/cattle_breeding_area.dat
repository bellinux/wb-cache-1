50|$|The Deoni {{breed of}} cattle also {{sometimes}} known as Dongari/Dongarpati ("of the hills"), Surti or Deccani, has been evolved {{within the last}} 200 years. The name of the breed {{is derived from the}} Deoni Taluka of Latur district of Maharashtra. It is claimed that it has been developed from a strain descended from a mixture of Gir, Dangi and local cattle. A contribution from the Gir type of cattle is quite evident {{in the formation of the}} head and ears, and also of the horns to a certain extent. They also show a great similarity in general conformation and ruggedness to the Dangi cattle of Bombay State, an area which is not far from the Deoni <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>area</b> (Joshi, 1953).|$|E

40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: Localizada em Caçapava, SP, Brasil, indústria produtora de lingotes de chumbo provocou contaminação {{ambiental}} na região do Vale do Paraíba, com chumbo e cádmio. Com o objetivo de avaliar o grau de contaminação do leite produzido na região, devido à possível ingestão, pelo gado, de gramíneas e águas contaminadas, foram determinados os teores de chumbo e cádmio no leite. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Foram analisadas 218 amostras de leite in natura e pasteurizado. O cádmio e o chumbo foram determinados por espectrofotometria de absorção atômica com chama. RESULTADOS E CONCLUSÕES: Das amostras analisadas, 43 apresentaram teores de chumbo acima do limite máximo estabelecido pela legislação brasileira que é 0, 05 mg/kg. O valor da mediana encontrada para o chumbo foi 0, 04 mg/L. Os níveis de cádmio em todas as amostras foram menores que o limite de quantificação do método que é 0, 02 mg/L. Apesar da contaminação ambiental, os níveis encontrados para o cádmio no leite estão abaixo do limite estabelecido pela legislação brasileira que é 1, 0 mg/kg. INTRODUCTION: A factory producing lead ingots, {{located in}} Caçapava, caused lead and cadmium {{contamination of the}} environment, in the Paraiba Valley region of Southeastern, Brazil, through the discharge of industrial waste and the recycling of batteries. The factory, set in a rural, dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>area,</b> worried sanitary authorities who envisaged the possibility of these metals' having entered the food chain. For the purpose of assessing the levels of contamination of the milk produced in the region, due to the cattle's possible consumption of contaminated grass and water, the amounts of cadmium and lead present in the milk were verified. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Major producers, covering an area of up to 20 km from the contaminated source, authorized collection of 218 samples of both pasteurized and non-pasteurized milk, which were analysed. Lead and cadmium levels were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry, the lead being pre-concentrated by complexation with APDC (ammonium 1 -pyrrolidinecarbodithioate) and further extraction with isobutyl methylketone. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of {{the total number of}} samples, 43 presented lead levels over the maximum limit of 0. 05 mg/kg estabilished by Brazilian legislation. The median value found for lead was 0. 04 mg/L. The variance analysis, with 95 % confidence level, found no significant difference among the types of milk studied with regard to lead levels. As for cadmium, all samples showed levels below the 0. 02 mg/L quantification limit of the method. In spite of the environmental contamination, the levels of cadmium found in the milk were below the 1. 0 mg/kg limit established by Brazilian legislation...|$|E

40|$|Tapeworm {{infection}} is {{most common in}} <b>cattle</b> and pork <b>breeding</b> <b>areas.</b> Humans are the definitive host. Gravid segments of T saginata are passed in human feces to soil, where they are ingested by grazing animals, especially cattle. The eggs then hatch to release embryos that encyst in muscle as cysticerci. Humans are infected by eating raw or undercooked infected beef. Most individuals infected with T saginata are asymptomatic, but abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms may be present. Eosinophilia is common. The most common presenting finding is the passage of proglottids in the stool. Treatment is highly satisfactory with praziquantel. Taenia Saginata Asiatica is a variant of Taenia saginata where the intermediate host is Pork. Normally the pork tapeworm is mean for Taenia solium.

50|$|Lund Khwar has {{historically}} been an important town due to its geography. During the Gandharan era (2nd century BCE) {{it had been a}} visiting sanctuary for Buddhist Monks from their nearby strongholds at Takht Bhai. Many archaeological sites have thus been discovered. Even before the Buddhist times it was a major <b>cattle</b> and herd <b>breeding</b> <b>area.</b> Archeological and Historical clues point towards these conclusions. The armies of Alexander the Great reached the Indus Valley by two separate routes, one through the Khyber Pass and the other led by Alexander himself through Kunar, Bajaur, Swat, and Buner in 326 BCE. After Alexander's death, the valley came under the rule of Chandragupta, who ruled the valley from 297 to 321 BCE. During the reign of the Buddhist emperor Ashoka (the grandson of Chandragupta) Buddhism became the religion of the Peshawar Valley. The valley saw the revival of Brahmanism after the Greeks took over in the time of King Mehanda. The Scythians and Indians followed and retained control of the valley till the 7th century CE.|$|R
