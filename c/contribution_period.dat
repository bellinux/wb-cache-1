However, life-cycle strategies that maintain a constant exposure to equities during most of the accumulation period, switching swiftly to bonds in the last decade before retirement, seem to produce better results and are easier to explain. Dynamic management strategies can provide somewhat higher replacement rates for a given level of risk than the more deterministic strategies, at least in the case of pay-outs in the form of variable withdrawals.

30|$|The lack of {{portable}} social benefits—such as pensions, health care, and social assistance—might also constrain {{the mobility of}} labor between EU countries. EU legislation grants portability of such benefits at a level not found in any other region of the world. In principle, the most important benefits (for example, public pension and health benefits) are fully portable within the European Union and, to some extent, with countries outside the European Union. Nevertheless, important challenges remain 22. First, the administration of portability can be burdensome for intra-EU migrants. For example, old-age pensions are not paid as a single benefit, but by each pension insurance fund separately. The determination of separate pensions, taking into account <b>contribution</b> <b>periods</b> from different member states, is complex and opaque. Second, legislation on portability {{does not apply to}} occupational benefits, so moving might lead to considerable losses. Third, social assistance benefits are excluded from portability; the lack of a Europe-wide social safety net could also act as a barrier to intra-EU mobility.|$|R
40|$|How {{does the}} {{retirement}} age affect the {{physical and mental health}} of seniors? We identify this effect based on the 1993 reform of the French pension system, which was heterogeneously introduced among the population. With each cohort, the French government gradually increased the incentive to work using two tools: the <b>contribution</b> <b>period</b> required for entitlement to a full pension and the number of reference earning years taken to calculate pensions. We use a unique database on health and employment in France in 1999 and 2005, when the cohorts affected by the reform started to retire. A difference-in-differences approach, with the control group comprising public sector employees (not concerned by the 1993 reform), finds that the people more affected by the reform, and hence with a stronger incentive to work, were those posting less of an improvement and even a deterioration in their health between 1999 and 2005. Subsequently, taking the reform as a tool to filter out the potential influence of health on employment choices, we show that retirement improves physical and social health. The more physically impacted are the low-educated individuals...|$|E
40|$|Lump sum {{payments}} in {{compensation for the}} transfer to the Government of pension liabilities {{are one of the}} main categories of one-off budgetary measures that have developed in Europe over the recent years. These operations have been the most frequent in France, because of the various special employer schemes existing in the public sector. As pension systems and accounting standards are being reformed and former public companies are being privatized, adjustments seemed necessary. The paper studies the treatment of such measures in national accounts and reviews the different transactions implemented in France since 1997 and the various impacts on public finances. It assesses the risk of budgetary losses for the French government due to unexpected developments in the different parameters used for the calculation of the lump sums. Stress tests show that these risks are very limited, especially with the perspective of an increase in the <b>contribution</b> <b>period</b> that will apply to all pension schemes.

For women, pension dispersion is also due to dispersion in <b>contribution</b> <b>periods.</b> We also decompose the Gini coefficient by source of income to measure the impact of institutional rules on the extent of pension inequality.

Germany abolished an important early retirement program for women born after 1951, effectively raising the ERA for women by three years. We analyze the effects of this huge increase on employment, unemployment, disability pensions, and inactivity rates. Our results suggest that the reform increased both employment and unemployment rates of women age 60 and over. However, we do not find evidence for active program substitution from employment into alternative social support programs. Instead employed women remained employed and unemployed women remained unemployed. The results suggest an increase in inequality within the affected cohorts...|$|R

40|$|The current {{economic}} and financial crisis has shaken confidence in funded pension systems in general and in defined contribution (DC) pension plans in particular. The crisis has highlighted the impact of market conditions on retirement savings accumulated in DC pension plans and the uncertainty as to whether those retirement savings may prove adequate to finance retirement – particularly for those close to retirement. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide recommendations on how to ensure adequate retirement income from DC pension plans. In this context, this paper addresses three main questions: 1) How much do people need to save? 2) How can the effects of market risk on DC pension plans be alleviated? 3) How can retirement income be protected during the payout phase? The analysis concludes that in order to deliver adequate retirement income from DC pension plans with a certain degree of certainty, there is a need for comprehensive measures which include: higher contributions; increasing the <b>contribution</b> <b>period</b> by postponing retirement; setting as default options relatively conservative investment policies including life-cycle strategies; and managing risk in the payout phase with inflationindexed life annuities. ...|$|E
30|$|Full retirement. An {{individual}} can fully retire through three different paths: ordinary retirement, early retirement and special retirement {{at the age}} of 64. The ordinary retirement age is 65. For those who started contributing to the system after 1967 and since the 2002 amendment, early retirement at age 61 is permitted with strict requirements. Namely, they have to (a) certify a minimum effective <b>contribution</b> <b>period</b> of 30  years, (b) be registered as a job seeker, in the public employment service offices, during a period of 6  months immediately prior to the date of the retirement application and (c) the job termination should not been caused by worker’s free will. Early retirement at age 60 is permitted (if the minimum period of contributions is satisfied), according to the rules of a transient law, for those who contributed to labour mutual funds that preceded the establishment of the social security system. The amount of all early retirement pensions are subject to reduction coefficients. Finally, retirement at 64  years, certifying the minimum period of contributions, is possible if the firm hires another worker for a minimum period of 1  year to replace the retiree. In this latter case the retiree is eligible to full benefits and no reduction coefficients are applied.|$|E

40|$|Classical public {{pensions}} {{systems are}} financed through Pay-as-you-go (PAYG), meaning that current contributions finance the expenditure on pensions. However, some countries combine funding and PAYG financing techniques, see Könberg et al. (2006). The idea behind this mixed {{system is to}} allocate {{a part of the}} individual's contribution to an individual funded account, whereas the other part is allocated to PAYG.

This is done in the specific context of a Defined Contribution design with constant contribution rate. This problem was already introduced in Devolder et al. (2014) for the case of a constant allocation over time. We generalize this result in a multi-generational Overlapping Generations framework. The age-dependent optimal allocation is calculated for a reference cohort participating in the scheme. Finally, we study the allocation problem involving all contributing cohorts. The aim is to obtain the age-dependent allocation per cohort which will maximize their pension wealth at retirement, and which ensures liquidity to pay the expenditure on pensions for the same year. This constrained optimization problem gives a result which depends on age, wealth accumulated so far, survival probability, the risk associated to the remaining <b>contribution</b> <b>period</b> and the liquidity of the system...|$|E
