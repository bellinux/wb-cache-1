The stadium's architectural focal point is the sweeping roof and support masts which are separate from the concrete bowl. A <b>catenary</b> <b>cable</b> is situated around the inner perimeter of the roof structure which is tied to the masts via forestay cables. Backstay cables and corner ties from the masts are connected to the ground to support the structure. With the expansion of the South Stand in 2015 to accommodate a third tier of seating, the original south end roof was dismantled; but with the southern masts and corner ties remaining, so as to continue to tie the <b>catenary</b> <b>cable</b> which now runs below the new roof. [...] The new higher South Stand roof is a separate structure, with its own set of braced masts and cables; and it is expected that a counterpart arrangement will be adopted for the proposed North Stand expansion.|$|E

40|$|The {{classical}} moving co-ordinate frame {{approach and}} Hamilton's principle are employed to derive a distributed-parameter mathematical model {{to investigate the}} dynamic behaviour of deep mine hoisting cables. This model describes the coupled lateral–longitudinal dynamic response of the cables in terms of non–linear partial differential equations that accommodate the non-stationary nature of the system. Subsequently, the Rayleigh–Ritz procedure is applied to formulate a discrete mathematical model. Consequently, a system of non-linear non-stationary coupled second order ordinary differential equations arises to govern the temporal behaviour of the cable system. This discrete model with quadratic and cubic non-linear terms describes the modal interactions between lateral oscillations of the <b>catenary</b> <b>cable</b> and longitudinal oscillations of the vertical rope. It is shown that {{the response of the}} catenary–vertical rope system may feature a number of resonance phenomena, including external, parametric and autoparametric resonances.

The results also show that an average 97. 3 % precision and an average 97. 7 % accuracy at the point cloud level are achieved. The high precision and high accuracy of the rail track classification (both greater than 96 %) at the point cloud level stems from the great impact of the employed template matching method on excluding the false positives.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a state-of-the-art-review and twodifferent approaches for solving the moving load problem ofcable-stayed and suspension bridges. The first approach uses a simplified analysis method tostudy the dynamic response of simple cable-stayed bridgemodels. The bridge is idealized as a Bernoulli-Euler beam onelastic supports with varying support stiffness. To solve theequation of {{motion of the}} bridge, the finite difference methodand the mode superposition technique are used. The second approach {{is based on the}} nonlinear finite elementmethod and is used to study the response of more realisticcable-stayed and suspension bridge models considering exactcable behavior and nonlinear geometric effects. The cables aremodeled using a two-node <b>catenary</b> <b>cable</b> element derived using"exact" analytical expressions for the elastic catenary. Twomethods for evaluating the dynamic response are presented. Thefirst for evaluating the linear traffic load response using themode superposition technique and the deformed dead load tangentstiffness matrix, and the second for the nonlinear traffic loadresponse using the Newton-Newmark algorithm. The implemented programs have been verified by comparinganalysis results with those found in the literature and withresults obtained using a commercial finite element code. Several numerical examples are presented including one for theGreat Belt suspension bridge in Denmark. Parametric studieshave been conducted to investigate the effect of, among others,bridge damping, bridge-vehicle interaction, cables vibration,road surface roughness, vehicle speed, and tuned mass dampers. From the numerical study, it was concluded that road surfaceroughness has great influence on the dynamic response andshould always be considered.

40|$|A {{simulation}} model is presented which investigates the dynamic response {{of a deep}} mine hoisting cable system during a winding cycle. The response, namely the lateral motions of the <b>catenary</b> <b>cable</b> and the longitudinal motion of the vertical rope with conveyance is observed on the fast time scale, and the slow time scale is introduced to monitor the variation of slowly varying parameters of the system. The cable equivalent proportional damping parameters, and periodic excitation functions resulting from the cross-over cable motion on the winder drum are identified. Subsequently, the model is solved numerically using parameters of a double-drum multi-rope system. Since the system eigenvalues are widely spread {{and the problem is}} of stiff nature, the numerical simulation is conducted using a stiff solver. The results of the simulation demonstrate various transient non-linear resonance phenomena arising in the system during the wind. The nominal ascending cycle simulation results reveal adverse dynamic behaviour of the catenary largely due to the autoparametric interactions between the in- and out-of-plane modes. Principal parametric resonances of the lateral modes also occur, and conditions for autoparametric interactions between the lateral and longitudinal modes arise. Additionally, a transition through a number of primary longitudinal resonances takes place during the wind. The adverse dynamic motions in the system promote large oscillations in the cable tension which must be considered significant with respect to fatigue of the cable. It is noted that a small change in the winding velocity may cause large changes in the dynamic response due to the resonance region shifts. Consequently, the resonance modal interactions can be avoided, to a large extent, if the winding velocity is increased to an appropriate level. ...|$|E

40|$|Moving vehicle loads, {{associated}} with roadway traffic can induce significant dynamic {{effects in the}} structural behavior of bridges, especially for long-span bridges. The main objective {{of this research is}} to study traffic induced dynamic responses of long-span bridges, particular for box-girder bridges and cable-stayed bridges. The finite element method has been employed in this study to obtain a three-dimensional mathematical model for the bridge system. For box-girder bridges, the deck, the box girders and the diaphragms are modeled as 8 -node shell element. Linear elastic structural responses are considered. For cable-stayed bridges, the box-girder bridge deck and diaphragms are modeled as 8 -node shell element, while the pylons are modeled as beam element. Stability functions are applied to both shell element and beam element to account for geometric nonlinearity. A two-node <b>catenary</b> <b>cable</b> element is adopted using exact analytical expressions for modeling stayed cables. Non-linear structural responses are considered. For the present analytical study of the bridge-vehicle system, the vehicle is modeled as a three-axle six-wheel system. The equation derivations are described in details. The dynamic response is evaluated using the modal method and the step-by-step integration method. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of the bridge are obtained based on the deformed dead load tangent stiffness matrix. For cable-stayed bridge, an iterative scheme is utilized to obtain the deformed dead load tangent stiffness matrix due to its nonlinear characteristics. The dynamic responses of bridges subjected to traffic loads are complicated because the dynamic effect induced by moving vehicles is basically influenced by the interaction between the bridge and the moving vehicle. The bridge-vehicle interaction is affected by many factors, such as vehicle speed, road roughness, damping of bridge and vehicle, dynamic characteristics of bridge, and etc. Parametric study has been carried out to investigate those factors that influence the bridge-vehicle interaction. The finite element computer program GLBA in FORTRAN 90 and MATLAB is developed to carry out the proposed research. GLBA includes four main modules: static linear analysis, static non-linear analysis, free vibration analysis and dynamic analysis due to traffic load...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comparison}} between different representation methods for form finding structures. The aim is to test the tools {{used in the present}} to represent and to generate shapes built in the past. We intend for form finding structures all the shapes that are characterized by minimizing the use of materials, these shapes are the result of an optimization process where the structure itself defines its own shape based on its figure of equilibrium under applied loads. From hanging cables used by Gaudì to inverted hanging membranes built by Heins Isler, the only way to define the optimal form, before the computer age, has been the systematic use of physical models. The Isler's method was based on physical models that he measured to produce resin models on which he could be structural tests. This method, that looks very simple, wasn't copied because you need a very accurate survey of inverted hanging membranes to make a good test models and you have to choose between many possible alternative solutions. We {{think that one of the}} main reasons of poor diffusion of this method has been the lack of tools for accurate survey and representation to simplify the management of form finding process.
