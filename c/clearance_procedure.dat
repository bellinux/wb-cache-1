The session judge, high court judge and their rightful verdicts to lodged the FIR was put aside, we protested for months to get our fundamental rights, Justice Baqir Najafi & the commission report has been tucked away, we also remember the statement of CM Punjab and his resignation if the reports even indicates the slightest towards his guilt. The report did just exactly just that and stated that the Punjab Police did exactly that what the CM desired, hence where is the resignation when all fingers are pointing at the CM of Punjab.The culprits mentioned in the FIR have been appointed & sent abroad, rewarded with high positions & the eye wash game was played by the inept rulers to wash its hands clean from the blood of the PAT martyrs, hence we today have travelled abroad for justice, we will struggle at each legal platform for justice. We have made contact with law firms in United Kingdom, France and Netherlands till this moment.We are currently undergoing our meetings and consultation and intend to approach the following:1. The Human Rights Council 2. The International Criminal Court will be approached, currently the law experts are looking into the technicalities to put forward the Model Town Massacre case, these courts of has announced sentences in the past for 14, 12, 18 years, some cases are ongoing regarding various politicians and state representatives.3. English High Court, Torture Convention 1984 which holds a universal jurisdiction.These 3 courts have been in our sight and we are working with lawyers to approach these forms in the most appropriate manner.On the other hand by which intention has the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif travelled to the UN to represent the Muslims of Kashmir, he intends to fight the case against PM of India, to that nation whom he has suspended the <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> for, and has exempted the clearance & custom check procedure, who always remains silent when the neighbouring country renders threatening statements, the PM has always remained silent and by which face does he intend to represent and talk in favour the Muslims of Kashmir?I announced a list of 50 Indian nationals, with their passport numbers and date of arrival and departure in link with the sugar mills of the sitting PM, my question is why are all silent on this matter?The inept rulers have suspended all visa regulations, among the list of 300 Indian nationals working in the sugar mills of the PM, I have started to trace the visa duration, (Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri showed a copy of the 10 year multiple visa acceptance of Namdee Shiridarh as a sample).We now want the democratic nations to come to know how this inept government is destabilising its nation and how they are violating the laws of human rights.The government is avoiding rangers operating in the province of Punjab to eradicate terrorism, an intentional delay to pack away the breeding grounds of terrorism. This will result in missing terrorists and only then rangers will be granted partial permission for operation.National sovereignty is the top most priory in my sight, I will continue to fight against terrorism till my last breath.|$|E

40|$|Inertial {{motion sensors}} in the {{flight control system}} pick up high {{frequency}} signals due to the flexible modes {{in addition to the}} rigid body responses and could lead to instability at the structural frequencies when the rigid body stability augmentation feedback loops are closed. To attenuate the effects of this structural coupling, notch filters are designed and placed in series with the inertial sensors in each of the feedback paths. During the initial phase of control law design and development, aircraft structural response data is generally not available. Therefore, while designing the rigid body control laws, an additional budget is allocated for phase lags introduced by the structural notch filters. Once the structural coupling tests are carried out on the aircraft, structural filters are designed {{in order to meet the}} certification requirements. During developmental flight tests with multiple prototype vehicles there are likely to be variations in the structural response characteristics as the production processes are maturing and also, due to minor updates to the aircraft standard of preparation and addition of different external stores. This calls for the redesign of structural filters and subsequent onboard software development and testing which is a lengthy process. Hence, in order to meet project schedules without compromising safety, the <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> was modified so that it could be efficiently used for flights during the development phase. This paper presents a revised <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> based not only on values of the nominal stability margins, but also on the sensitivity of structural stability margins to the modal frequency perturbation. This change in the clearance philosophy was considered acceptable for the developmental phase of flights but for the final production vehicle standard one would need to strictly follow the MIL-F 9490 D Standard guidelines. This paper discusses the changes carried out to the <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure,</b> the rationale behind the changes made, and also gives directions for future research in robust stabilization of structural modes as well as notch filter design...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The interaction between an aircraft's structural dynamics, unsteady aerodynamics and flight control system is known as aeroservoelasticity. The problem can occur because the control system sensors are of sufficient bandwidth to sense the structural vibrations {{as well as the}} rigid-body motion of the aircraft. This sensed structural vibration can result in further excitation of the structure through both aerodynamic and inertial excitation, leading to a potential closed-loop instability. At present, such an unstable interaction is prevented by the inclusion of notch filters within the feedback path which have a detrimental effect on the aircraft's rigid-body performance. The current <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> is restricted by a poor understanding of the array of complex issues involved. The aim of the project was to develop a clearer understanding of the interactions between system components leading to a reduction in the clearance requirements. Work has concentrated on the effects of system nonlinearities and on the digital nature of modem control systems. A major source of nonlinearities within the control system are the servo-hydraulic actuators. Through detailed actuator modelling confirmed by rig testing of actual hardware, these nonlinearities are analysed and a method for predicting the response of the actuators in the presence of two input signals proposed. As a result, it is demonstrated that an unstable structural oscillation would cause a limit-cycle oscillation as opposed to an unbounded response. Through nonlinear system theory the criteria for the existence of such limit-cycles are obtained, enabling them to be predicted and therefore prevented. Consideration of the true nonlinear nature of the aeroservoelastic system has enabled an alternative design and <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> to be proposed which reduces the attenuation requirements of the structural-mode filters whilst ensuring satisfactory aircraft performance even in the presence of modelling errors. This design procedure is demonstrated on both a model of the aircraft system and a simple test system enabling verification of the nonlinear analysis and comparison between the current and proposed alternative procedures. As a result, it is demonstrated that consideration of the true nonlinear nature of the aeroservoelastic interaction has the potential for allowing a significant reduction in structural filter attenuation requirements. Consequently, a reduction in the phase lag due to the filters is possible resulting in an improvement in closed-loop system performance whilst ensuring the safe operation of the aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{development}} of airborne flight management systems (FMS) and ground-based {{air traffic control}} (ATC) systems has {{tended to focus on}} different objectives with little consideration for operational integration. A joint program, between NASA's Ames Research Center (Ames) and Langley Research Center (Langley), is underway to investigate the issues of, and develop systems for, the integration of ATC and airborne automation systems. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate a profile negotiation process (PNP) between the Center/TRACON Automation System (CTAS) and an aircraft equipped with a four-dimensional flight management system (4 D FMS). Prototype procedures were developed to support the functional implementation of this process. The PNP was designed to provide an arrival trajectory solution which satisfies the separation requirements of ATC while remaining {{as close as possible to}} the aircraft's preferred trajectory. Results from the experiment indicate the potential for successful incorporation of aircraft-preferred arrival trajectories in the CTAS automation environment. Fuel savings on the order of 2 percent to 8 percent, compared to fuel required for the baseline CTAS arrival speed strategy, were achieved in the test scenarios. The data link procedures and clearances developed for this experiment, while providing the necessary functionality, were found to be operationally unacceptable to the pilots. In particular, additional pilot control and understanding of the proposed aircraft-preferred trajectory, and a simplified <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> were cited as necessary for operational implementation of the concept...|$|E

40|$|The California Automated Mortality Linkage System (CAMLIS), {{established}} in 1981 {{to facilitate the}} conduct of follow-up studies in the State of California, employs a combination of deterministic and probabilistic linkage decision criteria to perform the death clearance function. The system was evaluated against four traditional death clearance procedures {{and the performance of}} each procedure measured in terms of measures of sensitivity and specificity. Only one procedure was associated with a specificity lower than 0. 99; for that one, the specificity was 0. 93. There was much greater fluctuation in the observed sensitivity levels. In one of the procedures, CAMLIS demonstrated a sensitivity of 0. 97 versus 0. 79 for the Social Security Administration. A comparison against the National Death Index (NDI) produced sensitivities of 0. 89 for CAMLIS and 0. 94 for the NDI.

40|$|Background: The {{frequency}} of residual {{common bile duct}} (CBD) stones in patients with previous cholecystectomy ranges from 2 - 10 %, and a minimally invasive approach is generally recommended for these patients. This study reviews the experience {{in the management of}} residual CBD stones at the Aga Khan University Hospital. Methods: All adult patients diagnosed to have residual CBD stones, from 1993 to 2001, were identified and analyzed in terms of the treatment modality utilized and its associated complications. The role of endoscopic sphincterotomy was particularly analyzed in our set-up. Results: The study population consisted of 66 patients. The mean age was 52 (range: 18 - 84 years) years with a female to male ratio of 51 : 15. The primary mode of management consisted of endoscopic sphincterotomy in 61 patients (92. 5 %). The initial clearance rate for these patients was 75 %, while the remaining 25 % required ancillary procedures to achieve a complete <b>clearance.</b> <b>Procedure</b> related complications were observed in 17 (28 %) patients, with zero mortality. The other 5 patients (7. 5 %) underwent an open choledochotomy as a primary procedure with no further complications. Conclusions: Endoscopic sphincterotomy is the most frequent treatment modality used for the management of residual CBD stones at our hospital. Although initial success rate seems low, the fact that endoscopic sphincterotomy is a less invasive procedure justifies its preferential utilization. The study does not compare the results of endoscopic management with open surgery, as the number of patients managed by open choledochotomy is very small...|$|E

Customs plays {{a pivotal role}} in international trade transactions and in this paper, the use of an automated systems approach to the processes involved in cargo clearance is highlighted. The successful implementation of automation projects largely depends on an effective project team and the unequivocal commitment of senior management. Better results can be achieved by simplifying procedures in accordance with international best practices instead of simply automating manual systems. From traditional tasks to trade facilitation Customs formalities at border crossings are key elements in international trade insofar as they serve to monitor and control the movement of goods and passengers through customs barriers. The collection of revenue by way of duties and taxes {{is one of the main}} activities of any customs administration. The percentage of revenue collected by the customs administrations of developing countries can be up to 50 per cent of total government revenue. Certain commodities require the approval of other statutory agencies before they are released from the border-crossing point (for example, quarantine and health authorities). Statutory agencies rarely delegate authority to clear such cargo to Customs. As a result, the cargo <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> has become complicated and cumbersome. The World Customs Organization (WCO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international organisations all promote trade facilitation.
