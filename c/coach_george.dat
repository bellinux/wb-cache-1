Prior to the game, the Staleys' <b>coach,</b> <b>George</b> Halas, moved their home {{field to the}} much larger Cubs Park in Chicago and hired Paddy Driscoll from the Cardinals to play on his team {{in order to help}} defeat the Pros, which was against league rules at the time.

5|$|Kindt {{forfeited}} {{his last}} year of eligibility at Wisconsin after the 1946 season {{to play in the}} National Football League. It was reported that the Chicago Bears had Kindt as its top player in their draft wish list. By the time the 1947 NFL Draft was held, the Bears managed to get Kindt with the eleventh overall pick. He soon signed a three-year contract at a reported $25,000 to play for head <b>coach</b> <b>George</b> Halas.

5|$|After {{his short}} stint in baseball, Jordan {{returned}} to basketball {{late in the}} 1994–95 season. Although he did not lead the Bulls to the Finals, he returned to pre-retirement form the next year while the team acquired perennial rebounding champion Dennis Rodman. The 1995–96 Bulls finished the regular season 72–10, attaining, at the time, the best regular season record in NBA history (Later surpassed by the Golden State Warriors in the 2015-16 season {{with a record of}} 73-9). They dominated in the playoffs, with series records of 3–0, 4–1 and 4–0, before facing the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA Finals. After the Bulls took a 3–0 series lead, Seattle won the next two games after <b>coach</b> <b>George</b> Karl switched point guard Gary Payton onto Jordan, leading to a sixth game. However, Jordan altered his game to accommodate the advances of Payton, and the Bulls won Game 6 to win their fourth title.|$|E

5|$|Malawi first {{competed in}} the Summer Olympics at the 1972 Games in Munich, Germany. They participated on ten {{occasions}} prior to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, where they made their Summer Paralympics debut in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the expection of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Games in the Soviet Union, the former because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa, and the latter because the country joined the United States-led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. Malawi intended to make its first appearance in the Summer Paralympics at the 2012 Games in London but withdrew hours before the opening ceremony started {{because of a lack}} of funding. The country participated in the Rio Paralympic Games from 7 to 18 September 2016. Malawi was one of six countries to make their first appearance in the quadrennial event; the others were Aruba, Congo, Somalia, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. They sent a single middle-distance runner, Taonere Banda, who was announced by the Malawi Paralympics Committee on 4 July, and was occupied by her <b>coach</b> <b>George</b> Luhanga. Banda was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.|$|E
5|$|At Eton, Allen played many sports, but his {{academic}} performance {{was no more}} than respectable, and he later admitted to laziness. In cricket, Allen played for his school house team and had reasonable success with bat and ball; by 1918 he was house cricket captain. After a trial match, and a spell in the school second team, he progressed to the Eton first team in 1919. The effects of a rib injury limited his bowling, and he achieved little with the bat. Even so, he was chosen to play in the prestigious match against Harrow School, played annually at Lord's Cricket Ground in London. In his second innings, he scored 69 runs, the highest individual score of the game, and Eton won the match. His rib injury continued to trouble him in 1920, and caused him such pain that he considered abandoning bowling altogether. The new Eton <b>coach</b> <b>George</b> Hirst persuaded him to continue, and a few weeks later Allen took nine for 19 (nine wickets while conceding 19 runs) in an innings against Winchester. But other than this performance, Allen was ineffective. More successful in 1921, he opened the batting for a time; he also opened the bowling, topping the Eton bowling averages. He had some success at Lord's against Harrow and a particularly fast bowling spell in this match was seen by Hubert Ashton, who was to captain the Cambridge University team the following year—Allen had already been approved for a place at Trinity College, Cambridge beginning later that year. He was chosen to play in the annual matches at Lord's in which two teams representing the best public schoolboys opposed each other, but was forced to withdraw with sunstroke.|$|E
