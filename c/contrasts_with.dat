5|$|The {{echolocation}} {{call of the}} bristle-faced free-tailed bat <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> {{all other}} Australian molossid bats in that it displays a strongly frequency modulated search phase pulse. The bristle-faced free-tailed bat also has the highest mean characteristic frequency (36 kHz) of any Australian Mormopterus.|$|E
5|$|ASL is used {{throughout}} Anglo-America. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> Europe, where {{a variety of}} sign languages are used within the same continent.

5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.|$|E
5|$|Other NAD-dependent enzymes include {{bacterial}} DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends {{by using}} NAD {{as a substrate}} to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> eukaryotic DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first named Toxostoma curvirostre by William John Swainson in 1827. Since then, six {{subspecies}} have been recognized, {{and have been}} divided into two branches. Genetic {{research has indicated that}} the curve-billed thrasher is the sister species of a clade consisting of the ocellated thrasher, brown thrasher, long-billed thrasher, and Cozumel thrasher. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> an earlier suggestion that curve-billed and ocellated thrashers are closest relatives.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the genus}} Entoloma, the fungus is {{classified}} in the subgenus Leptonia, section Cyanula because of its overall habit, clampless hyphae, and abundant granules of pigment. Noordeloos and Gates place it in the stirps (a grouping of related species within a genus) Austroprunicolor, characterized by mushrooms with a violaceous pink or blue cap that <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> a pallid, whitish, polished stipe.|$|E
5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form {{that would not have}} been used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E

5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L. Fleiss) is a {{statistical}} measure {{for assessing the}} reliability of agreement between a fixed number of raters when assigning categorical ratings {{to a number of}} items or classifying items. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> other kappas such as Cohen's kappa, which only work when assessing the agreement between not more than two raters or the interrater reliability for one appraiser versus themself. The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Australian census in 1911 there were 611 people {{resident}} {{in the town}} and surrounding area. By 1931 this had reduced to 246, of which 186 lived in the town. In the latest census, in 2011, 330 people were recorded living in 148 dwellings in the Hagley statistical area. The census does not record the town's population but the Meander Valley Council notes it as c.150 in 2014. Hagley's people are predominantly Australian born with 89.1% reporting as such in the 2011 census. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> 83.6% for Tasmania and 69.8% {{for the whole of}} Australia.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E

5|$|Patterns {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in the camas pocket gopher have been studied. Although there are no subspecies, there is substantial genetic diversity within the species. Its genetic patterns are consistent with limited inbreeding within specific populations. This is similar to patterns described in Botta's pocket gopher and the southern pocket gopher, {{both of which are}} members of the same genus. However, it <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> patterns noted in Baird's pocket gopher and the plains pocket gopher, members of a separate genus, Geomys, which showed a higher degree of inbreeding.|$|E

Cotton and silk {{spinning}} and weaving in local mills attracted an influx of families and provided Salford with a strong economy. Salford Docks was a principal dockyard of the Manchester Ship Canal. By {{the end of the}} 19th century Salford had an enlarged working class community and suffered from chronic overpopulation. Industrial activities declined during the 20th century however, causing a local economic depression.

5|$|Serpins are a {{superfamily}} {{of proteins}} with similar structures that were first identified for their protease inhibition activity and {{are found in}} all kingdoms of life. The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (serine protease inhibitors). They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action, in which they irreversibly inhibit their target protease by undergoing a large conformational change to disrupt its active site. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> the more common competitive mechanism for protease inhibitors that bind to and block access to the protease active site.|$|E

He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{cinematography}} by William Lubtchansky furthers Rivette's {{interest in}} visual textures. The film's colour palette is largely natural, except for certain scenes—like the initial dream sequence—that are filmed in vivid colours. In {{the scene where}} Marie is arranging the attic room, the light changes—from shadow to warm light—just as she places an oil lamp on a stool to indicate that she has placed it correctly; this introduces a supernatural element that <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> the realism {{of the rest of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{trioxide}} is {{volatile and}} sublimes at high temperatures. This prevents {{formation of a}} continuous protective (passivating) oxide layer, which would stop the bulk oxidation of metal. Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left). The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to tungsten than to chromium; the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds, for example, <b>contrasts</b> <b>with</b> {{the stability of the}} chromium(III) compounds.
