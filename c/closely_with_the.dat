5|$|Oppenheimer {{worked with}} his first {{doctoral}} student, Melba Phillips, on calculations of artificial radioactivity under bombardment by deuterons. When Ernest Lawrence and Edwin McMillan bombarded nuclei with deuterons they found the results agreed <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> predictions of George Gamow, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not conform to the theory. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips worked out a theory {{now known as the}} Oppenheimer–Phillips process to explain the results, a theory still in use today.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae.

5|$|The Kangchu {{acted as}} the {{middleman}} in the bulk {{purchase of the}} settlement's commodities through suppliers based in Singapore. In particular, opium was highly popular among the coolies, although frowned upon by the British who took strong measures to suppress its distribution. The Kangchu formed illegal opium syndicates which had links to Chinese leaders from Singapore and other Malay states in the north, particularly Selangor. British contempt for the Kangchu was also fuelled by the coolies' preference for gambling and prostitution, {{both of which were}} seen as social vices by the British colonial government. The Kangchu maintained friendly relations with the Temenggong (later Sultan), and worked <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ngee Heng Kongsi in administrative matters. In particular, the state government attempted to forge close relations with the Kangchu by the appointment of a Malay official who was conversant in Teochew and literate in Chinese characters, Mohamed Salleh bin Perang, as the liaison officer between the Temenggong and the Kangchu. Several years later, in the early 1870s, the state government worked <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ngee Heng Kongsi to draft the Kanun Kangchu which had legal clauses that defined the powers of the Kangchu in Johor. The Kanun Kangchu contained 81 clauses in total, and was implemented in 1873.|$|E

The Liberals won five consecutive majorities between 1935 and 1953. The Liberals worked <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> civil service (drawing several of their ministers from those ranks) and their years of dominance saw prosperity.|$|E

5|$|The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made Wheeler an {{associate}} professor in 1937, but he wanted to be able work more <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> experts in particle physics.

Although it was a lesser position, he felt that Princeton, which was building up its physics department, was a better career choice. He remained a member of the faculty there until 1976.|$|E
