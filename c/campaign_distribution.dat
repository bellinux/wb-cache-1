The inventories (activities per unit area) of the radionuclides deposited onto ground soil were measured using portable gamma-ray spectrometers at nearly 1000 locations (at most) per measurement <b>campaign.</b> <b>Distribution</b> maps of the inventories of 134 Cs, 137 Cs, and 110 mAg as of March, September, and December 2012 were constructed. No apparent temporal change of the radionuclide inventories was observed from March to December 2012. Weathering effects (e. g., horizontal mobility) were not noticeable during this period. Spatial dependence in the ratios of 134 Cs/ 137 Cs and 110 mAg/ 137 Cs were observed in the Tohoku and Kanto regions. The detailed maps of 134 Cs and 137 Cs as of September 2012 and December 2012 were constructed using {{the relationship between the}} air dose rate and the inventory...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Uganda, {{long-lasting}} insecticidal nets (LLIN) {{have been}} predominantly delivered through two public sector channels: targeted campaigns or routine antenatal care (ANC) services. Their combination in a mixed-model strategy is being advocated to quickly increase LLIN coverage and maintain it over time, {{but there is}} little evidence on the efficiency of each system. This study evaluated the two delivery channels regarding LLIN retention and use, and estimated the associated costs, to contribute towards the evidence-base on LLIN delivery channels in Uganda. Methods: Household surveys were conducted 5 - 7 months after LLIN distribution, combining questionnaires with visual verification of LLIN presence. Focus groups and interviews were conducted to further investigate determinants of LLIN retention and use. <b>Campaign</b> <b>distribution</b> was evaluated in Jinja and Adjumani while ANC distribution was evaluated only in the latter district. Costs were calculated from the provider perspective through retrospective analysis of expenditure data, and effects were estimated as cost per LLIN delivered and cost per treated-net-year (TNY). These effects were calculated for the total number of LLINs delivered and for those retained and used. Results: After 5 - 7 months, over 90 % of LLINs were still owned by recipients, and between 74 % (Jinja) and 99 % (ANC Adjumani) were being used. Costing results showed that delivery was cheapest for the campaign in Jinja and highest for the ANC channel, with economic delivery cost per net retained and used of USD 1. 10 and USD 2. 31, respectively...|$|E

Costing results showed that delivery was cheapest for the campaign in Jinja and highest for the ANC channel, with economic delivery cost per net retained and used of USD 1. 10 and USD 2. 31, respectively. Financial delivery costs for the two channels were similar in the same location, USD 1. 04 for campaign or USD 1. 07 for ANC delivery in Adjumani, but differed between locations (USD 0. 67 for campaign delivery in Jinja). Economic cost for ANC distribution were considerably higher (USD 2. 27) compared to campaign costs (USD 1. 23) in Adjumani. Conclusions Targeted campaigns and routine ANC services can both achieve high LLIN retention and use among the target population. The comparatively higher economic cost of delivery through ANC facilities was at least partially due to the relatively short time this system had been in existence. Further studies comparing the cost of well-established ANC delivery with LLIN campaigns and other delivery channels are thus encouraged. </p...|$|E

Thirteen community-wide intervention studies using substantive methodologies were located in 16 published papers.

40|$|Abstract Background Long-lasting insecticidal nets are an {{effective}} tool for malaria prevention, and "universal coverage" with such nets is increasingly {{the goal of}} national malaria control programmes. However, national level campaigns in several countries {{have run out of}} nets in the course of distribution, indicating a problem in the method used to estimate the quantity needed. Presentation of hypothesis A major reason for the shortfall in estimation is the mismatch between the quantification factor used to plan procurement and the allocation algorithm used at community level, in particular the effect of needing to add an additional net to households with an odd number of inhabitants. To solve this problem a revised quantification factor is suggested. Testing hypothesis Based on data from a broad range of household surveys across Africa, the effect of odd-numbered households on numbers of nets distributed is estimated via two frequently used allocation methods. The impact of these algorithms on the proportion of households reaching a person to net ratio of 2 : 1, a frequently used marker of universal coverage is then calculated. Implications In order to avoid stock-outs of nets during national coverage campaigns, it is recommended to use a quantification factor of 1. 78 people per net, with an additional allocation factor suggested to account for other common problems at the community level resulting in a final recommended ratio of 1. 60 people per net. It is also recommend that community level allocation procedures be aligned with procurement estimates to reduce shortages of nets during <b>campaign</b> <b>distributions.</b> These analyses should enable programme managers to make evidence-based decisions and support a more efficient and effective use of LLIN <b>distribution</b> <b>campaign</b> resources. </p...|$|R

Zambia has used mass free <b>distribution</b> <b>campaigns</b> and <b>distribution</b> through antenatal care (ANC) clinics to achieve high coverage. Methodology and Principal Findings: We conducted a probability survey of 801 households in 2008 to assess factors associated with households that lacked an ITN after mass distribution. Community perceptions of barriers to ITN access were also obtained from in-depth interviews with household heads that reported not owning an ITN. Nearly 74 % of households in Luangwa district reported owning $ 1 ITN. Logistic regression showed households without a child, 5 years old during the ITN <b>distribution</b> <b>campaigns</b> were {{twice as likely to}} not have an ITN as those with a child, 5 during distribution (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2. 43; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 67 – 3. 55).

40|$|BackgroundThe Government of Mali and the President 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Malaria Initiative {{conducted}} a long-lasting, insecticidal net (LLIN) <b>distribution</b> <b>campaign</b> in April 2011 in the Sikasso region of Mali, {{with the aim}} of universal coverage, defined as one insecticide-treated net for every two persons. This study examines how households in post- and pre-campaign regions value and care for nets. MethodsThe study was conducted in October 2012 in Sikasso and Kayes in the southeast and western regions of Mali, respectively. The regions were purposively selected to allow for comparison between areas that had already had a mass <b>distribution</b> <b>campaign</b> (Sikasso) and areas that had not yet had a mass <b>distribution</b> <b>campaign</b> (Kayes). Study sites and households were randomly selected. Sleeping space questionnaires and structured interviews with household heads were conducted to obtain information on net use, perceived value of free nets in relation to other malaria prevention activities, and net care and repair practices. ResultsThe study included 40 households, split evenly across the two regions. Forty interviews were conducted with household heads and 151 sleeping spaces were inventoried using the sleeping space questionnaire. Nets obtained through the free distribution were reported to be highly valued in comparison to other malaria prevention strategies. Overall, net ownership and use were higher among households in areas that had already experienced a mass distribution. While participants reported using and valuing these nets, care and repair practices varied. ConclusionNational net use is high in Mali, and comparatively higher in the region covered by the universal <b>distribution</b> <b>campaign</b> than in the region not yet covered. While the Government of Mali and implementing partners have made strides to ensure high net coverage, some gaps remain related to communication messaging of correct and consistent net use throughout the year, and on improving net care and repair behaviour. By focusing on these areas as well as improved access to nets, coverage and use rates should continue to increase, contributing to improvements in malaria control...|$|R
