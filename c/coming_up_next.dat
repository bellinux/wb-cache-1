5|$|After {{their first}} round bye, Tennessee faced Mississippi State again. Instead of Tennessee {{starting}} quickly, however, the Bulldogs did, taking a 9–2 lead. At this point though, the Vols went {{on one of}} their runs, this time a 15–2 one. State did not recover from this, and Tennessee advanced to the semi-finals, 88–60. Catchings had a double-double by halftime. In the semi-finals, UT met Vanderbilt for the third time, with an even better performance than the previous two. Catchings again had a double-double by halftime and the team shot 6 of 7 from beyond the three point line, as they advanced to the championship 106–45. The SEC Championship was against Alabama, who had played within seven points of the Lady Vols in their previous match-up. Alabama used the same, slow style they had previously employed, and at the break were only down by three. Tennessee was able to slowly up the lead to ten during the first ten minutes of the second period, eventually reaching a fourteen-point lead, before Alabama started a comeback, cutting the lead to five with just over forty seconds remaining. Alabama was able to score the five points, but Tennessee made their foul shots, and won the title, 67–63. After the game, Holdsclaw was named the tournament's most outstanding player. UT was now 33–0, with the NCAA tournament <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Maddux {{has been}} {{credited}} {{by many of}} his teammates with a superior ability to outthink his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez {{tells the story of}} Maddux intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros's Jeff Bagwell, in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again, which Maddux would then refuse to throw. On another occasion while sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, [...] "Watch this, we might need to call an ambulance for the first base coach." [...] The batter, Los Angeles' José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers' first base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who'd been pitched inside by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly. On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between innings, he told Grissom, [...] "Gary Sheffield is <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> inning. I am going to throw him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to the warning track." [...] The at-bat went as Maddux had predicted.|$|E
2500|$|Program {{managers}} {{identified the}} analysis and repairs that were required to safely launch the shuttle, and this analysis was reviewed at a special Program Requirements Control Board (PRCB) held on 24 November. Managers announced at that meeting that the launch window available in early December would be passed up, with a new target of 17 December set, but cautioned that the launch could slip into February 2011. After reviewing the space station's December traffic model following the realigned Johannes Kepler ATV's launch date, NASA had identified a potential launch window in mid-/late-December 2010. The 17 December 2010 date was preferred {{because it would have}} allowed the shuttle to carry more stored oxygen to the International Space Station to help it deal with oxygen generation issues, which the crew had dealt with for several months. [...] "What we've told the agency leadership is that clearly we're not ready for the 3 December to 7 December window that's <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> week," [...] John Shannon, NASA's SSP manager, said in a news conference held after the special PCRB.

40|$|Sandia National Laboratories has {{undertaken}} an ambitious, multiyear effort to greatly improve our parachute system modeling and analysis capabilities. The impetus for this effort is twofold. First, extending the stockpile lifetime raises serious {{questions regarding the}} ability of the parachutes to meet their requirements in the future due to material aging. These aging questions cannot currently be answered using available tools and techniques which are based upon the experience of expert staff and full-scale flight tests and are, therefore, not predictive. Second, the atrophy of our parachute technology base and the loss of our experienced staff has eroded our ability to respond to any future problems with stockpiled parachutes or to rapidly design a new parachute system on an experience base alone. To assure a future in-house capability for technical oversight of stockpile nuclear weapon parachutes, Sandia must move from our present empirically based approach to a computationally based, predictive methodology. This paper discusses the current status of the code development and experimental validation activities. Significant milestones that have been achieved and those that are <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> in the <b>next</b> year are discussed...|$|R
