5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and <b>corn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob.</b>|$|E

40|$|Shake-flask {{cultivation}} of T. lanuginosus strain SSBP <b>on</b> coarse <b>corn</b> cobs yielded β-xylanase levels of 56, 500 nkat/ml at 50 °C, whereas other hemicellulases (β-xylosidase, β-glucosidase, and α-L-arabinofuranosidase) were produced at levels less than 7 nkat/ml. Cultivation on D-xylose yielded much {{lower levels of}} xylanase (350 nkat/ml), although other hemicellulase levels {{were similar to those}} produced <b>on</b> <b>corn</b> <b>cobs.</b> <b>The</b> influence of agitation rate and dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) on hemicellulase production was studied further in a bioreactor. On xylose, xylanase activities of 4, 330 nkat/ml and 4, 900 nkat/ml were obtained at stirrer speeds up to 1, 400 rpm to control DOT. At a constant stirrer speed of 400 rpm, xylanase activities of 10, 930 nkat/ml and 15, 630 nkat/ml were obtained when cultivated on xylose and beechwood xylan respectively, despite DOT levels below 5 % for the duration of fermentation. The results indicate that there is an interaction between agitation rate and DOT, impacting on xylanase and accessory enzyme production. Higher agitation rates favoured the production of xylosidase, arabinofuranosidase and glucosidase by T. lanuginosus strain SSBP, whereas the lower agitation rates favoured xylanase production. Rheological difficulties precluded cultivation <b>on</b> <b>corn</b> <b>cobs</b> in <b>the</b> bioreactor. Volumetric xylanase productivities of 1, 060, 000 nkat/l·h and 589, 000 nkat/l·h obtained on beechwood xylan and xylose indicate that T. lanuginosus strain SSBP is a hyperxylanase producer with considerable industrial potential.

2500|$|Maize {{can also}} be {{harvested}} and consumed in the unripe state, when the kernels are fully grown but still soft. Unripe maize must usually be cooked to become palatable; this may be done by simply boiling or roasting the whole ears and eating the kernels right off the cob. Sweet corn, a genetic variety that is high in sugars and low in starch, is usually consumed in the unripe state. Such <b>corn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> is a common dish in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Cyprus, some parts of South America, and the Balkans, but virtually unheard of in some European countries. <b>Corn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> was hawked {{on the streets of}} early 19th-century New York City by poor, barefoot [...] "Hot Corn Girls", who were thus the precursors of hot dog carts, churro wagons, and fruit stands seen on the streets of big cities today. The cooked, unripe kernels may also be shaved off the cob and served as a vegetable in side dishes, salads, garnishes, etc. Alternatively, the raw unripe kernels may also be grated off the cobs and processed into a variety of cooked dishes, such as maize purée, tamales, pamonhas, curau, cakes, ice creams, etc.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{protection}} against the Greater Grain Borer can be obtained for about eight months by mixing shelled grain with permethrin dust before storing it in sacks.

Unfortunately, this is precisely how most small farmers prefer to store maize, which suits the Greater Grain Borer best of all. This {{is one of the}} reasons why the pest has spread so rapidly through East Africa in recent years. The Tropical Development and Research Institute has been examining ways of combating the pest. Trials are being conducted to see if protection can be provided by leaving <b>the</b> sheath <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> and dusting it with permethrin The greater grain borer is also a pest on cassava, especially when this is dried and stored. Once the pest has burrowed inside, it can remain for some time, eating out the centre. Dusting the outside is of little use once the beetle is inside. Experiments are now being conducted in which dried cassava is dipped into aqueous solutions of permethrin, and is then dried again before storing.
