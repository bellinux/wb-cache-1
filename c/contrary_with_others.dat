40|$|Questions {{about the}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages of sending young children to formal day care ("Kindertageseinrichtungen") have always greatly concerned parents and led to intense, if not always well informed, policy debate. Two issues have been foremost. One is whether young children removed from their parents' care for part of the day suffer long term emotional consequences, or whether on the <b>contrary,</b> interaction <b>with</b> <b>other</b> children and <b>with</b> carers improves their social skills and confidence. Results are generally positive for children over three years old, but mixed for children under three, with some studies indicating negative socio-emotional consequences (Rossbach, 2005), and others reporting no negative emotional results and clear gains in social competence (Tietze, 1998; Andersson, 1989, 1992; NICHD, 2000, 2001). The second issue, dealt with in this article, relates to children's school outcome. Do children who have been to formal day care which exposes them to some pre-school learning achieve better, the same, or worse educational results in their later school years? If they do better, how long does the advantage last? Does it persist through to secondary school...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of the evolution of a nanostructured system in a metastable state to equilibrium. To this purpose, we use the case study of the transition of an Au corePd shell nanoalloy cluster containing up to about 600 atoms toward the equilibrium Au segregated configuration. We start from a molecular dynamics approach with an embedded atom potential. The way the transition develops at low temperatures is found to be very sensitive to the cluster morphology and the way energy is exchanged with the environment. The transition of icosahedral inverse core-shell Au-Pd clusters is predicted to nucleate locally at the surface <b>contrary</b> to clusters <b>with</b> <b>other</b> morphologies, and starting at lower temperatures compared to them. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to evaluate {{the impact of the}} surface grafting of cellulose fibres on the processing, dimensional stability and mechanical performance of fibre–cement composites. The surface modification of the pulps was performed with methacryloxypropyltri-methoxysilane (MPTS), aminopropyltri-ethoxysilane (APTS) and n-octadecyl isocyanate, an aliphatic isocyanate (AI). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the chemical changes have indeed occurred at the surface, and contact angle measurements showed that the surface energy has also changed. MPTS- and AI-treated fibres presented lower hydrophilic character than untreated fibres, whereas APTS increased the water retention value of the pulp. MPTS-treated fibres decreased the water retention and improved dimensional stability of the fibre–cement composites, while the <b>contrary</b> occurred <b>with</b> <b>other</b> modified fibres. Fibre– cement strength was little influenced by fibre treatment, whereas AI-treated fibres contributed to higher specific energy (SE) and the lower SE value for APTS-treated fibres is an indication of the improvement on fibre to cement adherence. These results are promising and contribute toward new strategies to improve the processing and stability of natural fibre-reinforced cement products.

40|$|The {{reception}} of Petrarch’s Rvf {{seems to have}} been very extensive even in the so-called “century without poetry” (Croce 209 - 238), above all in humanist Latin literature which wisely mixes the topoi of classical elegy with the ones of Romance poetry. The recent studies by Pantani, Landi and Tonelli have only opened the way towards a field which could be really interesting to explore. In particular, “Solo et pensoso” seems to have enjoyed a great fortune: even if it has not been translated by humanists (as on the <b>contrary</b> has happened <b>with</b> <b>other</b> poems from the Rvf) it has a revival in the neo-Latin poetry of humanists, both in evident rewritings, such as those by Strozzi and Landino, and in the echoes, the allusions, and even the parodical overturnings that can be found in Folengo. However, after careful scrutiny we can realise that humanists did not absorb the melancholic elements which make this poem closer to our modern sensibility. They just extracted some tesserae (above all the promenade through the natural elements) to insert in an amatory context which sometimes shows traits of classical sufferance, sometimes of stilnovistic hope...|$|R

40|$|Aim We {{investigated}} inpatients {{with and}} without type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged over 60 years, to compare their vitamin D status and calcium homeostatic parameters Materials and Methods We studied 140 patients consecutively admitted to our Internal Medicine Unit during the year 2010 (61 from November to April, 79 from May to October). The sample encompassed 70 patients with and 70 without diabetes. At admission we measured serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), sodium (Na), potassium (K), creatinine (Cr), alkaline phosphatase total activity (AP), albumin adjusted serum calcium (Caalb adj), 25 hydroxy-vitamin D (25 OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 24 -h urinary sodium/creatinine (uNa/Cr), potassium/creatinine (uK/Cr), calcium/creatinine (uCa/Cr), phosphate/creatinine (uP/Cr) ratios and calcium excretion (Ca ex). Results 25 OHD levels of patients {{with and without}} diabetes did not significantly differ. In patients without diabetes recruited from November to April, 25 OHD levels were significantly lower than those from May to October, whilst patients with diabetes did not show a significant seasonal variation. PTH had opposite non-significant seasonal variations, and negatively correlated with 25 OHD in both groups of patients. This correlation was lost after adjusting for age and BMI in patients with diabetes. These inpatients had higher serum P and lower uP/Cr, according to lower PTH. Their serum glucose negatively correlated with uCa/Cr and Ca ex, <b>contrary</b> to inpatients <b>with</b> <b>other</b> diseases. Instead, uCa/Cr and Ca ex correlated with uNa/Cr only in patients without diabetes.

On the <b>contrary</b> <b>with</b> common agents, which are {{designed}} {{only for a}} specified task or a game, general game playing agents {{have to be able}} to play basically any arbitrary game described in a formal declarative language. The biggest challenge is that the game rules are not known beforehand, which makes it impossible to use some optimizations or to make a good heuristic function. The thesis consists of a theoretical and a practical part. The first part introduces the field of general game playing agents, defines the Game Description Language and covers construction of heuristic evaluation functions and their integration within the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. In the practical part, a general method of creating a new heuristic function is presented, which is later integrated into a proper agent, which is compared then <b>with</b> <b>other</b> systems...|$|R
