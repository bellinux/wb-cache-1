40|$|Current {{through the}} σ-pore was first {{detected}} in hKv 1. 3 _V 388 <b>C</b> <b>channels,</b> where the V 388 C mutation in hKv 1. 3 channels {{opened a new}} pathway (σ-pore) behind the central α-pore. Typical for this mutant channel was inward current at potentials more negative than - 100 mV when the central α-pore was closed. The α-pore blockers such as TEA+ and peptide toxins (CTX, MTX) could not reduce current through the σ-pore of hKv 1. 3 _V 388 <b>C</b> <b>channels.</b> This new pathway would proceed in parallel to the α-pore in the S 6 -S 6 interface gap. To see whether this phenomenon is restricted to hKv 1. 3 channels we mutated hKv 1. 2 at the homologue position (hKv 1. 2 _V 370 C). By overexpression of hKv 1. 2 _V 370 <b>C</b> mutant <b>channels</b> in COS- 7 cells we could show typical σ-currents. The electrophysiological properties of the σ-pore in hKv 1. 3 _V 388 C and hKv 1. 2 _V 370 <b>C</b> mutant <b>channels</b> were similar. The σ-pore of hKv 1. 2 _V 370 <b>C</b> <b>channels</b> was most permeable to Na+ and Li+ whereas Cl- and protons did not influence current through the σ-pore. Tetraethylammonium (TEA+), charybdotoxin (CTX) and maurotoxin (MTX), known α-pore blockers, could not reduce current through the σ-pore of hKv 1. 2 _V 370 <b>C</b> <b>channels.</b> Taken together we conclude that the observation of σ-pore currents is not restricted to Kv 1. 3 potassium channels but can also be observed in a closely related potassium channel. This finding could have implications {{in the treatment of}} different ion channel diseases linked to mutations of the respective channels in regions close to homologue position investigated by us...|$|R
40|$|Acid-sensing ion {{channels}} are proton-gated Na+ channels expressed predominantly in neurons. How channel structure translates an environmental stimulus into changes in pore permeability remains largely undefined. The pore of ASIC 1 {{is defined by}} residues in the second transmembrane domain (TM 2), although {{a segment of the}} outer vestibule is formed by residues of TM 1. We used the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to define the role of the region preceding TM 2 (pre-TM 2) in activation and desensitization of mouse ASIC 1 a. Oocytes expressing E 425 <b>C</b> <b>channels</b> labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C 5 -maleimide showed a change in the emission of the fluorescent probe in response to extracellular acidification. The time course of the change in fluorescence correlated with activation but not desensitization of E 425 <b>C</b> <b>channels.</b> The fluorescence emission did not change following extracellular acidification in oocytes carrying an inactivating mutation (W 287 G/E 425 <b>C),</b> although these <b>channels</b> were labeled and expressed at the plasma membrane.

We observed a change in the emission of the fluorescent probe when labeled E 425 <b>C</b> <b>channels</b> transition from the desensitized to the resting state. The substituted-cysteine-accessibility method was used to determine whether the pre-TM 2 has different conformations in the resting and desensitized states.

40|$|AbstractHuman MinK and KCNQ 1 {{subunits}} assemble to form IKs channels. When MinK position 55 is mutated to cysteine (MinK- 55 <b>C),</b> IKs <b>channels</b> can {{be blocked}} by external cadmium (Cd 2 +). We have supported a pore-associated location for MinK- 55 C because Cd 2 + block {{is sensitive to}} voltage, permeant ions {{on the opposite side}} of the membrane (trans-ions), and external tetraethylammonium (TEA), an IKs pore-blocker. Two recent reports argue that MinK- 55 C is distant from the pore: one finds TEA does not affect Cd 2 + block if channels are formed with a KCNQ 1 mutant (K 318 I, V 319 Y) that increases TEA affinity; the second proposes that Cd 2 + binds between MinK- 55 C and a cysteine in KCNQ 1 that is posited to lie toward the channel periphery. Here, these discrepancies are considered. First, Cd 2 + block of MinK- 55 <b>C</b> <b>channels</b> formed with wild-type KCNQ 1 is shown to depend not only on voltage and trans-ions but state (showing decreased on-rate with increased open time and blocker trapping on channel closure). Conversely, MinK- 55 <b>C</b> <b>channels</b> with K 318 I, V 319 Y KCNQ 1 are found to demonstrate Cd 2 + block that is independent of voltage, trans-ions and state (and to have a lower unitary conductance) : thus, the KCNQ 1 mutations alter the process under study, yielding Cd 2 + inhibition that is pore-independent and, perforce, TEA-insensitive. Second, MinK- 55 <b>C</b> <b>channels</b> are found to remain sensitive to Cd 2 + despite mutation of any single native cysteine in KCNQ 1 or all nine simultaneously; this suggests no KCNQ 1 cysteine binds Cd 2 + and can serve to localize MinK- 55 C. Despite many concerns that are enumerated, we remain obliged to conclude that Cd 2 + enters and leaves the pore to reach MinK- 55 C, placing that residue in or near the pore...|$|R

40|$|Ion channel {{conductance}} can {{be influenced}} by electrostatic effects originating from fixed “surface” charges that are remote from the selectivity filter. To explore whether surface charges contribute to the conductance properties of Kir 2. 1 channels, unitary conductance was measured in cell-attached recordings of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with Kir 2. 1 channels over a range of K+ activities (4. 6 – 293. 5 mM) using single-channel measurements as well as nonstationary fluctuation analysis for low K+ activities. K+ ion concentrations were shown to equilibrate across the cell membrane in our studies using the voltage-sensitive dye DiBAC 4 (5). The dependence of γ on the K+ activity (aK) was fit well by a modified Langmuir binding isotherm, with a nonzero intercept as aK approaches 0 mM, suggesting electrostatic surface charge effects. Following the addition of 100 mM N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG+), a nonpermeant, nonblocking cation or following pretreatment with 50 mM trimethyloxonium (TMO), a carboxylic acid esterifying agent, the γ–aK relationship did not show nonzero intercepts, suggesting the presence of surface charges formed by glutamate or aspartate residues. Consistent with surface charges in Kir 2. 1 channels, the rates of current decay induced by Ba 2 + block were slowed {{with the addition of}} NMG or TMO. Using a molecular model of Kir 2. 1 channels, three candidate negatively charged residues were identified near the extracellular mouth of the pore and mutated to cysteine (E 125 C, D 152 C, and E 153 C).
