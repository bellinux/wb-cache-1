5|$|Following {{the release}} of her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002), and several collaborations, Aguilera decided to {{incorporate}} elements of 1930s and 1940s musical styles in her follow-up album project. She commented that she wished to revolve {{as an artist and}} a visionary in between production of the records. Aguilera sent letters to various producers that she hoped <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> with the direction she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul feel.|$|E

5|$|When Saldívar {{became a}} {{business}} associate, their relationship began to deteriorate. In September 1994, Selena met Ricardo Martinez, {{a doctor who}} lived in Monterrey, Mexico. Selena wanted to expand the number of boutiques by opening a Selena Etc. store in Monterrey. Martinez said he had contacts in Mexico who <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> grow her business. Martinez became a business adviser to Selena, though her family said he was simply a fan who posed in several pictures with her. Saldívar became envious of Selena's dependency on Martinez. He began sending flowers to Selena's hotel room. Saldívar warned the singer that Martinez might have unprofessional intentions. Selena began visiting Monterrey more frequently, often in disguise. Sebastian D'Silva, Martinez's assistant, would pick up Selena at the airport; he said he noticed she was wearing wigs and using her husband Chris Pérez's surname so others would not identify her. According to Martinez, he had lent several thousand dollars to Selena because she was short on cash.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, aged 16, Kidman {{made her}} film debut in {{a remake of}} the Australian holiday season {{favourite}} Bush Christmas. By the end of 1983, she had a supporting role in the television series Five Mile Creek. In 1984, her mother {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer, which caused Kidman to halt her acting to work temporarily while she studied massage so she <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> mother with physical therapy. She began gaining popularity in the mid-1980s after appearing in several film roles, including BMX Bandits (1983), Watch the Shadows Dance (1987 aka Nightmaster), and the romantic comedy Windrider (1986), which earned Kidman attention due to her racy scenes. Also during the decade, she appeared in several Australian productions, including the soap opera A Country Practice and the miniseries Vietnam (1986). She also made guest appearances on Australian television programs and TV movies.|$|E

25|$|While {{the rate}} of {{domestic}} violence among immigrant groups does not differ {{from that of the}} general population, immigrant victims of domestic violence may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable. The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence. Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for those trying to escape such situations. Even when a woman does have access to social services that <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it difficult for her to leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing shame to her family. Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} the 18th birthday, a half-fairy half-mortal {{girl named}} Lyra had a strange dream. All her friends and family were there tonight to {{celebrate}} that special event, and Lyra's grandfather Tangle had prepared an amazing gift for her. But then Lyra heard a whisper, and everyone quickly disappeared. Waking up from that dream, Lyra finds herself alone in her beloved Town of Wish as she is being trapped in a parallel dimension which is very similar to her original one. Guided by the messages left by Tangle plus using her father's magically hidden airship, Lyra breaks out to find Tangle's odd fairy friend simply called the Clockmaker, who is the only stranger <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> get back home, and reunite with family and friends. She finds the Clockmaker in his hideout and thankfully, he agrees to help. Lyra have to find three magical keys in three separately hidden areas; Treehouse Village, Wind Music Island, and Water Collector; to re-activate the Clockmaker's Time Synchronization Machine.|$|E
25|$|Parnok left Moscow in {{late summer}} 1917 and spent the Russian Civil War years in the Crimean town of Sudak with Erarskaya. Soon after their arrival, she was {{approached}} by Alexander Spendiaryan (known in Russia as Alexander Spendiarov) and asked to prepare the libretto for a 4-act opera Almast, based on an Armenian legend. Parnok immediately set to work, sourcing her dramatic verse on the epic poem, The Taking of Tmuk Fortress, by Hovhannes Tumanyan and using Erarskaya as her inspiration. She finished the libretto by the winter of 1918, long before Spendiaryan had completed the musical score, and returned to reading Sappho. At that time in Russia, as elsewhere, Sappho was considered a heterosexual poet because she wrote about desire. Both physical love and desire, were perceived as masculine traits, thus women poets who wrote erotic lyrics without shame, regardless of their sexual orientation, were often given the label Sapphic. Simultaneously, she and Eugenia Gertsyk, Adelaida's sister, became closer friends, reveling in their spiritual quest. She viewed her relationship with Eugenia as that of an older and wiser guide, who <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> mature spiritually and break her addiction to love.|$|E

Aguilera {{worked with}} [...] "more beat-driven" [...] {{producers}} on the first disc, such as DJ Premier and Mark Ronson, who included samples in the production. The second disc consists solely of collaborations with producer Linda Perry. Aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> with the direction she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul feel. She described the first disc as [...] "kind of a throwback with elements of jazz, blues and soul music combined with a modern-day twist, like hard-hitting beats".|$|E

500|$|At age 16, Cher {{dropped out}} of school, left her mother's house, and moved into Los Angeles with a friend. She took acting classes and worked to support herself, dancing in small clubs along Hollywood's Sunset Strip and {{introducing}} herself to performers, managers, and agents. According to Berman, [...] " [...] {{did not hesitate to}} approach anyone she thought <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> get a break, make a new contact, or get an audition." [...] Cher met performer Sonny Bono in November 1962 when he was working for record producer Phil Spector. Cher's friend moved out, and Cher accepted Sonny's offer to be his housekeeper. Sonny introduced Cher to Spector, who used her as a backup singer on many recordings, including the Ronettes' [...] "Be My Baby" [...] and the Righteous Brothers' [...] "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'". Spector produced her first single, the commercially unsuccessful [...] "Ringo, I Love You", which Cher recorded under the name Bonnie Jo Mason.|$|E
500|$|To {{create a}} [...] "throwback" [...] with {{elements}} of old-school genres combined with [...] "a modern-day twist", Aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> {{with the direction}} she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul feel. She initially planned to condense the album into a single, more [...] "affordable" [...] disc, however she expanded Back to Basics as a double album. For the first disc, Aguilera collaborated with hip hop producers including DJ Premier, Rich Harrison, Kwamé, and Mark Ronson for the first time. Most songs from the first half incorporate horn samples to create [...] "gritty and old" [...] sounds. DJ Premier questioned if Aguilera was familiar with his work, though she had known of his jazz-influenced work with Gang Starr in late-1980s and early-1990s. In response, Aguilera wanted her album to draw inspirations from Premier's song [...] "Jazz Thing" [...] and noted that their collaboration became his first time [...] "venturing into the 'pop' world".|$|E
500|$|On 4 March, Webster {{travelled}} to Hammersmith {{to see her}} old neighbours the Porters, {{whom she}} had not seen for six years, wearing Thomas' silk dress and carrying a Gladstone bag which she had filled with some of Thomas' remains. Webster introduced herself to the Porters as [...] "Mrs. Thomas". She claimed that, since last meeting the Porters, she had married, had a child, been widowed, and had been left a house in Richmond by an aunt. She invited Porter and his son Robert to the Oxford and Cambridge Arms pub in Barnes. Along the way, she disposed of the bag that she was carrying, probably by dropping it into the River Thames, while the Porters were inside the pub drinking. It was never recovered. Webster then asked young Robert Porter if he <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> carry a heavy box from 2 Mayfield Cottages to the station. As they crossed Richmond Bridge, Webster dropped the box into the Thames. She was able to explain it away and did not arouse Robert's suspicions.|$|E

500|$|After {{releasing}} Stripped (2002) and {{collaborating with}} many different artists, Aguilera decided to record new old-school style materials for her upcoming album. She later {{explained that the}} lengthy break allowed her to write {{a lot about what}} she had experienced during that time. Aguilera also explained that she wanted to bring something novel to her album, which has 24 songs on it. She wanted to try to evolve as an artist and a visionary. As a result, Back to Basics, Aguilera's fifth studio album, is made up of two discs. On the first disc, she worked with [...] "more beat-driven" [...] producers, such as DJ Premier and Mark Ronson, who included samples in the production. The second one was written and produced solely by longtime producer Linda Perry.

By happenstance or design, Wallis was also at the club that night. Hoffman introduced Scott to Wallis, who arranged for an interview the following day. When Scott returned home, she found a telegram offering her the lead for the Boston run of The Skin of Our Teeth. Miriam Hopkins was ill. Scott sent Wallis her apologies, cancelling the interview. Scott recalled [...] "On the train up to Boston, to replace Miss Hopkins, I decided I {{needed to make the}} name more of an attention-grabber.
