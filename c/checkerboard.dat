5|$|In a video {{posted on}} July 21, 2009, YouTube {{software}} engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos. The videos {{can be viewed}} in several different ways, including the common anaglyph (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect. The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a <b>checkerboard</b> pattern, side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision.|$|E
5|$|James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor {{created the}} {{original}} stage design for Double Dare. The {{design for the}} original series' set {{was inspired by a}} 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a <b>checkerboard</b> pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original Double Dare music was composed by Edd Kalehoff.|$|E
5|$|On the Reinanzaka House, the labourers were {{skilled in}} the use of wood, and helped Raymond engrain the texture of cedar onto the concrete. This was further {{explored}} on the Tetsuma Akaboshi and the Morinosuke Kawasaki houses, where the concrete walls of the luxurious interiors were imprinted with cypress textures. On the Karuizawa Studio, workmen polished the concrete with sand and straw to reveal the texture of the aggregate. Whilst at Nanzan University, the south facing facades were cast with <b>checkerboard</b> patterns, with applied metalwork casting abstract shadows on the surface.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{traditional}} formulations of topology optimization that make use of finite element method suffer from instabilities such as <b>checkerboarding.</b> This <b>checkerboarding</b> is generally due to mathematical instability, commonly observed solution of minimum compliance problems. If <b>checkerboarding</b> problem is controlled in an efficient way we can obtain more accurate and highly optimized results in Topology Optimization. This paper reviews the various available <b>checkerboarding</b> control methods available and presents a comparison of <b>checkerboarding</b> control methods. As a designer one must know which control method should be applied to get desired result also insight into the <b>checkerboarding</b> opens a new field for developing more able algorithms for controlling <b>checkerboarding</b> problem...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{electromagnetic}} {{properties of}} finite <b>checkerboards</b> consisting of alternating rectangular cells of positive refractive index (epsilon= + 1, mu = + 1) and negative refractive index (epsilon = - 1, mu = - 1) {{have been investigated}} numerically. We show that the numerical calculations have {{to be carried out}} with very fine discretization to accurately model the highly singular behaviour of these <b>checkerboards.</b> Our solutions show that, within the accuracy of the numerical calculations, the focussing properties of these <b>checkerboards</b> are reasonably robust in the presence of moderate levels of dissipation. We also show that even small systems of <b>checkerboards</b> can display focussing effects to some extent...|$|R
50|$|<b>Checkerboarding</b> also {{occurred}} due to Native American land grants, where native land was intermingled with non-native land. Many Native American tribes oppose <b>checkerboarding,</b> because it broke up traditionally communal native settlements into many individual plots, and allowed non-natives to claim land within those settlements.|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Buddhism during {{the sixth century}} was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese Tang and Sui Dynasties led to {{the foundation of the}} first permanent capital in Nara. Its <b>checkerboard</b> street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The {{introduction of}} the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|An even <b>checkerboard</b> plot model {{dominates the}} green {{landscape}} {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|Although Chang'an was {{the capital}} of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after {{subsequent}} destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis. From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this <b>checkerboard</b> pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian kyō (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the <b>checkerboard</b> street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Daoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju football. In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Checkerboarding</b> {{can create}} {{problems}} for access and ecological management. It {{is one of}} the major causes of inholdings within the boundaries of national forests. As is the case in Northwestern California, <b>checkerboarding</b> has resulted in issues with managing national forest land. <b>Checkerboarding</b> was previously applied to these areas during the period of western expansion, and they are now commercial forest land. Conflicting policies establishing the rights of the private owners of this land have caused some difficulties in the local hardwood timber production economy.|$|R
50|$|In late August and September 1995, the <b>Checkerboards</b> {{conducted}} {{their first}} direct combat sorties since Vietnam {{in support of}} the United Nations resolutions in Operation Deliberate Force. NATO's decision to conduct immediate air strikes against Bosnian-Serb ammunition bunkers, communication and control facilities, and logistical storage buildings heavily tasked both the air wing and the <b>Checkerboards.</b>|$|R

The <b>Checkerboards</b> remained in their area of operations {{until the end of}} January before transiting towards home.|$|R
5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the <b>Checkerboard,</b> the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Checkerboard</b> Inn, {{also known}} as the Forshee-Jenkins House, is a late 18th-century frame {{building}} located on Mansion Ridge Golf Club in Monroe, New York, United States. Originally built as a house, within a decade it went into service as an inn when the Orange Turnpike, an early toll road through the area, opened in 1802. It takes its name from an early owner's reputed decision to paint it in a <b>checkerboard</b> pattern to attract business, although this has not been conclusively established.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{technique}} for mapping the backpropagation algorithm on hypercubes and related architectures. A key component of this technique is a network partitioning scheme which is called <b>checkerboarding.</b> <b>Checkerboarding</b> allows us to replace the all-to-all broadcast operation performed by the commonly used vertical network partitioning scheme, with operations that are much faster on the hypercubes and related architectures. <b>Checkerboarding</b> can be combined with the pattern partitioning technique to form a hybrid scheme which performs better than either one of these schemes. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on nCUBE 2 TM y and CM 5 TM z show that our scheme performs {{better than the other}} schemes, both for uniform and non-uniform networks...|$|R
25|$|The sweep {{technique}} is a hybrid frequency domain/time domain technique.

25|$|In the Cohen et al. study, the MOT task {{involved}} viewing eight black moving discs presented {{against a}} changing background {{that consisted of}} randomly colored <b>checkerboard</b> masks. Four of these discs were picked out and participants were instructed to track these four discs. The RSVP task involved viewing a stream of letters and digits presented against a series of changing checkerboards, and {{counting the number of}} times a digit was presented. In both experiments, the critical trial involved a natural scene suddenly replacing the second last <b>checkerboard,</b> and participants were immediately afterwards asked whether they had noticed anything different, as well as presented with six questions to determine whether they had categorized the scene. The dual-task condition simply involved participants performing the MOT task mentioned above and a scene-classification task simultaneously. The authors varied the difficulty of the task (i.e. how demanding the task was) by increasing or decreasing the speed of the moving discs.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{allotment}} of Indian reservation land during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, land on reservations today is severely <b>checkerboarded</b> and fractionated, making its productive use virtually impossible. Complicating productive land use is the status of land tenure on reservations, which may be classified into as many as seven tenures: Indian trust land; Indian fee land; tribal trust land; tribal fee; non-Indian land; federal trust land, and state land. Congress has attempted to reconcile fractionation and <b>checkerboarding</b> for the past eighty years, yet with little success. In 1983, Congress passed the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA) to enable tribes to consolidate their land holdings and reduce fractionated land parcels. However, this act has failed to accomplish its goals. Rather than eliminating fractionation and <b>checkerboarding,</b> the act has succeeded only in complicating the devise and descent of Indian lands...|$|R

25|$|Most {{of these}} European {{immigrants}} {{settled in the}} cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Urban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, {{and most of the}} larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the redevelopment of Paris. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish grid style, centered on a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this general layout, known as a damero, meaning <b>checkerboard,</b> since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed {{at the end of the}} 19th century by Pedro Benoit, combines the <b>checkerboard</b> layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street illumination.|$|E
