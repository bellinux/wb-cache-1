The temperature at which alpha- and Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars relaxation appear in the TSDC plots and the magnitude of these relaxations are strongly affected by the degree of microphase separation (DMS) of the ionomer blends. The results, of the various techniques, were compared to each other with respect to their characteristic, and indicate that the DMS decreases on addition of the pure <b>component</b> <b>PU</b> 2 to the blends. Analysis of the alpha-relaxation, in terms of fragility, indicates that the systems under investigation are fragile. Results indicate a correlation between fragility and DMS. Lower phase mixing suggests higher fragility. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Both the materials obtained {{consist of a}} hydrophilic component, sulfated hyaluronic acid (HyalS 3. 5), and a hydrophobic <b>component,</b> polyurethane (<b>PU).</b> In the material named Puhmdi, the HyalS 3. 5 was cross-linked to the PU chains via hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) while in that named Pubrac, the binding of HyalS 3. 5 to the PU chains occurred only through a few carboxy groups via N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and bromoacetic acid. The surface characteristics of the polymers were investigated by ATR FT-IR spectroscopy while the surface morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. There was a signi®cant difference between the surface characteristics of the ®lms in dry and hydrated environments. In both materials the hydrophilic component (HyalS 3. 5) migrates from the bulk to the surface, thus minimizing the surface free energy of the polymer when exposed to the hydrated environment.

Two component systems comprising of a polyol (either polyether- or polyester-polyol) as component A and a diisocyanate as component B are generally applied. Both components are produced from fossil oil resources. The liquid products from fast pyrolysis of biomass, called biooil hereafter, contain a largevariety of organic compounds with –OH functional groups. This {{gives rise to the}} idea to substitute the polyol <b>component</b> in <b>PU</b> foams with such biomass based intermediates.

Especially the biooils produced from straw showed good insulation property expressed as low thermal conductivity. The achieved thermal conductivity of 0. 0283 W/mK with a substitution degree of 80 % was 8 % lower than for the foams produced from commercial components (0. 0308 W/mK).

40|$|Recently, in {{the field}} of {{biomaterials}} for soft tissue scaffolds, the interest of their modification with natural polymersis growing. Synthetic polymers are often tough, and many of them do not possess fine biocompatibility. On the other hand, natural polymers are biocompatible but weak when used alone. The combination of natural and synthetic polymers gives the suitable properties for tissue engineering requirements. In our study, we modified gelatin synthetic polyurethanes prepared from polyester poly(ethylene-butylene adipate) (PEBA), aliphatic 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), and two different chain extenders 1, 4 -butanediol (BDO) or 1 -ethoxy- 2 -(2 -hydroxyethoxy) ethanol (EHEE).

40|$|Many {{articles}} of daily use {{are made of}} or contain polyurethane (PU), for instance clothes, mattresses, furniture filling, insulation materials or automotive interiors. Polyurethanes (PUs), as most synthetic materials can emit volatile organic compounds (VOC), some {{of which could be}} unpleasant odorous and may reduce the consumer acceptance or cause consumer anxiety. Therefore, the aim of the PU-industries was the development of low emission and low odor PU products. The prerequisite in order to do this was to reveal the odorant sources and to understand their formation pathways during manufacturing. In contrast to other plastics, PUs are not commercially available as pellets/granulate or semi finished products for subsequent processing. PUs are produced in situ in the PUfactory by the exothermal polyaddition reaction of a polyol and an isocyanate component in presence of catalysts and additives like blowing agents, cross linkers, surfactants, flame retardants, pigments or fillers in order to achieve specific end product properties. Therefore, PU properties and corresponding material emissions are influenced by both the main <b>PU</b> <b>components</b> (polyol and isocyante), additives and catalysts as well as by production conditions like the reaction temperature. In order to reveal the causes for odor formation during the PU manufacturing process, the raw materials and additives of a conspicuous odorous PU product were sensorially evaluated.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{polymers}} {{made from}} renewable materials has been developed in diverse areas especially in furniture, mattresses, automotive or building <b>components.</b> Polyurethanes (<b>PU's)</b> made from renewable materials {{are one of the}} most important groups of polymers because of their versatility and they can be manufactured in a wide range of grades, densities and stiffness. In this project, polymers based on renewable materials such as rapeseed (RS) and sunflower oil (SF) were synthesized and cross-linked with methylene di-/>-phenyl diisocyanate (MDI) to form polyurethanes. Treatment with titanium dioxide (TiCh) was found to affect the physical properties of the polyurethane in a systematic way. As the loadings of TiOj were increased (up to 10 % of monomer weight), large strain responses were obtained; thus the stress vs. strain curves plotted by the Instron tensile test showed an increase from 5 % to 31 %). This study also revealed a remarkable characteristic in the pigmented polymer exhibiting soft - but - tough behaviour at high TiC> 2 loading. The DMTA test also showed that the properties of the sample loaded with 10 % TiC> 2 increased its tan delta peak (damping factor) from 0. 43 to 0. 7. The tan delta peak showed that the damping properties of the material were improved markedly upon loading with TiC> 2. This is useful since noise is radiated by vibration, and the application of damping materials to the vibrating surface converts the energy into heat, which is dissipated within the damping materials rather than being radiated as airborne noise. Increase in TiC> 2 loading also gave a progressive increase of hardness (Shore D) for both RS and SF oil - based polyurethanes. The effect of prolonged exposure to UVB light, in general promotes photodegradation for both RS and SF-based polyurethanes, both neat and also material loaded with TiCh- The photodegradation of the PU's depends on the grade of titanium dioxide. The addition of 10 % Degussa P 25 pigment, gives the greater degradation while PUs loaded with 5 % Kronos 2220 show the slowest rates of degradation due to the effect of the coating of this pigment. The photostabiliser Tinuvin 770 also offers high protection from UVB, while the combination of Tinuvin 770 and Degussa P 25 gave the highest protection from UVB. Addition of Tinuvin 770 at the stage of preparation of the PUs also greatly reduced the undesirable yellow colouration prevalent during PU syntheses...|$|R
40|$|In Russia, {{mixed oxide}} (MOX) fuel is {{produced}} in a pilot facility ''Paket'' at ''MAYAK'' Production Association. The Mining-Chemical Combine (MCC) has developed plans to design and build a dedicated industrial-scale plant to produce MOX fuel and fuel assemblies (FA) for VVER- 1000 water reactors and the BN- 600 fast-breeder reactor, which is pending an official Russian Federation (RF) site-selection decision. The design output of the plant {{is based on a}} production capacity of 2. 75 tons of weapons plutonium per year to produce the resulting fuel assemblies: 1. 25 tons for the BN- 600 reactor FAs and the remaining 1. 5 tons for VVER- 1000 FAs. It is likely the quantity of BN- 600 FAs will be reduced in actual practice. The process of nuclear disarmament frees a significant amount of weapons plutonium for other uses, which, if unutilized, represents a constant general threat. In France, Great Britain, Belgium, Russia, and Japan, reactor-grade plutonium is used in MOX-fuel production. Making MOX-fuel for CANDU (Canada) and pressurized water reactors (PWR) (Europe) is under consideration in Russia. If this latter production is added, as many as 5 tons of Pu per year might be processed into new FAs in Russia. Many years of work and experience are represented in the estimates of MOX fuel production wastes derived in this report. Prior engineering studies and sludge treatment investigations and comparisons have determined how best to treat Pu sludges and MOX fuel wastes. Based upon analyses of the production processes established by these efforts, we can estimate that there will be approximately 1200 kg of residual wastes subject to immobilization per MT of plutonium processed, of which approximately 6 to 7 kg is Pu in the residuals per MT of Pu processed. The wastes are various and complicated in composition. Because organic wastes constitute both the major portion of total waste and of the Pu to be immobilized, the recommended treatment of MOX-fuel production waste is incineration or calcination, alkali sintering, and dissolution of sintered products in nitric acid. Insoluble residues are then mixed with vitrifying <b>components</b> and <b>Pu</b> sludges, vitrified, and sent for storage and disposal. Implementation of the intergovernmental agreement between Russia and the United States (US) regarding the utilization of 34 tons of weapons plutonium will also require treatment of Pu containing MOX fabrication wastes at the MCC radiochemical production plant...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of intercoat adhesion exhibited between {{a series of}} polyester/polyurethane (PU) based primer formulations and a standard poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF) based topcoat formulation has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). An initial XPS study of changes in surface elemental composition (induced by variation of the peak metal temperature (PMT) achieved during thermal curing), on {{a subset of the}} PU primers employed, indicates that beyond a PMT of 232 °C changes in PU primer surface composition are negligible. A reference PU primer coating formulation and four variations of this formulation, produced by including, excluding or substituting components/additives in the reference formulation, are characterised by XPS. The PU primer formulation in which a flow agent additive is included exhibits segregation of the flow agent to the primer surface. The PU primer and PVdF topcoat intercoat adhesion failure surfaces resulting from failure at or near the PVdF/PU interface {{as a result of a}} peel test are also characterised by XPS. Additionally the PVdF topcoat air-coating surface is characterised by XPS. The interface analyses for the flow agent containing PU primer formulation indicates stripping of the flow agent layer from the PU primer and transfer of the flow agent to the PVdF topcoat interfacial failure surface. Similarly, PU primer formulations in which the concentrations of a crosslinking resin are changed demonstrate that the transfer of carbon and oxygen containing materials from the PU primer to the PVdF topcoat occurs, due to insufficient crosslinking of the polyester <b>component</b> of the <b>PU</b> primer formulation. These results suggest a correlation between the nitrogen concentration at the PU primer surface and the {{strength of}} the intercoat adhesion exhibited by the PU primer towards the PVdF topcoat...|$|R
40|$|An {{accelerated}} alpha-decay damage {{study of}} a glass-bonded sodalite ceramic waste form has recently been completed. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the physical and chemical durability of the waste form after significant exposure to alpha decay. This accelerated alpha-decay study was performed by doping the ceramic waste form with {sup 238 }Pu which has a much greater specific activity than {sup 239 }Pu that is normally present in the waste form. The alpha-decay dose at the end of the four year study was approximately 1 x 10 {sup 18 } alpha-decays/gram of material. An equivalent time period for a similar dose of {sup 239 }Pu would require approximately 1100 years. After four years of exposure to {sup 238 }Pu alpha decay, the investigation observed little change to the physical or chemical durability of the ceramic waste form (CWF). Specifically, the {sup 238 }Pu-loaded CWF maintained it's physical integrity, namely that the density remained constant and no cracking or phase de-bonding was observed. The materials chemical durability and phase stability also did not change significantly over the duration of the study. The only significant measured change was an increase of the unit-cell lattice parameters of the plutonium oxide and sodalite phases of the material and an increase in the release of salt components and plutonium of the waste form during leaching tests, but, as mentioned, these did not lead to any overall loss of waste form durability. The principal findings from this study are: (1) {sup 238 }Pu-loaded CWF is similar in microstructure and phase composition to referenced waste form. (2) Pu was observed primarily as oxide comprised of aggregates of nano crystals with aggregates ranging in size from submicron to twenty microns in diameter. (3) Pu phases were primarily found in the intergranular glassy regions. (4) PuO phase shows expected unit cell volume expansion due to alpha decay damage of approximately 0. 7 %, and the sodalite phase unit cell volume has expanded slightly by 0. 3 % again, presumably due to alpha-decay damage. (5) No bulk sample swelling was observed. (6) No amorphization of sodalite or actinide bearing phases was observed after four years of alpha-decay damage. (7) No microcracks or phase de-bonding were observed in waste form samples aged for four years. (8) In some areas of the {sup 238 }Pu doped ceramic waste form material bubbles and voids were found. Bubbles and voids with similar size and density were also found in ceramic waste form samples without actinide. These bubbles and voids are interpreted as pre-existing defects. However, some contribution to these bubbles and voids from helium gas can not be ruled out. (9) Chemical durability of {sup 238 }Pu CWF has not changed significantly after four years of alpha-decay exposure except for an increase in the release of salt <b>components</b> and <b>Pu.</b> Still, the plutonium release from CWF is very low at less than 0. 005 g/m{sup 2 }...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{disarmament}} is {{a highly}} debated subject. Proponents argue that political conditions for nuclear disarmament are ripe. Opponents reason that dismantlement could create instability leading to a higher probability of nuclear war or large-scale conventional war. Verification of disarmament can help alleviate instabilities and as nuclear arsenals decrease, verifying actual warheads and not just delivery vehicles will become more important. Current techniques {{that could be used}} in warhead verification have the ability to reveal sensitive information about the warhead and thus require an information barrier. This research developed a proof-of-principle concept for a new technique to address the need of nuclear warhead verification for arms control treaties. Specifically, this technique uses fluorescence imaging to determine fissile material attributes in verifying, during the dismantlement process, an uncanned nuclear warhead or warhead component without revealing sensitive information. This could potentially reduce the need for an information barrier. Experiments were performed using a Princeton Instruments PIXIS: 1024 B/BUV back-illuminated CCD camera to image the fluorescence produced by the decay of nuclear material. The Monte Carlo simulation tool GEANT 4 was used to model the experimental setups and to compare with the experimental results. The results verified the proof-of-concept of fluorescence imaging for use in nuclear arms control treaty verification. Fluorescence imaging would be most beneficial for assessing the fissile material attributes of U enrichment (greater than a threshold) and symmetry. It also contributes valuable data for verifying the presence of fissile material, presence of Pu, presence of U, mass greater than a threshold, Pu age, and 239 Pu to 240 Pu ratio greater than a threshold. Fluorescence imaging may also be beneficial to the ?absence of oxide? attribute, but additional experiments are needed to confirm this assumption. Additionally, it was concluded that the only potential for revealing presumably sensitive information is the ability to provide too much image detail on external surfaces of <b>Pu</b> <b>components.</b> However, simple steps could be taken to prevent the imaging system from acquiring too much detail and thus eliminate the need for an information barrier...|$|R
