50|$|After {{the death}} of the Regent Moray in January 1570, Oliphant met the leaders of the queen's party at Linlithgow, where they had a conference with the French ambassador. Henry Killigrew, in a letter to Lord Burghley in 1573, {{mentioned}} that Oliphant had joined the anti-Marian party after James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton's succession as regent to James VI; but he had attended a meeting of the privy council at Leith in May 1572, while Regent Mar was still alive. After the retirement of Morton from the regency, Oliphant attended the meeting of the parliament in Stirling Castle on 16 July 1578, presided over by the king. In November 1580 he was charged to answer before the council for an attack on Lord Ruthven, and on 7 December <b>caution</b> <b>money</b> was set that he would on the 9th enter into ward in Doune Castle in Menteith. Subsequently disputes between him and the Earl of Caithness often came to the privy council.|$|E

The rate of interest charged {{in various parts of}} the country varies from 4 to 16%, but in Brussels it is usually less than half the maximum. The management is very similar to that of the French monts de pit, but the arrangements are much more favorable to the borrower. The ordinary limit of loans is I2o. In Antwerp there is an anonymous pawnshop, where the customer need not give his name or any other particulars. In the Netherlands private pawhbrokers flourish side by side with the municipal Banken van Leening, nor are there any limitations upon the interest that may be charged. The rules of the official institutions are very similar to those of the monts de pit in the Latin countries, and unredeemed pledges are sold publicly 15 months after being pawned. A large proportion of the advances are made upon gold and diamonds; workmen's tools are not taken in pledge, and the amount lent varies from 8d. upwards. On condition of finding such sum of money as may be required for working capital over and above loans from public institutions, and the <b>caution</b> <b>money</b> deposited by the city officials, the municipality receives the profits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Bayesian {{approach}} to explore money-output causality within a logistic smooth transition VECM framework. Our empirical results provide substantial {{evidence that the}} postwar US money-output relationship is nonlinear, with regime changes mainly governed by the lagged inflation rates. More importantly, we obtain strong support for long-run non-causality and nonlinear Grangercausality from money to output. Furthermore, our impulse response analysis reveals that a shock to money appears to have negative accumulative impact on real output over the next fifty years, which calls for more <b>caution</b> when using <b>money</b> as a policy instrument...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between money, prices, output, and the exchange rate in Bangladesh during the 1974 - 92 period. Several interesting conclusions {{can be derived from}} the paper. First, the inflationary process in Bangladesh cannot be explained exclusively by the monetarist or the structuralist explanation of inflation. Second, regardless of the monetary aggregate employed, monetary policy exerts a significant unidirectional impact on real output. Third, monetary policy and inflation together account for a significant portion of fluctuations in the exchange rate. Finally, it is noted that monetary shocks have a strong, but relatively short-run, impact on inflation. In light of these findings, it can be concluded that monetary policy in Bangladesh should be carried out with extreme <b>caution.</b> While tight <b>money</b> may put a short-term halt to inflation and help stabilize the foreign trade sector, it may also cause a slowdown in the economy. ...|$|R
40|$|The Kunshan factory enjoyed {{remarkable}} success {{over the}} past 24 months. The quick response, superior teamwork and scouting capability for opportunity and risk {{on the part of}} all staff outperformed that of their counterparts in multinational companies. Family ties, community affection, social ‘face’ and personal recommendations co-ordinated company members well. Chinese community relationships had a consolidating and stabilising function in the factory, enabling a convergent corporate movement. This phenomenal practice is explored here to understand quantitatively the roles of Chinese community relationships (guanxi) and learning organisation practice towards corporate performance. In this research, the bricolage method was adopted to cater for the diverse and vibrant nature in the research context. Ethically, this insider research had to ensure that all factory members received fair treatment {{in the course of the}} research. Their comments and reflections on learning organisations and Chinese community relationships had to be objectively recorded for examination. An assurance was made that there would be no impact on their job security and access to company <b>caution</b> <b>money</b> remained unchanged during the research, so that they remained in control. Guanxi encourages participation in community activity, at the same time advocating action learning. In research methods, repeated actions, a form of action research, are performed in cycles with input from stakeholders to develop a directed course of further actions. Soft Systems Method, and associated structural tools such as rich pictures and CATWOE, help factory members to dissect the business challenge. Qualitative interviewing was carried out among key managers to devise a master plan for divestment. All employees were recompensed for the disruption caused. New corporate spin-offs were established through the exchange of favours and scouting for opportunities. Later, a focus group was undertaken to evaluate progress in the business units and to examine the contribution of learning organisations and Chinese community relationships. Seven relational outcomes are identified in this research in this Kunshan factory. They are: 1) 360 -degree dialogue; 2) group-level exchange of favours; 3) action learning; 4) acculturation; 5) community-prompted foresight capability; 6) personal recommendation; and 7) outside-in mentality. Collectivism on the part of the Chinese community’s participants equalises individual interests through acculturation to establish a common societal and business goal. Sharing a vision and a goal is a pragmatic means of attaining organisational integration and operational excellence. Self-organised vision and mission are attained swiftly through these seven factors to save the effort of initial ice-breaking and team-building activity. A Chinese social system is regarded as a high-context social system – it depends less on precise wording than collective understanding. The Chinese term ‘guanxi’ is used interchangeably in this thesis with ‘Chinese community relationships’ to describe the subtle and delicate interpersonal social interactions perpetuated among ethnic Chinese people in mainland China and overseas in settlements such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and elsewhere. Guanxi comprises two aspects. One is a social construct of Chinese society and the other is the value generated by guanxi in action. In combination these position Chinese community relationships as a mediator of organisational transformation such as the implementation of a learning organisation and improved business performance. Historically, guanxi is perceived as having three characteristics: affection (ganqing, in Chinese), reciprocity (renqing) and credit (xinyong). The learning organisation paradigm describes a continuous process of corporate transformation through collective staff learning, aiming to anticipate and cope with the disruptive commercial challenges of today’s business world. When employees are committed to their organisation, it favours business sustainability. Operational and business risks are mitigated through shared vision and mentality. The attributes of individualism and collectivism substantially influence the implementation of a learning organisation. This research uncovers the mediating effect of Chinese community relationships on learning organisation effectiveness for fast business performance through acculturation and personal recommendation. It reveals the social systems in a Chinese community to empower learning organisation practice. The integrational capability of the seven relational outcomes augments guanxi’s mediating effect in empowering learning organisation practice so as to raise corporate performance substantially...|$|E
40|$|The first essay {{introduces}} a Bayesian logistic smooth transition vector autoregression (LSTVAR) approach to investigating {{the impact of}} international business cycles on the UK economy. We find that the British business cycle is asymmetrically influenced by growth in the US, France and Germany. Overall, positive and negative shocks generating in the US or France affect the UK in the same directions as the shock. However, a shock emanating from Germany always exerts negative cumulative effects on the UK. Further, a positive shock arising from Germany adversely affects the UK output growth more than a negative shock of the same size. The second essay proposes a Bayesian method to investigating the purchasing power parity (PPP) utilizing an exponential smooth transition vector error correction model (ESTVECM). Employing a simple Gibbs sampler, we jointly estimate the cointegrating relationship along with the nonlinearities caused by the departures from the long run equilibrium. By allowing for symmetric regime changes, we provide strong evidence that PPP holds between the US {{and each of the}} remaining G 7 countries. The model we employed implies that the dynamics of the PPP deviations can be rather complex, which is attested to by the impulse response analysis. The final essay proposes a Bayesian approach to exploring money-output causality within a logistic smooth transition vector error correction framework (LSTVECM). Our empirical results provide substantial evidence that the postwar US money-output relationship is nonlinear, with regime changes mainly governed by the lagged inflation rates. More importantly, we obtain strong support for long-run non-causality and nonlinear Granger-causality from money to output. Furthermore, our impulse response analysis reveals that a shock to money appears to have a negative aggregate impact on real output over the next fifty years, which calls for more <b>caution</b> when using <b>money</b> as a policy instrument.
