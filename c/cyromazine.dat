40|$|The poultry {{industry}} in Arkansas is a large, concentrated, growing industry {{that produces a}} high volume of fecal waste. Most of this waste is surface applied as pasture fertilizer. Pesticides are commonly used in the {{poultry industry}} for fly and litter beetle contro land are often {{a component of the}} surface-applied poultry waste. No information exists in the scientific literature regarding the transport of this pesticide component to nearby water supplies. Our research focused on <b>cyromazine,</b> a feed-through larvicide used to control flies in caged-layer hen houses. Tetrachlorvinphos and carbaryl are also used in poultry waste, but these pesticides have a relatively low solubility in water and rapid decomposition rate. <b>Cyromazine,</b> however, is highly soluble and stable in water. Since it may be readily washed from the pasture by heavy rainfall and may persist in surface and soil water, <b>cyromazine</b> appears to be potentially a much greater long-term threat to water quality than either carbaryl or tetrachlorvinphos. Therefore, the objective of this investigation was to examine the extent of <b>cyromazine</b> loss as a result of land application of caged layer manure. To quantify <b>cyromazine</b> loss from pasture plots treated with caged layer manure,research was conducted at the University of Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station at Fayetteville. Plots of uniform slope were bordered to isolate surface runoff, fitted with runoff collectors, and established in fescue pasture. Suction lysimeters were placed at the 60 cm depth to sample soil water in the unsaturated zone. Caged layer manure was analyzed for <b>cyromazine</b> concentration and applied to the plots at three different rates. Rainfall was applied by simulator at two intensities. Surface runoff and lysimeter samples were measured and analyzed for <b>cyromazine</b> concentration. A solid phase extraction procedure was used to separate the <b>cyromazine</b> from the water samples and analysis was done by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that a heavier manure application increased both the runoff and <b>cyromazine</b> concentration. Higher rainfall intensity also increased total <b>cyromazine</b> loss in the runoff, but provided enough runoff volume to decrease the <b>cyromazine</b> concentration.

40|$|In Arkansas, {{much of the}} {{environmental}} concern related to water quality {{has focused on the}} high volume of poultry fecal waste spread on the surf ace of local pastures to fertilize forage grass. <b>Cyromazine</b> (N-cyclopropyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4, 6 - triamine), a feed-through larvicide used to control house flies (Musca domestica), is often a component of caged-layer manure. <b>Cyromazine</b> is quite soluble and stable in water, and previous research has shown that it can be readily washed from pasture plots by intense rainfall. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate increased drying time as a best management practice technique for reducing <b>cyromazine</b> runoff losses from pasture fertilized with caged-layer manure. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare cyromaz ine runoff losses from plots with different drying intervals between the manure application and first rainfall event. Fescue plots with uniform slope and dimensions were used to simulate pasture. Each plot had a runoff collector and borders to isolate plot runoff. Manure was analyzed for <b>cyromazine</b> content, applied to the plot surface at 3. 76 Mg/ha, and allowed to dry for 1 or 7 days. Simulated rain was then applied at 50 mm/h to generate 30 min of runoff from each plot. Plots with manure that dried for 7 days had significantly less runoff than both the control plots that dried for 7 days and manure plots that dried for only 1 day. Analyses of runoff samples indicated that increased drying time following manure application reduced the amount of surf ace runoff and reduced the concentration of <b>cyromazine</b> in the runoff. The resulting decrease in <b>cyromazine</b> runoff loss implies that increased drying time may serve as an effective best management practice for reducing <b>cyromazine</b> losses in runoff from pastures fertilized with caged-layer manure...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} ectoparasiticides are used on sheep {{to protect the}} animals from ill health {{associated}} with infestations of lice {{and the effects of}} fly-strike. Most of the compounds currently in use are organophosphate or pyrethroid-based and have been used for 15 - 20 years, or more. In more recent times, as with other pest control strategies, there has been a tendency to introduce 'newer' pesticides, principally in the form of insect growth regulators (IGRs). VetrazinÂ® was the first IGR-based compound to be registered for use as an ectoparasiticide in Australia and New Zealand. The active ingredient of VetrazinÂ® is <b>cyromazine,</b> a triazine-based compound. Prior to the introduction of VetrazinÂ®, and indeed more recently with other 'new' pesticides, little was, or is known regarding the fate of these compounds during woolscouring. Additionally, given the present practice for woolscours to discharge their aqueous effluents to the aquatic environment, little was, or is known regarding their effects on these receiving waters. In addition, <b>cyromazine</b> is a chemically 'unique' compound, apparently possessing chemical and environmental stability, as well as being highly polar. This uniqueness required the development of specialised techniques for its analysis. Its environmental stability and polarity also suggested that it could become a significant aquatic contaminant, certainly in localised situations. This thesis outlines the development of a clean-up method for the analysis of <b>cyromazine</b> residues in woolscouring waste waters and on greasy (shorn) and scoured wool. A clean-up method using Extract-Cleanâ¢ ion-exchange cartridges and analysis by both gas chromatography with nitorgenphosphorus detector (GC/NPD) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is described. The fate of <b>cyromazine</b> residues during the scouring of greasy wool was investigated by both laboratory and industrial pilot plant trials. <b>Cyromazine</b> was shown to be readily removed in the first three scouring bowls of a woolscour. A simple model is described {{that can be used to}} predict <b>cyromazine</b> effluent concentrations based on a known content for greasy wool. These effluent concentrations can then be used to assess compliance with a proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) established for <b>cyromazine,</b> based on aquatic bioassays. Aquatic bioassays were conducted with both Chironomus zealandicus (Diptera: Chironomidae) larvae and eggs and Deleatidium sp. (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) nymphs. <b>Cyromazine</b> possessed negligible acute toxicity to both organisms, with the concentration required for 50 % mortality (LC 50) being greater than 100 mg/l. However, significant chronic toxicity to C. zealandicus was observed, with a lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) of 25 Âµg/l being recorded. A proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) value of 1. 0 Âµg/l has been suggested, a figure supported by limited aquatic toxicity studies performed elsewhere. <b>Cyromazine</b> was shown to dominate approximately 30 % of the fly-strike control market in New Zealand. This high usage, plus a moderate EQS value, suggests that a minimum seven week withholding period be instigated between dipping for fly-strike control and shearing of treated sheep. Limited toxicity testing was carried out on another IGR-based ectoparasiticide, ZenithÂ®, containing diflubenzuron. This testing, combined with published aquatic toxicity data, suggests than an EQS value for this compound be set at 0. 01 Âµg/l and a withholding period for dipped sheep be set at 18 weeks. Such a long withholding period is unlikely to be attainable in practice such that, if highly aquatically toxic compounds are going to be used as ectoparasiticides on sheep, then woolscours are going to have to invest in technology to remove pesticides from their effluents...|$|E

The rate of the conversion being sensitive to the type and concentration of toxicants. The pesticides tested were carbofuran, <b>cyromazine,</b> fenamiphos, formetanate, and propamocarb. The aqueous solubility of all compounds exceeded 320 mg lâ 1. All the toxicity bioassays were characterized in terms of relative sensitivity and complementarity. Synergistic and antagonistic toxicity effects were observed with pesticide cocktails relative to pure compound toxicities. The D. magna assay was the most sensitive and best able to detect toxic interactions of mixtures. <b>Cyromazine</b> was the least toxic of the pesticides tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{stone leek}} leafminer, Liriomyza chinensis (Kato), {{has become a}} serious pest on onioncrops in the whole Vietnam, and it is treated by {{a wide range of}} {{conventional}} insecticides. Growers apply insecticides early after a few mines on several leaves have been seen, and repeated applications are usually made. Field trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of a single application of four currently and potentially used insecticides on L. chinensis. These insecticides were applied at recommended field rates. Leaf samples were used to monitor larval population, and yellow sticky traps were used to monitor adult population. <b>Cyromazine</b> was effective on the larvae, but no effective on the adults. Cartap, permethrin and phenthoate were not or less effective on neither larvae nor adults of the leafminer. These results suggest that <b>cyromazine</b> application provide one potential component of an effective L. chinensis control strategy for Vietnamese onion farmers...|$|E

The strategies evaluated were: chemical, chemical + cultural, and chemical + cultural + biological (integrated management). The products used were: <b>cyromazine</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{laboratory}} experiments are reported that tested {{the effects of}} five chitin synthesis inhibitors, diflubenzuron, <b>cyromazine,</b> lufenuron, hexaflumuron and triflumuron. on second instars of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Crysomelidae), originally collected from potato fields of Bostanabaad, a town 66 km southeast of Tabriz, Iran. In bioassays, the larvae were fed potato leaves dipped in aqueous solutions containing chitin synthesis inhibitors. The mortalities and abnormalities of the treated larvae were recorded 72 hours after treatments. LC 50 values were 58. 6, 69. 6, 27. 3, 0. 79 and 81. 4 mg ai/ L for diflubenzuron, <b>cyromazine,</b> lufenuron, hexaflumuron and triflumuron, respectively. Compared with phosalone, {{which is one of}} the common insecticides used for controlling this pest in Iran, lufenuron and hexaflumuron seem to be much more potent, and if they perform equally well in the field, they would be suitable candidates to be considered as reduced risk insecticides in management programs for L. decemlineata due to much wider margin of safety for mammals and considerably fewer undesirable environmental side effects...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory studies {{investigated}} {{the interaction between}} the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin and sublethal doses of the insecticides imidacloprid and <b>cyromazine</b> when applied to larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlinenta (Say). When second instars were fed potato leaf discs treated with sublethal doses of imidacloprid and a range of doses of B. bassiana, a synergistic action was demonstrated. Similar results were observed when larvae were sprayed directly with B. bassiana conidia and immediately fed leaf discs treated with imidacloprid. No synergistic interaction was detected when larvae were fed leaf discs treated with sublethal doses of imidacloprid 24 h after application of R. bassiana conidia to larvae. However, a synergistic interaction was detected when larvae were fed leaf discs treated with imidacloprid and sprayed with B, bassiana conidia 24 h later. Although sublethal doses of both imidacloprid and the triazine insect growth regulator (IGR) <b>cyromazine</b> prolonged the duration of the second instar, only imidacloprid interacted with B. bassiana to produce a synergistic response in larval mortality. In leaf consumption studies, the highest dose of B, bassiana tested promoted feeding in inoculated second instars. Feeding was inhibited when larvae were fed foliage treated with sublethal doses of imidacloprid and significantly reduced when fed foliage treated with a sublethal dose of <b>cyromazine.</b> Starvation of larvae for 24 h immediately after B. bassiana treatment produced a similar result to the combined treatment of B. bassiana and imidacloprid and increased the level of mycosis when compared with B. bassiana controls. Imidacloprid treatment affected neither the rate of germination of B. bassiana conidia on the insect cuticle nor the rate at which conidia were removed from the integument after application. The statistical analysis used to detect synergism and the possible role of starvation-induced stress factors underlying the observed synergistic interactions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{stone leek}} leafminer, Liriomyza chnensis (Kato), {{has become a}} serious pest on onion in the whole Vietnam, and it was {{controlled}} by {{a wide range of}} conventional insecticides. Because there is no recommendation on insecticide application, growers continue to use whatever is available without considering the effectiveness. The susceptibility of larva and adult L. chinensis to several insecticides currently and potentially used for the management of leafminers was investigated in the laboratory. Among 10 insecticides available in Vietnam, dimethoate, phenthoate, permethrim, and cartap were highly or moderately effective on either larvae or adults of L. chinensis, but ethofenprox was ineffective. Of the seven insecticides labeled for leafminer control in Japan, crymazine, emamectin benzoate, cartap, and spinosad were highly effective, but thiamethoxam, flufenoxuron, and chlothianidin were less or no effective on L. chinensis at their field recommended dilutions. While dimethoate was effective on both the larvae and adults, <b>cyromazine</b> was only highly effective on the larvae and spinosad, and phenthoate were only found highly effective on the adults. There results suggest that dimethoate, <b>cyromazine,</b> spinosad,phenthoate, and cartap can be rotationally used for L. chinensis control...|$|E
