5|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>gas,</b> {{also known}} as bertholite, was first used as a weapon in World War I by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres. As {{described}} by the soldiers, it had the distinctive smell of a mixture of pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung {{the back of the}} throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form hydrochloric acid, destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal. Human respiratory systems can be protected from <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> by gas masks with activated charcoal or other filters, which makes <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben, which developed methods for discharging <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> against an entrenched enemy. After its first use, both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly phosgene and mustard gas.|$|E

5|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> {{was first}} used as a weapon on April 22, 1915, at Ypres by the German Army. The effect on the allies was devastating because the {{existing}} gas masks were difficult to deploy and had not been broadly distributed.|$|E
40|$|Etch {{rates of}} {{polycrystalline}} beta-silicon carbide (SiC) substrate {{in a wide}} range from less than one to more than 10 mu m/min are obtained using <b>chlorine</b> trifluoride <b>gas</b> in ambient nitrogen at 673 - 973 K and atmospheric pressure in a horizontal reactor. Over the <b>chlorine</b> trifluoride <b>gas</b> concentrations of 10 - 100 % used in this study, the etch rate increases at the substrate temperatures between 673 and 773 K. Additionally, the etch rate at temperatures higher than 773 K is independent of the substrate temperature, similar to the one obtained using <b>chlorine</b> trifluoride <b>gas</b> concentration of 100 %. The root means square roughness of etched surface tends to be small at high temperatures and high <b>chlorine</b> trifluoride <b>gas</b> concentrations. The polycrystalline beta-SiC etch rate can be adjusted using a combination of <b>gas</b> flow rate, <b>chlorine</b> trifluoride <b>gas</b> concentration, and substrate temperature in order to obtain surfaces suitable for various purposes.

5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is denser than air, {{it tends to}} accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. <b>Chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E
5|$|In the home, {{accidents}} {{occur when}} hypochlorite bleach solutions {{come into contact}} with certain acidic drain-cleaners to produce <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas.</b> Hypochlorite bleach (a popular laundry additive) combined with ammonia (another popular laundry additive) produces chloramines, another toxic group of chemicals.|$|E
5|$|The element iron {{can combine}} with {{chlorine}} at high temperatures {{in a strong}} exothermic reaction, creating a chlorine-iron fire. Chlorine-iron fires are a risk in chemical process plants, {{where much of the}} pipework that carries <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> is made of steel.|$|E

40|$|The reactor {{cleaning}} process {{applicable to}} the silicon carbide chemical vapor deposition was designed and developed. The large silicon carbide particles formed on the carbon susceptor surface during the silicon carbide film deposition could be removed by etching the narrow contact regions between the particles and the susceptor surface using <b>chlorine</b> trifluoride <b>gas</b> at temperatures lower than 290 ◦C. During this process, the carbon susceptor covered with the silicon carbide coating film did not suffer considerable damage. Thus, the reactor cleaning by detaching the silicon carbide particles while maintaining the silicon carbide coating film is possible when <b>chlorine</b> trifluoride <b>gas</b> is used at low temperatures...|$|R

5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} has {{a relatively}} low melting point and boils at around 315°C. The vapour consists of the dimer Fe2Cl6 (c.f. aluminium chloride) which increasingly dissociates into the monomeric FeCl3 (D3h point group molecular symmetry) at higher temperature, in competition with its reversible decomposition to give iron(II) chloride and <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5|$|The mucosal {{lining of}} the trachea may also be injured by {{inhalation}} of hot gases or harmful fumes such as <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas.</b> This can lead to edema (swelling), necrosis (death of the tissue), scar formation, and ultimately stenosis.

40|$|The {{growth of}} indoor molds and their {{resulting}} products (e. g., spores and mycotoxins) can present health hazards for human beings. The efficacy of <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>gas</b> as a fumigation treatment for inactivating sick building syndrome-related fungi and their mycotoxins was evaluated. Filter papers (15 per organism) featuring growth of Stachybotrys chartarum, Chaetomium globosum, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Cladosporium cladosporioides {{were placed in}} <b>gas</b> chambers containing <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>gas</b> at either 500 or 1, 000 ppm for 24 h. C. globosum was exposed to the gas both as colonies and as ascospores without asci and perithecia. After treatment, all organisms were tested for colony growth using an agar plating technique. Colonies of S. chartarum were also tested for toxicity using a yeast toxicity assay with a high specificity for trichothecene mycotoxins. Results showed that <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>gas</b> at both concentrations completely inactivated all organisms except for C. globosum colonies which were inactivated an average of 89 %. More than 99 % of ascospores of C. globosum were nonculturable. For all ascospore counts, mean test readings were lower than the controls (P < 0. 001), indicating that some ascospores {{may also have been}} destroyed. Colonies of S. chartarum were still toxic after treatment. These data show that <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>gas</b> can be effective to a degree as a fumigant for the inactivation of certain fungal colonies, that the perithecia of C. globosum can play a slightly protective role for the ascospores and that S. chartarum, while affected by the fumigation treatment, still remains toxic...|$|R

5|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} (Cl2O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) {{which may}} be obtained by reacting <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> with yellow mercury(II) oxide. It is very soluble in water, {{in which it is}} in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make hypochlorites. It explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of ammonia gas.|$|E
5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would be {{expected}} that chlorine {{should be able to}} oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Welded {{titanium}} {{pipe and}} process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) {{are used in}} the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in Oil & Gas downhole applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium hypochlorite or wet <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> (in the bleachery).

40|$|SUMMARY. The role of {{atmospheric}} ozone {{to protect the}} living organism from the ul-traviolet radiation is well known. It saves the earth from the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun. Some stable <b>chlorine</b> <b>gases</b> released by the human activities going above the earth eat up the ozone layer. Depletion {{of the ozone layer}} is a great threat to the human society. In this paper, we discuss the lethal effects of the ozone depletion and compute the upper and lower β content confidence limits for an extreme value distribution and show that this can be used to calculate the upper and lower tolerance limits to the level {{of atmospheric}} ozone layer. The technique is explained by a data set. 1...|$|R
40|$|Study of the {{characteristics}} of the CW neutral argon IR laser, using a variety of techniques. The output power enhancement effects of helium and <b>chlorine</b> <b>gases</b> are measured, and the reasons for the enhancement are determined. The gain is measured for the 2. 397 -, 2. 208 -, 2. 062 -, and 1. 792 -micron laser lines, using an internal cavity-loss method and a single-pass amplifier method. In addition, the saturation intensity is measured, and competition effects are studied. It is concluded that helium aids excitation of the upper laser levels by producing {{a significant increase in the}} electron temperature. Chlorine is shown to aid deexcitation of the lower laser levels by partially depopulating the metastable argon 4 s levels that lie just below them...|$|R
5|$|Bismuth {{travels in}} crude lead bullion (which can contain up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of refining, {{until it is}} removed by the Kroll-Betterton process which {{separates}} the impurities as slag, or the electrolytic Betts process. Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper. The raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead. By reacting the molten mixture with <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged. Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high-purity bismuth metal (over 99% Bi). World bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources of}} bromine are in the United States and Israel. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> to oxidise Br− to Br2. This is then removed with a blast of steam or air, and is then {{condensed}} and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth {{the size of the}} chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.|$|E

Little company, which was {{developing}} a portable military [...] "lox" [...] generator and was dumping excess product fuming and freezing everything, into the gutter. The club hauled it to their test site in 5-gallon steel cans insulated with fiber mat. This gave their most successful test—the rocket motor roared with a ten-foot plume of flame filled with standing shock waves, with the thrust gauge off-scale for ten seconds or more. But the aluminum motor burned out its throat and set the test stand on fire, which they put out with a Pyrene hand fire extinguisher. However the carbon tetrachloride produced phosgene and <b>chlorine</b> <b>gasses</b> (they deduced), which corroded all the metal.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{chemical}} vapor deposition reactor {{for producing}} thin silicon films was designed and developed for achieving a new electronic device production system, the Minimal Manufacturing, using a half-inch wafer. This system requires a rapid process by a small footprint reactor. This was designed and verified by employing the technical issues, such as (i) vertical gas flow, (ii) thermal operation using a highly concentrated infrared flux, and (iii) reactor cleaning by <b>chlorine</b> trifluoride <b>gas.</b> The combination of (i) and (ii) could achieve a low heating power and a fast cooling designed by the heat balance of the small wafer placed at a position outside of the reflector. The cleaning process could be rapid by (iii). The heating step could be skipped because <b>chlorine</b> trifluoride <b>gas</b> was reactive at any temperature higher than room temperature...|$|R

Due {{to the large}} number of individuals allergic to beta-lactams, a method for their inactivation was explored such that a contaminated area could be treated and re-used. The goal was to validate a cycle {{that could be used to}} treat a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s beta-lactam manufacturing equipment for the future production of non-beta-lactam compounds. Testing was conducted using <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>gas</b> at various concentrations and exposure times in an effort to achieve the pharmaceutical manufacturer’s required 3 -log (99. 9 %) reduction of eight different beta-lactams on various surfaces. After a period of cycle development, multiple <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>gas</b> cycles at various concentrations and exposure lengths were shown effective in inactivating the eight beta-lactam compounds to a successful degree...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{compound}} of chlorine, sodium chloride, {{has been known}} since ancient times; archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used as early as 3000 BC and brine as early as 6000 BC. Its importance in food was very well known in classical antiquity and was sometimes used as payment for services for Roman generals and military tribunes. Elemental chlorine was probably first isolated around 1200 {{with the discovery of}} aqua regia and its ability to dissolve gold, since <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> is one of the products of this reaction: it was however not recognised as a new substance. Around 1630, chlorine was recognized as a gas by the Flemish chemist and physician Jan Baptist van Helmont.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas</b> is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E
5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give <b>chlorine</b> <b>gas.</b> For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the possible reactions of chlorine atoms, chlorine monoxide, and hydrogen chloride with D region negative ions. The mesospheric concentrations of the neutral <b>chlorine</b> <b>gases</b> have been predicted with a diurnally varying one-dimensional model of the upper atmosphere. Despite the low abundances of chlorine compounds in air their high reactivity leads {{to the formation of}} substantial quantities of clorine negative ions at high altitudes. The concentration of chlorine ions is limited in daylight by rapid reactions with oxygen and hydrogen atoms and at night by the competitive production of other stable ions. The presence of chlorine negative ions in the upper atmosphere is consistent with in situ mass spectrometer observations of charged species. The abundance of chlorinated ions in the D region may be correlated with mesospheric nitric oxide and water vapor concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The role of PSC {{particles}} {{in determining the}} distributions of HCl and chlorine radicals is studied. The thermodynamics of HCl in ice is discussed, showing that significant quantities of HCl may be dissolved in ice when PSCs form. It is argued that HCl and HNO 3 will {{be removed from the}} gas phase early in the condensation process, when only small quantities of H 2 O have been condensed, reflecting the thermodynamic properties of the solid phases of HCl, HNO 3, and H 2 O. Rapid heterogeneous chemical reactions then volatilize reactive <b>chlorine</b> <b>gases</b> and convert NO(x) to solid-phase nitrates, which can be removed by gravitational settling. Analysis of the suite of heterogeneous chemical processes in the polar stratosphere implies a threshold for HCl concentrations, above which chemical loss rates for ozone increase dramatically...|$|R
