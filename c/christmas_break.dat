5|$|The Flames {{struggled}} {{to begin the}} 2010–11 NHL season, falling to 14th place in the conference at the <b>Christmas</b> <b>break.</b> Consequently, the organization asked Darryl Sutter to step aside as general manager. The team named assistant Jay Feaster the interim general manager in his place, making it permanent following the season. The team pulled itself back into playoff contention following the change but once again failed {{to qualify for the}} post-season.|$|E
5|$|Carter and Frank Spotnitz wrote major {{parts of}} the script in Hawaii over Christmas 1996. They used the same method that they had used when writing episodes and {{sketching}} out scenes for the series on 3x5 index cards. By the time the <b>Christmas</b> <b>break</b> had ended, the whole narrative for the film had been written. Upon his return from Hawaii, Carter looked for spare time to write the script. He returned to Hawaii and in ten days wrote {{about half of the}} 124-page screenplay for the film.|$|E
5|$|The team's struggles {{continued}} into December, where the Flames lost four of six games {{to begin the}} month. Back-to-back victories over the Columbus Blue Jackets and Toronto Maple Leafs on December 13 and 16, respectively, {{marked the first time}} the team won consecutive games since late October. The latter victory also spoiled Dion Phaneuf's first return to Calgary following his trade to Toronto the previous season. The Flames followed the victories with three consecutive losses, but entered the <b>Christmas</b> <b>break</b> on a positive note with a 3–2 shootout victory over the Dallas Stars.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the <b>Christmas</b> <b>break,</b> in a faxed letter to NDP {{candidate}} Judy Wasylycia-Leis, the Commissioner of the RCMP, Giuliano Zaccardelli announced the RCMP had opened a criminal investigation into her complaint that it appeared Liberal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale's office had leaked information leading to insider trading before making an important announcement on the taxation of income trusts. On December 27, 2005, the RCMP confirmed that information in a press release. At {{the conclusion of the}} investigation, Serge Nadeau, a top Finance Department civil servant, was charged with criminal breach of trust. No charges were laid against then Finance Minister Ralph Goodale.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season {{fears of}} a {{conflict}} with Keenan were realized, as the coach reduced his time on the power play and forced him into a defensive role he was not comfortable with. Unhappy with being pushed into a checking role, and believing that the way Keenan was using him was not allowing him to give the Flames fair value on his contract, Tanguay requested a trade at the <b>Christmas</b> <b>break.</b> He and general manager Darryl Sutter agreed to keep it quiet {{so as not to}} become a distraction to the team, although Tanguay's request was revealed in the off-season. He suffered offensively, falling to 58 points.|$|E
5|$|The team then {{traveled}} to Indianapolis, where {{they lost to}} IUPUI 64–73, despite a career high 20 points from Eric Evans. In their final game before a short <b>Christmas</b> <b>break,</b> Duquesne defeated the Saint Francis Red Flash 86–56. Damian Saunders scored his tenth double-double, making him the national leader in that statistic, as well as second in rebounds. Following the break, Duquesne lost its final non-conference game to the Old Dominion Monarchs by a score of 54–63, {{the first of a}} five-game losing streak. Saunders still managed to post his eleventh double-double, coming just one block short of what would have been only the second triple-double in school history.|$|E

5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed {{that he did not}} look like a military man, they felt he had the quality they were looking for in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a <b>Christmas</b> <b>break</b> was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 season {{would kick}} {{off with the}} Supercopa de España, this time against reigning Copa del Rey champions Real Madrid. In Madrid, Barcelona would play to a 2–2 draw, but would seal the Supercup with a 3–2 win at the Camp Nou. The first kick of a ball in La Liga for Barça {{would be at the}} Camp Nou against Villarreal, with the Catalans easily winning 5–0. In the first Liga Clásico of the season, Barcelona would win 1–3 in Madrid to level on points with Madrid heading into the <b>Christmas</b> <b>break.</b> Nevertheless, Barcelona would drop two points away to Espanyol, which ended 1–1, to go two points behind their archrivals Madrid. In the Copa del Rey semi-finals, in the first leg against Real Madrid, the Blaugrana would win 1–2 in Madrid, later sealing their place in the semi-finals after a 2–2 draw at the Camp Nou. In the Round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League, the then-defending champions would defeat Bayer Leverkusen 1–3 in Germany and rout them 7–1 at the Camp Nou. The quarter-finals against Milan would begin slowly for the Catalan club, playing to a 0–0 draw in Milan, only to sweep the Italian club aside 3–1 at the Camp Nou with two strikes from Lionel Messi. In the semi-finals against Chelsea, Barcelona would be {{defeated}} 1–0 in London after a Didier Drogba strike in the 45th minute. The second leg, meanwhile, at the Nou Camp finished 2–2, thus eliminating Barcelona from European contention. In the penultimate game of the season at home to Real Madrid, perhaps the most important game of the Catalan club's season, Barça would collapse 1–2 to Real Madrid with a strike each from Sami Khedira and Cristiano Ronaldo, winning Los Blancos the match. On 27 April, coach Pep Guardiola announced in a tearful press conference in Barcelona that he would be stepping down as coach of the Catalan club {{at the end of the}} season, citing that he needed a break from football; he was to be replaced by Tito Vilanova. In Barcelona's final game of the season, the Copa del Rey finals against Athletic Bilbao, Barça would win 3–0 with a brace from Pedro and a strike from Messi, winning the club the trophy. That season, Barça would also win the 2011 UEFA Super Cup, 2–0 against Porto and the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, 4–0 against Santos.|$|E
