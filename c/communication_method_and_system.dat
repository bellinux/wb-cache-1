This paper examines a fifth generation messaging system proposed by Jihong Li in her Master’s thesis A fifth generation messaging system. It discusses four problems identified in this thesis and then redefines and examines the “persona problem ” or the identification and uses of a person’s various “personalities ” in a messaging system. This problem is refined and examined in the concept of persona identification. To help provide understanding of this concept an electronic mailing system design that would be able to identify “persona ” is discussed. A current graphical user interface electronic mailing system is examined before a user interface that could be integrated with a fifth generation messaging system is presented. This paper then discusses possible implementations of this persona concept through manipulation of existing filters <b>and</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R

According to some embodiments, a low-power {{wireless receiver}} can comprise an input module, a controller, and a feedback loop. The input module can receive a wireless signal from a wireless communication channel. The controller can receive the wireless signal {{and provide a}} control signal corresponding to the wireless communication channel. The controller can be operatively configured to dynamically modify the control signal responsive to conditions of the wireless signal and/or the communication channel. The feedback loop can be disposed between the controller and the input module and can dynamically provide the control signal to the input module such that the input module can modify quality conditions of the wireless signal. Dynamic adaptations can occur in real-time so that a low-power wireless device can manage power consumption {{in response to a}} quality of signal metric that reflects conditions of a wireless communication channel.

40|$|In this {{document}} we propose {{the development of}} a Smart Transmission Grids Laboratory named (SmarTS-Lab - Smart Transmission Systems-Laboratory) to be developed jointly by KTH-EPS and KTH-ICS. This laboratory has the aim of serving as a test-bench where research enabling the future ?Smart Grids? at the transmission level will be performed. To this aim, the SmarTS-Lab will be designed as a completely configurable system which will allow testing and development of power <b>system</b> operations <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> techniques; control <b>methods,</b> strategies, <b>and</b> algorithms; advanced protective system coordination with system controls; communication network paradigms <b>and</b> computer <b>system</b> architecture paradigms; information and communication technology design specifications - all under a completely controlled environment. This approach will allow the assessment of research ideas by subjecting them to a ?near-real-world? power network (emulated by a highly accurate real-time simulator) and allowing gradual testing of the performance of our research ideas under near ?real-world? conditions imposed by ?actual? communication networks <b>and</b> computer <b>system</b> architectures. It is important to emphasize that this approach will bring to our research area a methodology that is not standard in similar research groups ? a completely controlled environment where we can reproduce experiments. Therefore, this will allow for a very rigorous and careful assessment of new <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> techniques and to determine applications requirements for ICT; in addition to incorporating practical limitations, which are close to those present in the field. Recently, the European Institute of Technology (EIT) assigned KTH as a Smart Grids center. Within the EIT cooperation the proposed SmarTS-Lab will provide a suitable launching platform to develop innovative technologies for Smart Transmission Grids. Once established, the SmarTS-Lab can be used to develop innovative software/hardware solutions that can be used by transmission system operators worldwide. KTH?s long-standing collaboration with ABB and Vattenfall will provide an opportunity to establish the potential of the developed solutions within this EIT collaboration. This laboratory will also serve the larger research and education goals of the EPS and ICS departments at KTH. At EPS it will serve for on-going PhD and Master thesis projects, while it may also be used to perform illustrations for some courses. At ICS it will serve as a canvas where different paradigms of <b>communication</b> <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> computer <b>system</b> architectures for real-time operation of power systems can be demonstrated. This document provides background information and justifications to develop such simulator by KTH EPS and ICS. QC 20120126. Internal EPS Report and White Pape...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the effective internal <b>communication</b> <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> media for knowledge transfer in the manufacturing industry. The research involved the collection of quantitative data through non-probability, convenience sampling. The data was collected using survey questionnaires at three companies in the manufacturing industry namely; Exxaro FerroAlloys, Tubatse Chrome and Amalgamated Beverage Industries. The data was analysed using descriptive and univariate statistical techniques. The study showed that push <b>communication</b> <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> high-media rich <b>communication</b> is preferred for transferring information/explicit knowledge in the manufacturing industry. The most preferred <b>communication</b> <b>methods</b> (top three) for information/explicit knowledge transfer were email followed by newsletters and compulsory meetings. The importance of media richness in transferring tacit knowledge was shown. The study found that High-media rich communication, especially face-to-face, was preferred to transfer and share tacit knowledge. These findings were discussed in the context of existing literature and a number of recommendations were made. CopyrightDissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} perceptions of organizational <b>communication</b> <b>methods</b> used by selected commodity-specific, general agricultural and, conservation or natural resources organizations to disseminate information about the Farm Security and Rural Investment (FSRI) Act of 2002 within their organizations. A secondary purpose was to evaluate if preferred organizational <b>communication</b> <b>methods</b> related to organization leaders?? perceptions of the FSRI Act of 2002. Previous studies have assessed organizational <b>communication</b> <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> members?? perceptions, but little research has been completed on the combination of these variables. The instrument used in this study was derived from modified versions of Sulak??s (2000) 1996 Farm Bill survey, a similar instrument by Catchings and Wingenbach (2003), and Franklin??s (1975) organizational communication survey. The target population (N= 300) was all selected Texas organizations?? board members. The accessible population (n= 160) were selected Texas organizations (commodity-specific, general agriculture, and conservation or natural resources) board members. There were 70 respondents with a response rate of 44 %. iv The respondents from this study were mostly board members from a commodity-specific organization and were 46 to 55 years old. They had attended college or completed an undergraduate degree, were raised on a rural farm or ranch, and currently live on rural farm or ranch. The respondents from selected Texas organizations indicated that they had some knowledge about 17 of the 18 primary issues or programs in the 2002 Farm Bill. Selected Texas organizations board members strongly agreed that their respective organizations wanted to meet their primary objectives and information about important events or situations were shared within their organizations. The respondents strongly agreed with the statement ??farm organization coalitions were essential for enacting the 2002 Farm Bill,?? and ??farm organizations strongly influenced the 2002 Farm Bill. ?? This study summated and correlated the perceptions of organizational <b>communication</b> <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> perceptions of influencers affecting the outcome of the 2002 Farm Bill. Through that correlation, this study can conclude there was a moderately significant and positive relationship between perceived organizational <b>communication</b> <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> perceived levels of influencers affecting the outcome of the 2002 Farm Bill...|$|R
