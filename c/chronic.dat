5|$|If {{symptoms}} develop {{during the}} acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three {{to eight weeks}} in approximately 90% of individuals. Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a <b>chronic</b> phase. Of individuals with <b>chronic</b> Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called indeterminate <b>chronic</b> Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called determinate <b>chronic</b> Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of <b>chronic</b> Chagas disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. <b>Chronic</b> excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether <b>chronic</b> alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For <b>chronic</b> alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or <b>chronic.</b> In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in <b>chronic</b> poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. <b>Chronic</b> overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; <b>chronic</b> overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Broussais {{discovers that}} if acute {{gastritis}} is untreated, {{it can become}} <b>chronic.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Chronic</b> {{blistering}} cutaneous {{conditions have}} a prolonged course and present with vesicles and bullae.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chronic</b> {{gastritis}} {{is likely}} to underlie H. pylori-related diseases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chronic</b> {{prostatitis}} in {{the forms}} of <b>chronic</b> prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and <b>chronic</b> bacterial prostatitis (not acute bacterial prostatitis or asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis) may cause recurrent urinary tract infections in males. Risk of infections increases as males age. While bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this {{does not appear to}} affect the risk of urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{and risk}} factors that {{predispose}} to pneumonia include smoking, immunodeficiency, alcoholism, <b>chronic</b> obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, <b>chronic</b> kidney disease, and liver disease. The use of acid-suppressing medications—such as proton-pump inhibitors or H2 blockers—is {{associated with an}} increased risk of pneumonia. The risk is also increased in old age.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with <b>chronic</b> low back pain. It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another. The Alexander technique appears useful for <b>chronic</b> back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in <b>chronic</b> low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of <b>chronic</b> low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people {{infected}}, the disease is <b>chronic,</b> and without treatment, they are infected {{for the remainder of}} their lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. The treatment of <b>chronic</b> carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>chronic</b> stage, {{treatment}} involves {{managing the}} clinical {{manifestations of the}} disease. For example, pacemakers and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug amiodarone, may be life saving for some patients with <b>chronic</b> cardiac disease, while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. <b>Chronic</b> heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for heart transplantation surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a contraindication for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the immunosuppression that follows surgery.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with {{low back pain}}. <b>Chronic</b> low back pain is associated with sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration of sleep, and less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority of those with <b>chronic</b> low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Pain is classed as acute (short term) or <b>chronic</b> (long term). <b>Chronic</b> pain may be {{continuous}} {{with occasional}} sharp rises in intensity (flares), or intermittent: periods of painlessness interspersed with periods of pain. Despite pain being well controlled by long-acting drugs or other treatment, flares may occasionally be felt; {{this is called}} breakthrough pain, and is treated with quick-acting analgesics.|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic {{dermatitis}} is a <b>chronic,</b> superficial, {{inflammatory disease}} characterized by scaling on an erythematous base.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Chronic</b> didn't {{chart on}} the UK Albums Chart until 2000, {{eight years after}} its {{original}} release, and peaked at number 43 in July 2004. It has sold 260,814 copies there. The <b>Chronic</b> re-entered the charts in 2003, peaking on the Ireland Albums Top75 at number48, and on the UK Albums Top75 in 2004 at number43.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Chronic</b> {{peaked at}} number {{three on the}} Billboard 200 and had been {{certified}} triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America with sales of 5.7 million copies in the United States, which led to Dr. Dre {{becoming one of the}} top ten best-selling American performing artists of 1993. Dr. Dre's production has been noted for popularizing the G-funk subgenre within gangsta rap. The <b>Chronic</b> has been widely {{regarded as one of the}} most important and influential albums of the 1990s and regarded by many fans and peers to be one of the most well-produced hip hop albums of all time. The <b>Chronic</b> was ranked at #138 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of <b>chronic</b> {{infection}} in women prior to or during pregnancy {{does not appear}} to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether prophylactic treatment of <b>chronic</b> infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example, those with HIV infection).|$|E
5|$|Up to 1% of {{the overall}} {{population}} experiences tic disorders, including <b>chronic</b> tics and transient tics of childhood. <b>Chronic</b> tics affect 5% of children, and transient tics affect up to 20%. Prevalence rates in special education populations are higher.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{is usually}} due to insufficient dietary intake, {{but can be}} associated with malabsorption, acrodermatitis enteropathica, <b>chronic</b> liver disease, <b>chronic</b> renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other <b>chronic</b> illnesses. Groups at risk for zinc deficiency include the elderly, children in developing countries, and those with renal dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Persistent <b>chronic</b> pain {{associated}} with non-healing wounds {{is caused by}} tissue (nociceptive) or nerve (neuropathic) damage and is influenced by dressing changes and <b>chronic</b> inflammation. <b>Chronic</b> wounds {{take a long time}} to heal and patients can suffer from <b>chronic</b> wounds for many years. <b>Chronic</b> wound healing may be compromised by coexisting underlying conditions, such as venous valve backflow, peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled edema and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chronic</b> pain: Even in {{the absence}} of acute vaso-occlusive pain, many {{patients}} have unreported <b>chronic</b> pain.|$|E
25|$|P. aeruginosa {{represents}} a commonly used biofilm model organism {{since it is}} involved in different types of biofilm-associated infections. Examples of such infections include <b>chronic</b> wounds, <b>chronic</b> otitis media, <b>chronic</b> prostatitis and <b>chronic</b> lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. About 80% of CF patients have <b>chronic</b> lung infection, caused mainly by P. aeruginosa growing in a non-surface attached biofilms surround by PMN. The infection remains present despite aggressive antibiotic therapy and is a common {{cause of death in}} CF patients due to constant inflammatory damage to the lungs.|$|E
25|$|People with <b>chronic</b> obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), most commonly emphysema or <b>chronic</b> bronchitis, frequently have <b>chronic</b> {{shortness of breath}} and a <b>chronic</b> productive cough. An acute exacerbation presents with increased shortness of breath and sputum production. COPD is {{a risk factor for}} pneumonia; thus this condition should be ruled out. In an acute exacerbation treatment is with a combination of anticholinergics, beta2-adrenoceptor agonists, steroids and possibly positive pressure ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Leukemias* are {{progressive}} {{proliferation of}} cancerous {{white blood cells}} within the bone marrow, resulting in destruction of the bone marrow and pancytopenia in many cases. Types of leukemia in dogs include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acute megakaryocytic leukemia, <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic leukemia, <b>chronic</b> myelogenous leukemia, <b>chronic</b> basophilic leukemia, and <b>chronic</b> eosinophilic leukemia (or hypereosinophilic syndrome).|$|E
25|$|<b>Chronic</b> and {{transitory}} {{food insecurity}} are linked, since the reoccurrence of transitory food security can make households {{more vulnerable to}} <b>chronic</b> food insecurity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chronic</b> {{bronchitis}} {{is defined}} as a productive cough that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. Most people with <b>chronic</b> bronchitis have <b>chronic</b> obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Protracted bacterial bronchitis {{is defined as}} a <b>chronic</b> productive cough with a positive bronchoalveolar lavage that resolves with antibiotics. Symptoms of <b>chronic</b> bronchitis may include wheezing and shortness of breath, especially upon exertion and low oxygen saturations. The cough is often worse soon after awakening and the sputum produced may have a yellow or green color and may be streaked with specks of blood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chronic</b> rhinosinusitis {{represents}} a multifactorial inflammatory disorder, {{rather than simply}} a persistent bacterial infection. The medical management of <b>chronic</b> rhinosinusitis is now focused upon controlling the inflammation that predisposes patients to obstruction, reducing the incidence of infections. However, all forms of <b>chronic</b> rhinosinusitis are associated with impaired sinus drainage and secondary bacterial infections. Most individuals require initial antibiotics to clear any infection and intermittently afterwards to treat acute exacerbations of <b>chronic</b> rhinosinusitis.|$|E
25|$|About 20% of {{patients}} with acute ischemic colitis may develop a long-term complication known as <b>chronic</b> ischemic colitis. Symptoms can include recurrent infections, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and <b>chronic</b> abdominal pain. <b>Chronic</b> ischemic colitis is often treated with surgical removal of the chronically diseased portion of the bowel.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recommended}} that healthcare providers handle the pain related to <b>chronic</b> wounds {{as one of the}} main priorities in <b>chronic</b> wound management (together with addressing the cause). Six out of ten venous leg ulcer patients experience pain with their ulcer, and similar trends are observed for other <b>chronic</b> wounds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chronic</b> {{diseases}} can delay puberty in {{both boys}} and girls. Those that involve <b>chronic</b> inflammation or interfere with nutrition have the strongest effect. In the western world, inflammatory bowel disease and tuberculosis have been notorious for such an effect in the last century, while {{in areas of the}} underdeveloped world, <b>chronic</b> parasite infections are widespread.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam is not {{recommended}} for patients with <b>chronic</b> schizophrenia. A 1982 double-blinded, placebo-controlled study found clonazepam increases violent behavior in individuals with <b>chronic</b> schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of MI can {{be broken}} into three phases of the disease process: the acute phase, the <b>chronic</b> compensated phase, and the <b>chronic</b> decompensated phase.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol use {{increases}} the risk of <b>chronic</b> gastritis (stomach inflammation); it is one cause of cirrhosis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis in both its <b>chronic</b> and acute forms.|$|E
25|$|Bartonella species cause {{diseases}} such as Carrión´s disease, trench fever, cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, peliosis hepatis, <b>chronic</b> bacteremia, endocarditis, <b>chronic</b> lymphadenopathy, and neurological disorders.|$|E
25|$|On November 4, 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} duloxetine {{to treat}} <b>chronic</b> musculoskeletal pain, including discomfort from osteoarthritis and <b>chronic</b> lower back pain.|$|E
