The controversial film, depicting two social outcasts, was scheduled to be released in an edited form but Palme thought the material was too socially important to be cut.|$|E

For live performances, Este plays bass, Danielle plays lead guitar and sings lead vocals, and Alana plays rhythm guitar along with keyboards and percussion.

In September 2009, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach released a book based on taped conversations he had with Jackson in 2001. It included Jackson's thoughts on personal relationships in general and specific ones. His romantic feelings for two famous friends were widely cited in the media; {{when asked if he}} got jealous when his long-time friend Elizabeth Taylor dated other men, he replied, [...] "Yes and no.

500|$|... "I Shall Be Free" [...] is a rewrite of Lead Belly's [...] "We Shall Be Free", {{which was}} {{performed}} by Lead Belly, Sonny Terry, Cisco Houston, and Woody Guthrie. According to Todd Harvey, Dylan's version draws its melody from the Guthrie recording but omits its signature chorus ("We'll soon be free/When the Lord will <b>call</b> <b>us</b> home"). Critics have been divided about the worth of this final song. Robert Shelton dismissed the song as [...] "a decided anticlimax. Although the album has {{at least a half}} dozen blockbusters, two of the weakest songs are tucked in at the end, like shirttails." [...] Todd Harvey has argued that by placing the song {{at the close of the}} Freewheelin LP, Dylan ends on a note of levity which is a relief after the weighty sentiments expressed in several songs on the album.|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record of your career, take as much time as you want, <b>call</b> <b>us</b> when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've got to put creative first. It's an art, you've got to look at it like an art, treat it like an art, and then you'll get the best product in the long run." ...|$|E

'Wherefore we must depart from iniquity that profess the name of Christ, that we may glorify him for his call.' (1 Cor. 1:9; Heb. 3:1) He has <b>called</b> <b>us</b> to the {{fellowship}} of his Son Jesus Christ; that is, to partake of all that good that is in him, as Mediator, and {{to be done by}} him for those that trust in him. Nor had we ever come out of a cursed and condemned condition, to Christ, for life and blessedness, but by the call of the Father; 'For it is not of works, but of him that calleth.' (Rom. 9:11) Now since he has <b>called</b> <b>us</b> to this privilege--even us whom he has called--and left others in their sins to perish by his judgments, it is meet we should depart from iniquity. (Heb. 3:1; 2 Peter 1:2, 3) Especially since the call by which he <b>called</b> <b>us</b> is heavenly, and holy, and because he has not only <b>called</b> <b>us</b> to glory, but to virtue.|$|R

500|$|Ralph M. Cole, {{a member}} of the golf team of 1926-1928, later wrote of a humorous {{incident}} involving the septuagenarian Coach Trueblood. Cole recalled: [...] "As golf coach he could add very little about the mechanics of the game. But he added one piece of advice which was very helpful when followed, and which he drilled into us at every practice session. It was: 'Up and out in two, boys.' As any golfer would know, it meant, when hitting a short approach shot, get it close enough to the pin to make the next putt. [...] Now for the humorous part of that admonition. We had played Purdue in Lafayette on a Thursday and were to play Illinois on Friday. The Professor was to <b>call</b> <b>us</b> at 4:30a.m. to catch a 5:30 train for Urbana. Well, he got confused on our room number and awakened a man who called the front desk and told the night clerk that there must be some nut calling at 4:30a.m. and shouting, 'Up and out in two boys!' [...] We did make the train, anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to <b>call</b> <b>us</b> with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E

[...] "Skew It On the Bar-B" [...] {{is followed by the}} title track, which has been compared to the music of soul singer Isaac Hayes.
