40|$|In this article, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} advance the {{thinking}} about the ‘new’ self-employed (NSE). This is done by describing four cases which can be considered representative for the ambiguous attitude of social policy makers towards NSE. In the end four conclusions are drawn. The target group is too varied for statements about desirable legislation or social policy architecture, but a substantial proportion does deserve the qualification ‘precarious’ and, consequently, the attention of social policy. The solution lies in categorical arrangements which address the need for protection in specific sectors. The time is ripe for this. Research {{has shown that the}} proposition that many NSE are concerned about their vulnerability as workers is untrue. They see that they are no longer protected by collective arrangements, and they have experienced that the market can resolve only a limited portion of their problems. Their concerns can provide the foundation for a <b>collective</b> <b>facility</b> with mandatory solidarity which should be branche related. And finally, the complexity surrounding NSE labour is especially confronting for the labour unions, but they could also approach their entry as an opportunity to regroup around the interests of all workers, no matter what their labour law status...|$|R

50|$|Mehr project, {{designed}} in 2007, aimed {{to cover a}} part of house shortage through building of around 2 million housing units within 5 years. As of January 2011, the banking sector, particularly Bank Maskan has given loans up to 102 trillion rials ($10.2 billion) to applicants of Mehr housing project. Under this scheme real estate developers are offered free lands in return for building cheap residential units for first-time buyers on 99-year lease contracts. The government then commissioned agent banks to offer loans to the real estate developers to prepare the lands and begin construction projects {{in an attempt to}} increase production and create equilibrium in the supply and demand curve (2008). Close to 400,000 units have been built and permits have been issued for another 12,000. Mehr Housing project is expected to provide 600,000 residential units in its first phase. About 3.7 million people have so far registered for Mehr Housing Plan (2008). About 10 million rials is to be paid by applicants for preparing the land and another 10 million to be given by the government in the form of banking facilities. Applicants should pay about 20 percent of the construction costs. In addition, about 140 million rials worth of housing loans will be granted to them (10,000 rials=1 USD in 2008). While most Iranians have difficulties obtaining small home loans, 90 persons have managed to secure <b>collective</b> <b>facilities</b> totaling $8 billion from banks. Problems regarding lack of utilities has been reported for the project, including lack of access to water, power, gas, and sewerage lines. Starting in 2014, the Mehr housing scheme will be taken off the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Iran. The government of President Rouhani announced that by 2017 the Mehr housing project will be replaced with cheap loans to needy families with the stated objective to build only 150,000 homes on a yearly basis.|$|E
