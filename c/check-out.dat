5|$|She {{attended}} Fountain Valley High School, {{graduating in}} 1976. She {{worked as a}} <b>check-out</b> girl at Vons supermarket, and attended Golden West College where {{she was a member}} of Alpha Delta Pi sorority. After a short stint training to be a court stenographer, she decided upon an acting career. She won the Miss Orange County beauty pageant in 1978, and participated in Miss California contest the same year, finishing in 6th position. Following her participation in these pageants, she acquired an acting agent and began to audition for television and films.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} day in {{preparations}} for Friday's landing. After working through their post-sleep activities, Altman, Johnson and McArthur performed a <b>check-out</b> of the flight control surfaces, performed a reaction control system hot-fire, and went through communications checks with managers on the ground. The {{rest of the crew}} worked to stow away items that were used during the mission. The crew held a deorbit preparations briefing with the ground teams, and Altman and Johnson worked with the simulator on board to run through a series of landing simulations.|$|E
25|$|M {{introduced}} self <b>check-out</b> tills in the food-halls of a {{small number}} of trial stores in 2002. Self <b>check-out</b> was implemented in the general merchandise sections in three trial stores in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|POS-related [...] "kiosks" [...] are [...] "lane busting" [...] <b>check-outs</b> such as seen {{at large}} {{retailers}} like Home Depot and Kroger.|$|R
50|$|CREATE {{stands for}} the Crucible’s Expanded Access to Tools & Equipment. The Crucible offers the {{opportunity}} to use their tools and equipment through the CREATE program. After passing studio area <b>check-outs,</b> current and past students can use The Crucible’s tools and equipment during studio hours.|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} {{production}} B-61A Matador missiles arrived at Eglin in September 1953, {{under the control}} of the 6555th Guided Missile Squadron, out of Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, for climatic testing, although instrumentation and pre-test <b>check-outs</b> kept the actual cold-weather tests from beginning until November.|$|R
25|$|In July 2000, Kmart closed 72 underperforming stores due to poor sales, and {{the company}} {{announced}} that they were planning on a major restructuring process, in which Kmart would invest in new customer <b>check-out</b> and new inventory management technology and other related systems as well.|$|E
25|$|The Nol Card {{are used}} by the {{passengers}} to check-in and <b>check-out</b> at the gates in their destination station. The fare will be automatically deducted {{based on the number}} of zones traveled. Passengers will be allowed to check-in when their card has more than minimum credit required.|$|E
25|$|Most of the post-Jupiter voyage {{was spent}} in {{hibernation}} mode to preserve on-board systems, except for brief annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument <b>check-out</b> began. On January 15, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto.|$|E
25|$|This five month phase {{lasted from}} the end of the Near Earth Commissioning phase until one month prior to the Mars capture {{manoeuvre}} and included trajectory correction manoeuvres and payloads calibration. The payload was mostly switched off during the cruise phase, with the exception of some intermediate <b>check-outs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Staffing at CML {{consists}} of 794 employees, of whom 154 are fully accredited librarians, plus volunteers. The system has 2 bookmobiles. The annual expenditures {{for the library}} collection totals $8,000,000. It was found that thirty-five percent of all <b>check-outs</b> are children's materials. [...] In 2005, CML had 8.4 million visits and loaned out 16.5 million items.|$|R
50|$|Revision {{control systems}} are often centralized, {{with a single}} {{authoritative}} data store, the repository, and <b>check-outs</b> and check-ins done with reference to this central repository. Alternatively, in distributed revision control, no single repository is authoritative, and data can be checked out and checked into any repository. When checking into a different repository, this is interpreted as a merge or patch.|$|R
25|$|To cut costs, {{customers}} unload bulkier products directly off a pallet. Some items, like produce, {{are priced}} per item instead of by weight. For {{items that are}} still sold by weight, the customers weigh, barcode, and tag those items {{before they reach the}} <b>check-out</b> counter. Unlike the regular stores, the 365 stores offer a rewards program.|$|E
25|$|A {{shopping}} cart is a metal or plastic basket on wheels supplied by a shop, especially a supermarket, {{for use by}} customers inside the shop for transport of merchandise to the <b>check-out</b> counter during shopping. Often, customers are allowed to leave the carts in the parking lot, and store personnel return the carts to the shop. The first {{shopping cart}} was invented by Sylvan Goldman in 1937, owner of the Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain in Oklahoma City.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} from Hammond & Anderson {{that the first}} {{printing}} appeared on March 1, 1938. A library copy of the third printing has been seen with a <b>check-out</b> date of November 28, 1938. If we accept, then, that the first edition consisted of multiple runs on the evidence of emendations to the text block, the most surprising fact arising out of the dating {{is that the first}} three printings appeared within nine months of each other. It is not known whether a planned larger, single run was shortened and broken up for the corrections, or whether demand was simply strong enough to warrant new runs with corrections made opportunistically.|$|E
5000|$|Mobile {{advertising}} DASH7 {{is being}} developed for [...] "smart" [...] billboards and kiosks, likewise [...] "smart" [...] posters that can be ready from many meters (or even kilometers) away, creating new opportunities for both tracking the effectiveness of advertising spend but also creating new e-commerce opportunities. DASH7's potential to automate check-ins and <b>check-outs</b> provides essential infrastructure to location-based advertising and promotions ...|$|R
30|$|The results {{related to}} the {{electronic}} kiosk were unexpected, given college students’ proclivity to use SSTs such as self <b>check-outs</b> in retail settings (Dean, 2008). A managerial implication of this finding is that electronic kiosks in the exterior store environment may provide limited, if any, return on investment {{in the context of}} the university-branded merchandise store. Additional research may confirm this initial conclusion, as limited work has explored this topic.|$|R
50|$|The library also {{consists}} of the Grinton I. Will branch and the Crestwood branch. All three libraries {{offer a variety of}} services, including computer and internet access, movie, audio book and CD <b>check-outs,</b> as well as traditional book loans. The library offers free computer classes, from beginner to advanced, and is a source of free public programming all year round, including concerts and movies, classes, homework help, research help and informational workshops.|$|R
25|$|Proudfoot {{was born}} in Crook, County Durham where his father was manager of the local Broughs grocery shop. Broughs was a family-owned grocery chain serving Northern England. It was a British pioneer of the {{self-service}} model whereby customers took goods from open shelves and paid for them at a <b>check-out</b> desk rather than being served at a counter. Proudfoot (senior) held a temporary commission and had won the Military Cross while serving in the British army during the First World War. The older Proudfoot had political ambitions but these were restrained by Broughs who refused {{to allow him to}} stand as a Conservative candidate in local council elections.|$|E
25|$|Although {{users of}} such systems {{generally}} pay to use vehicles {{that they themselves}} do not own, sharing systems differ from traditional for-profit bike rental businesses. The first bike sharing projects were largely initiated by local community organisations, either as charitable projects intended for the disadvantaged, or to promote bicycles as a non-polluting form of transport. In recent years, {{in an effort to}} reduce losses from theft and vandalism, many bike-sharing schemes now require a user to provide a monetary deposit or other security, or to become a paid subscriber. Most large-scale urban bike sharing programmes utilise numerous bike <b>check-out</b> stations, and operate much like public transit systems, catering to tourists and visitors as well as local residents. Some bike-sharing systems are completely free like Aarhus in Denmark.|$|E
25|$|According to Ziethaml et al., layout affects {{how easy}} or {{difficult}} it is to navigate through a system. Signs and symbols provide cues for directional navigation and also inform about appropriate behaviour within a store. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the goals of the customer. For instance, in the case of supermarkets, the customer's goal may be to minimise {{the amount of time spent}} finding items and waiting at the <b>check-out,</b> while a customer in a retail mall may wish to spend more time exploring the range of stores and merchandise. With respect to functionality of layout, retail designers consider three key issues; circulation– design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination– design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience– design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees.|$|E
5000|$|In {{areas where}} the EMS charges a fee, lower income {{clientele}} lacking health insurance may have a reluctance to call for an ambulance unless the evidence of urgency is overwhelming. A volunteer service, with less overhead costs, tends to reduce that reluctance. Hatzolah will often handle [...] "check-out" [...] cases, without charge. In this way, the true emergencies among those <b>check-outs</b> may be recognized and treated quickly, where the caller might have otherwise not sought treatment.|$|R
5000|$|The team often {{recruited}} {{students through}} flyers {{and across the}} players' friends throughout college campuses across the country. The team tested potential members {{to find out if}} they were suitable candidates and, if they were, the team thoroughly trained the new members for free. Fully trained players had to pass an intense [...] "trial by fire," [...] consisting of playing through 8 six-deck shoes with almost perfect play, and then undergo further training, supervision, and similar <b>check-outs</b> in actual casino play until they could become full stakes players.|$|R
25|$|The {{squadron}} had between 22 and 27 airframes while {{operating the}} Thunderjets. It was originally set to provide interception, but from 1 November 1954 it was remissioned {{to become an}} operational training unit. All F-84G <b>check-outs</b> were {{carried out in the}} 330 Sqn, and the instructor pilots received twice the flight hours as their colleagues in other squadrons. Between the training courses the squadron practised bombing at Sola Air Station and participated in exercises. The 330 Sqn moved to Rygge Air Station on 28 August 1956. Following the retirement of the F-84G and the introduction of the North American F-86F Sabre, the 330 Sqn was deactivated on 5 July 1958.|$|R
25|$|Advantages of {{long-term}} use include rider {{familiarity with the}} bicycle and a mode of travel that is always nearby and instantly ready for use. The bicycle can be checked out like a library book, a liability waiver can be collected at <b>check-out,</b> and the bike can be returned any time. A Library Bike in a person's possession can be chosen for some trips instead of a car, thus lowering car usage. The long-term rental system generally results in fewer repair costs to the scheme administrator, as riders are incentivised to obtain minor maintenance {{in order to keep}} the bike in running order during the long rental period. Most of the long-term systems implemented to date are funded solely through charitable donations of second-hand bicycles, using unpaid volunteer labour to maintain, and administer the bicycle fleet. While reducing or eliminating the need for public funding, such a scheme imposes an outer limit to program expansion. The Arcata Bike Library, in California, has loaned over 4000 bicycles using this system.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Zack's character {{has generally been}} positive. In IGN's 2008 list of Final Fantasy VII top ten characters list, Zack made sixth place, with IGN's Dave Smith noting that [...] "his <b>check-out</b> scene in Crisis Core is just about as epic as it gets in videogames." [...] In 2010, Famitsu readers voted Zack as the 37th most popular video game character in Japan. GamesRadar's Jim Sterling found Zack {{to be one of}} video game's most sexually appealing male characters due to his personality and look. In 2013, Complex ranked Zack as the 18th greatest Final Fantasy character of all time, as well as the sixth greatest soldier in video games.|$|E
500|$|Carol Swiderski of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that}} {{although}} saying [...] "have a nice day" [...] {{may not be}} sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there. She argued [...] "ave we become so analytic that we can't accept these little niceties without asking ourselves, 'Did he really mean it? Does she really care if I have a nice day?'" [...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a <b>check-out</b> line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you have a nice day, too" [...] because she hoped that when {{a sufficient number of}} people do this, there could be a time when people will sincerely intend it.|$|E
40|$|Methodological {{problems}} of violations detection under the Moscow government procurement are expounded. The great {{attention is paid}} to a qualification of these violations in compliance with the requirements of the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation. The authors conduct the research of common violations in Moscow government order and their causes. The consequences of these violations for Moscow budget are detected. A differentiated approach to estimation of administrative offences according the social danger of committed offence in government order is offered. An exercise of supervisory powers using scheduled, unscheduled <b>check-outs</b> (on the ground of appeals, complaints and the others) and administrative proceedings is considered...|$|R

5000|$|Seed {{libraries}} may {{function as}} programs of public libraries, {{such as the}} programs of the Richmond Public Library in California (the [...] "Richmond Grows" [...] program is the [...] "unofficial spiritual center of the library seed library movement") and the New Port Richey Public Library (Florida). Seed library initiatives in public libraries garner patron participation as a novelty supplement to book <b>check-outs.</b> Seed packets are usually located next to everyday circulated items like books, audiobooks, CDs, and DVDs. Seed libraries in public libraries have been successful because they catch patron hobby curiosities. Public libraries are an appropriate space for seed libraries because they make seeds and plants available to everyone.|$|R
500|$|In 1924, Bonner Park {{was created}} out of John L. Bonner's estate near the university. The park today has {{multiple}} athletic fields and courts in addition a band shell {{used by the}} Missoula City band through the summer. The Kiwanis club set up a park downtown in 1934, making Kiwanis Park {{the first of a}} string of parks which line both sides of the Clark Fork River. One of those parks on the southern bank of the river is McCormick Park, which was created with WPA funds out of surplus highway land, a parcel from the American Hide and Fur Company, and land donated from the Kate McCormick estate. The [...] park, named for Washington J. McCormick and his wife is home to a skate park, aquatics center, a free bike <b>check-out</b> and a children's fishing pond.

2500|$|Williams gave generously {{to those}} in need. He was {{especially}} linked with the Jimmy Fund of the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, which provides support for children's cancer research and treatment. Williams used his celebrity to virtually launch the fund, which raised more that $750 million between 1948 and 2010. Throughout his career, Williams made countless bedside visits to children being treated for cancer, which Williams insisted go unreported. Often, parents of sick children would learn at <b>check-out</b> time that [...] "Mr. Williams has taken care of your bill." [...] The Fund recently stated that, [...] "Williams would travel everywhere and anywhere, no strings or paychecks attached, to support the cause...

25|$|The 300 Sqn's first Albatross {{landed in}} February 1962 and the unit was {{activated}} at Sola Air Station on 1 March. Delivery {{of the final}} aircraft took place in late 1963. The 330 Sqn was designated the operational training unit and all <b>check-outs</b> took place at Sola for both squadrons. From late 1962 a detachment was established at Bardufoss Air Station with one aircraft and one crew. The 330 Sqn was declared operative from 15 July 1963. The detachment was a strain on the unit's moral and its commanded asked his subordinates to withdraw it {{and replace it with}} a mobilized unit. The resources used to support the detachment made the 330 Sqn almost unable to provide sweeping operations.|$|R
25|$|In 1946 the Teeters {{moved from}} {{downtown}} {{to a much}} larger location {{to keep up with}} demand. The Teeters were leaders in installing the first automated doors and <b>check-outs</b> in North Carolina. In July 1953, the Teeters opened their second store in Lincolnton, North Carolina. At this point the Teeters had become a household name. Lines of eager shoppers wrapped around the new store in anticipation of being one of the first customers in the Teeters' new store. The Teeters' success continued to grow and by 1957 their third store opened in Newton, North Carolina, a fourth in Cornelius, a fifth in Hickory, and a sixth opened in Morganton, North Carolina, in November 1958.|$|R
