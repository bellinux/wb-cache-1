40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess indices of proteolysis and related enzymatic activities of various cheese varieties produced in Greece. Physicochemical composition, extent of proteolysis (nitrogen fraction and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) profiles of cheese soluble fraction) and residual chymosin and plasmin activities were analyzed in 57 commercial samples, grouped according to cheesemaking technologies. The mean values of soluble nitrogen fraction on total nitrogen and trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen fraction on total nitrogen did not differ significantly between the different cheese varieties, with mean values of 16. 03 % and 9. 97 %, respectively. Brined cheeses had the highest mean residual chymosin activity 0. 166 International Milk Clotting units (IMCU). g(- 1) of <b>cheese</b> <b>dry</b> matter and the lowest mean plasmin plus plasminogen-derived activity 3. 88 U. g(- 1) of cheese.
