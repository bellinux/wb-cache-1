40|$|Post-cut enzymatic {{browning}} {{of apples}} {{is a very}} important issue for the fresh-cut industry because of its negative impact on the appearance and quality of processed product. The rate and intensity of enzymatic browning are affected by several pre-, post-harvest and handling factors. The objectives of the present study were to assess browning propensity of 8 advanced and semi-advanced apple lines (Table 1) compared to 4 named varieties. Browning intensity of cut apple surface was evaluated subjectively using visual assessment and objectively using a <b>chromatometer.</b> There were significant differences between the tested genotypes fo...|$|E
40|$|Color and {{sorption}} {{characteristics of}} osmotically treated and air dried apple and banana were studied during air drying at 70 degrees C. The color parameters: Lightness (L), Redness (a) and Yellowness (b) were studied, using a Hunter Lab <b>chromatometer.</b> ii first order kinetic model was fitted {{to the experimental}} data adequately for color parameters, while sorption data for treated and air dried products were fitted to the GAB model. Untreated fruits showed an extensive browning which was monitored by a significant drop of the lightness (L) and an increase of redness (a) and yellowness (b). Osmotically pretreated samples did not brown {{as much as the}} untreated samples and the lightness L decreased only slightly while a, b increased slightly. Osmotic pretreatment resulted in a shift in sorption isotherm for both fruits. Osmotic dehydration prevented color damages and decreased the sorption capacity of dehydrated products...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pretreatment}} on color of convective dried products (namely apple, banana, potato and carrot) was investigated. Five {{different types of}} pretreatment were taken into consideration; microwave, osmotic, sulfite, water blanching and steam blanching. Color characteristics were identified by measuring the color parameters (namely, Lightness (L), Redness (a) and Yellowness (b)) using a Hunter Lab <b>chromatometer.</b> The type of pretreatment was found to significantly affect the three color parameters. In addition, Redness (a) and Yellowness (b) were found to follow a first order kinetic model. Untreated dried materials showed an extensive browning, indicated by a significant drop of the L parameter and a corresponding increase of a, b parameters. Osmotically and microwave pretreated samples supressed browning compared to the untreated samples. In this case, lightness decreased slightly, while a, b increased slightly. Sulfite pretreatment prevented significantly color deterioration, while water and steam blanching also prevented enzymatic browning during convective drying...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that an optimum method of drying fruit could be designed. The effect of the method used for drying on colour of apple, banana, potato and carrot was investigated for five different methods of drying: conventional, vacuum, microwave, freeze and osmotic drying. Colour characteristics were studied by measuring lightness (L), redness (a) and yellowness (b) using a Hunter Lab <b>chromatometer.</b> The method used to dry the material was found to significantly affect the three colour parameters. The changes in redness (a) and yellowness (b) were found to follow a first order kinetic model. Air-, vacuum- and microwave-dried materials caused extensive browning in the fruits and vegetables, this was manifested by a significant drop of the L parameter and an increase of the a and b parameters. Osmotically pretreated samples did not brown {{as much as the}} untreated samples and the value for lightness (L) decreased only slightly while a and b increased slightly. Freeze drying seems to prevent colour changes, resulting in products with improved colour characteristics...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of a biosynthetic cellulose wound dressing (BWD) to stimulate wound healing in patients with a venous leg ulcer on periulcer skin condition when compared with standard care using a foam dressing. METHODS: Each patient with a venous ulcer received compression therapy with a short stretch bandage system and either a BWD + foam (study group [SG]) or foam (control group [CG]). Periulcer skin condition was compared with the untreated lower leg skin and the forearm skin, using noninvasive parameters, comparing day 0 versus day 28 results. Ulcers were further evaluated for healing rate. The study period was 28 days, and the follow-up period was 12 weeks. Fifty patients were recruited to the study, of which N = 46 (SG, n = 26; CG, n = 20) completed the 28 -day study period and were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The BWD showed a more improved periulcer skin condition versus the CG. Transepidermal water loss was significantly less in the SG (P =. 003), as well as the results shown with the <b>chromatometer</b> (P =. 05). Ulcer healing rate was also statistically significant in favor of the SG (P =. 0001). CONCLUSION: Treatment for the BWD + foam group was shown to be safe and significantly improved periwound skin condition, leading to more expeditious wound healing than treatment with foam alone.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the nutritional composition of the pulps of the green stages of fruits of two FHIA hybrids (FHIA- 21 and FHIA- 03) in Ghana. Fresh fruits were harvested from the plantain orchard of the Crops Research Institute in Kumasi, Ghana. The standard Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods were used to determine the moisture, crude protein, ash, crude fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, carbohydrate, sodium and crude fat. Pulp colour was measured with a <b>Chromatometer</b> (Minolta). The data was subjected to student t-test analysis. The results showed that the nutritional composition of the hybrids were similar to the local landrace. The hybrids however had higher fat content (1. 94 %) for FHIA- 21 and (1. 66 %) for FHIA- 03 compared to triploid plantains. The hybrids were slightly soft due to the high moisture content. There was a significant difference (p> 0. 05) in the potassium content between FHIA- 03 and FHIA- 21 (1060 mg/ 100 g dry weight for FHIA- 21 and 1725 mg/ 100 g dry weight for FHIA- 03) compared to reported values. This could be due to the soil and agronomic practices. The pulp colours of the hybrids were orange for FHIA- 21 and white to creamy for FHIA- 03 showing the physiological maturity of the fruits. The bright orange pulp colour of FHIA- 21 was indicative of the presence of provitamins and carotenoids. The high potassium level in the hybrid may be an advantage over the local for use as a therapy. The tetraploid hybrids (FHIA- 21 and FHIA- 03) could be described as high energy yielding carbohydrates...|$|E
40|$|The agronomic, {{nutritional}} {{composition of the}} green stages of fruit and the consumer acceptance of FHIA- 21 (tetraploid hybrid plantain) from Honduran Agricultural Research Foundation was conducted in the forest region of Ghana. The standard AOAC methods {{were used to determine}} the moisture, crude protein, ash, crude fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, carbohydrate, sodium and crude fat. Pulp colour was measured with a <b>Chromatometer.</b> Results on the agronomy indicated that the hybrid was very tolerant to the black Sigatoka disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. The crop cycle was comparable to that of False Horn plantains. The yield performance of the hybrid was high ranging from 34 - 38 t ha- 1 across the locations. The yield values have been stable over the three-year study period. In addition, the FHIA hybrid plants were relatively short. The physio-chemical composition results showed that the hybrid had high fat (1. 94 %) and water (60 %) contents. The potassium content was also high (1060 mg/ 100 g dry weight) however, the iron content (0. 45 mg/ 100 g dry weight) was low. The high potassium level in the hybrid may be an advantage for use as a therapy. The tetraploid hybrid had bright orange pulp colour which was indicative of the presence of provitamins and carotenoids. The consumer acceptability results revealed that FHIA- 21 compared favourably with the local triploid (Apem). The hybrid was accepted for ampesi, fufu and ripe fried plantain. However acceptability of the hybrid as ripe fried plantain was at ripening stages 3 and 4. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrid could only be used for processed (mashed) food recipes...|$|E
