5|$|A {{combination}} of genetic {{and environmental factors}} {{play a role in}} the development of schizophrenia. People with a family history of schizophrenia who have a transient psychosis have a 20–40% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> diagnosed one year later.|$|E
5|$|Zebras and {{wildebeest}} group {{together in}} open savannah environments with high chances of predation. This grouping strategy reduces predation risk because larger groups decrease each individual’s <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> hunted, and predators {{are more easily}} seen in open areas. The seasonal presence of thousands of migratory wildebeests reduces local lion predation on giraffe calves, resulting in greater survival of giraffes.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> caught in a collision and falling.|$|E

5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} insects in the Amazon basin, and especially the butterflies. He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> attacked by a predator, in the process now called after him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path {{to remain on}} a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Jovanovski {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman. Able to {{contribute}} offensively, he is an adept puck-carrier and joins plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He plays defence physically, bodychecking opponents primarily with his shoulder. In both aspects of his game, he is considered to play {{with a high level of}} risk, taking the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> out of position in favour of a good scoring chance or a hit.|$|E

5|$|The Burgess Shale {{animals were}} {{probably}} killed {{by changes in}} their environment either immediately preceding or during the mud-slides that buried them. Proposed killing mechanisms include: changes in salinity; poisoning by chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide or methane; changes in the availability of oxygen; and changing consistency of the sea floor. The death event was not necessarily related to the burial, and {{there may have been}} multiple death events between burial events; but only organisms killed immediately before a burial event would stand any <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> fossilised, instead of rotting or being eaten.|$|E
5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> rejected.|$|E
5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a better <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E

5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, {{absentee ballot}}s were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 absentee ballots {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E
5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk {{is likely to be}} long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E

5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E
5|$|In its {{study of}} 2012 FBI Uniform Crime Reports, {{national}} realtor Movoto LLC assessed Briarcliff Manor as the second-safest municipality in New York, with the second-lowest crime {{rate in the}} state. According to the FBI reports, the village had no reported violent crimes in 2012 and a resident had a 1-in-569 <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a crime victim. In 2014, security system company Safe Choice Security used the same data and assessed Briarcliff Manor as the safest municipality in New York. A SafeWise report in 2016 using 2014 FBI data assessed the village as the third safest in New York.|$|E
5|$|After reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a hurricane in the eastern Atlantic, the Weather Bureau warned shipping lanes in the storm's path. Small craft warnings were issued for offshore areas from Block Island, Rhode Island south to Savannah, Georgia on September7 due to the threat of rough seas. After Carrie stalled on September11, the Weather Bureau gave Florida a slight <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> affected by the storm, but the possibilities of the storm affecting the peninsula decreased after the hurricane curved northwards. After the storm was forecast to potentially impact Bermuda, schools were closed in preparation for Carrie, while vessels were warned of the oncoming hurricane. Most planes in Kindley Air Force Base on the island were evacuated, with the remaining planes weighted down by sandbags. After passing Bermuda, the storm was forecast to strike Nova Scotia, but instead Carrie curved towards the northeast.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Sir Norman Brook {{attempted}} to have Gowing {{retained in the}} Cabinet Office as the permanent historian, but was stymied by the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission. In 1951, she was told {{that she had no}} <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> appointed to the grade of Principal, which would have carried retirement benefits with it. She later said that her years at the Cabinet Office were the happiest of her life, but she began looking for another position. In 1955, she applied for a chair in economic history at Oxford, and for a position as a reader at LSE, but was unsuccessful. Sir Norman exploited various administrative loopholes to allow her to be retained at the Cabinet Office, and was prepared to make her the Cabinet Office Archivist, but he could not offer her a pension.|$|E
5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones {{to the floor of the}} cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} {{makes all}} decisions by itself {{to lessen the}} <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed Internet access, and vice versa for malicious applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit malicious behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from Internet access. All malware was blocked by the firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were blocked by the intrusion prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed. Disabling Windows services {{had no effect on}} the firewall since it works at the kernel driver level. This version automatically adjusts configuration for different networks based on the physical address of the gateway rather than IP addresses.|$|E
