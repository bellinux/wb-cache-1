5|$|The highway through Imperial Valley was {{originally}} a plank road made {{of pieces of}} wood that were tied together. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915. Following this, US80 was built through the valley as the main east–west route. Plans for a new freeway across the southernmost reaches of California date from before 1950. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, {{at a cost of}} $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built. In 1957, the City of El <b>Centro</b> expressed a desire for the new freeway to replace US80 to be routed along the southern limits of the city. Caltrans engineer Jacob Dekema stated {{at the time that the}} four-lane freeway would not be constructed on the US80 routing due to possible expansion of the Naval Air Facility El <b>Centro.</b>|$|E
