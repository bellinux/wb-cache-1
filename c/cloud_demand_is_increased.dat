The acceptance of <b>cloud</b> computing <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> gradually <b>increasing</b> {{over the years}} and the development of the global market is regularly rising. Security is the major issue often arising and is questioned by users that results in migration of data from one cloud provider to the other. Various cloud storage systems survive presently, but many of existing fails to ensure security during data migration. This lack of security support holds a major problem for the acceptance of cloud computing, more specifically for organization and IT infrastructure. In order to addresses security issue during data migration, this paper presents Cloud-validation, a secure storage system exclusively meant for the cloud. The proposed Cloud-validation based Flexible Distributed (CFD) scheme detects security breaches like integrity, confidentiality. Hence, cloud-validation based flexible distributed scheme efforts wide possibility to allow users to detect and prove cloud misbehavior based on cryptographic implements. The cryptographic implements involve simulcast encryption and signature looping. Simulcast encryption allows a migration to encrypt message to a random subset of a set of users. Signature looping is the process of generating consecutive signatures from an initial signature and a secret head signature. The exchange of the cloud-validations secures the process of data migration. The validations are key elements that permit the users to verify cloud misbehavior and the cloud service providers to defend against the violations. Experimental evaluation proves CFD is high level of access control with cloud-validation in terms of data integrity, confidentiality and validity...|$|R

40|$|In 1989, the Forrestal Building, {{headquarters}} for the U. S. Department of Energy, was chosen for a major lighting retrofit project. The project replaced the aging fighting system newer, energy-efficient fixtures. Pacific Northwest Laboratory conducted a three-part monitoring study at the Forrestal Building to (1) characterize building energy use, (2) empirically measure savings realized by the lighting retrofit, and (3) determine the persistence of energy savings. This report summarizes {{the findings from the}} third and final monitoring phase. Two data loggers were left installed at the Forrestal Building and data were collected for a 12 -month period after the lighting retrofit was completed. An analysis-of-variance test indicated that the mean monthly lighting <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasing.</b> A regression analysis performed on the data indicated that the mean monthly lighting <b>demand</b> for workdays <b>is</b> <b>increasing</b> at a rate of 0. 3652 {+-} 0. 1101 kW/mo.

During the same period, workday mean monthly plug load demand increased 0. 0912 {+-} 0. 0275 kW/mo., while nonworkday plug loads decreased slightly. The gradual <b>increase,</b> though significant, <b>is</b> reduced when compared to the 56 % savings recorded after the lighting retrofit.
