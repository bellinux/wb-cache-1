5|$|By Sesame Streets 40th anniversary, it {{was ranked}} the fifteenth most popular children's show on television. When the show premiered in 1969, 130 episodes a year were produced; in 2009, because of rising costs, twenty-six episodes were made. In 2000, the Children's Television Workshop, which had {{changed its name}} to the Sesame Workshop (SW) in June 2000 to better reflect its entry into non-television and {{interactive}} media, launched a website with a library of free video <b>clips</b> <b>and</b> free podcasts from throughout the show's history. The 2008–2009 recession, which led to budget cuts for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected Sesame Street; in spring 2009, the SW had to lay off 20% of its staff.|$|E
5|$|The art was {{developed}} by Paul Drummond, Kevin Preston, Maria Drummond, Jeff Wall, and Karen Pinchin. This team were based at a studio in Manchester, rather than Birmingham, the central studio. Their work included character animations, developed in Autodesk Animator using its language POCO, which the graphics tools were built in. The artwork (including the sprites) was made as a selection of <b>clips,</b> <b>and</b> a final image was formed by pasting them together. The ability to use clips in multiple locations, and the colour information being stored separately and used on an as--needed basis meant that the art took much less space than was usual. The background artwork was sketched in black and white, and then scanned into a computer and colourised. The music is credited to Media Sorcery.|$|E
5|$|The rich art {{elaborated}} by the Muisca {{has inspired}} modern artists and designers in their creativity. Muisca motives are represented as murals, in clothing and as objects found {{all over the}} former Muisca territories {{as well as in}} animated <b>clips</b> <b>and</b> video games. The art of the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense is well studied by many different researchers who published their work right from the beginning of colonial times. The conquistador who made first contact with the Muisca, Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, wrote in his memoires about a skilled and well-organised civilisation of traders and farmers. Friar Pedro Simón described the relation between art and the religion and later contributions in the analysis of the various artforms have been made by Alexander von Humboldt, Joaquín Acosta and Liborio Zerda in the 19th century, Miguel Triana, Eliécer Silva Celis and Sylvia M. Broadbent in the 20th century and modern research is dominated by the work of Carl Henrik Langebaek Rueda, Javier Ocampo López and many others.|$|E

5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street <b>clips</b> <b>and</b> a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Volition {{aimed for}} a quality release, {{and promised to}} deliver a product without major bugs. Minor bugs would be fixed in a prompt manner. The shipped game, however, had {{deficiencies}} admitted by the team, such as problems with the multiplayer code, and a few design issues. The game underwent four patches, which resolved most of the bugs, and improved the multiplayer performance. Complaints about an online mission giving unfair scores led to Volition removing the mission from scoring play. Another patch allowed EAX capability to be enabled for Creative Sound Blaster sound cards. Interplay played its part in drumming up the community's interest by holding contests, and expanding material for the FreeSpace universe. Meanwhile, Volition created official star maps, and released Vasudan voice <b>clips</b> <b>and</b> story development notes. Interplay hired science-fiction writers such as Fred Saberhagen, Simon Hawke, and Jeff Grubb to write weekly FreeSpace stories for two months. Preparing for Silent Threats release, Interplay held a contest from July 28 to August 25, 1998, in which the submitted fan-designed missions could win their authors prizes such as free copies of Silent Threat, FreeSpace apparel, and gaming hardware. Entries were judged by a panel from PC Gamer, and qualified entries constituted half of the missions in Silent Threat.|$|E

40|$|Artemisia is {{the major}} {{component}} of the vegetation of {{a large portion of}} arid lands in Iran. Determining the utilization rate is an essential element in the management of these rangelands. Methods of determining the utilization regime for woody plants <b>and</b> shrubs include <b>clipping</b> <b>and</b> weighing, reference unit, ocular estimate, twig length, branch diameter and production index. These methods were used in Chahlor winter range in Jarghoyeh, 250 Km southeast of Isfahan. <b>Clipping</b> <b>and</b> weighing is the most accurate although the most time-consuming method. In this research, means of utilization percentages obtained from the above methods were compared with the mean obtained from the <b>clipping</b> <b>and</b> weighing method using T-test.
