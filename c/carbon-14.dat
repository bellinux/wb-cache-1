5|$|<b>Carbon-14</b> {{is formed}} in upper {{layers of the}} {{troposphere}} and the stratosphere at altitudes of 9–15km by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic rays. Thermal neutrons are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen-14, forming <b>carbon-14</b> and a proton. As such, 1.2 × 1010% of atmospheric carbon dioxide contains <b>carbon-14.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, the {{graphite}} reactor {{became the}} first facility {{in the world to}} produce radioactive isotopes for peacetime use. On August 2, 1946, Oak Ridge National Laboratory director Eugene Wigner presented a small container of <b>carbon-14</b> to the director of the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital, for medical use at the hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Subsequent shipments of radioisotopes, primarily iodine-131, phosphorus-32, <b>carbon-14,</b> and molybdenum-99/technetium-99m, were for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses.|$|E

5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits {{may be the}} consequence of the Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates into the lake. In addition, discrepancies between shell and other organic material ages can reach 400–800 years owing to old carbon; shells can also absorb <b>carbon-14</b> from the air. Other research has documented no substantial old carbon effects.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Libby {{accepted}} professorship at the University of Chicago's Institute for Nuclear Studies, {{where he}} developed the technique for dating organic compounds using <b>carbon-14.</b> He also discovered that tritium similarly {{could be used for}} dating water, and therefore wine. In 1950, he {{became a member of the}} General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He was appointed a commissioner in 1954, becoming its sole scientist. He sided with Edward Teller on pursuing a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, participated in the Atoms for Peace program, and defended the administration's atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{after he}} unsuccessfully {{applied for a}} job with Canada's National Research Council, the University of Chicago {{accepted}} him as a research associate. There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first cyclotron in the midwestern United States. The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans, {{the head of the}} university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon (<b>carbon-14</b> and carbon-11) from the cyclotron. While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to demonstrate that plant cells had the capacity to use carbon dioxide for carbohydrate synthesis, through carbon fixation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carbon-14</b> (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{claim that}} {{evolution}} relies on {{certain types of}} evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, {{it is argued that}} radiometric dating technique of evaluating a material's age based on the radioactive decay rates of certain isotopes generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. Radiocarbon dating based on the <b>carbon-14</b> isotope has been particularly criticized. It is argued that radiometric decay relies on a number of unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of uniformitarianism, consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as closed systems. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{has survived}} {{for so long}} due to {{vegetative}} cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but {{it is part of}} an older root system that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree may die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by <b>carbon-14</b> dating of the root system, which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.|$|E
25|$|One side-effect of {{the change}} in {{atmospheric}} <b>carbon-14</b> is that this has enabled some options (e.g., bomb-pulse dating) for determining the birth year of an individual, in particular, the amount of <b>carbon-14</b> in tooth enamel, or the <b>carbon-14</b> concentration in the lens of the eye.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{naturally}} occurring isotopes of carbon on Earth: 99% {{of the carbon}} is carbon-12, 1% is carbon-13, and <b>carbon-14</b> occurs in trace amounts, i.e., making up about 1 or 1.5 atoms per 1012 atoms of the carbon in the atmosphere. Carbon-12 and carbon-13 are both stable, while the half-life of <b>carbon-14</b> is 5,730±40 years. <b>Carbon-14</b> decays into nitrogen-14 through beta decay. A gram of carbon containing 1 atom of <b>carbon-14</b> per 1012 atoms will emit 0.2 beta particles per second. The primary natural source of <b>carbon-14</b> on Earth is cosmic ray action on nitrogen in the atmosphere, and it is therefore a cosmogenic nuclide. However, open-air nuclear testing between 1955–1980 contributed to this pool.|$|E
25|$|By {{emitting}} {{an electron}} and an electron antineutrino, {{one of the}} neutrons in the <b>carbon-14</b> atom decays to a proton and the <b>carbon-14</b> (half-life of 5700 ± 40 years) decays into the stable (non-radioactive) isotope nitrogen-14.|$|E
25|$|Radiocarbon dating is {{a dating}} method {{that uses the}} {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope <b>carbon-14</b> (14C) to determine the age of carbonaceous materials up to about 60,000 years. In 1949, Willard F. Libby invented the procedure for <b>carbon-14</b> dating.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbon-14</b> {{may also}} be {{produced}} by lightning bolts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbon-14</b> is {{produced}} in coolant at boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors (PWRs). It is typically released to {{the atmosphere in the}} form of carbon dioxide at BWRs, and methane at PWRs. Best practice for nuclear power plant operator management of <b>carbon-14</b> includes releasing it at night, when plants are not photosynthesizing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbon-14</b> {{may also}} be radiogenic (cluster decay of 223Ra, 224Ra, 226Ra). However, this origin is {{extremely}} rare.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{similar to}} hydrocodone, differing {{only in that}} it has a {{hydroxyl}} group at <b>carbon-14.</b>|$|E
25|$|This transmethylation {{mechanism}} {{has been}} repeatedly and consistently proven by radiolabeling of SAM methyl group with <b>carbon-14</b> (14C-CH3)SAM).|$|E
25|$|The {{inventory}} of <b>carbon-14</b> in Earth's biosphere is about 300 megacuries (11EBq), of which most {{is in the}} oceans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbon-14,</b> 14C, or radiocarbon, is a {{radioactive}} isotope of carbon with an atomic nucleus containing 6 protons and 8 neutrons. Its presence in organic materials {{is the basis}} of the radiocarbon dating method pioneered by Willard Libby and colleagues (1949) to date archaeological, geological and hydrogeological samples. <b>Carbon-14</b> was discovered on February 27, 1940, by Martin Kamen and Sam Ruben at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California. Its existence had been suggested by Franz Kurie in 1934.|$|E
25|$|New <b>carbon-14</b> dating in 2013 has {{revealed}} that the second stage started around 500 AD, and the oldest fortifications are even older than that.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Tyrrhenian {{is defined}} as exactly 10,000 <b>Carbon-14</b> years before the present (0.01143 +/- 0.00013 mya), which is near {{to the end of}} the Younger Dryas cold spell.|$|E
25|$|Pictorial {{evidence}} {{dating from}} c. 1690 and 1842 {{indicates that the}} corner used for the dating and several similar evenly spaced areas along one edge of the cloth were handled each time the cloth was displayed, the traditional method being {{for it to be}} held suspended by a row of five bishops. Others contend that repeated handling of this kind greatly increased the likelihood of contamination by bacteria and bacterial residue compared to the newly discovered archaeological specimens for which <b>carbon-14</b> dating was developed. Bacteria and associated residue (bacteria by-products and dead bacteria) carry additional <b>carbon-14</b> that would skew the radiocarbon date toward the present.|$|E
25|$|Does not use {{solvents}} containing {{hydrogen and}} carbon, which are neutron moderators creating risk of criticality accidents and can absorb the {{fission product tritium}} and the activation product <b>carbon-14</b> in dilute solutions that cannot be separated later.|$|E
25|$|Previous <b>carbon-14</b> dating dated some of {{the early}} constructions to {{the second half of the}} 7th century, and {{dendrochronology}} also suggests that the examined constructions began not very long after 737, a few decades before the reign of king Gudfred.|$|E
25|$|The {{above-ground}} {{nuclear tests}} {{that occurred in}} several countries between 1955 and 1980 (see nuclear test list) dramatically increased the amount of <b>carbon-14</b> in the atmosphere and subsequently in the biosphere; after the tests ended, the atmospheric concentration of the isotope began to decrease.|$|E
25|$|Cosmic rays {{also cause}} {{elemental}} transmutation in the atmosphere, in which secondary radiation {{generated by the}} cosmic rays combines with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere to generate different nuclides. Many so-called cosmogenic nuclides can be produced, but probably the most notable is <b>carbon-14,</b> which is produced by interactions with nitrogen atoms. These cosmogenic nuclides eventually reach the Earth's surface and {{can be incorporated into}} living organisms. The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years. The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short half-life of <b>carbon-14</b> are the principles used in radiocarbon dating of ancient biological materials, such as wooden artifacts or human remains.|$|E
25|$|Cosmic rays {{kept the}} level of <b>carbon-14</b> in the {{atmosphere}} roughly constant (70 tons) {{for at least the}} past 100,000 years, until the beginning of above-ground nuclear weapons testing in the early 1950s. This is an important fact used in radiocarbon dating used in archaeology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbon-14</b> {{can also}} be {{produced}} by other neutron reactions, including in particular 13C(n,γ)14C and 17O(n,α)14C with thermal neutrons, and 15N(n,d)14C and 16O(n,3He)14C with fast neutrons. The most notable routes for 14C production by thermal neutron irradiation of targets (e.g., in a nuclear reactor) are summarized in the table.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} isotopes {{of carbon}} {{do not differ}} appreciably in their chemical properties. This resemblance is used in chemical and biological research, in a technique called carbon labeling: <b>carbon-14</b> atoms {{can be used to}} replace nonradioactive carbon, in order to trace chemical and biochemical reactions involving carbon atoms from any given organic compound.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} {{neutrons}} on stable isotopes can form radioisotopes, for instance the neutron bombardment (neutron activation) of nitrogen-14 forms <b>carbon-14.</b> This radioisotope can {{be released from}} the nuclear fuel cycle; this is the radioisotope responsible {{for the majority of}} the dose experienced by the population as a result of the activities of the nuclear power industry.|$|E
25|$|The first Danevirke {{was built}} in five stages, {{starting}} about 650, according to <b>carbon-14</b> dating. The first three stages were simple ramparts of soil, and the fourth stage was a palisade rampart with heavy timber front, built in 737. In the final stages the timber palisade was reinforced with a heavy stone wall around the timber.|$|E
25|$|The sinter cone for Castle Geyser {{has been}} dated to around 1022 using <b>carbon-14</b> dating. This date is {{much younger than}} the originally-presumed age of 5,000 to 15,000 years. A 3-D laser scan made of the cone reveals {{evidence}} that this geyser has evolved through four to five distinct stages to reach its current configuration.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{frequent}} {{uses of the}} technique is to date organic remains from archaeological sites. Plants fix atmospheric carbon during photosynthesis, so the level of 14C in plants and animals when they die approximately equals the level of 14C in the atmosphere at that time. However, it decreases thereafter from radioactive decay, allowing the date of death or fixation to be estimated. The initial 14C level for the calculation can either be estimated, or else directly compared with known year-by-year data from tree-ring data (dendrochronology) up to 10,000 years ago (using overlapping data from live and dead trees in a given area), or else from cave deposits (speleothems), back to about 45,000 years before the present. A calculation or (more accurately) a direct comparison of <b>carbon-14</b> levels in a sample, with tree ring or cave-deposit <b>carbon-14</b> levels of a known age, then gives the wood or animal sample age-since-formation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbon-14</b> dating at Tell Ramad, on the {{outskirts}} of Damascus, suggests that the site may have been occupied since {{the second half of the}} seventh millennium BC, possibly around 6300 B C. However, evidence of settlement in the wider Barada basin dating back to 9000 BC exists, although no large-scale settlement was present within Damascus walls until the second millennium BC.|$|E
25|$|Acetylene is used {{to volatilize}} carbon in {{radiocarbon}} dating. The carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with lithium metal in a small specialized research furnace to form lithium carbide (also known as lithium acetylide). The carbide can then be reacted with water, as usual, to form acetylene gas to feed into a mass spectrometer to measure the isotopic ratio of <b>carbon-14</b> to carbon-12.|$|E
