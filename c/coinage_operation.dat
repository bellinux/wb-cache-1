5000|$|The San Francisco Mint - 1852 to date. <b>Coinage</b> <b>operations</b> were {{suspended}} in March 1955, but the plant continued {{to operate as}} an Assay Office. In 1962, its official designation was changed from Mint to Assay Office. <b>Coinage</b> <b>operations</b> were again authorized in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|The Denver Mint - 1862 to date. It {{served as}} an Assay Office until 1906, when <b>coinage</b> <b>operations</b> began.|$|R
5000|$|The New Orleans, Louisiana Mint - 1835 to 1942. <b>Coinage</b> <b>operations</b> were {{conducted}} here from 1838, but were suspended from 1861 until 1879; assay functions were performed from 1876. Coinage resumed in 1879 and continued until 1909. The facility operated as an Assay Office from 1909 until 1942, {{when it was}} closed.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1934, {{the price}} of silver in the United States was {{effectively}} set by the government as it would support that price through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $.45 per troy ounce. In 1958, {{with the return of}} lend-lease bullion, the Treasury's stock of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to vend the metal at $.91 per ounce to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that there was not enough silver to make these sales and maintain <b>coinage</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Bureau of the Mint in 1955 ended <b>coinage</b> <b>operations</b> at the San Francisco Mint, deeming it {{cheaper to}} supply the West Coast with coins from Denver. [...] The Denver Mint (opened in 1906) had been modernized twice, in {{contrast}} to the aging Philadelphia Mint, constructed in 1901 and with much of its coinage equipment dating from then. Plans for a replacement facility had been scuttled multiple times by political infighting, as a new mint was sought not only by different cities, but by various neighborhoods of the city of Philadelphia.|$|R

50|$|Appropriations to {{complete}} and equip the plant were insufficient, and {{the transfer of}} assay operations to the new building were delayed until September 1, 1904. <b>Coinage</b> <b>operations</b> finally began on February 1, 1906, advancing {{the status of the}} Denver facility to Branch Mint. In addition, before the new machinery to be used at the Mint was installed for use, it was first sent to the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 for display. Silver coins were minted in Denver {{for the first time in}} 1906. During the first year, 167 million coins were produced, including $20 gold (double eagle) coins, $10 gold (eagle) coins, $5 gold (half eagle) coins, and assorted denominations of silver coins.|$|R
500|$|O'Reilly ran most Mint {{operations}} under Scobey and his successor, Robert J. Grant. Although the Mint Bureau {{was very}} {{busy in the}} booming economy of the 1920s, numismatic historian Roger Burdette points out that there were flaws in operations—for example, Philadelphia Mint officials, instead of setting aside gold coins from each batch delivered for inspecting and testing by the annual Assay Commission, took all assay coins from a bag set aside {{at the start of}} the year, increasing the likelihood that nonstandard coins would go undetected. O'Reilly did keep a close eye on <b>coinage</b> <b>operations,</b> warning the San Francisco Mint in November 1931 that it had produced fewer than 200,000 nickels, a figure that if allowed to stand would have resulted in the issue being hoarded by collectors. [...] She directed the mint to strike nothing but nickels for the remainder of the year, resulting in a total mintage for the 1931–S of 1,200,000, still the second-lowest by date and mint mark in the Buffalo nickel series.|$|R
