In the VPI process, a combination of heat, vacuum and pressure is used to thoroughly seal, bind, and eliminate entrained air voids in the winding polyester resin insulation coat layer, thus increasing resistance to corona. VPE windings are similar to VPI windings but provide more protection against environmental effects, such as from water, dirt or corrosive ambients, by multiple dips including typically in terms of final epoxy coat.Regarding image at top captioned, <b>Cut</b> <b>view</b> of {{transformer winding}}s: ...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} 20 years, the {{identification}} of triadin function in cardiac and skeletal muscle {{has been the focus}} of numerous studies. First thought as the missing link between the ryanodine receptor and the dihydropyridines receptor and responsible of skeletal type excitation-contraction coupling, the current hypothesis on triadin function has slowly evolved, and triadin is envisaged now as a regulator of calcium release, both in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Nevertheless, none of the experiments performed up to now gave a clear <b>cut</b> <b>view</b> of what triadin really does in muscle. The problem became more complex with {{the identification of}} multiple triadin isoforms, having possibly multiple functions.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that (aΛ 2 +b|H| 2) R in a spacetime of {{curvature}} R {{is a natural}} ultraviolet (UV) completion of (aΛ 4 +bΛ 2 |H| 2) in the flat-spacetime Standard Model (SM) with Higgs field H, UV scale Λ, and loop factors a and b. This curvature completion rests {{on the fact that}} Λ-mass gauge theory in flat spacetime turns, on the <b>cut</b> <b>view</b> R= 4 Λ 2, into a massless gauge theory in curved spacetime. It provides a symmetry reason for curved spacetime, wherein gravity and matter are both low-energy effective phenomena. Gravity arises correctly if new physics exists with at least 63 more bosons than fermions, with no need to interact with the SM and with dark matter as a natural harbinger. It can source various cosmological, astrophysical, and collider phenomena depending on its spectrum and couplings to the SM. TUBITAK (115 F 212...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 65 - 66) Increased bandwidth {{demands in}} the current network infrastructure have lead {{to the need for}} faster switching speeds. Most of the backbone networks today use fiber optics for carrying the data and electronic components for switching. However, current electronic speeds cannot keep up with the transmission capability of the optical fibers. All-optical switch fabrics {{play a major role in}} the effort to migrate the switching functions to the optical layer as they can overcome the capacity bottleneck of electronic-switched networks. One such type of optical switch is the electro optic switch. This project deals with the design of a 2 x 2 electro optic switch based on Mach Zehnder Interferometer. The switch design is simulated using OptiBPM software. Various design parameters such as the waveguide dimensions, substrate and diffusion profiles and cross and bar state voltages are chosen to realize the switch. Characteristics of the switch such as optical field propagation, refractive index propagation and <b>cut</b> <b>view</b> are observed for the different input parameters. The switching behavior is studied for the cross and bar state of the designed switch...|$|E

40|$|Prominent {{figures in}} our {{profession}} have quite recently offered clear <b>cut</b> <b>views</b> {{on the present}} distribution of prosperity and depression among the advanced industrial countries, see for example, Lucas (2003), Prescott (2002) : prosperity is identified with the United States, depression with Western Europe, and they relate this to the lower burden of taxation in the United States. The gap in the chosen level of performance (output per capita) is very large, about 30 %, and the remedy is clear: cut taxes in Europe. But Europe is different from America: for deep historical, cultural reasons, but partly because the pressures to consume are different. There can be no easy inference about relative prosperity: the market investment of modern capitalism can drive people towards longer hours of work and away from their underlying (meta) preferences.

Guitarist David Gilmour expressed feelings about his strained relationship with Waters on his second solo album, About Face (1984), and finished the accompanying tour as Waters began touring to promote his debut solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both had enlisted the aid of a range of successful performers, including in Waters' case Eric Clapton, their solo acts attracted fewer fans than Pink Floyd; poor ticket sales forced Gilmour to cancel several concerts, and critic David Fricke felt that Waters' show was [...] "a petulant echo, a transparent attempt to prove that Roger Waters was Pink Floyd". Waters returned to the US in March 1985 with a second tour, this time without the support of CBS Records, which had expressed its preference for a new Pink Floyd album; Waters criticised the corporation as [...] "a machine".|$|R
