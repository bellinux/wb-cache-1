25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the trend}} towards {{deinstitutionalisation}} {{began in the}} 1950s. Enoch Powell, the Minister of Health in the early 1960s, criticized psychiatric institutions and called {{for most of the}} care to be transferred to general hospitals and the community. In 1983, the government of Margaret Thatcher began the <b>Care</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> initiative {{to reduce the number of}} mental hospitals.|$|E
25|$|In the future, DSPD {{will face}} the {{challenge}} of growing support for privatization. Voices within the state legislature have questioned the continued operation of the State Developmental Center with taxpayer funds. As it is more cost-effective to provide the same level of <b>care</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> the continued use of such institutions is a paradox. During recent economic hardships, the state legislature explored the possibility of privatizing the Developmental Center.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{called the}} Office of Handicapped Services, DSPD {{was created in}} 1979 to manage {{what is now called}} the Utah State Developmental Center. This is the state-funded {{institution}} for people with disabilities in American Fork, Utah. In 1983 Congress added section 1915(c) to the Social Security Act. This addition provided for the creation of Medicaid waivers. It also outlined the contractual obligations of states choosing to establish waiver programs with Medicaid. Waiver programs were considered a positive step as they provided a way for people to lead less-restricted lives in the community. Studies that supported waivers cited cost-effectiveness as the main reason why they should be enacted. It was argued that providing the same institutional <b>care</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> cost less.|$|E

The string section, composed by Jonny Greenwood and written for 16 instruments, was inspired by modern classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima. Greenwood said, [...] "I got very excited {{at the prospect of}} doing string parts that didn't sound like 'Eleanor Rigby', which is what all string parts have sounded like for the past 30 years." [...] Select described Yorke's distraught vocals and the atonal strings as [...] "Thom's voice dissolving into a fearful, blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo." [...] For the lyrics, Yorke drew from his time as an orderly in a mental hospital during the <b>Care</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> policy of deinstitutionalizing mental health patients, and a New York Times article about serial killers.|$|E

The study also stated that the effectiveness of HCBS waiver programs has not been rigorously evaluated to date.|$|E

40|$|There {{is little}} {{experience}} {{of the use of}} health <b>care</b> assistants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> to support breastfeeding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. The aim of this project was to evaluate the implementation of a small-scale pilot project using health <b>care</b> assistants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> to support disadvantaged women breastfeeding. The evaluation was funded as part of the Department of Health's Infant Feeding Initiative. A longitudinal observational and quasi-experimental design was used. The project involved women, who had recently given birth, living in an area of London identified by the government's Sure Start scheme as socio-economically disadvantaged. This paper focuses mainly on the findings drawn from the qualitative data focusing on the process of implementation, the role of the Support Worker and women's perceptions of the support. The findings suggest that the use of health <b>care</b> assistants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> may offer a practical and encouraging approach in supporting breastfeeding which is acceptable to both breastfeeding women and health care professionals. More research is needed to establish whether the intervention significantly increases breastfeeding rates...|$|R

In 1993, however, Powell claimed that his policy could have worked. He claimed the criminally insane should have never been released and that the problem was one of funding. He said the new way of caring for the mentally ill would cost more, not less, than the old way because community care was decentralised and intimate as well as being [...] "more human". His successors had not, Powell claimed, provided the money for local authorities to spend on mental health care and therefore institutional care had been neglected whilst {{at the same time there}} was not any investment in community care.|$|E

[...] It was a manor of the parish and remains a hamlet of the town as well as not qualifying for post town status. The place-name Horton is a common one in England. It derives from Old English horu 'dirt' and tūn 'settlement, farm, estate', presumably meaning 'farm on muddy soil'.
