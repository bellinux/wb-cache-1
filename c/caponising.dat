40|$|The {{present study}} {{has shown that}} age {{resistance}} to R. cesticillus, manifested by worm destrobilization, occurred in male chickens. In females, age resistance developed more rapidly than in males, until the birds were about 84 days old and from this age onwards the manifestations of resistance declined. The roles of immune responses, mucus secretion and host hormone balance {{in the development of}} age resistance to R. cesticillus were subsequently investigated. Host resistance to superinfection with R. cesticillus was demonstrated {{for the first time and}} this resistance was inhibited by the immunosuppressant dexamethasone. Further evidence for the immunogenicity of the cestode was provided by histological studies and by the demonstration of immunocytes and of ring precipitin and immunofluorescent antibodies. Experimental evidence suggested that these antibodies are not protective and it is probable the protective immune response is cellular. An in vitro culture system, described by Schiller (1970), kept young adult cestodes in an active condition for more than eight days, although growth was poor. Chicken intestinal mucus extracts were shown to be lethal to R. cesticillus in vitro and mucus from old birds appeared to have a greater effect than 'young' mucus. The effects of gonadal steroids on the course of infection of R. cesticillus were investigated by <b>caponising</b> male birds and implanting oestradiol or testosterone pellets. This procedure reproduced to some degree the patterns of infection of R. cesticillus observed in intact, untreated, mature birds. Scolex transplantation and the correlation of worm weights down the intestine with destrobilization strongly implicated intestinal environmental factors as being responsible for the phenomenon of worm destrobilization. The possible mechanisms whereby the immune response, mucus secretions and host hormone balance affect worm viability are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the osteometric effects of surgical caponisation on long bones of cockerel chickens. Sixty- (60 -) day-old chicks were distributed into two experimental groups with thirty (30) cockerels per group. The birds were <b>caponised</b> at eight (8) weeks of age. The mean of final body weights of caponized groups was significantly higher (Pâ‰¤ 0. 05) than the uncaponised group. The weights of all long bones measured as well as lengths between the two groups were not statistically different (P> 0. 05) from one another except the weight of femur of the caponized group and the lengths of tibia and tarsometatarsus (P 0. 05) from one another except the midshaft diameter of ulna that was significantly higher (P 0. 05) on almost all the long bones studied when they were normalised to the final body weights...|$|R
5000|$|Yajnavalkya Smriti, a {{historic}} Indian text on statecraft and jurisprudence, suggested {{to have been}} written before the 5th century AD, prohibited the cutting of trees and prescribed punishment for such acts. During Chandragupta's reign, there was a regular forest department led by a Kupyadhyaksha (superintendent) and Vanpalas (forest guards). Kautilya's Arthashastra says {{that they had a}} role of classifying the trees, plants and herbs and fixing their price; they imposed fines on those who fell trees without permission. It further mentions how forests were classified into three types: Reserved, those donated to Brahmins and public. Written in Mauryan period, it emphasised the need for forest administration. Ashoka went further, and his Pillar Edicts expressed his view about the welfare of environment and biodiversity. [...] "Happiness in this world and the next is difficult to obtain without much love for the dhamma, much self-examination, much respect, much fear of evil, and much enthusiasm. ...Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi (Ashoka), speaks thus: Animals were declared to be protected - parrots, mainas, aruna, geese, wild ducks, nandimukhas, gelatas, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, vedareyaka, gangapuputaka, sankiya fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, okapinda, wild asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible. Also protected were nanny goats, ewes and sows which are with young or giving milk to their young, and so are young ones less than six months old. Cocks are not to be <b>caponised,</b> husks hiding living beings are not to be burnt, and forests are not to be burnt either without reason or to kill creatures. One animal is not to be fed to another. Our king killed very few animals." [...] Ashoka's Seven Pillar Edicts ...|$|R
