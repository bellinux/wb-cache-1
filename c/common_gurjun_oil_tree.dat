Haar-based rectangular windows or {{also known as}} Haar-like rectangular features have been popular in face recognition as used in Viola-Jones object detection framework. Similar to face recognition, the <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> recognition would also need a suitable Haar-based rectangular windows that best suit to the characteristics of <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree.</b> A set of seven Haar-based rectangular windows {{have been designed to}} better match specifically the young <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> as the crown size is much smaller compared to the matured ones. Determination of features for <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> is an essential task to ensure a high successful rate of correct <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> detection. Furthermore, features that reflects the identification of <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> indicate distinctiveness between an <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> and other objects in the image such as buildings, roads and drainage.

40|$|Tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil</b> {{is used as}} {{a natural}} remedy, but is also a popular {{ingredient}} in household and cosmetic products. Oxidation of tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil</b> may result in degradation products, such as ascaridole, which may cause allergic contact dermatitis. We investigated the prevalence of sensitization to ascaridole, the optimal patch test concentration and we studied co-sensitization of ascaridole and oxidized tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil.</b> A total of 290 patiënts with eczema were patch tested with ascaridole 1 %, 2 % and 5 % in petrolatum. Ascaridole 2 % seems to be the most favorable patch test concentration based on the ratio of positive (5. 5 %), irritant (1. 7 %) and doubtful (4. 1 %) reactions. Six patients showed a positive reaction to oxidized tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil.</b> All patients with a positive reaction to tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil</b> showed a positive reaction to ascaridole. This finding suggests that ascaridole is contact allergen in tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil.</b> A total of 24 patients showed a positive reaction to ascaridole without a positive reaction to tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil.</b> Six out of these 24 patients were exposed to tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil</b> en developed eczema after using products containing tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil.</b> Patch testing with ascaridole elicits clinically relevant positive reactions, which are missed by patch testing with tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil</b> alone...|$|R

40|$|In the past, {{oil palm}} density has been {{determined}} by manually counting trees every year in oil palm plantations. The measurement of density provides important data related to palm productivity, fertilizer needed, weed control costs {{in a circle around}} each tree, labourers needed, and needs for other activities. Manual counting requires many workers and has potential problems related to accuracy. Remote sensing provides a potential approach for counting <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees.</b> The main objective {{of this study is to}} build a robust and user-friendly method that will allow oil palm managers to count <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> using a remote sensing technique. The <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> analysed in this study have different ages and densities. QuickBird imagery was applied with the six pansharpening methods and was compared with panchromatic QuickBird imagery. The black and white imagery from a false colour composite of pansharpening imagery was processed in three ways: (1) <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> detection, (2) delineation of the oil palm area using the red band, and (3) counting <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> and accuracy assessment. For oil palm detection, we used several filters that contained a Sobel edge detector; texture analysis co-occurrence; and dilate, erode, high-pass, and opening filters. The results of this study improved upon the accuracy of several previous research studies that had an accuracy of about 90 - 95 %. The results in this study show (1) modified intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) resolution merge is suitable for 16 -year-old <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> and have rather high density with 100 % accuracy; (2) colour normalized (Brovey) is suitable for 21 -year-old <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> and have low density with 99. 5 % accuracy; (3) subtractive resolution merge is suitable for 15 - and 18 -year-old <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> and have a rather high density with 99. 8 % accuracy; (4) PC spectral sharpening with 99. 3 % accuracy is suitable for 10 -year-old <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> and have low density; and (5) for all study object conditions, colour normalized (Brovey) and wavelet resolution merge are two pansharpening methods that are suitable for <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> extraction and counting with 98. 9 % and 98. 4 % accuracy, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{essential}} oil of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil)</b> and its components have antimicrobial activity against {{a wide range}} of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and viruses. The mechanism(s) by which Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 10662 maintains a decreased susceptibility to tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil</b> and components was investigated. Results: Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil</b> and terpinen- 4 -ol against stationary phase P. aeruginosa while polymyxin B nonapeptide enhanced the activity of tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil</b> and γ-terpinene. Pre-treatment with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone increased the susceptibility of exponential phase cells to sub-inhibitory concentrations of tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil,</b> terpinen- 4 -ol and γ-terpinene, indicating that intrinsic tolerance to tea <b>tree</b> <b>oil</b> and components is substantially energy dependent.

40|$|<b>Oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> is an {{important}} cash crop in Thailand. To maximize the productivity from planting, oil palm plantation managers {{need to know the}} number of <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> in the plantation area. In order to obtain this information, an approach for palm tree detection using high resolution satellite images is proposed. This approach makes it possible to count the number of <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> in a plantation. The process begins with the selection of the vegetation index having the highest discriminating power between <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> and background. The index having highest discriminating power is then used as the primary feature for palm tree detection. We hypothesize that <b>oil</b> palm <b>trees</b> are located at the local peak within the oil palm area. To enhance the separability between <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> crowns and background, the rank transformation is applied to the index image. The local peak on the enhanced index image is then detected by using the non-maximal suppression algorithm. Since both rank transformation and non-maximal suppression are window based, semi-variogram analysis is used to determine the appropriate window size. The performance of the proposed method was tested on high resolution satellite images. In general, our approach uses produced very accurate results, e. g., about 90 percent detection rate when compared with manual labeling...|$|R
