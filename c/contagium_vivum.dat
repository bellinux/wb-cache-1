In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium– this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a <b>contagium</b> <b>vivum</b> fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus– agent of foot-and-mouth disease (aphthovirus)– through a similar filter.|$|E

He did not find a special species of bacteria himself - this was achieved by his student Robert Koch. Those two put up the fundamental rules of cleanly defining disease-causing microbes: the Henle Koch postulates.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of viruses was first recognized when certain pathogens {{were found to}} pass through filters that otherwise stop bacteria. Pasteur made such observations in 1887 with the pathogen of rabies, but {{he thought that the}} pathogen was a very subtle microbe. In 1886 Adolf Mayer studied the mosaic disease of tobacco plants. He was unable to observe the least trace of a microbe, but still assumed that the pathogen was a bacterium. In 1892 Iwanovsky demonstrated that tobacco mosaic was caused by an agent that passed through bacteria-proof filters but he insisted till {{the end of his life}} that the tobacco mosaic virus was a small bacterium. Similar observations were made by Loeffler and Frosch in 1898 on foot-and-mouth disease of cattle. Beijcrinck confirmed the filterability of tobacco mosaic virus but confirmed its properties in more detail and then, in 1898, firmly concluded that tobacco mosaic virus is not a microbe but a <b>contagium</b> <b>vivum</b> fluidum. His idea that a pathogen can be a soluble molecule that proliferates when it is part of the protoplasm of a living cell was revolutionary and new. This new concept has laid the foundation of virus research and directed further studies on the nature of viruses...|$|E
40|$|Beijerinck's {{entirely new}} concept, {{launched}} in 1898, of a ¢lterable <b>contagium</b> <b>vivum</b> £uidum which multiplied in close {{association with the}} host's metabolism and was distributed in phloem vessels together with plant nutrients, did not match the then prevailing bacteriological germ theory. At the time, tools and concepts to handle such {{a new kind of}} agent (the viruses) were non-existent. Beijerinck's novel idea, therefore, did not revolutionize biological science or immediately alter human understanding of contagious diseases. That is how bacteriological dogma persisted, as voiced by Loe¥er and Frosch when showing the ¢lter-ability of an animal virus (1898), and especially by Ivanovsky who had already in 1892 detected ¢lterability of the agent of tobacco mosaic but kept looking for a microbe and ¢nally (1903) claimed its multiplication in an arti¢cial medium. The dogma was also strongly advocated by Roux in 1903 when writing the ¢rst review on viruses, which he named s̀o-called ` ̀ invisible' ' microbes', unwittingly including the agent of bovine pleuropneumonia, only much later proved to be caused by a mycoplasma. In 1904, Baur was the ¢rst to advocate strongly the chemical view of viruses. But uncertainty about the true nature of viruses, with their similarities to enzymes and genes, continued until the 1930 s when at long last tobacco mosaic virus particles were isolated as an enzyme-like protein (1935), soon to be better character-ized as a nucleoprotein (1937).

Physicochemical virus studies were a key element in triggering molecular biology which was to provide further means to reveal the true nature of viruses 'at the threshold of life'. Beijerinck's 1898 vision was not appreciated or verified during his lifetime. But Beijerinck already had a clear notion of the mechanism behind the phenomena he observed. Developments in virology and molecular biology since 1935 indicate how close Beijerinck (and even Mayer, Beijerinck's predecessor in research on tobacco mosaic) had been to the mark. The history of research on tobacco mosaic and the commitments of Mayer, Beijerinck and others demonstrate that progress in science is not only a matter of mere technology but of philosophy as well. Raemaekers' Mayer cartoon, inspired by Beijerinck, artistically represents the crucial question about the reliability of our images of reality, and about the scope of our technological interference with nature...|$|E
