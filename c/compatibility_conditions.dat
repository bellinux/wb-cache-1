40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} a simple Levi <b>compatibility</b> <b>condition</b> determines {{stability}} of WKB solutions to semilinear hyperbolic initial-value problems issued from highly-oscillating initial data with large amplitudes. The <b>compatibility</b> <b>condition</b> involves the hyperbolic op-erator, the fundamental phase associated with the initial oscillation, and the semilinear source term; it states roughly that hyperbolicity is preserved around resonances. If the <b>compatibility</b> <b>condition</b> is satisfied, the solutions are defined over time intervals independent of the wavelength, and the associated WKB solutions are stable under a large class of initial perturbations. If the <b>compatibility</b> <b>condition</b> is not satisfied, resonances are exponentially amplified, and arbitrarily small initial perturbations can destabilize the WKB solutions in small time. The amplification mechanism {{is based on the}} observation that in frequency space, res-onances correspond to points of weak hyperbolicity. At such points, the behavior of the system depends on the lower order terms through the <b>compatibility</b> <b>condition.</b> The analysis relies, in the unstable case, on a Duhamel representation formula for solutions of zeroth-order pseudo-differential equations.

2500|$|A distance-preserving diffeomorphism between Riemannian {{manifolds}} {{is called}} an isometry. This notion {{can also be}} defined locally, i.e. for small neighborhoods of points. Any two regular curves are locally isometric. However, the Theorema Egregium of Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that for surfaces, {{the existence of a}} local isometry imposes strong <b>compatibility</b> <b>conditions</b> on their metrics: the Gaussian curvatures at the corresponding points must be the same. In higher dimensions, the Riemann curvature tensor is an important pointwise invariant associated with a Riemannian manifold that measures how close it is to being flat. An important class of Riemannian manifolds is the Riemannian symmetric spaces, whose curvature is not necessarily constant.

2500|$|The {{theory of}} {{complexes}} of groups (see Haefliger, Corson Bridson-Haefliger) provides a higher-dimensional generalization of Bass–Serre theory. The {{notion of a}} graph of groups is replaced by that of a complex of groups, where groups are assigned to each cell in a simplicial complex, together with monomorphisms between these groups corresponding to face inclusions (these monomorphisms are required to satisfy certain <b>compatibility</b> <b>conditions).</b> One can then define an analog of the fundamental group of a graph of groups for a complex of groups. However, in order for this notion to have good algebraic properties (such as embeddability of the vertex groups in it) and {{in order for a}} good analog for the notion of the Bass–Serre covering tree to exist in this context, one needs to require some sort of [...] "non-positive curvature" [...] condition for the complex of groups in question (see, for example [...] ).|$|E
