No single instrument fulfills the criteria of being valid, reliable, and practical while not affecting behavior. The instruments that are very precise tend to be impractical on a population basis. Surveys are the most practical approach in large-scale studies, although little is known about their reliability and validity. Studies employing objective monitoring through heart rate, movement sensors, and doubly labeled water procedures appear promising, but are still experimental and costly. Despite the difficulty of measurement, relatively strong association has been found between physical activity and health, suggesting that, with improvements in assessment techniques, even stronger associations should be seen...|$|E

40|$|Benthic assemblages of {{variable}} density cover three ridges that parallel the Broward County, Florida coast at about 5 - 10 m, 10 - 20 m, and 20 - 30 m depth. Two of these ridges are drowned early Holocene reefs of 5 ky and 7 ky uncorrected radiocarbon age respectively. In response {{to changes in}} environmental factors (hydrodynamic exposure, ambient light, etc.) the characteristics of benthic assemblages change. An acoustic bottom <b>classification</b> <b>survey</b> using QTCView 5 based on a 50 kHz transducer showed different acoustic classes on the shallow, nearshore hardground and the two deeper reeflines, which showed the same acoustic signature. Rubble beds inshore of the the third, deepest reef-line showed a mixed acoustic signature. Ground-truthing by divers utilizing traditional transect surveys showed that the differences in acoustic signature corresponded to different benthic assemblages: nearshore hardgrounds had low live cover (10 %) and were dominated by algae and hydrozoa, the two deeper reef lines had the same acoustic signature and similar benthic assemblages (25 - 50 % cover by tall sponges and gorgonians). Subtle differences in species composition existed, however since growth-form characteristics and thus acoustic surface roughness characteristics, were the same in both areas, no acoustic split was achieved. The QTCView 5 was also able to differentiate between stable sands covered by a thin red algae turf and more mobile sand without turf cover. It is therefore concluded that acoustic remote-sensing methods {{can be used to}} differentiate different benthic assemblages, as long as enough differences exist in the growth-form characteristics of the dominant species to provide for a unique acoustic roughness...|$|E

Movements between George&rsquo;s Island caribou and nearby Mealy Mountain caribou were examined through satellite telemetry (April 2005 to April 2006).

Mainland caribou moved very little throughout the year, travelling no more than 53. 7 km on average from their initial collaring locations. Also, satellite data indicated no mixing between animals on George&rsquo;s Island and the mainland. The elevated caribou density and high proportion of calves suggest that George&rsquo;s Island could at times be acting as a predator-free recruitment area and that George&rsquo;s Island may be a subpopulation from which animals disperse to the mainland...|$|R
