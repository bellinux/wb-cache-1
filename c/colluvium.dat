Many fossils and stone tools can be {{observed}} in the <b>colluviums</b> that overlap the present topography constituted by Late Pliocene continental sediments. The Masol paleonto-archeological site {{is located in}} the center of a trenched anticline compatible with the direction of plate convergence between India and Eurasia. Erosion processes are very actives and efficient in the area. Around 80 m of vertical erosion occurred in the Patiali Rao valley and regressive erosion incised the Siwalik Hills for ∼ 12 km. At least two levels of fluvial terraces are visible in the Patiali Rao valley and laterally apart the Pichhli River. River bank erosion, gullies, collapses, cavities, regressive erosion, landslides and in situ disaggregation have been observed and are responsible of the significant excavation of the anticline. Substrate composed of sand, sandstone and silt is very erodible in case of heavy rain. Slope destabilizations by seasonal monsoon are responsible of a large part of the <b>colluviums</b> overlapping the present slopes. Some <b>colluviums</b> could be due also to in situ disaggregation of sandstone formations. Due to the very active erosion and to their position on the topography, we believe that these <b>colluviums</b> are very recent...|$|R

This paper {{presents the results of}} detailed studies of the mechanism of slope failures in and around a large-scale abandoned forest (95. 6 ha) after clear-cutting, southern Kumamoto Prefecture. General speaking, intense rainfall, relief, slope angle, slope form, and slope exposure are recognized as factors in slide formation and distribution. The slope failures have no relevance to the abandoned forest after clear-cutting. However, the failures have a connection with logging and road constraction, i. e. road-cut failure, road-prism, road-fill failure and <b>colluviums</b> slide. Large-scale <b>colluviums</b> slide movement is thought to begin at the scar head along multiple slip planes in saturated, relatively shallow, cohesionless soil.

In order to improve the interpretation, the ERT results were correlated with the data of drilling and geotechnical tests. The thickness of <b>colluviums</b> detected by ERT agrees with the borehole data, as indicated in the results. Pole-Pole array type is the best electrode arrangement in this study area. Laboratory test data indicates that the dominant influences on resistivity of <b>colluviums</b> are saturation and gravel content.

25|$|Partly filling most craters is plains {{material}} that is smoother and less densely cratered than intermediate plains material. Because most areas underlain by this unit are enclosed within craters, contacts between smooth plains and older plains units are rare. Smooth plains material thus is defined almost entirely by texture and apparent crater density. Few superposition data directly support the inferred age sequence, but the relative youth of the smooth plains unit is indicated by its presence on the floors of craters that are superposed on intermediate plains material. The smooth plains unit probably includes materials {{of a wide range}} in age, but the exposed areas are too small to test this possibility quantitatively. Although a volcanic origin cannot be ruled out for {{all or part of the}} smooth plains material, it is more probably a mixture of ejecta from very small craters and <b>colluvium</b> mass wasted from crater walls.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{deposits}} {{are affected}} by the mechanism of transport and deposition to their location. Soils that are not transported are called residual soils—they exist at the same location as the rock from which they were generated. Decomposed granite is a common example of a residual soil. The common mechanisms of transport are the actions of gravity, ice, water, and wind. Wind blown soils include dune sands and loess. Water carries particles of different size depending on the speed of the water, thus soils transported by water are graded according to their size. Silt and clay may settle out in a lake, and gravel and sand collect {{at the bottom of a}} river bed. Wind blown soil deposits (aeolian soils) also tend to be sorted according to their grain size. Erosion at the base of glaciers is powerful enough to pick up large rocks and boulders as well as soil; soils dropped by melting ice can be a well graded mixture of widely varying particle sizes. Gravity on its own may also carry particles down from the top of a mountain to make a pile of soil and boulders at the base; soil deposits transported by gravity are called <b>colluvium.</b>|$|E

The production consists of cooking utensils (based on schist, <b>colluviums,</b> quartzose sand and silt), decoration products (based on argillite, washing residues and soil), vases and gourds products (based on schist and soil), tiles (based on silt decantation) and traditional dishes (based on soil and argillite). In this study we elaborate bricks from the different raw material and we evaluate some of their physical properties after firing at 1050 °C. In particular we measure the porosity to water and the mechanical strength of all the fired bricks. The aim is to compare the final product quality according to the origin (lithology) of the clayey raw material of the ceramic pastes. Based on our experiments, the bricks of the lower compressive strength (CS) and of the lower flexural strength (FS) are those based on sand (CS = 39 MPa; FS = 7 MPa), on silt decantation (CS = 25 to 39 MPa; FS = 10 to 18 MPa), and on schist and <b>colluviums</b> (CS = 20 to 51 MPa; FS = 6 to 17 MPa). Those of the highest values are based on argillites (CS = 33 to 102 MPa; FS = 13 to 28 MPa). The other pastes are characterized by intermediate values. The porosity ranges between 5 to 27 %. The bricks based on silt decantation have the greatest values (20 to 27 %), whereas those based on argillite have the lower values (5 to 10 %).

In this work, resistivity imaging was used to map fractures, faults and quartz veins emplaced in strongly weathered volcanic rocks. The aim was to map geological units related {{to the formation of}} groundwater systems in the Rio Artiguas basin, Nicaragua. Eight 2 D resistivity surveys selected from two sites with characteristic geological features are discussed in this article. The resistivity lines were carried out with a multi-electrode system together with different electrode geometries. The data inversion was done by applying the robust (L-i-norm) method and a finite element grid to accommodate the steep topography. The data interpretation included numerical modelling to assess the suitability of all used electrode arrays in relation to the expected geological settings. The results indicated a top high resistive layer consisting of <b>colluviums</b> with laterite (> 50 Omega m), underlain by conductive clay weathered layers (10 - 50 Omega m). Below the conductive layer less weathered or fresh rock can be found with higher values (50 - 600 Omega m). The quartz veins and dykes stand out as the highest resistive bodies (100 - 4000 Omega m). The results indicated an overall weathering thickness of 10 - 30 m or more. In conclusion, the extensive resistivity imaging surveys allowed delineation of geological structures and weathering layers throughout the study area. Furthermore, the vertical extension of weathering was examined at all locations.
