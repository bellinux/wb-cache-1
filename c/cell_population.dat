5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule <b>cell</b> <b>population</b> activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E

Methods: Spectra of individual SC and TA cells in situ from cryosections of human cornea were collected using a synchrotron micro-spectroscopy facility at Daresbury laboratory, UK. Multivariate analysis and Mann Whitney U tests were used to analyse the spectral data from the SC and TA <b>cell</b> <b>populations.</b> Results: There were marked differences between the median spectra of the two <b>cell</b> <b>populations.</b> This correlated with their level of differentiation and functional specialization. Multivariate (principal component) analysis revealed that the <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> could be segregated into distinct clusters, with only slight overlap between the two cell types. Significant (p< 0. 05) spectral differences were found in the spectral regions associated with nucleic acid, protein and lipids. Conclusions: Synchrotron FTIR micro-spectroscopy together with principal component analysis is able to discriminate between SC and TA <b>cell</b> <b>populations.</b> Our results also suggest a small sub-population of corneal epithelial cells in the SC niche have TA cell-like characteristics. Many of the spectral differences between the SC and TA <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> relate to differences in nucleic acid conformation...|$|R

A mutation in the 3' UTR of the myostatin gene in Texel sheep creates a miR-1 and miR-206 target site. This is likely to cause the muscular phenotype of this breed of sheep.|$|E
25|$|In A. thaliana, {{function}} A {{is mainly}} represented by two genes APETALA1 (AP1) and APETALA2 (AP2) AP1 is a MADS-box type gene, while AP2 {{belongs to the}} family of genes that contains AP2, which it gives its name to and which consists of transcription factors that are only found in plants. AP2 has also been shown to complex with the co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) in developing floral buds to repress the C-class gene AGAMOUS (AG). However, AP2 is not expressed in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which contains the latent stem <b>cell</b> <b>population</b> throughout the adult life of Arabidopsis, and so it is speculated that TPL works with some other A-class gene in the SAM to repress AG.AP1 functions as a type A gene, both in controlling the identity of sepals and petals, and it also acts in the floral meristem. AP2 not only functions in the first two verticils, but also in the remaining two, in developing ovules and even in leaves. It is also likely that post-transcriptional regulation exists, which controls it’s A function, or even that it has other purposes in the determination of organ identity independent of that mentioned here.|$|E
25|$|In a {{discovery}} setting, {{the goal is}} to identify and describe cell populations correlated with an external variable (as opposed to the diagnosis setting in which {{the goal is to}} combine the predictive power of multiple cell types to maximize the accuracy of the results). Similar to the diagnosis use-case, cluster matching in high-dimensional space can be used for exploratory analysis but the descriptive power of this approach is very limited, as it is hard to characterize and visualize a <b>cell</b> <b>population</b> in a high-dimensional space without first reducing the dimensionality. Finally, combinatorial gating approaches have been particularly successful in exploratory analysis of FCM data. Simplified Presentation of Incredibly Complex Evaluations (SPICE) is a software package that can use the gating functionality of FlowJo to statistically evaluate a wide range of different cell populations and visualize those that are correlated with the external outcome. flowType and RchyOptimyx (as discussed above) expand this technique by adding the ability of exploring the impact of independent markers on the overall correlation with the external outcome. This enables the removal of unnecessary markers and provides a simple visualization of all identified cell types.

This project sought to expand on a previously published model of the B <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> in trout immune tissues using flow cytometry analysis of the kidney. The model suggests that a maturation gradient exists along the trout kidney, with the earliest B cell precursors in the anterior kidney, and mature B cells residing in the posterior kidney.

METHODS. Spectra of individual cells in situ in cryosections of bovine cornea were collected by using a synchrotron microspectroscopy facility at Daresbury Laboratory (United Kingdom). The resultant spectra were analyzed by multivariate analysis. RESULTS. The median spectra of the three different <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> showed marked differences, which correlated with their degree of differentiation and proliferative capacity. Multivariate (principal component) analysis (PCA) showed that the three <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> could be segregated into discrete clusters, with only a slight overlap between the SC and TA <b>cell</b> <b>populations.</b> Further analysis (Mann-Whitney test) indicated that the most significant (P < 0. 001) spectral differences between the SC and TA <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> were chiefly associated with changes in nucleic acid conformation. CONCLUSIONS.

ALDH(high) and ALDH(low) <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> were further examined for co-expression of CD 44 and/or CD 24. We demonstrate that unlike <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> demonstrating low ALDH activity, as few as 100 cells enriched for high ALDH activity were capable of tumor formation, irrespective of CD 133 expression. In direct xenograft tumors, the proportions of total tumor cells expressing ALDH and/or CD 133 in xenograft tumors were unchanged through a minimum of two passages. We further demonstrate that ALDH expression among patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is heterogeneous, but the expression is constant in serial generations of individual direct xenograft tumors established from bulk human pancreatic tumors in NOD/SCID mice. We conclude that, in contrast to some previous studies, <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> enriched for high ALDH activity alone are sufficient for efficient tumor-initiation with enhanced tumorigenic potential relative to CD 133 (+) and ALDH(low) <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> in some direct xenograft tumors. Although <b>cell</b> <b>populations</b> enriched for CD 133 expression may alone possess tumorigenic potential, they are significantly less tumorigenic than ALDH(high) <b>cell</b> <b>populations.</b> ALDH(high) /CD 44 (+) /CD 24 (+) or ALDH(low) /CD 44 (+) /CD 24 (+) phenotypes do not appear to significantly contribute to tumor formation at low numbers of inoculated tumor cells.
