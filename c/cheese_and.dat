40|$|Isovaleric acid (3 -methylbutyric acid) and 2 -methylbutyric acid are <b>cheese</b> flavour {{compounds}} <b>and</b> {{are produced}} in Swiss cheese mainly by propionibacteria (PAB), with large variations in amounts {{depending on the}} strain. To evaluate the possibility of screening this property in vitro, the production of both acids (referred to as methylbutyric acids) was compared for eight Propionibacterium freudenreichii strains both in mini-Swiss <b>cheeses</b> <b>and</b> in liquid cultures (salted-yeast extract-peptone-lactate medium, pH 5. 4, incubated at 24 °C then at 6 °C). Similar time courses of methylbutyric acid production were observed in <b>cheeses</b> <b>and</b> in liquid cultures. PAB produced methylbutyric acids during propionic fermentation at 24 °C (8 – 37 mg kg− 1, and 5 – 13 mg L− 1, respectively, in <b>cheeses</b> <b>and</b> cultures), and during further storage at 6 °C for 2 months (11 – 77 mg kg− 1 and 5 – 17 mg L− 1). PAB strains significantly (P< 0. 05) influenced the amounts produced, and they were similarly classified in <b>cheeses</b> <b>and</b> in liquid cultures. This simple screening method has potential for selection of high- or low-producing strains for cheese manufacture...|$|R

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008–2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The Stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale {{at the same rate as}} increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> double the bacon of one triple Stacker. The Stacker line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base.|$|E
