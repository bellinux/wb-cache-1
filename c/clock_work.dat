25|$|By 1873, {{the year}} of the inaugural Intercolonial Coast Lighthouse Conference in Sydney, Queensland had 39 lights along its coastline. The conference was the first attempt to {{coordinate}} coastal lights and signals around Australia. Recommendations included the need for more coastal lights in Queensland. Although there was general agreement on the recommendations, there were no moves by any of the colonies to cede their control of lighthouses and other coastal signals to a centralised body or to adopt standardised designs for coastal lights. Lighthouse design continued to take into account local conditions and readily available building materials. Often the local materials were augmented with specialised fittings such as stairways, lantern rooms, lenses, and <b>clock</b> <b>work</b> mechanisms from overseas companies.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} proteins {{which make up}} the mammalian TTNFL are the Period (PER), and Cryptochrome (CRY) proteins, BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. PER and CRY levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. BMAL1 and <b>CLOCK</b> <b>work</b> to increase PER and CRY transcription by binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER and CRY gene coding sequences. The level of PER and CRY proteins is regulated by casein kinase 1 through phosphorylation, which marks these proteins for degradation by the cell. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. However, if CRY proteins bind to PER before this phosphorylation can occur, all three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER and CRY can work to inhibit their own transcription, while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{illuminating apparatus}} was an 1885, lenticular 3rd order lens, manufactured by Sautter, Lemonnier & Company of France. The central drum measured 1 meter in diameter. It had six panels of which three were flashing panels. In each {{panel of the}} central drum there were seven elements; each panel above central drum had eleven prisms and four prisms below. The flashes were produced by the central revolving drum mounted on a chariot activated by a <b>clock</b> <b>work</b> system. The clock cord descended through the central column in the stairway. The mechanism was protected by a circular iron and glass case. The original light characteristic showed a white flash every 3 seconds and had an 18-mile range. In 1923 the light characteristics were changed. In 1945 the light was electrified. It was also changed into an automatic, unwatched light that exhibited the original characteristics. The structure was abandoned and boarded up. The lens {{was replaced by a}} 500mm lens. No record has been found which indicates that major structural changes or alterations were introduced in the dwelling. The decorative elements are purely neo-classic especially its cornices and pediment.|$|E
