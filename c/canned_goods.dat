On 23 May 2011, the Belarusian ruble depreciated 56% against the United States dollar. The depreciation was even steeper {{on the black market}} and financial collapse seemed imminent as citizens rushed to exchange their rubles for dollars, euros, durable goods, and <b>canned</b> <b>goods.</b> On 1 June 2011, Belarus requested an economic rescue package from the International Monetary Fund.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of {{residents}} were evacuated from the Panhandle of Florida, including Santa Rosa Island and Destin, {{as well as}} other low-lying locations. Some residents evacuated to storm shelters that were set up in various cities along the coast. A store in Destin reported increased sales in hurricane-related supplies such as <b>canned</b> <b>goods</b> and flashlights. Florida Governor Claude Kirk ordered health units and law enforcement to operate on emergency alert. Small craft in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico were advised to remain in port until the high seas subsided.|$|E

The Santo Domingo International Airport suspended all flight operations on the morning of August16. The tropical storm warning for the island was discontinued when Cindy made landfall as no more than a weak tropical depression. In Cuba, a storm alert was issued for eastern provinces as forecasters warned of possibly heavy rainfall.|$|E

After doing so, a boarding party with Japanese officers in a launch headed to Montanan.

The news report did not identify the type or the name of the Japanese warship, which had been searching for a German vessel thought to be operating in the area.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of Xangsane, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) issued an {{emergency}} request for 5.7million Swiss francs ($4.6million, 2006USD) to aid the Philippine Red Cross in its relief effort. In addition, the movement dispatched 3,000 workers and three disaster response teams to affected areas for search and rescue missions, damage assessments, and assistance to people affected by the typhoon. The Philippine Red Cross provided <b>canned</b> <b>goods,</b> rice, clothing, and personal hygiene items to over 6,300 families, and local volunteers provided assistance to people in shelters. The Spanish Red Cross, present since 1998 as a backup to the Philippine Red Cross, also sent officials, logistics equipment, and water purification systems to the more heavily areas to aid in disaster relief and damage assessments.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of <b>canned</b> <b>goods.</b> In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, then-Philippine {{president}} Joseph Estrada declared six provinces as a {{state of}} calamity, which allocated ₱1million in emergency funds for each province. The president was unable to return home {{from a trip to}} Singapore due to the storm. The military was activated to help organize relief efforts, using rubber boats and trucks to reach the hardest hit areas as floodwaters decreased. They were aided by the Philippine Red Cross and other government agencies. Most evacuees returned home after the storm passed, excluding those whose houses sustained damage. Volunteers, the military, and public workers helped clean up from the damage. Just seven days after Zeb's damaging Philippine landfall, another typhoon—Babs—struck the same general region with a similar, but lesser intensity. After both storms, the Philippine National Electrification Administration provided ₱1.78million to the Batanes Electric Cooperative to restore damaged power lines. Power was gradually restored in northeastern Luzon, allowing communication of the damage extent. The nation's Department of Health distributed ₱547,469 worth of medicine to four provinces. The government airlifted about 3,000bags of supplies to Cagayan that included rice and <b>canned</b> <b>goods.</b> The back to back storm impacts caused an estimated 30% drop in coconut exports. Food prices rose dramatically, in some instances up to 400%, after both storms damaged crops. The storms also delayed shipments of sugar from neighboring countries, although prices were expected to fall once they arrived. By December 1998, consumer prices had risen by 11.2% over the previous year due to the typhoons' damage.|$|E

25|$|With the {{discovery}} of the importance of airtight containers for food preservation by French inventor Nicholas Appert, the tin canning process was patented by British merchant Peter Durand in 1810. After receiving the patent, Durand did not himself follow up with canning food. He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first <b>canned</b> <b>goods</b> for the Royal Navy.|$|E
