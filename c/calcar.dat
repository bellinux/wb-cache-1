5|$|Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), {{professor}} of anatomy at the University of Padua, {{is considered the}} founder of modern human anatomy. Originally from Brabant, Vesalius published the influential book De humani corporis fabrica ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543. The accurate and intricately detailed illustrations, often in allegorical poses against Italianate landscapes, {{are thought to have}} been made by the artist Jan van <b>Calcar,</b> a pupil of Titian.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings are}} brown, but lighter {{than those of}} M.mystacinus. The plagiopatagium (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is {{attached}} to the fifth toe. The tail extends only about 1mm beyond the back margin of the uropatagium (the portion of the wing membrane between the hindlegs). The <b>calcar,</b> a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip (except in one Croatian specimen). The baculum (penis bone) is about 0.5mm long. The short and broad shape of this bone distinguishes M.alcathoe from M.brandtii as well as M.ikonnikovi.|$|E
5|$|The mesosoma is half {{as broad}} than the head when viewed dorsally. The {{junction}} of the mesoscutellum (middle {{part of the}} scutellum) and the propdeums dorsal surface are indistinct; on two Z. ferox specimens, these body parts are slightly angled. The propodeal dorsums posterior margin is concave. The propleuron (the lateral exoskeletal plate of the prothorax) is well developed and the mesopleuron (the lateral exoskeleton plate of the mesothorax) is separated {{from the rest of}} the mesosoma by distinct sulci (deep grooves of the head). The propodeum is high and the propodeal spiracles (external openings) are slit-like and located around the mid-regions of the propodeal sides. The opening of the metapleural gland is semicircular and the metapleural bulla (the reservoirs) is developed. On the legs, the femora and tibiae are flattened and tibiae with anterior and posterior margins are bordered by a carina. The trochantellus (proximal end of the femur) is found on all legs, and the forelegs have patches of dense and elongated setae. The protibia has three spurs; the large spur ("calcar") is curved and the other two spurs are just as long as the <b>calcar.</b> Pretarsal claws are present with a subapical tooth.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2009, <b>Calcars</b> {{declared}} a preliminary victory, with mass-produced PHEVs and fully electric vehicles set to arrive shortly. Drivers and advocates were {{migrated to the}} Electric Auto Association (EEA), Plug In America (PIA), or the Sierra Club for further promotion of <b>CalCars</b> goal of rapidly electrifying all vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the first}} handful of Prius+ conversions, the PHEVs were {{displayed}} at multiple locations and events around the country, including the US Congress. Interest in the PHEV concept swelled, and building conversion kits for DIYers or commercial conversions took off as many {{small and large}} companies entered the space. <b>Calcars</b> worked closely with journalists and the media to further stoke interest. Dozens of books on the topic were released and reviewed by <b>Calcars.</b> <b>CalCars</b> tracked and commented on continuing developments through its listserv from 2005-2013, archived at http://www.calcars.org/news-archive.html ...|$|R

5|$|The Eastern small footed bat {{is between}} 65 and 95millimeters in length, has a {{wingspan}} of 210 to 250millimeters, and weighs between 4 and 8grams. The bat {{got its name}} from its abnormally small hind feet, which are only 7 to 8 millimeters long. The fur on the dorsal side of their body is dark at the roots, and fades to a light brown at the tips, which gives the bats a signature shiny, yellow-brown appearance. The fur on the dorsal {{side of the body}} is a dull gray color, which is believed to help camouflage themselves in their hibernacula. The defining characteristic of this bat is its face-mask, which is completely black. They also have black ears, wings and interfemoral membrane, (the membrane between the legs and tail). Like all bats, the Eastern small-footed bat has a patagium that connects the body to the forelimbs and tail, allowing the animal to fly. Their head is very flat and short, with a forehead that slopes gradually away from the rostrum, a feature that is unique to other individuals in the Myotis species. They have erect ears, which are very broad at the base and a short flat nose. They have a keeled <b>calcar</b> (protruding cartridge on the hind legs to support the interfemoral membrane) as well as a pointed tragus Their tail is between 25-45 millimeters in length and protrudes past their interfemoral membrane, and they have a dental formula of 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3.|$|E
25|$|The last {{subgroup}} {{is formed}} by species that present petals oblique to the column. Two have petals and sepals marked with other colors: Bifrenaria clavigera, {{that has a}} <b>calcar</b> formed by the fusion of the lateral sepals bases, and Bifrenaria silvana where the <b>calcar</b> {{is a result of}} their superposition; Bifrenaria leucorhoda has white flowers with labellum veined of pink color. The two remaining species have highly similar yellow flowers, although of diverse sizes, the smaller and often paler is Bifrenaria stefanae, the larger and of brighter color is Bifrenaria vitellina.|$|E
25|$|The first {{subgroup}} {{is formed}} by the two Amazonian species, with elongated rhizome: Bifrenaria venezuelana, that has short inflorescence and highly reduced calcar; and Bifrenaria longicornis, with long inflorescence and noticeable <b>calcar.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>CalCars</b> {{worked with}} allied {{organizations}} to build buyer demand for PHEVs in the United States and promote commercial production of plug-in hybrid vehicles by major automakers. It engaged {{in public education}} through its web site calcars.org. It displayed its +100 mpg PHEVs at public and private events, showed promotional videos, and makes presentations to different audiences, including political leaders and opinion-makers. <b>CalCars</b> also promoted technology development for PHEVs by building example plug-in hybrid vehicles, and maintaining open-source documentation of technological information about its prototypes.

25|$|Evening bats have {{relatively}} robust jaws, {{compared to other}} insectivorous bats. They have an unkeeled <b>calcar</b> and a short, round tragus. The curvature of the tragus helps distinguish it from bats of the genus Myotis, which otherwise look very similar. Their skull has one upper incisor on each side with 4 molariform teeth.|$|E
25|$|The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) is a {{medium-sized}} mouse-eared bat native to North America. It lives primarily in southern and midwestern {{states and in}} parts of the south of the United States and is listed as an endangered species. The Indiana bat is gray, black, or chestnut in color and is 1.2–2inches and weighs 4.5 – 9.5 grams (0.16 – 0.34 oz.). It is similar in appearance to the more common little brown bat but is distinguished by its feet size, toe hair length, pink lips and a keel on the <b>calcar.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1564 a {{prominent}} feature {{on the floor}} of the Lateral ventricles of the brain was named the hippocampus by Aranzi as its curved shape on each side supposedly reminded him of a seahorse, the Hippocampus (apart from a spell after Mayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by others until 1829). At that same time a ridge on the occipital horn was named the <b>calcar</b> avis, but in 1786 this was renamed the hippocampus minor, with the hippocampus being called the hippocampus major.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 2008, <b>CalCars</b> {{started to}} address the problem that the rate of market {{penetration}} (as a percentage of new vehicles into the national and international fleet) would be remarkably slow, even with optimistic assumptions. To accelerate the electrification of transportation and all of its consequent benefits, <b>CalCars</b> started an unsuccessful initiative: spurring the growth of a new industry that converts existing internal combustion engine vehicles into plug-ins.|$|R

25|$|The {{length of}} the Indiana bat's head to the body is from 4.1-4.9 centimeters. The animal weighs about 1/4 an ounce. These bats are very {{difficult}} to distinguish from other species, especially the more common little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), unless examined closely. The size of the feet, the {{length of the}} toe hairs, and the presence of a keel on the <b>calcar</b> are characteristics used to differentiate the Indiana bat from other bats. Indiana bats live an average of 5 to 9 years, but some have reached 12 years of age. It can have fur from black to chestnut with a light gray to cinnamon belly. Unlike other common bats with brown hair and black lips, the Indiana bat has brown hair and pink lips, which is helpful for identification.|$|E
500|$|Another {{reference}} {{appeared with}} the term pes hippocampi, which may date back to Diemerbroeck in 1672, introducing a comparison with {{the shape of the}} folded back forelimbs and webbed feet of the mythological hippocampus, a sea monster with a horse's forequarters and a fish's tail. The hippocampus was then described as pes hippocampi major, with an adjacent bulge in the occipital horn, described as the pes hippocampi minor and later renamed as the <b>calcar</b> avis. The renaming of the hippocampus as hippocampus major, and the <b>calcar</b> avis as hippocampus minor, has been attributed to Félix Vicq-d'Azyr systematising nomenclature of parts of the brain in 1786. [...] Mayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by some other authors until Karl Friedrich Burdach resolved this error in 1829. In 1861 the hippocampus minor became the centre of a dispute over human evolution between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen, satirised as the Great Hippocampus Question. The term hippocampus minor fell from use in anatomy textbooks, and was officially removed in the Nomina Anatomica of 1895. Today, the structure is just called the hippocampus, {{with the term}} Cornu Ammonis surviving in the names of the hippocampal subfields CA1–CA4.|$|E

2500|$|The {{key point}} that Owen {{asserted}} was that only humans had {{part of the}} brain then known as the hippocampus minor (now called the <b>calcar</b> avis), and that this gave us our unique abilities.

2500|$|Bifrenaria {{flowers are}} {{strongly}} scented, they have sepals {{slightly larger than}} the petals, with the lateral ones basally united to the column foot forming a <b>calcar</b> with truncated extremity.The column is slightly arching, generally without wings or any other appendages, bearing a foot [...] which the labellum is hinged to, whose shape varies, articulated to the column, with a longitudinal channeled callus often with a basal claw. Flowers show two elongated stipes, hardy ever one, at least twice longer than wide, with salient viscidium, visible caudicles and retinacle in inverted positions. The superposed pollinia number four, and are protected by a deciduous incumbent anther. Fruits are green, erect or pendulous; they take about eight months to ripe and hold hundreds of thousand yellowish or brownish elongated seeds up to 0.35mm long. Among all the mentioned, the main characteristic distinguishing Bifrenaria from its closest relatives {{is the presence of}} the <b>calcar.</b> Other important characters are the four-sided single-leaved pseudobulbs besides the raceme inflorescence with two to ten flowers.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1833, {{an unknown}} species from the Serra dos Órgãos {{mountains}} of Brazil blossomed {{in the greenhouse}} of Mrs. Arnold Harrison, an English collector of orchids homaged in diverse descriptions of noted species such as Bifrenaria harrisoniae and Cattleya harrisoniana. A short time later, Mrs. Harrison sent a drawing and cutting of this plant to the botanist John Lindley, who verified it {{to be not only}} a new species but a new genus. In its description, dated the same year, Lindley suggests the name of Leptotes, from the Greek λεπτότητα for mild, delicate, in reference to the appearance of the plant's flowers. He affirmed that Leptotes was similar to Tetramicra, from which it is distinguished by the structures of the pollinarium and by the smaller lateral lobes of the lip petal; and because they have no <b>calcar</b> attached to the ovarium. He also differentiated it from [...] Brassavola by the pollinia and trilobed lip.
