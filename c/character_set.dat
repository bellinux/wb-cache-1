5|$|Fans of the <b>{{character}}</b> <b>set</b> up {{campaigns to}} get Ford {{back as a}} main character later in season two or season three. They sent various petitions to the producers, cast and crew of Stargate Atlantis to change their minds. Fans of the character even put up a website under the name F.O.R.D., which in turn was also the name {{for one of the}} campaigns fighting for the revival of the character.|$|E
5|$|King Kong is a 2005 epic monster {{adventure}} film co-written, produced, {{and directed}} by Peter Jackson. A remake of the 1933 film of the same name, the film stars Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Adrien Brody, and, through motion capture, Andy Serkis as the title <b>character.</b> <b>Set</b> in 1933, King Kong {{tells the story of}} an ambitious filmmaker who coerces his cast and hired ship crew to travel to the mysterious Skull Island. There they encounter Kong, a legendary giant gorilla, whom they capture and take to New York City.|$|E
5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum <b>character</b> <b>set</b> was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E

5|$|The {{circuit board}} of Radar Scope was {{restructured}} for Donkey Kong. The Radar Scope hardware, originally {{inspired by the}} Namco Galaxian hardware, was designed for {{a large number of}} enemies moving around at high speeds, which Donkey Kong did not require, so the development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced the scale of the circuit board. While the gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated ROM chips, the existing CPU, sound hardware and monitor were left intact. The <b>character</b> <b>set,</b> scoreboard, upper HUD display and font are almost identical to Radar Scope, with palette differences. The Donkey Kong hardware had the memory capacity for displaying 128 foreground sprites at 16x16 pixels each and 256 background tiles at 8x8 pixels each. Mario and all moving objects used single sprites, the taller Pauline used two sprites, and the larger Donkey Kong used six sprites.|$|E
5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum <b>character</b> <b>set</b> or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Brown {{expanded}} the <b>character</b> <b>set</b> {{to include more}} features; in the revised version: a comparatively short skull with a high helmet-like crest formed by nasals, prefrontals and frontals; the nasals not being separated in front by premaxillaries; a narrow beak, expanded section {{in front of the}} elongated nares; a small narial opening; a vertebral formula of 15 cervicals, 19 dorsals, 8 sacrals, and 61+ caudals; possession of dorsal spines of a medium height; high anterior caudal spines; long chevrons; long scapulae, possessing a blade of medium width; a radius considerably longer than humerus; comparatively short metacarpals; an anteriorly decurved ilium; a long ischium with a foot-like terminal expansion; a pubis with an anterior blade that is short and broadly expanded at end; a femur that is longer than the tibia; the phalanges of pes are short; that the integument over the sides and tail composed of polygonal tuberculate scales without pattern but graded in size {{in different parts of the}} body; and a belly with longitudinal rows of large conical limpet-like scales separated by uniformly large polygonal tubercles. Again, the presumed traits of the snout are incorrect because Brown confused the praemaxillae with the nasal bones and the nasal bones with the frontals. Most of the postcranial traits are today known to be shared with other lambeosaurines.|$|E

50|$|ECI allows usually {{unsupported}} national <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> such as Arabic, Greek, or Japanese {{to be used}} in barcode symbols. In theory, a barcode symbol {{could use}} several <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> by embedding several ECI codes.|$|R
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's <b>character</b> <b>set</b> offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{movable type}} invented by Bi Sheng was {{ultimately}} trumped {{by the use}} of woodblock printing due to the limitations of the enormous Chinese character writing system, yet movable type printing continued to be used and was improved in later periods. The Yuan dynasty scholar-official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) implemented a faster typesetting process, improved Bi's baked-clay movable type <b>character</b> <b>set</b> with a wooden one, and experimented with tin-metal movable type. The wealthy printing patron Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming dynasty established China's first metal movable type (using bronze) in 1490. In 1638 the Beijing Gazette switched their printing process from woodblock to movable type printing. Yet it was during the Qing dynasty that massive printing projects began to employ movable type printing. This includes the printing of sixty-six copies of a 5,020 volume long encyclopedia in 1725, the Gujin Tushu Jicheng (Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times), which necessitated the crafting of 250,000 movable type characters cast in bronze. By the 19th century the European style printing press replaced the old Chinese methods of movable type, while traditional woodblock printing in modern East Asia is used sparsely and for aesthetic reasons.|$|E

25|$|BBSes were {{generally}} text-based, rather than GUI-based, and early BBSes conversed using the simple ASCII <b>character</b> <b>set.</b> However, some home computer manufacturers extended the ASCII <b>character</b> <b>set</b> {{to take advantage}} of the advanced color and graphics capabilities of their systems. BBS software authors included these extended character sets in their software, and terminal program authors included the ability to display them when a compatible system was called. Atari's native <b>character</b> <b>set</b> was known as ATASCII, while most Commodore BBSes supported PETSCII. PETSCII was also supported by the nationwide online service Quantum Link.|$|E
50|$|The ISO-8859 {{series of}} 8-bit <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> encodes all Latin <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> used in Europe, albeit {{that the same}} code points have {{multiple}} uses that caused some difficulty.

50|$|The 026 could {{print the}} punched {{character}} above each column.

50|$|While {{there is}} no truly general solution, there has been {{considerable}} work in both in transliteration nonroman <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> Soundex and related systems help search biographical databases by phonetics, but transliterated <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> allow people not fully fluent in the written language to search for names.|$|R
25|$|This {{changed with}} the {{introduction}} of the HP82240B printer in 1989 and the HP48 series in 1990, which came with a new <b>character</b> <b>set</b> now based on ECMA94/ ISO8859-1 instead of HPRoman-8, but with the control codes in the range 128 to 159 (0x80 to 0x9F) being replaced by additional displayable characters. Compared to ISO8859-1, codepoint 127 (0x7F) showed a medium shaded gray box like in the former HPRoman-8 based <b>character</b> <b>set.</b> Code points 131 (0x83) to 142 (0x8E) were also taken over from the former HPRoman-8 based <b>character</b> <b>set.</b> In addition to this, codepoint 31 (0x1F) was used for ellipsis (…) and codepoints 169 (0xA9) and 174 (0xAE) showed ambiguous glyphs which could be viewed as inverse circled numbers ❸ or copyright (©) and as ❷ or registered trademark (®), respectively. This first version of the <b>character</b> <b>set</b> also had a non-breaking space at position 160 (0xA0).|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for Hong Kong people to learn {{traditional}} Chinese characters in school, and some simplified Chinese in passing (either through reading mainland-published books or other media). For use on computers, however, people tend to type Chinese characters using a traditional <b>character</b> <b>set</b> such as Big5. In Hong Kong, as well as elsewhere, it {{is common for}} people who use both sets to do so because {{it is much easier to}} convert from the traditional <b>character</b> <b>set</b> to the simplified <b>character</b> <b>set</b> because of the usage of the aforementioned methods 8 and 9 of simplification.|$|E
25|$|Particularly vexing was the Selectric's {{lack of a}} full ASCII <b>character</b> <b>set.</b> The late Bob Bemer {{wrote that}} while working for IBM he lobbied unsuccessfully to expand the typing element to 64 {{characters}} from 44. The Selectric actually provided 44 characters per case, but the point remains that with 88 printable characters it could not quite produce the full printable ASCII <b>character</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E
