5|$|Here <b>Come</b> <b>the</b> Warm Jets was {{released}} in January 1974. The album was one of Brian Eno's best-selling releases, charting for two weeks and peaking at number 26 on the UK Albums Chart on 9 March 1974, and number 151 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart. Eno planned a tour with the band The Winkies to accompany him following the release of Here <b>Come</b> <b>the</b> Warm Jets. Eno had to depart the tour after being diagnosed with a collapsed lung. After recovering, Eno played at an Island Records 1 June 1974 concert with fellow musicians Nico, Kevin Ayers and John Cale.|$|E

2500|$|Harrison's {{handwritten}} lyrics for [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Moon" [...] are dated 25 February, the {{day after}} his 35th birthday. The song's nature-related theme matches that of much of his previous work, including [...] "All Things Must Pass", [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Sun" [...] and [...] "Blow Away". Due to the similarity of its title with [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Sun", the song has invited interpretation as a sequel to that 1969 Harrison composition. Author Ian Inglis writes that the two songs differ significantly, however, in that while [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Sun" [...] adopts the arrival of sunshine as a metaphor for hope and an end to a dark emotional mood, [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Moon" [...] focuses purely on the moment itself, rather than what the moon's appearance might suggest. While also viewing the songs as having little in common aside from their titles, Harrison biographer Simon Leng considers that [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Moon" [...] shares the earlier composition's theme of escape.|$|R

God created the five original female hunters by biting off her left arm, each of her fingers becoming a Quintaglio. They wished to create as God did, so she bit off her right arm and these became the first males, the mates of the original hunters.|$|R
5|$|Cooke {{began to}} improve the team {{significantly}} and was responsible for shifts in the Gophers' scheduling that foreshadowed other changes to <b>come.</b> <b>The</b> team never played a YMCA team after the 1903–04 season, and beginning in 1900, began to schedule large neighboring universities that would join Minnesota in Big Ten competition. This shift to playing similar competition helped the Gophers {{to become one of}} the premier programs in the nation. From the 1899–00 to 1903–04 seasons, the Gophers had a 59–6 record. The 1901–02 squad has been retroactively named the national champions by both the Helms Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll; the Premo-Porretta poll also names the 1902–03 Gophers as national champions. When the Big Ten established basketball in 1905, the Gophers won the first two conference titles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{weekend of the}} season Manchester United faced Leicester City at Old Trafford, and went a goal down within seven minutes; Muzzy Izzet’s cross was met by Emile Heskey to scuff {{the ball into the}} net before Tony Cottee– the scorer in the {{previous}} season’s corresponding fixture– added a second with fifteen minutes remaining. Teddy Sheringham’s intervention and a last gasp free kick by David Beckham helped the home side salvage a point, setting a precedent for things to <b>come.</b> <b>The</b> team's first away game at West Ham followed, but despite the debut of striker Dwight Yorke, United were held to a goalless draw. Beckham, who had become a national hate figure after his dismissal in the World Cup, received a torrid reception by the home supporters, with every touch of the ball made by him jeered at. Bottles and stones were directed at the team coach prior to kick-off. After the game Ferguson, his players, and the Manchester United staff refused to be interviewed by the press or television.|$|E

Shortly after finishing The Quatermass Xperiment, he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with, as the title character in Dixon of Dock Green (1955–76). Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a running joke in the film involving Lomax's futile attempts to find the time to have a shave with his electric razor.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups: the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages– Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive– and the Q-Celtic, from which <b>come</b> <b>the</b> Goidelic languages– Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script {{of their own and}} all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place-name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica.|$|E

5|$|One {{factor that}} helped Tillman and his {{movement}} in the 1890 campaign was the organization of many South Carolina farmers {{under the auspices of}} the Farmers' Alliance. The Alliance, which had spread through much of the agricultural South and West since its origin in Texas, sought to get farmers to work together cooperatively and seek reform. From that organization would <b>come</b> <b>the</b> People's Party (better known as the Populists). Although the Populist Party played a significant role in the politics of the 1890s, it did not do so in South Carolina, where Tillman had already channeled agricultural discontent into an attempt to take over the Democratic Party. The Alliance in South Carolina generally backed Tillman, and its many local farmers' organizations gave Tillman new venues for his speeches.|$|E
