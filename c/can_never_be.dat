The final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is the greatest common divisor of a and b. The number N cannot be infinite because there are only a finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder r0 and zero.|$|E

Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that they <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> together because they have vastly different lives. They part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him leave. As he is walking away into the airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries {{to make up for}} his mistakes by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two drive back to their apartment.|$|E

5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E
5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is {{greater than or equal to}} F'N+1 which in turn is greater than or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

Harsha kidnaps Indu and takes her to Bhairavakona and in the process, Ghora is accidentally killed by Raghuveer. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived; she reunites with Harsha.

5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} the galactic equator is an entirely {{arbitrary}} line and <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> precisely drawn, because {{it is impossible to}} determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Dirac's second-order {{perturbation}} theory can involve virtual photons, transient intermediate {{states of the}} electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy , and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, virtual photons may {{have three or four}} polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of renormalization.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> treated merely as means to ends; they must always also {{be treated as}} ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{examiner}} Blythe (Wendy Hughes) {{leaves her}} visiting son Danny (Stivi Paskoski) {{with her boyfriend}} Bolander (Ned Beatty) for the day, with the hopes they will {{get to know each}} other better. Danny rides along with Bolander and Munch (Richard Belzer) on their murder investigations, but acts very wild and constantly asks inappropriate questions. At dinner later, Danny asks Bolander about his sex life with Danny's mother, making Bolander extremely uncomfortable. Bolander later tells Blythe he believes her son is crazy. Meanwhile, Crosetti (Jon Polito) spends a lot of time with his friend Officer Chris Thormann (Lee Tergesen), who is recovering from a recent shooting that has left him blind. At one point, Thormann defecates on himself and is humiliated, but Crosetti helps him clean up. Thormann's wife, Eva (Edie Falco), tells Crosetti she is pregnant, but that her husband reacted angrily to the news. Thormann tells Crosetti he should have died at the hospital and <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> a good father, but Crosetti encourages him.|$|E
5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; {{he decided that he}} did not have the {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of confidentiality, the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach of confidentiality <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E

However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
