5|$|The inner chamber {{measures}} 4.5 metres (13 feet) in length, and 1.7 metres (5 feet, 6 inches) in width, {{although it}} was potentially much larger when originally constructed. The chamber's internal height {{would have been at}} least 2 metres (6 feet, 6 inches). In its current state, the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs. One is 2.44 metres (8 feet) long, 2.29 metres (7 feet, 6 inches) deep, and 53 <b>centimetres</b> (1 foot, 9 inches) thick; the other is 1.52 <b>centimetres</b> (5 feet) long, 1.83 (6 feet) deep, and 61 <b>centimetres</b> (2 feet) thick. Conversely, the chamber's southern side consists of a single slab, measuring 3.45 metres (11 feet, 4 inches) in length, 2.21 metres (7 feet, 3 inches) in depth, and 53 <b>centimetres</b> (1 foot, 9 inches) in thickness at its eastern end.|$|E
5|$|Electronic devices {{make use}} of the transistor, {{perhaps one of the most}} {{important}} inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few <b>centimetres</b> square.|$|E
5|$|B.sessilis var. sessilis is an autonym that {{encompasses}} the type material of the species. This {{is the most}} widespread variety, occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, south-east to Albany, and inland as far as Wongan Hills, Pingelly and Kulin. Its blue-green leaves are cuneate (wedge-shaped) or oblong, and are usually two to three <b>centimetres</b> long but may reach five.|$|E
50|$|A {{kilogram-force}} {{per square}} <b>centimetre</b> (kgf/cm2), often just kilogram per square <b>centimetre</b> (kg/cm2), or kilopond per square <b>centimetre</b> is a deprecated unit of pressure using metric units. It {{is not a}} part of the International System of Units (SI), the modern metric system. 1 kgf/cm2 equals 98.0665 kilopascals.|$|R
50|$|Any unit {{of length}} gives a {{corresponding}} unit of volume: the volume of a cube whose sides have the given length. For example, a cubic <b>centimetre</b> (cm3) is the volume of a cube whose sides are one <b>centimetre</b> (1 cm) in length.|$|R
50|$|Though {{for many}} {{physical}} quantities, SI prefixes for factors of 103—like milli- and kilo-—are often preferred by technicians, the <b>centimetre</b> remains a practical {{unit of length}} for many everyday measurements. A <b>centimetre</b> is approximately {{the width of the}} fingernail of an average adult person.|$|R
5|$|Cicadas, {{unlike other}} Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight. However, {{they do not}} walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel {{distances}} greater than a few <b>centimetres.</b> Cicadas can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|E
5|$|Comparison of {{high-resolution}} images {{obtained by}} the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than previously estimated. A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two <b>centimetres</b> of regolith a hundred times more quickly than previous models suggestedon a timescale of 81,000 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Friedrichstraße {{station was}} rebuilt; the long-distance {{section of the}} station was {{expanded}} to four tracks and the current station hall was built. Between 1922 and 1932, the Stadtbahn viaduct was thoroughly modernised in order to handle the ever-increasing train weight. Also, the train sheds of Alexanderplatz and Schlesischer Bahnhof were replaced. The suburban line's platforms were raised to a height of 96 <b>centimetres.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Metric tonnes per <b>centimetre</b> {{immersion}} (usually {{abbreviated to}} TPC or TPCMI) {{is the number}} of metric tonnes (1,000 kg) that need to be loaded on the ship for the salt water draft (draught) to increase by one <b>centimetre.</b> The TPCMI is used to calculate the draft of the vessel with a given deadweight tonnage of cargo loaded. For a typical Panamax bulk carrier with a TPCMI of 80, the ship will sink (i.e., its draft will increase) by one <b>centimetre</b> for every 80 tonnes of cargo loaded.|$|R
50|$|Reciprocal length or inverse {{length is}} a {{measurement}} used in several branches {{of science and}} mathematics. As the reciprocal of length, common units used for this measurement include the reciprocal metre or inverse metre (m&minus;1), the reciprocal <b>centimetre</b> or inverse <b>centimetre</b> (cm&minus;1), and, in optics, the dioptre.|$|R

5|$|In March 2011, Emery's {{injury and}} undefeated {{return to the}} NHL with the Anaheim Ducks {{garnered}} much media attention and fascination, with a special segment featured on CBC's Hockey Night in Canada. Remarkably, Emery currently has 13 <b>centimetres</b> of bone missing from his leg. This later garnered him a nomination for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mobilisation}} the men of the AIF were selected under some of the toughest criterion of any army in World War I and it is believed that roughly 30 per cent of men that applied were rejected on medical grounds. In order to enlist, men had to be aged between 18 and 35 years of age (although it is believed that men as old as 70 and as young as 14 managed to enlist), and they had to be at least five foot six inches tall (168 <b>centimetres),</b> with a chest measurement of at least 34inches (86 <b>centimetres).</b> Many of these strict requirements were lifted later in the war, however, as the need for replacements grew. Indeed, casualties among the initial volunteers were so high, that of the 32,000 original soldiers of the AIF only 7,000 would survive {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Physical damage {{can also}} reduce the value of carrot crops. The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a {{longitudinal}} crack develops during growth {{that can be a}} few <b>centimetres</b> to {{the entire length of the}} root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest. These disorders can affect over 30% of commercial crops. Factors associated with high levels of splitting include wide plant spacing, early sowing, lengthy growth durations, and genotype.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, most texts, {{following}} Owen's {{estimate of}} 1841, give a body length of thirty feet or nine metres for Megalosaurus. The {{lack of an}} articulated dorsal vertebral series {{makes it difficult to}} determine an exact size. David Bruce Norman in 1984 thought Megalosaurus was seven to eight metres long. Gregory S. Paul in 1988 estimated the weight tentatively at 1.1 tonnes, given a thighbone seventy-six <b>centimetres</b> long. The trend in the early twenty-first century to limit the material to the lectotype inspired even lower estimates, disregarding outliers of uncertain identity. Paul in 2010 stated Megalosaurus was six metres long and seven hundred kilogrammes heavy. However, the same year Benson claimed that Megalosaurus, though medium-sized, was still among the largest of Middle Jurassic theropods. Specimen BMNH 31806, a thighbone 803 millimetres long, would indicate a body weight of 943 kilogrammes, using the extrapolation method of J.F. Anderson — which method, optimised for mammals, tends to underestimate theropod masses by at least a third. Furthermore, thighbone specimen OUM J13561 has a length of about eighty-six <b>centimetres.</b>|$|E
5|$|When hunting a {{web spider}} in the prey's web, a P. schultzi walks very slowly towards the prey and then, when {{two to three}} <b>centimetres</b> away, pauses for some minutes. During this time the P. schultzi quivers very quickly with its whole body at regular intervals. In almost all cases the prey stays motionless. P. schultzi never plucks the web as Portia fimbriata does.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Seilacher has {{suggested}} the Ediacaran sees animals usurping giant protists {{as the dominant}} life form. The modern xenophyophores are giant single-celled protozoans found throughout the world's oceans, largely on the abyssal plain. A recent genetic study suggested that the xenophyophores are a specialised group of Foraminifera. There are approximately 42 recognised species in 13 genera and 2 orders; one of which, Syringammina fragilissima, is among the largest known protozoans at up to 20 <b>centimetres</b> in diameter.|$|E

5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} distance {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey too fast for a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns up its safety line to its vantage point and looks for another chance - and seldom misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four <b>centimetres,</b> as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, he {{recorded}} a season best of 83.43metres in June before witnessing his form gradually declining {{over the next}} months. At his first European Championships, which were held in August in Munich, he again failed to progress from the qualifying round. With a best throw of 78.36metres he finished fifteenth overall, 68 <b>centimetres</b> behind Ari Pakarinen who secured the last spot in the final. Although Thorkildsen only managed to take silver at the Norwegian championships behind Pål Arne Fagernes, his result of 83.43metres was enough to front the national top list in javelin throw for the first time.|$|E

Located opposite the circle's two shortest stones, one is thin and pointed, reaching 2.1 metres (7 feet) high, while the other is broader, measuring 1.8 metres square (6 feet by 6 feet). The largest of the stones weighs approximately 7.3 tonnes (8 tons) and would have required the efforts of many people to move and erect it.|$|E

5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 <b>centimetres,</b> while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E

In the 19th century, the mound was higher on {{the western end of}} the tomb, although during the 1920s this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath. It is probable that in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb-stones now sit.|$|E
5|$|The main {{damage done}} by mole crickets is {{as a result of}} their {{burrowing}} activities. As they tunnel through the top few <b>centimetres</b> of soil they push the ground up in little ridges, increasing evaporation of surface moisture, disturbing germinating seeds and damaging the delicate young roots of seedlings. They are also injurious to turf- and pasture-grasses as they feed on the roots of the grasses, leaving the plants prone to drying-out and damage by use.|$|E
