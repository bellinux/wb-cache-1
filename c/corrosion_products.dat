Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and <b>corrosion</b> <b>products</b> without undue removal of structural metal.

Methods which remove the minimum amount of structural material are indicated. Solvents, detergents and bead blasting are generally used. Removal of coatings by the application of heat may render the cylinder unserviceable by affecting the crystalline microstructure structure of the metal. This is a particular hazard for aluminium alloy cylinders, {{which may not be}} exposed to temperatures above those stipulated by the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the <b>corrosion</b> <b>products</b> found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum Oil Co. explained that it was almost impossible for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E

25|$|The high {{temperature}} water coolant with boric acid dissolved in it is corrosive to carbon steel (but not stainless steel); this can cause radioactive <b>corrosion</b> <b>products</b> to circulate in the primary coolant loop.

25|$|Although lead is {{the least}} {{expensive}} dense (SG=11.34) material available, it is a toxic substance causing biological damage to wildlife and humans. The Centers for Disease Control has stated that no safe level of lead exposure in children has been determined, and that once lead has been absorbed into the body, its effects cannot be corrected. Even a very small amount of exposure causes a permanent reduction in intelligence, ability to focus attention, and academic ability. Lead can be inhaled or ingested as either a metal powder or powdered <b>corrosion</b> <b>products,</b> however most lead salts have very low solubility in water, and pure lead corrodes very slowly in seawater.

The <b>corrosion</b> <b>product</b> distorted the voltammogram at UO 2 and SIMFUEL electrodes in the potential region of oxygen evolution and increased the overpotential of oxygen evolution at the electrode.

25|$|Microbial corrosion, or {{commonly}} known as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms, usually chemoautotrophs. It can apply to both metallic and non-metallic materials, in {{the presence or absence}} of oxygen. Sulfate-reducing bacteria are active in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic); they produce hydrogen sulfide, causing sulfide stress cracking. In the presence of oxygen (aerobic), some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides, other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion. Concentration cells can form in the deposits of <b>corrosion</b> <b>products,</b> leading to localized corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Passivation {{refers to}} the {{spontaneous}} formation of an ultrathin film of <b>corrosion</b> <b>products,</b> known as a passive film, on the metal's surface that act {{as a barrier to}} further oxidation. The chemical composition and microstructure of a passive film are different from the underlying metal. Typical passive film thickness on aluminium, stainless steels, and alloys is within 10 nanometers. The passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range – the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not. Passivation in natural environments such as air, water and soil at moderate pH is seen in such materials as aluminium, stainless steel, titanium, and silicon.|$|E
25|$|The {{driving force}} behind the {{development}} of bioresorbable metals is primarily due to their ability to provide metal-like mechanical properties while degrading safely in the body. This is especially relevant in orthopaedic applications, where although many surgeries only require implants to provide temporary support (allowing the surrounding tissue to heal), the majority of current bio-metals are permanent (e.g. stainless steel, titanium). Degradation of the implant means that intervention or secondary surgery will not be necessary to remove the material {{at the end of its}} functional life, providing significant savings in both cost and time for the patient and health care system. In addition, the <b>corrosion</b> <b>products</b> of current bio-metals (which will still corrode in the body to some degree) can generally not be considered biocompatible.|$|E
40|$|In the {{lead-acid}} storage battery, the antimonial-lead grids which {{support the}} lead-dioxide active material usually fail by corrosion which occurs in two stages. In {{the first stage}} {{the attack on the}} lead-antimony alloy was uniform and nonselective.

Corrosion proceeded at a faster rate in the areas of eutectic between individual pr imary lead dendrites and in particular at grain boundaries.

This {{presentation}} {{summarizes the}} on-going {{development of an}} information system used to predict corrosion of metals and alloys by high temperature gases found in many different oil refining, petrochemical, power generation, and chemical processes.

The data {{are the result of}} tests with well-defined conditions lasting thousands of hours. Oxidation has been emphasized with many exposures lasting several years of time. The corrosion data archived and the resulting corrosion predictions represent total metal penetration, which includes both surface recession and subsurface corrosion. The system manages corrosion data from well-defined exposures and determines <b>corrosion</b> <b>product</b> stabilities.
