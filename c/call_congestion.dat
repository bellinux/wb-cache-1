40|$|We {{propose a}} new multirate {{teletraffic}} loss {{model for the}} calculation of time and <b>call</b> <b>congestion</b> probabilities in CDMA-based networks that accommodate calls of different serviceclasses whose arrival follows a batched Poisson process. The latter is more "peaked" and "bursty" than the ordinary Poisson process. The acceptance of calls in the system {{is based on the}} partial batch blocking discipline. This policy accepts a part of the batch (one or more calls) and discards the rest if the available resources are not enough to accept the whole batch. The proposed model takes into account the multiple access interference, the notion of local (soft) blocking, user’s activity and the interference cancellation. Although the analysis of the model does not lead to a product form solution of the steady state probabilities, we show that the calculation of the call-level performance metrics, time and <b>call</b> <b>congestion</b> probabilities, can be based on approximate but recursive formulas.

We study the performance, at call-level, of a CDMA cell with interference cancellation capabilities, while {{assuming that the}} cell accommodates different service-classes of batched Poisson arriving calls. The partial batch blocking discipline is applied for Call Admission Control (CAC). To guarantee certain Quality of Service (QoS) for each service-class, the Bandwidth Reservation (BR) policy is incorporated in the CAC; i. e., a fraction of system resources is reserved for high-speed service-classes.

40|$|Abstract — Optical {{networks}} with book-ahead bandwidth schedulers {{are being}} deployed {{to meet the}} high-speed and predictable-service networking requirements of applications in the scientific research community. We present an analytical model for a single-link book-ahead bandwidth scheduler, which responds to advance reservation requests with the first-available time interval in which a channel is available. The link {{is assumed to be}} divided into m channels, and time is discretized into intervals. Our proposed model is a non-homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain, which has an embedded discrete-time Markov chain. We solve the model for <b>call</b> <b>congestion,</b> mean scheduling delay, and link utilization. This model can be used by network designers to select the size of the reservation window, K, in timeinterval units, corresponding to a desired set of values for the output metrics, for a given value of m. For example, when m is 8, increasing the reservation window beyond 4 intervals does not affect the <b>call</b> <b>congestion</b> or system utilization, but causes the mean scheduling delay to increase.

40|$|In this lesson, {{we learn}} about models used for {{circuit-switched}} networks. We start with an M/M/m/ m model, also called the m-server loss system [1]. We note here that [2], page 379 states that a system with a finite customer population will always be stable, no matter what value of ρ. This statement is made for any finite state space MC. Does this explain why in M/M/m/m model we often talk about ρ being 1, 10, 100 - see [3], pg. 235. Unlike in the M/M/m case, here ρ or offered load is defined to be λ ⁄ µ. In the M/M/m case, recall, we defined ρ to be λ ⁄ (mµ). In Section 1, we derive the Erlang-B formula for an infinite population. In Section 2, we derive the simple time congestion or blocking probability for a finite population model, called the Engset for-mula. In Section 3, we show the difference between <b>call</b> <b>congestion</b> or call loss probability and time congestion. For these two sections, refer to [6], page 518 - 521. Both [4] and [6] refer to [5] for the dif-ference between time congestion and <b>call</b> <b>congestion.</b> Section 4 describes the recursion formulation for numerically computing the Engset call loss probabilities from [4]. Section 5 derives the Blocked Call Queueing (BCQ) equations. Only the system in Section 1 is characterized using the queueing theory notation. In Sections 2 - 5, we are modeling {{a system in which}} the number of sources is limited. There is no place to indicate the number of sources from which jobs arrive in the Kendall notation. The last two numbers are for num-ber of servers, and number of jobs in the system. Thus the BCQ derivation for mean waiting delay is different from the mean delay derivations for M/M/ 1, M/M/m type queues that we learned in an ear-lier lesson. This lesson is entirely on the single-link case and is hence more about TDM/FDM sharing on a single link rather than circuit-switched networks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{the telecom}} network traffic {{environment}} is composed mostly of emerging multirate services whose calls can tolerate bandwidth compression either by extending their service-time (elastic services) or not (adaptive services). The coexistence of elastic and adaptive services makes the call-level performance analysis {{and evaluation of}} modern networks much more complicated. To contribute, in this paper, we present a new multirate loss model for elastic and adaptive services with finite traffic-source population. Thus, the call arrival process is a quasi-random process which is, in many cases, a more realistic consideration than a random (Poisson) process. The proposed model {{does not have a}} product form solution, and therefore, we propose approximate but recursive formulas for the efficient calculation of the call-level performance metrics, such as time and <b>call</b> <b>congestion</b> probabilities and link utilization.

40|$|The all-optical WDM (wavelength {{division}} multiplex) networks transmit {{signals from}} {{end to end}} across intermediate nodes without conversion to and from electrical form. This reduces delay, but imposes a new restriction not seen in electrically switched networks, the wavelength continuity constraint: Each link in the network can transmit using a limited number of colours (wavelengths), and when routing a connection, all links along the route must use the same colour. This added constraint increases the probability of network congestion. We present a novel way of using existing analytical network analysis tools to perform this estimation, changing only the link/route table which is passed to the analyzer. Assuming Poisson distributed arrival processes, we perform the analysis on some small example networks, and find that the end-to-end <b>call</b> <b>congestion</b> decreases for WDM networks as the number of wavelengths available per link increases. For direct (one-hop) connections, congestion is lower in the WDM network than in the electronically switched counterpart, whereas indirect connections (multi-hop) experience higher congestion, because the wavelength constraint is enforced. As the routing problem with the wavelength continuity constraint is NP-complete, we cannot hope to find efficient algorithms for exact calculation of large networks, and a topic for future research is to find methods for good approximations. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a multirate {{teletraffic}} loss {{model of a}} single link that accommodates elastic and adaptive services whose calls come from a finite traffic-source population. This call arrival process {{is known as a}} quasi-random process and is used in traffic modelling when the number of users who generate traffic is relatively small compared to the sys-tem capacity. In-service elastic and adaptive calls can tolerate bandwidth compression by extending their remaining service-time (elastic calls) or not (adaptive calls). In this loss system, we study the effect of the bandwidth reservation policy on time congestion probabilities, <b>call</b> <b>congestion</b> probabilities and link utilization. The bandwidth reservation policy is considered when a certain quality of service for each service-class is required and is essential to be guaranteed. The proposed model does not have a product form solution, and therefore we propose approximate but recursive formulas for the efficient calculation of the above mentioned performance measures. The accuracy and consistency of the proposed model are verified by simulation and is found to be quite satisfactory.

40|$|First, {{we review}} an {{extension}} of the Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM), namely the multirate batched Poisson loss model, in which calls of each service-class arrive in a link of certain capacity following a batch Poisson process and compete for the available link bandwidth under the Complete Sharing (CS) policy. The batch size is generally distributed while the batch blocking discipline is the partial batch blocking, i. e. depending on the available link bandwidth a part of an arriving batch can be accepted while the rest of it is discarded. Second, we propose the multirate batched Poisson loss model under the Bandwidth Reservation (BR) policy. The importance of this proposal is that we can guarantee specific QoS at call-level for each service-class. For the application of the BR policy in the multirate batched Poisson loss model, we study two methods already used in the EMLM: a) the Roberts ’ and b) the Stasiak-Glabowski (S&G) method. The new model (with BR) does not have a product form solution and therefore we propose approximate but recursive formulas for the calculation of various performance measures, such as time and <b>call</b> <b>congestion</b> probabilities and the link utilization.

30|$|It {{should be}} stressed, however, {{that both the}} number of sectors in a base station {{and the number of}} cells added to RNC can {{substantially}} differ depending on the solutions preferred by given producers of network devices for UMTS. In the UMTS network, priorities can be assigned to particular services. Priorities define the sequence of resource allocation. This sequence may result, in the case of services with lower priority, in a decrease in the amount of resources or may even enforce a termination of a service (in an instance when there are no sufficient resources to be allocated to services with higher priority). The decision of whether a priority is allocated or not is made by the network operator who defines its importance (significance) in the core network. Hence, the call service process of calls with different priorities is carried out both in the radio part {{as well as in the}} resources of Iub interfaces of the access part of the UMTS network. The execution of prioritization means that the traffic management mechanism implemented at the call admission control (CAC) and/or <b>call</b> <b>congestion</b> control (CCC) levels, which are usually executed in the RNC software, is being used. In practice, many operators execute the prioritization of services in such a way as to make it imperceptible to users, while the priorities assigned to different categories of users are visible. Generally, the available categories of users are labelled as platinum, gold, silver, and bronze, while each of the groups included is assigned appropriate service parameters, e.g., through the allocation of specific priorities [9, 10]. The process of defining priorities is executed at both the radio interface level and the Iub resource level.|$|E

These algorithms have been analysed in environments where applications have stable requirements on the anticipated transmission rate, however recent use of TCP with applications that exhibit significant variation in transmission rate present a new challenge, especially when these applications need to share a capacity-limited internet bottleneck. This paper investigates a technique <b>called</b> <b>Congestion</b> Window Validation (CWV) that seeks to modify TCP when flows do not utilise the full capacity allowed by the congestion window. This change is expected to reduce the impact of application-limited flows on other flows, by limiting the rate at which these applications can transmit following an idle or application-limited period, while allowing applications to appropriately restore their traffic rate when they cease being idle.
