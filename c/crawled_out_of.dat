5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the bedroom door and called to her brother, then {{closed the door and}} placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E
25|$|At zero {{hour the}} {{creeping}} bombardment began and infantry <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their trenches, the first men pulling the following troops over the parapet. The British began {{to follow the}} creeping barrage, a moderate German counter-barrage fell short of Snag Trench and massed machine-gun fire began from the flanks, causing many casualties as the British troops struggled through the mud at walking-pace. The remaining men of the 1/8th DLI got close to Butte Trench, where they were also hit by British artillery and Stokes mortar fire and then retired to Snag Trench, leaving wounded and stragglers in shell-holes. On the right flank, a supporting Australian attack failed when the Australian artillery barrage fell behind the front line and a machine-gun barrage was so inaccurate that bullets hit the DLI trenches. In the centre the 1/6th DLI was held up {{on the right and}} on the left managed to overrun Gird Trench and form a strong point. The attack of the 1/9th DLI on the left flank, took the quarry, overran the butte and established a machine-gun position, advanced to Gird Trench and dug in on the Albert–Bapaume road. By noon, the 1/6th DLI were held up in Maxwell Trench and the 1/9th DLI had consolidated at the quarry, Gird Trench, Gird Support Trench and Butte Alley.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{references}} to Illuminatus! and themselves were in keeping with Drummond and Cauty's tradition, this was also in part {{intended to be a}} self-parodying dredge of The KLF's [...] "myth".

No comeback has ever worked. The motivation behind the comeback has never and {{will never be the same}} as when the group or artist first <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their sub-cult.... If there was fresh original talent, it is now tired and tested, only capable of flicking the nostalgia switch." [...] Designing 2K's parody of the comeback, Drummond wrote that he and Cauty were [...] "getting totally into the institution of The Comeback, drawing on the sad, pathetic nature of the whole thing, the desperation of all concerned to exploit whatever they can from the myth...".|$|E

2500|$|Col. Manning Force, the {{commander}} of the 20th Ohio Infantry Regiment, heard the rebel yell, followed by the sounds of musketry, and panicked. He ordered his regiment to charge, running through the nearly impassable tangle and then leaping into the creek bed. There his men must have been stricken with horror at their mistake—the rest of the division was holding its ground to the rear, and the walls of the creek were too steep to either move forwards or retreat. [...] Luckily the creek made a turn here, and the soldiers utilized it as a bunker as they traded blows with the right battalion of the 7th Texas Infantry, the ends of the Texans' rifles discharging just inches away as the Confederates utilized {{the other side of the}} creek bed in the same manner. Force <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the creek bed with difficulty and sought help from the rest of the division, begging Colonel Richards of the 20th Illinois Volunteer Infantry regiment to move forward and connect the Federal line.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there was}} also some {{negative}} reception of the character, described by Matt Slagle of Associated Press as [...] "outrageously proportioned". In a review of Emergence, Computer Gaming World criticized the [...] "cringe-inducing scenes [...] villainous sexpot Elexis Sinclaire's digitized boobs practically slapping you in the face." [...] Phaedra Boinodiris from WomenGamers.com, talking to GamesRadar in 2007, used Elexis {{as an example of}} game characters [...] "sexualized to the point of deformity" [...] as she looked [...] "like she <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an S club." [...] In 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked Elexis from the original SiN as the sixth [...] "most unrealistic and sexist depiction of women in games". In 2012, Shelby Reiches of Cheat Code Central included [...] "Elexis' Hidden Button" [...] scene among the four worst cinematic scenes in games, commenting that [...] "the player's final confrontation with villain Elexis Sinclaire, already dolled up to look like a stereotypical sex worker, involves her 'out-smarting' the player by evoking Basic Instincts Sharon Stone. Elexis, however, lacks her inspiration's sophistication," [...] and calling it not as much as provocative but rather [...] "awkward and nonsensical".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Two {{species of}} {{earthworms}} {{were used to}} unravel why some earthworm species <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the soil at night after heavy rain. Specimens of Amynthas gracilis, which show this behavior, {{were found to have}} poor tolerance to water immersion and a diurnal rhythm of oxygen consumption, using more oxygen at night than during the day. The other species, Pontoscolex corethrurus, survived longer under water and was never observed to <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the soil after heavy rain; its oxygen consumption was not only lower than that of A. gracilis but also lacked a diurnal rhythm. Accordingly, we suggest that earthworms have at least two types of physical strategies to deal with water immersion and attendant oxygen depletion of the soil. The first is represented by A. gracilis; they <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the waterlogged soil, espe-cially at night when their oxygen consumption increases. The other strategy, shown by P. corethrurus, allows the earthworms to survive at a lower concentration of oxygen due to lower consumption; these worms can therefore remain longer in oxygen-poor conditions, and never <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the soil after heavy rain. Additional key words: rain, earthworm crawling, oxygen consumption Darwin (1881) observed that, after heavy rain, man...|$|R
