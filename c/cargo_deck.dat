5|$|On 4 June 1927, a {{crowd of}} 7,000 well-wishers saw City of Honolulu depart on her maiden voyage. The festivities were also {{broadcast}} on radio station KGFO, a portable station operating form the front <b>cargo</b> <b>deck</b> of the ship. During the journey, broadcasts of the City of Honolulus orchestra, along with radio personalities and musicians from Los Angeles station KHJ, entertained both passengers and listeners on shore (while the ship was in range).|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Yamal LNG project, one of the {{alternatives}} that were studied for transporting LNG plant modules to the material offloading facility located in the port of Sabetta was a conversion {{of one of the}} remaining SA-15 class ships into a heavy-lift module carrier. If done, it would consist of removing all cargo handling gear ahead of the superstructure and cutting the hull down to the tweendeck {{in order to create a}} large level <b>cargo</b> <b>deck</b> for the oversized industrial modules.|$|E
25|$|Later in the book, Yulius Fuchik {{was spotted}} by an American P-3C Orion shortly after {{launching}} four Lebed class hovercraft from her <b>cargo</b> <b>deck.</b> After an SA-7 surface-to-air missile launched {{from the ship}} failed to hit the Orion, the American plane retaliated with a Harpoon anti-ship missile and called in two F-15s to strafe the ship with their 20 mm cannons. The damaged Yulius Fuchik eventually reached the port of Keflavik and, after running aground during the approach, slowly settled to the bottom next to the quay in water {{only a few feet}} deeper than the draught of the vessel.|$|E

50|$|The {{ship was}} a tweendecker (two <b>cargo</b> <b>decks)</b> 240 ft long, with {{a beam of}} 38 ft a depth of 15 ft. She had a GRT of 1,403 and a NRT of 635.|$|R
50|$|Design {{capacity}} of the XC-99 was 100000 lb of cargo or 400 fully equipped soldiers on its double <b>cargo</b> <b>decks.</b> A <b>cargo</b> lift was installed for easier loading. The engines face rearward in a pusher configuration.|$|R
25|$|The flight left Hong Kong on 25 July 2008 {{shortly after}} 9:00 am HKT (0100 UTC). At 10:17 HKT (0217 UTC), {{passengers}} and crew heard a loud bang; the cabin de-pressurised and {{a hole in the}} floor of the passenger deck appeared, as well as a hole in the outside wall of the <b>cargo</b> <b>deck.</b> During the emergency, parts of the aircraft's floor and ceiling collapsed. Passengers reported that, despite the noise and the deployment of the oxygen masks, there was very little panic. The pilots conducted an emergency descent from 29,000feet to ensure adequate oxygen supply for the passengers, reaching 10,000feet by 10:24 HKT (02:24 UTC).|$|E
25|$|The C-2 {{is powered}} by a pair of General Electric CF6-80C2K {{turbofan}} engines. While sharing fuselage components with the Kawasaki P-1, the fuselage of the C-2's is substantially larger to accommodate a vast internal <b>cargo</b> <b>deck,</b> which is furnished with an automated loading/unloading system to reduce workloads on personnel and ground equipment. The forward fuselage and horizontal stabilizer is made of an internally-designed composite material, KMS6115. A tactical flight management system and head-up display is installed to reduce the challenges involved in flying at low altitudes or close to mountainous terrain. The C-2 is equipped with a full glass cockpit, fly-by-wire flight controls, a high-precision navigation system, and self protection systems.|$|E
25|$|At 10:50a.m. on 18 April, the ROK Coast Guard began pumping in air {{to support}} {{possible}} air pockets. At the same time, divers entered the capsized ship's hull but only {{gained access to}} the <b>cargo</b> <b>deck.</b> The divers' entrance was later labeled a 'failure' by the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters. On 19 April, a Navy petty officer who was injured during rescue operations died. On 21 April, remotely operated underwater vehicles began {{to be used for}} operations. On 24 April, the CR2000 'Crabster' robot was sent to the rescue site. On 6 May, a diver working for Undine Marine Industries died during the search. This was followed by another diver's death on 30 May. On 17 July, a firefighting helicopter returning from rescue operations crashed near an apartment complex, killing all five officers aboard and injuring a high school student.|$|E
5000|$|Yachts can {{be shipped}} as <b>deck</b> <b>cargo.</b> Yachts are loaded {{directly}} from the water or from shore. Yachts are loaded by ship or by shore cranes in cradles either supplied by the carrier or the owner.

25|$|Modifications: In the 1980s {{the ship}} was {{reported}} to have had several modifications, including the addition of two passenger decks and the widening of <b>cargo</b> <b>decks.</b> This would have made the ship less stable than it was designed to be, particularly as its draught was only 5.9m. Combined with high winds, the tall ship could have been toppled easily.|$|R
500|$|Responding to lagging A300-600F and A310F sales, Airbus began {{marketing}} the Airbus A330-200F, a freighter derivative of the A330-200, around 2001. The freighter has {{a range of}} [...] with a [...] payload, or [...] with [...] The plane utilises the same nosegear as the passenger version, however it is attached lower in the fuselage and housed in a distinctive bulbous [...] "blister fairing". This raises the aircraft's nose so that the <b>cargo</b> <b>deck</b> is level during loading, as the standard A330's landing gear results the plane having a nose-down attitude while on the ground.|$|E

2500|$|After the collision, Baltic Ace {{began taking}} on water, capsized and sank within 15 minutes in shallow waters. According to the ship's manager, Corvus J likely hit Baltic Ace on the side, where void tanks forming a double side are only [...] wide, quickly {{flooding}} the <b>cargo</b> <b>decks.</b> Corvus J was severely damaged and her bulbous bow was bent, {{but she was}} not in danger of sinking and participated in the search for survivors.|$|R
25|$|Yulius Fuchik {{belonged to}} the {{distinct}} group of cargo ships known as barge carriers which offered, at the time, the highest theoretical loading and unloading rate of all cargo ships. The lighter aboard ship (LASH) system was based on unpowered barges, also known as lighters, that were loaded on board a larger vessel for transport between inland waterways separated by open seas. For this purpose, Yulius Fuchik had vast <b>cargo</b> <b>decks</b> and a large lifting platform in the stern.|$|R
5000|$|Banana {{discharge}} used {{to start}} at 0800 on Monday, using a system of continuous-belt elevators that were dropped down the hatches and she was, thus, able to discharge all decks concurrently to the shore. There were four <b>cargo</b> <b>decks</b> in the forward two hatches and three decks in the aft two hatches. Discharging generally finished by Tuesday night or Wednesday morning; then outward passenger baggage was loaded on Wednesday, the ship sailing for Trinidad/Jamaica/Bermuda on Wednesday afternoon or evening.|$|R
2500|$|Inside, Ikaluk {{provided}} comfortable accommodation for six {{officers and}} 16 crew members in single cabins {{even when the}} ambient temperature dropped to [...] In addition, she had two six-person cabins for 12 passengers commuting between oil rigs and coastal bases. Designed to provide the drilling units with bulk cement, fuel oil and drinking water, Ikaluk had cargo tanks and an open [...] <b>cargo</b> <b>deck</b> abaft of the deckhouse. Her hydraulic quadruple-drum waterfall-type winch {{could be used to}} tow Kulluk, BeauDril's ice-strengthened drilling unit, as well as deploy and retrieve its anchors at the drilling site.|$|E
2500|$|The Valiant station wagons had [...] {{of cargo}} space yet {{required}} two feet less parking space than a full-size Plymouth. A locking luggage compartment on the two-seat models included {{the use of}} Captive-Aire (run-flat) tires. The compartment, located in the <b>cargo</b> <b>deck,</b> served as a spare tire storage space for models equipped with standard tires {{in which case the}} lock was optional. Captive-Aire tires, which did not require a spare, were standard equipment on the three-seat models. An aluminum tailgate window screen was available for the exclusion of insects when on vacation and camping trips.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011 ESL Shipping {{signed a}} new {{long-term}} contract with Rautaruukki for the transportation {{of the raw}} materials of the steel industry in the Baltic Sea. The pushers and barges of the Finnpusku system were docked at Arctech Helsinki Shipyard and modernized by STX Finland Lifecycle Services {{during the summer of}} 2011. In addition to basic maintenance and machinery overhaul the outdated SELMA automation system in all six vessels was upgraded and the <b>cargo</b> <b>deck</b> plating in the barges, damaged after years of elevator loading and grab discharging, was strengthened with new [...] steel plating. Rautaruukki arrived at the shipyard in late June and Steel in mid-August.|$|E
25|$|The general {{arrangements}} of Yulius Fuchik were largely {{dictated by the}} cargo handling system. The superstructure, spanning across the weather deck, housed {{only part of the}} ship's accommodation space. The entire crew of 50 was housed in single cabins, most of them located within the narrow side compartments {{on both sides of the}} <b>cargo</b> <b>decks.</b> In addition to normal messes and saloons, the amenities of the ship also included sports and hobby rooms, library, sauna, photographic laboratory and even a swimming pool.|$|R

Above the plane-length <b>cargo</b> <b>deck,</b> it provides an upper deck for flight operations and for seating 75 passengers including the embarked loadmaster crew, all who face {{to the rear of}} the aircraft during flight. Full-open(able) bay doors at both nose and tail enable [...] "drive-through" [...] loading and unloading of cargo.|$|E
2500|$|Robert LeMeur had a spoon-shaped icebreaking bow {{designed}} to minimize ice resistance, a {{further development of}} Canmar Kigoriaks hull form. The bow was also fitted with reamers that made it about [...] wider than the vertical-sided midbody, breaking a wider channel that would help with turning in difficult ice conditions. The deckhouse was mounted forward of a [...] open <b>cargo</b> <b>deck</b> and nine bulk cargo silos. The superstructure design was chosen to minimize vibrations and maximize visibility from the one-man primary conning position. She had accommodation for 14 crew members and 12 supernumeraries. Under the main deck, Robert LeMeur had a full-length double hull as per Canmar policy.|$|E

2500|$|A {{court of}} inquiry found that the loss was due to a known design flaw {{identified}} in tank testing. The flaw resulted {{in the loss of}} the RHIB and water entering the <b>cargo</b> <b>deck</b> after the doors were opened by the sea. As a result of this the doors were tied shut. The {{court of inquiry}} also reported slamming of the bow and propellers leaving the water. Options to resolve the design problems on the ship include closing the alcoves in which the ship's boats had been stowed. At the time the RHIB was lost, the ship's log records the weather conditions as being a wind strength of , gusting to , a swell of [...] (sea state six), and a completely overcast, very dark night. The alcoves are [...] above the waterline and were swamped by the waves and because the ship was experiencing severe motion, rolling up to 28 degrees to port, at a roll frequency of 11.5 seconds. The ship's anti-roll system will not function when the period of the ship's roll is less than 11.9 seconds. As a result, work was begun to relocate the boats to a less vulnerable location.|$|E
