5|$|Foxgrover {{remained}} {{involved in}} the Millennium Park restaurant after she recused herself from contract negotiations in May, 2002. In October 2003, Foxgrover spoke {{in favor of the}} restaurant getting a liquor license before a Chicago City Council committee while O'Malley owed Foxgrover at least $5,000. On the same day, Foxgrover worked to get O'Malley's Clock Tower Cafe a liquor license. In one July 2003 e-mail, Foxgrover, then the acting director of park services, said that if O'Malley's contractor had any questions for the Park District, she will be the point person. In August 2003, Horan sent out an e-mail mentioning a discussion Horan had with Foxgrover, in which Horan asked Foxgrover if the Park District would waive a form of insurance on the restaurant's construction. A provision in the Park Grill contract allows the restaurant to arrange a series of summer concerts on the Millennium Park ice-skating rink, drawing crowds that bolster food and drink sales. In summer 2004, O'Malley and his partners asked Clear Channel-owned WNUA Radio to conduct the concerts. In February 2005, Foxgrover led a five-member Park District committee that chose <b>Clear</b> <b>Channel</b> over JAM Productions to operate the new concert venue at Northerly Island on the former site of Meigs Field.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{stations}} in the United States often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but {{not the same as}} ordinary generic classification. Many radio {{stations in}} the United States are locally owned and operated, and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings; many other stations are owned by large companies like <b>Clear</b> <b>Channel,</b> and are generally formatted on smaller, more repetitive playlists. Commercial sales of recordings are tracked by Billboard magazine, which compiles a number of music charts for various fields of recorded music sales. The Billboard Hot 100 is the top pop music chart for singles, a recording consisting of a handful of songs; longer pop recordings are albums, and are tracked by the Billboard 200. Though recorded music is commonplace in American homes, many of the music industry's revenue comes from a small number of devotees; for example, 62% of album sales come from less than 25% of the music-buying audience. Total CD sales in the United States topped 705 million units sold in 2005, and singles sales just under three million.|$|E

On September 21, 2001, a North American tour was announced that kicked off exactly two months later after various dates were postponed. In February 2002, Spears announced a second leg of the tour. It was directed and choreographed by Wade Robson, who explained the main theme of the show was Spears's coming of age and newfound independence. The stage was designed by Steve Cohen and Rob Brenner and was composed of a main stage and a B-stage, united by a runway. Inspired by Cleopatra's barge, a flying device was developed so Spears could travel over the audience to the B-stage. The setlist was mostly composed by songs from the supporting album, as Spears felt they were more reflective of her personality. Songs from her previous two studio albums were also included in remixed form by Robson.|$|E
