60|$|So Bickley and I said to each other, and yet {{presently}} {{he changed}} his mind and in a special metal machine carefully made some extremely strong black coffee which he poured into a thermos flask, previously warmed with hot water, adding thereto about a <b>claret</b> <b>glass</b> of brandy. Also he extracted certain drugs from his medicine-chest, and with them, as I noted, a hypodermic syringe, which he first boiled in a kettle and then shut up in a little tube with a glass stopper.|$|E
6000|$|... "At George's sudden {{entrance}} {{they had}} all looked towards the door, and now they sat, petrified by the same astonishment which kept George fixed and staring. Georgiana, who sat immediately facing the door, gazed at him with dark, enormous eyes. Between the thumb and forefinger of her right hand she was holding a drumstick of the dismembered chicken; her little finger, elegantly crooked, stood {{apart from the rest}} of her hand. Her mouth was open, but the drumstick had never reached its destination; it remained, suspended, frozen, in mid-air. The other two sisters had turned round to look at the intruder. Caroline still grasped her knife and fork; Emmeline's fingers were round the stem of her <b>claret</b> <b>glass.</b> For what seemed a very long time, George and the three sisters stared at one another in silence. They were a group of statues. Then suddenly there was movement. Georgiana dropped her chicken bone, Caroline's knife and fork clattered on her plate. The movement propagated itself, grew more decisive; Emmeline sprang to her feet, uttering a cry. The wave of panic reached George; he turned and, mumbling something unintelligible as he went, rushed {{out of the room and}} down the winding stairs. He came to a standstill in the hall, and there, all by himself in the quiet house, he began to laugh.|$|E
5000|$|... "You take a <b>claret</b> <b>glass,</b> half {{fill it with}} gin and lime- {{juice in}} equal {{proportions}} (fresh limes with a little sugar added for choice, otherwise lime-juice cordial), fill it up with crushed ice, stir, and drink through a straw." ...|$|E

60|$|Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking {{the last}} fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head {{as it went}} down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and <b>claret</b> <b>glasses</b> shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.|$|R
25|$|Glassware {{was also}} {{replenished}} at this time. Mrs. Lincoln ordered 24 plain cut goblets (probably for family dining) in November 1864 and January 1865 from the D.C. firm of Webb & Beveridge. The cost was just $30. On January 30, 1865, she also ordered glassware to replace broken and stolen glassware for public events from John Kerr's China Hall, {{at a cost}} of $612.50. This service included four dozen each of goblets, champagne <b>glasses,</b> <b>claret</b> <b>glasses,</b> burgundy glasses, madeira glasses, sherry glasses, hock glasses, and cordial glasses. The bases appear to have been plain (unlike the 1861 order), except for the madeira glassesâ€”which were more richly carved and featured the rays on the foot. The hock glasses were ruby (not green) in color, and the madeira glasses may also have been red colored. She ordered another four decanters on March 25.|$|R

60|$|J. Ballantyne and B. Cadell dined with me, and, as Pepys would say, all {{was very}} handsome. Drank amongst us one bottle of champagne, one of <b>claret,</b> a <b>glass</b> {{or two of}} port, and each a tumbler of whisky toddy. J.B. had courage to drink his with hot water; mine was iced.|$|R

2500|$|She {{completed}} her purchases by ordering glassware. [...] She purchased the glassware on July 3, 1861, from A. P. Zimaudy of Washington, D.C. [...] This $1,500 set of glassware was richly cut and one side inscribed with the U.S. coat of arms. The glassware was manufactured by Christian Dorflinger, a {{company based in}} Brooklyn, New York, and was much thinner and lighter than the typical White House heavy crystal which had been used since the Andrew Jackson administration. [...] Small flowers were depicted on the sides and backs of the glassware. [...] A decorative border of umbrella-like shapes was etched into the lip, and the base featured a star and fan of spreading rays. The exact content of the glassware order is not clear, but probably included four dozen complete settings (water glass, red wine glass, white wine glass, champagne flute, dessert wine glass, and all-purpose glass) {{as well as some}} serving dishes. White House glassware historian Jane Shadel Spillman believes the glassware collection was probably similar to a [...] "presentation" [...] set given to Japanese diplomats by E.V. Haughwout the year before. This presentation set included goblets, champagne <b>glasses,</b> wine <b>glasses,</b> <b>claret</b> <b>glasses,</b> green-tinted hock glasses, cordial glasses, quart- and pint-size decanters, claret decanters, bowls, side dishes, finger bowls, and saltcellars. The setting also probably included punch bowls, double-handled punch cups, ice cream plates, carafes, sugar bowls, and celery vases. Among the known serving dishes were a relish dish and a compote dish.|$|R
60|$|A second {{table was}} set {{against one of}} the walls. Our boiling water for the tea was kept there, in a silver kettle heated by a spirit-lamp. I next {{observed}} a delicate little china vase which held the tea, and a finely-designed <b>glass</b> <b>claret</b> jug, with a silver cover. Other men, possessing that beautiful object, would have thought it worthy of the purest Bordeaux wine which the arts of modern adulteration permit us to drink. This man had filled the claret jug with water.|$|R
60|$|Had he drunk a dozen {{bottles of}} claret, the old {{spinster}} could have pardoned him. Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan drank claret. Gentlemen drank <b>claret.</b> But eighteen <b>glasses</b> of gin consumed among boxers in an ignoble pot-house--it was an odious crime {{and not to}} be pardoned readily. Everything went against the lad: he came home perfumed from the stables, whither he had been to pay his dog Towzer a visit--and whence {{he was going to take}} his friend out for an airing, when he met Miss Crawley and her wheezy Blenheim spaniel, which Towzer would have eaten up had not the Blenheim fled squealing to the protection of Miss Briggs, while the atrocious master of the bull-dog stood laughing at the horrible persecution.|$|R
60|$|At the Tremont, I had Bridge to dine with me: iced champagne, <b>claret</b> in <b>glass</b> pitchers. Nothing very {{remarkable}} {{among the}} guests. A wine-merchant, French apparently, {{though he had}} arrived the day before in a bark from Copenhagen: a somewhat corpulent gentleman, without so good manners as an American would have in the same line of life, but good-natured, sociable, and civil, complaining of the heat. He had rings on his fingers of great weight of metal, {{and one of them}} had a seal for letters; brooches at the bosom, three in a row, up and down; also a gold watch-guard, with a seal appended. Talks of the comparative price of living, of clothes, etc., here and in Europe. Tells of the prices of wines by the cask and pipe. Champagne, he says, is drunk of better quality here than where it grows.--A vendor of patent medicines, Doctor Jaques, makes acquaintance with me, and shows me his recommendatory letters in favor of himself and drugs, signed by a long list of people. He prefers, he says, booksellers to druggists as his agents, and inquired of me about them in this town. He seems to be an honest man enough, with an intelligent face, and sensible in his talk, but not a gentleman, wearing a somewhat shabby brown coat and mixed pantaloons, being ill-shaven, and apparently not well acquainted with the customs of a fashionable hotel. A simplicity about him that is likable, though, I believe, he comes from Philadelphia.--Naval officers, strolling about town, bargaining for swords and belts, and other military articles; with the tailor, to have naval buttons put on their shore-going coats, and for their pantaloons, suited to the climate of the Mediterranean. It is the almost invariable habit of officers, when going ashore or staying on shore, to divest themselves of all military or naval insignia, and appear as private citizens. At the Tremont, young gentlemen with long earlocks,--straw hats, light, or dark-mixed.--The theatre being closed, the play-bills of many nights ago are posted up against its walls.|$|R
6000|$|TWELVE {{months had}} passed away since the Master of Ravenswood's {{departure}} for the continent, and, although his return to Scotland had been expected in a much shorter space, yet the affairs of his mission, or, according to a prevailing report, others of a nature personal to himself, still detained him abroad. In the mean time, the altered state of affairs in Sir William Ashton's family may be gathered from the following conversation which took place betwixt Bucklaw and his confidential bottle companion and dependant, the noted Captain Craigengelt. They were seated {{on either side of}} the huge sepulchral-looking freestone chimney in the low hall at Girnington. A wood fire blazed merrily in the grate; a round oaken table, placed between them, supported a stoup of excellent <b>claret,</b> two rummer <b>glasses,</b> and other good cheer; and yet, with all these appliances and means to boot, the countenance of the patron was dubious, doubtful, and unsatisfied, while the invention of his dependant was taxed to the utmost to parry what he most dreaded, a fit, as he called it, of the sullens, on the part of his protector. After a long pause, only interrupted by the devil's tattoo, which Bucklaw kept beating against the hearth with the toe of his boot, Craigengelt at last ventured to break silence. [...] "May I be double distanced," [...] said he, [...] "if ever I saw a man in my life have less the air of a bridegroom! Cut me out of feather, if you have not more the look of a man condemned to be hanged!" ...|$|R
