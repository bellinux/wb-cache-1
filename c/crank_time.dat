The main part of this work aims to create and verify a solution that can control the starter motor, as well as protect it in case of any failure. The different malfunctions that the solution protects against is high current, too high peak current, low current, maximum <b>crank</b> <b>time</b> and minimum cool off time. The timers also protect indirectly against overheating of the starter engine. The transistors used are BTS 555, from Infineon. Typical rated current of the transistor is 158 A and it has integrated functions such as temperature protection, short circuit protection and current sensing. The functions was tested and evaluated. The temperature protection and current sensor was found to satisfy the specification. The short circuit protection did not protect against all kinds of short circuit failures thus an external over current protection has been added. To control the starter motor, twelve transistors were connected in parallel, to allow for a total of initial start current 2 000 A and a continuous maximum current of 1 150 A. A series of tests were performed on the transistors, the external protections and the starter motor, until everything worked together as planned. The control circuits is designed with simple gate logic in combination with other active and passive components. The transistors are the largest expense. The used solution has an estimated price of 400 SEK, assembling excluded. The assembling is estimated to take one hour. Conclusions made from measurements and tests shows {{that it is possible to}} control the starter motor by using semiconductor technology. Since the solenoid in the current starter relay will not be excluded, the solution might be hard to motivate in an economic aspect. The advantages with a semiconductor solution are the protective functions and that the starter motor will be disconnected from the batteries when not being used. To control the smaller loads, such as the preheater, the semi conductor relay is a competitive alternative since the mechanical relay and the fuse can be replaced...|$|E

30|$|The {{synchronous}} machine model and parameters {{can be found}} in the Simulink SimPowerSystems library and follows the model in [13]. The clutch modifies the torque transmitted to the {{synchronous machine}} [6, 8] and the diesel engine speed [8]. When locking the clutch, a maximum speed difference of 10 − 5 is acceptable. Similar to the studies in [6, 7], the diesel engine cranking dynamics are avoided. To avoid the unnecessary diesel engine cranking dynamics, the engine rest state is simulated at a speed of 0.3 p.u. Thus, although the engine is considered stopped, the simulated value would remain at 0.3 p.u. Since the cranking delay will affect the readiness of the DG to provide frequency regulation, a 0.5  s delay is added as <b>cranking</b> <b>time</b> to the DG model [6, 7]. Thus, the diesel engine start will be delayed by 0.5  s when the speed increases from 0.3 p.u.|$|R

40|$|With {{advances}} in technology and ageing societal concerns growing, personal care devices are gaining importance globally. One such area is lower-limb exoskeletons, used to assist persons to move around for normal daily living. Most of the commercially available assistive exoskeletons use rechargeable Li-ion batteries, which require frequent charging to meet the operational needs. Charging becomes a problem when a person relying on a mobility exoskeleton has to go outdoors for shopping or a leisure walk. Experimental data from on-going research to develop assistive mobility exoskeletons for elderly persons indicates that, the power required for exoskeletons is around 45 – 60  W which falls in the output range of hand-crank generators. So use of hand-crank generators as a charging source is discussed. In this work, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the potential of hand-crank devices in charging mobility exoskeletons and to give relation between input cranking speed and output charging power, and estimate the <b>cranking</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{glowplug}} (alternatively spelled as {{glow plug}} or glow-plug) is a heating device used to aid starting diesel engines. In cold weather, {{high speed diesel}} engines {{can be difficult to}} start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition (which relies on that heat). Pre-chambered engines use small electric heaters (glowplugs) inside the pre-chambers. Direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber. The glowplug is a pencil-shaped piece of metal with a heating element at the tip. This heating element, when electrified, heats due to its electrical resistance and begins to emit light in the visible spectrum, hence the term glowplug. The visual effect is similar to the heating element in a toaster. The fuel injector spray pattern then impinges directly upon the hot tip of the glow plug during the injection of fuel at top dead center. This ignites the fuel even when the engine is insufficiently hot for normal operation, which reduces the <b>cranking</b> <b>time</b> to start the engine.|$|R

The MIL will also illuminate if the engine has been cranked but failed to start after returning the ignition to [...] "ON." [...] In most modern vehicles this is usually due to not giving the engine enough <b>cranking</b> <b>time</b> to start.

40|$|Starter motors are {{sensitive}} for overheating. By estimating {{the temperature and}} preventing <b>cranking</b> in <b>time,</b> there is an option to avoid the dangerous temperatures. The truck manufacturer Scania CV AB proposed a master thesis that should evaluate the need of an overheating protection for the starter motor. The aim is to evaluate any positive effects of implementing an algorithm that can estimate the brush temperature instead of using the available time constrain, which allows 35 seconds of cranking with a following 2 seconds delay, allowing the crank shaft to stop before a new start attempt is allowed. To achieve high load on the starter motor and high temperature in the brushes, tests were performed under − 20 o Celsius. Initial testing on truck, under normal temperatures, showed that the batteries could not run the starter motor long enough to reach high temperatures in the brushes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the voltage drop between the batteries and the starter motor, causing the starter motor to run in an operating area it is not optimized for. There are several other problems which gives a higher load on the engine, for example oil viscosity, resulting in higher currents, but those are not mentioned in this report. Three different models are compared, Two State Model, Single State Model and a Time Constrained Model. Tests and verifications show that the Two State Model is superior when it comes to protecting the starter motor from overheating and at the same <b>time</b> maximizing the <b>cranking</b> <b>time.</b> The major difference between the Two State Model and the Single State Model are the cooling characteristics. In the Single State Model the brush temperature drops quickly to the outside temperature while in the Two State Model the brush temperature drops to a second state  temperature instead of the outside temperature. With the currently implemented time constrain it is possible to overheat the starter motor. The algorithms are optimized under cold conditions, due to problems in reaching high temperatures under warmer conditions...|$|R

Only ethanol content was controlled. All aging used splash-blended E 15 fuel. Exhaust emissions, exhaust gas temperature, torque, power, barometric pressure, air temperature, and fuel flow were measured at five intervals using site-blended E 15 aging fuel and certification fuel (E 0). The durability test cycle showed no noticeable impact on mechanical durability or engine power. Emissions performance degraded beyond the certification limit for this engine family, mostly occurring by 28 % of expected life. Such degradation is inconsistent with prior experience. Comparisons showed that E 15 resulted in lower CO and HC, but increased NOX, as expected for non-feedback-controlled carbureted engines with increased oxygen in the fuel. Fuel consumption also increased with E 15 compared with E 0. Throughout testing, poor starting characteristics were exhibited on E 15 fuel for hot re-start and cold-start. <b>Cranking</b> <b>time</b> to start and smooth idle was roughly doubled compared with typical E 0 operation.

30|$|Power {{requirements}} and profitability of sucker-rod pumping are basically {{determined by the}} torque load on the pumping unit’s gearbox. Gearbox torques include the torque required to drive the polished rod and the torque used to rotate the counterweights. In addition to these, inertial torques arise in {{those parts of the}} pumping unit that turn at varying speeds. As shown in the paper, all torque components are functions of the crank angle; consequently, their exact calculation necessitates the knowledge of the <b>crank</b> angle versus <b>time</b> function. This circumstance, however, complicates torque calculations because contemporary dynamometers, used to acquire the necessary operating data, do not provide any information on the variation of the crank angle during the pumping cycle. The paper introduces a solution of the problem and presents an iterative calculation of the <b>crank</b> angle versus <b>time</b> function from dynamometer data. Based on this function crank velocity, crank acceleration, as well as beam acceleration can be calculated and all necessary gearbox torques can be evaluated. For calculating articulating inertial torque, the acceleration pattern of the walking beam during the pumping cycle is evaluated according to three different models and the accuracy of those is compared. The paper gives the details of the developed calculation models and presents a typical sample case.|$|R

30|$|As already discussed, gearbox torques are {{normally}} calculated based on dynamometer measurements {{that provide the}} variations of polished rod loads and positions. Modern dynamometer systems register these data in function of time but give no information on the crank angles valid at the measured times.

Rod torque changes with the torque factor that varies with the crank angle; counterbalance torque is a direct function of crank angle, see Eqs.  1 – 3. Inertial torques are found from the acceleration patterns of different components of the pumping unit, these also change with the variation of the <b>time</b> history of <b>crank</b> angle.

The governing set of hyperbolic equations is transformed, via the characteristic curves mathematical technique, {{to a group of}} three slope equations, constituting the two wave characteristics and the pathline curves coupled with their associated compatibility equations, giving the change of the two Riemann variables and entropy along the above curves.

The severity of these faults could have serious effects on diesel engine operations such as engine misfire, knocking, insufficient power output or even cause a complete engine breakdown.

In this paper, the authors present the results of an experimental investigation on identifying the signal characteristics of a simulated incipient injector fault in a diesel engine using both in-cylinder pressure and acoustic emission (AE) techniques.

The simulation {{is based on}} a thermodynamic analysis, which was validated successfully concerning the performance of the engine (load, fuel consumption, maximum pressures, etc). The analysis includes the calculation of the heat exchange between gas and walls in both the main chamber and (swirl) prechamber, after computing the relevant characteristic velocities and lengths, while combustion in both the main chamber and the swirl prechamber is attacked by proposing a two-zone combustion model. The concentration of the constituents in the exhaust gases is calculated by incorporating a complete chemical equilibrium scheme for the C-H-O system of the eleven species considered, together with chemical rate equations for the calculation of nitric oxide (NO). A model for the evaluation of soot formation and oxidation rates is also included, in order to compute the net soot concentration. The contribution of each chamber to the formation of NO and soot is given by presenting <b>time</b> (<b>crank</b> angle) diagrams of the net NO and soot formation inside each chamber (histories of formation).

40|$|Background. Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) creates a complex {{pathology}} {{that can lead}} to an increase in sedentary behaviours and deleterious changes in body composition. Consequently, individuals with SCI are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type- 2 diabetes mellitus. While the role of physical activity on the reduction of chronic disease risk is well documented in non-disabled individuals the evidence is less conclusive for persons with SCI. The aim of this methodological paper is to outline the design of a study that will assess the role of a home-based exercise intervention on biomarkers of metabolic and cardiovascular health in persons with SCI: the HOMEX-SCI study. Methods/Design. Eligible participants will be inactive (physical activity level ≤ 1. 60) individuals, with a chronic (> 1 year) spinal cord lesion between the second thoracic and the fifth lumbar vertebrae, aged between 18 – 65 years. Following baseline laboratory testing and lifestyle monitoring, participants will be randomly allocated to a control (CON) group or 6 -week home-based exercise intervention (INT). The INT consists of 45 minutes of moderate-intensity (60 - 65 % peak oxygen uptake) arm <b>crank</b> exercise 4 <b>times</b> per week. Participants assigned to the CON group will be asked to maintain their normal lifestyle. The main outcomes of this study (biomarkers of metabolic and cardiovascular health) are obtained from venous blood samples, collected in the fasted and postprandial state. Seven other measurement categories will be assessed: i) body composition; ii) physical activity; iii) energy intake; iv) measures of health and wellbeing v) resting metabolic rate, heart rate and blood pressure; vi) aerobic capacity; vii) immune function; and viii) adipose tissue gene expression. Discussion. This study will explore the feasibility of home-based moderate-intensity exercise and ascertain its impact on metabolic and cardiovascular health in comparison to a lifestyle maintenance CON group. Findings from this study may help inform new evidence-based physical activity guidelines and help elucidate the physiological mechanisms whereby exercise might exert beneficial effects in persons with chronic SCI. The results will also act as a scientific platform for further intervention studies in other diverse and at risk populations. Trial Registration.

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is now {{the leading}} cause of death in {{individuals}} with spinal cord injury (SCI). The SCI population is among the least physically active in society. Physical activity is known to reduce risk factors for CVD. The role of intensity of aerobic arm exercise in individuals with a chronic SCI is not fully investigated. Purpose: To compare the effects from aerobic high intensity interval training (HIT) (85 % - 95 % of peak heart rate (HR peak)) and isocaloric aerobic continuous moderate exercise (CME) (70 % of HRpeak) on peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak), waist circumference (WC) and endothelial function measured as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in the brachial artery. Methods: 10 individuals with SCI paraplegia were randomized to HIT or CME arm <b>crank</b> exercise three <b>times</b> a week for eight weeks. Results: No significant differences in VO 2 peak between the groups from baseline to post-test were found. However, there was a favorable trend towards a higher increase in VO 2 peak in the HIT group compared to the CME group, 28. 1 ± 7. 5 ml∙ kg - 1 ∙min - 1 - 31. 2 ± 8. 8 ml∙ kg - 1 ∙min - 1 versus 24. 6 ± 6. 9 ml∙ kg - 1 ∙min - 1 - 23. 8 ± 5. 4 ml∙ kg - 1 ∙min - 1, respectively, (P= 0. 051). No difference in FMD or WC within or between the groups from baseline to posttest was found. Conclusions: The findings from the present pilot study showed no significant difference between high- and moderate intensity arm crank exercise in terms of VO 2 peak, waist circumference or flow-mediated dilatation. However, there was a favorable trend towards a higher increase in VO 2 peak from arm crank exercise at aerobic high intensity compared to isocaloric exercise at moderate intensit y. Exercise at aerobic high intensity was feasible for the individuals with SCI paraplegia in this study. Future randomized studies with larger sample sizes to confirm our findings are needed. Relevance: Evidence based practice is essential to assure the best possible quality of rehabilitation medicine, and in this case, for the cardiovascular health of individuals with SCI paraplegia. The findings from the present study may be incorporated into daily treatment routines, and will contribute with new knowledge in the development of exercise guidelines for the SCI population...|$|R

[...] As per jargon amongst the stokers, the [...] "Monday" [...] was a hefty scrap and not less than one pound of weight, which broke up slag in the furnace before cleaning the boiler. — So, I was christined, - I say - the grandmother told me that a poop christined me in the village when I was four years old. And his partner immediately corrected: — So, you was christined in the Orthodox faith to be believe in Christ. And here christen in Steamship faith. That you will believe in the power of steam else. It is tradition. Without it you will not survive here. Steam will pull all the juices from you. In short, come tomorrow in the engine room after the daily watch. There all [...] "the clear" [...] will gather in full team. That he meant the whole engine team of the glorious ship «Лиза Чайкина». [...] Next day, just after the watch, I climbed down in engine room and there all my [...] "oily belly buttons" [...] brethren headed by [...] "grand-dad", I means the chief engineer, and waiting. Standing grandly and important. [...] "Grand-dad" [...] wore a tunic with wide chevrons on the sleeves for the solemnity even. And, in hand of the second engineer I observed a big white enamel mug, which was filled with not the water, not the alcohol to the brim. But I did not know details of the christening. I was thinking, if it is alcohol, - the trumped deal, due to I did not drink alcohol also and could normally stand on my feet after the watch. The [...] "grand-dad" [...] came solemnly and shouted in my ear as it was noisly in the engine room due to motors run. However, the diesel engine is more noisly now. So, he shouts me: — Shura, we are now intend to christen you as per maritime tradition and then you will our spirit man, and no any contagion or trouble will not overtake you easy. For this reason we need to make two sacraments, or possible to say — to perform only two conditions: to kiss a crank bearing of the main engine and then drink a cup of seawater. Are you ready? — Ready - I reply. And, thank God, I will hope if it is not alcohol. [...] Regarding crank bearing should be discussed separately. The fact that steam engines connecting rods attached to the pistons, located outside, rather than inside as in modern engines, and they go into the cycle of the piston not reciprocates only, that is up and down, but also too much sweeping to the sides that you have look to avoid its [...] "elbow" [...] does not hurt you if you stand close. The crank bearing is in the lower joint of the elbow and this bearing needs to be lubricated constantly with the machine oil using the oilcans. It is required the highest category skill as a funnel for the pouring was on the rod, which is hopping a dance of death. And a oilcaner, so a motorman was called in that years, was involved unwittingly into the rhythm of this pagan dance, it was independs if he like it or not. And, oilcaner was crouching and twisting when he began to follow movement of the connecting rod, and at the right time he injected the right portion of the oil using big oilcan with a large down-curved nose (outlet pipe). One wrong move, - the oilcan could be striked by the connecting rod and the entire portion of the lubricant will be on your head. So motormen and engineers were unsurpassed dancers in this sense. They were virtuosos of the deal. It is marvel if you look at them from the side. The boogie-woogie is a pathetic parody regarding what they were doing. It is possible to say that their watch passed in the rhythm of this macabre ritual dance with the accompaniment of the romped monster. And an engineer contrives to determine the temperature of a <b>crank</b> some <b>times</b> during the watch also, thus he was controlling its possible overheating. He did it using own palm. A flat of the hand could safely withstand the temperature 70 degrees. And if the temperature is higher, then it begins to burn... Then I did not know all subtleties, but I felt that I encountered the situation. This bearing was dangerous to catch by hand, but here it was necessary to touch by the lips. I took the position. All engine valetry surrounded me, the second engineer was closest and indicate the direction me by the mug to the crank bearing in front of me. I thought: [...] "How long will I fit in? This crank will hits my teeth with the star effects exactly". I stretched my lips out {{in the form of a}} pipe as far as possible and began to approach the [...] "killer". And right now, unfortunately, swayed to the left side, well, and I suddenly kissed the iron elbow so much that my eyes darkened. I woke from a stupor, and immediately the mug was served to me. I swallowed a little water with salt, my eyes climbed up on my forehead, and it burns in my mouth. It turns out, that my two upper teeth had been knocked out and hurted, became painfully due to salt. I wanted to howl. So it turned out, that I did not know who kissed whom - or I kissed the crank bearing or the crank bearing kissed me. But I survived it fully. More finally my forehead was anointed with axle-grease and said to me: — Well, now you're christened as per all rules, and no any adversities will able to hurt you. We accept you into our brotherhood of steam, coal and axle-grease, and, be healthy. [...] And, indeed, after the christening my second breath opened, and the power came from nowhere. I was not tired as before, and was able to beat off and split the outgrowths of slag to pieces by the [...] "monday". I was accustomed to the heat conditions after a week, I did not want to get out from the boiler room. And the fact, that I was christened second time - apparently, this is not in vain, because during my second voyage such situation happened that only a miracle was able to save me.|$|R
