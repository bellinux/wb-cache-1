40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} probabilistic stability of Kalman filtering over fading channels modeled by ∗-mixing random processes, where channel fading {{is allowed to}} generate non-stationary packet dropouts with temporal and/or spatial correlations. Upper/lower almost sure (<b>a.</b> <b>s.)</b> stabilities and absolutely upper/lower <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> stabilities are defined for characterizing the sample-path behaviors of the Kalman filtering. We prove that both upper and lower <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> stabilities follow <b>a</b> zero-one law, i. e., these stabilities must happen with a probability either zero or one, and when the filtering system is one-step observable, the absolutely upper and lower <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> stabilities can also be interpreted using a zero-one law. We establish general stability conditions for (absolutely) upper and lower <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> stabilities. In particular, with one-step observability, we show the equivalence between absolutely <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> stabilities and <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> ones, and necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of packet arrival rate are derived; for the so-called non-degenerate systems, we also manage to give a necessary and sufficient condition for upper <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> stability...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} altitude on growth and yield of five commonly grown plantain (Musa, AAB) cultivars at four sites, Mavivi (1, 066 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l.), Maboya (1, 412 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l.), Butembo (1, 815 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l.) and Ndihira (2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l.) in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. The cultivars included three 'French' plantains ('Nguma', 'Vuhindi' and 'Vuhembe') and two 'False Horn' types ('Kotina' and 'Musilongo'). Fifteen vigorous sword suckers of each cultivar were planted in three replicates of five plants, at each site. Growth and yield parameters were assessed for the plant crop and three subsequent ratoon cycles. High altitude and corresponding lower temperatures significantly increased suckering and crop cycle duration, whereas it {{reduced the number of}} functional leaves and yield. For example, all cultivars produced more suckers at 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l. (9 - 11 suckers) and 1, 815 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l. (5 - 7), compared with 3 - 4 at 1, 412 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l. and only two suckers at 1, 066 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l. In contrast, all cultivars had a low bunch yield (2 - 3 kg) at 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l. compared with 19 - 25 kg at 1, 815 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l., 19 - 23 kg at 1, 412 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l. and 23 - 33 kg at 1, 066 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l. Most bunches across the cultivars at 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l. were only partially developed, and unfit for consumption or the market. Choke throat symptoms were also observed and were associated with the year round low minimum temperatures (10. 4 - 12. 3 °C) at this altitude. Plantains adapted to high altitude need to be sought and evaluated at the high altitude sites in North Kivu (1, 815 and 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l.). The high altitude sites (e. g., at 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> l.) that are also free of banana pests could however be beneficial for establishment of mother gardens for clean planting material multiplication because sucker development is enhanced at these elevations.
