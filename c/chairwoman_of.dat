5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time <b>Chairwoman</b> <b>of</b> the National Energy Foundation.

5|$|In 2008, {{an article}} in The Day stated that the push to restore the house came from {{conservation}} specialist Doug Royalty, who was researching prefabricated homes from the 1920s and 1930s. Royalty approached Abigail Van Slyck, the <b>chairwoman</b> <b>of</b> Connecticut College's art history department and architectural studies program about the house. The Day referred to the house's historic value as a new discovery, but its history {{was included in the}} Winslow Ames House National Register of Historic Places nomination in 1995. The Winslow Ames House nomination detailed the House's origin, but criticized its gable roof modification. After its re-discovery, Connecticut College began collecting grants to restore the house under the direction of Royalty and Van Slyck. Royalty stated that the House and Winslow Ames House are very rare, with only a few surviving examples in the United States.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 83 Nagle {{was still}} {{pursuing}} gender equality, accusing the Kennel Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male-only membership and taking them to court over the matter. After the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was enacted, Nagle was proposed {{as a member of}} the Kennel Club at the end of September 1977; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club's constitution restricted membership to men only. Nagle referred the matter to an Industrial Tribunal five months later. She was <b>Chairwoman</b> <b>of</b> the Ladies Joint Committee, a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy, but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions. Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee. Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case, but it recommended that the Equal Opportunities Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated. Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision. Leonard Pagliero was Chairman of the Kennel Club at the time, and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press, Dog World and Our Dogs, on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club's General Committee was recommending that the club's constitution be changed to allow women members. The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978. The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979. The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle.|$|E
