It is a cross-cultural ministry sharing Jesus Christ with First Nations people in remote areas of Canada. The organization has been providing spiritual witness and nurture to communities in northern remote areas of Canada since 1970, through the ministry of missionary/pilots, and short and long-term volunteers-in-mission. LAMP presently works in 60 communities, teaching Vacation Bible School, youth and adult Bible study, and leading soccer camps in the summer months.|$|R
50|$|Power cables may {{be either}} fixed or {{detachable}} from the appliance. In {{the case of}} detachable leads, the appliance end of the power cord has a female connector to link it to the appliance, to avoid the dangers from having a live protruding pin. Cords may also have twist-locking features, or other attachments to prevent accidental disconnection at one or both ends. A cord set may include accessories such as fuses for overcurrent protection, a <b>pilot</b> <b>lamp</b> to indicate voltage is present, or a leakage current detector. Power cords for sensitive instruments, or audio/video equipment may also include a shield over the power conductors to minimize electromagnetic interference.|$|R
5000|$|A {{soldering}} gun is an approximately pistol-shaped, electrically powered tool for soldering metals using tin-based solder {{to achieve a}} strong mechanical bond with good electrical contact. The tool has a trigger-style switch {{so it can be}} easily operated with one hand. The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A soldering tip, made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured {{to the end of the}} transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the tubular copper winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms much less. A tap on the primary winding is often used to light a <b>pilot</b> <b>lamp</b> which also lights the workpiece.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2005 it has been realized Aladdin's <b>lamp,</b> <b>pilot</b> of the new series Aladdin's adventures (26 x 13'), co-produced by Rai-Fiction. Backgrounds and characters are inspired by Emanuele Luzzati's graphical work, by kind permission of the artist. The stories are inspired by the compilation of Eastern folk tales Arabian Nights. The drawings are animated thanks to the digital techniques that hark back to the traditional way of cut-out animation, as Luzzati and Gianini did in their works. The main characters are: Aladdin, a young boy {{in love with the}} Princess Budur, daughter of the Caliph Harun, and their friend the Genie. Their enemy is the wizard Kufor, that wills to grab Aladdin's magic lamp. Through the series, Aladdin and Budur will have to face lots of adventures, always winning thanks to their wit and reciprocal love. The telling is given to Sherazade's voice and the musical score composed and played expressly for each episode by Lorenzo Marini, in an ongoing dialogue with the graphic designer and animators.|$|R
40|$|Background  The role {{of nickel}} in causing hand {{dermatitis}} in some occupations {{has been difficult}} to assess due to problems with reliable measurement of the exposure to nickel in the workplace and lack of a definitive threshold for nickel allergic contact dermatitis. It is not uncommon to find nickel allergy on patch testing {{but it is difficult to}} determine whether this is of relevance to occupational nickel exposure or simply a reflection of past exposure to nickel-plated jewellery or other nonoccupational nickel exposure. Objectives  To devise a simple and reproducible method to quantify the amount of nickel on the skin and to apply the technique to measure dermal nickel exposure in various occupational settings. Methods  A rapid and simple sampling procedure was developed for determination of nickel on the skin of workers potentially exposed to nickel by exposing individuals to nickel-releasing coins and measuring exposure by immersing the exposed thumbs and index fingers directly into graduated sample tubes containing ultrapure water and aqueous nickel extracts. The solutions were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry after stabilization with nitric acid. The method shows advantages over alternatives such as wipe testing and tape stripping in terms of extraction efficiency, speed and ease of operation in the field. A pilot survey of dermal nickel exposure for workers in several occupational settings was conducted. Results  The study suggested that a ‘normal’ level of nickel on the skin is < 10 ng cm− 2. Coin handling induced an appreciable increase in the amount of nickel on the skin within 2 min. Experiments indicated a linear relationship between coin handling (exposure time) and measured dermal nickel levels following standardized <b>coin</b> handling. A <b>pilot</b> survey, conducted among cashiers, shop assistants, bar staff, hairdressers and workers in the nickel industry revealed dermal nickel concentrations ranging from < 0 · 9 to 7160 ng cm− 2. The levels of nickel on the skin of cashiers, shop assistants, bar staff and hairdressers were below the threshold level for water-soluble ionic nickel for occluded exposure at which 10...|$|R
40|$|Plating of Neurospora conidia or ascospores {{is often}} {{accomplished}} using a glass spreader to distribute suspended cells on the agar surface. See How to plate conidia and ascospores. Spreaders are commonly made of 3 mm diameter soft glass rod with a 70 ° bend 50 mm {{from one end}} (Davis and de Serres 1970). These are sturdy and suitable for reuse. Common practice is to sterilize the spreader between using it for different spore samples by dipping it in alcohol and flaming to burn off the excess alcohol. This kills conidia. Ascospores, however, are large, thick-walled, and heat-resistant, and the procedure does not ensure that all ascospores adhering to the spreader will be killed (Newmeyer and Wallace 1971). It is imperative, therefore, that an already used spreader be replaced with a sterile spreader whenever ascospores from different crosses are to be plated one after another. Spreaders handmade from disposable Pasteur pipettes provide a convenient alternative to the conventional spreaders made of glass rod. Procedure Disposable Pasteur pipets 23 cm long are suitable. (VWR Scientific Catalog No. 14572 - 380. Flint glass. Outside dimension of body, 7 mm; OD of 12 cm-long capillary stem, ~ 1. 5 mm.) Pipets are sterilized in a hot-air oven. Each spreader is made just before use. A pipet is brought carefully toward a small flame (Bunsen Burner <b>pilot</b> or alcohol <b>lamp)</b> until the long, thin stem melts at a selected point and the distal portion bends downward {{as a result of}} gravity. The angle at which it solidifies depends on how the pipette is held. A second bend, made quickly and easily, can shape the capillary tip into a straight, 4 - or 5 -cm-long interval suitably angled for spreading. There is no need to dip in alcohol or to flame before using. Each newly made spreader is discarded after use. Because the capillary portion of the Pasteur pipet is thinner than the solid glass rod of conventional spreaders, cells are spread more evenly and are not concentrated in the water film that is formed by surface tension if a spreader is picked up before liquid has been completely imbibed...|$|R
