To describe them {{we use the}} theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. An example of such motions are motions with the zero <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations.</b> We will show that there are asymptotic motions with nonzero <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations.</b> We introduce the notions of the Klein subspace, the Coriolis subspace and show their relation to asymptotic motions of robot manipulators.

25|$|The Coriolis effect {{strongly}} {{affects the}} large-scale {{oceanic and atmospheric}} circulation, leading {{to the formation of}} robust features like jet streams and western boundary currents. Such features are in geostrophic balance, meaning that the Coriolis and pressure gradient forces balance each other. <b>Coriolis</b> <b>acceleration</b> is also responsible for the propagation of many types of waves in the ocean and atmosphere, including Rossby waves and Kelvin waves. It is also instrumental in the so-called Ekman dynamics in the ocean, and in the establishment of the large-scale ocean flow pattern called the Sverdrup balance.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{analysis}} an important point appears: all the fictitious accelerations must be included to obtain the correct trajectory. In particular, besides the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>acceleration,</b> the centrifugal force plays an essential role. It is easy to get the impression from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which focus on displaying the Coriolis effect particularly, that the Coriolis force is the only factor that must be considered, but that is not so. A turntable for which the Coriolis force is the only factor is the parabolic turntable. A somewhat more complex situation is the idealized example of flight routes over long distances, where the centrifugal force of the path and aeronautical lift are countered by gravitational attraction.|$|E
25|$|Italian {{scientist}} Giovanni Battista Riccioli and {{his assistant}} Francesco Maria Grimaldi described the effect in connection with artillery in the 1651 Almagestum Novum, writing that rotation of the Earth should cause a cannonball fired to the north to deflect to the east. In 1674 Claude François Milliet Dechales described in his Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus how {{the rotation of the}} earth should cause a deflection in the trajectories of both falling bodies and projectiles aimed toward one of the planet's poles. Riccioli, Grimaldi, and Dechales all described the effect as part of an argument against the heliocentric system of Copernicus. In other words, they argued that the Earth's rotation should create the effect, and so failure to detect the effect was evidence for an immobile Earth. The <b>Coriolis</b> <b>acceleration</b> equation was derived by Euler in 1749 and the effect was described in the tidal equations of Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1778.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the contact interface and the propagation of compression waves inside a single wave rotor passage gradually opening to and traversing an inlet port is studied numerically using an inviscid formulation of the governing equations. Insights into {{the response of the}} interface and kinematics of the flow field to various opening times are given. Since the opening time is inversely proportional to the rotational speed of the rotor, the effects of passage rotation such as centripetal and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations</b> are intrinsically coupled to the gradual opening process. Certain three-dimensional features associated with the gradual opening process as a result of centripetal and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations</b> are illustrated. For the range of opening times or rotational speeds considered, a portion of the interface behaves like a vortex sheet that can degenerate into a complex interfacial structure. The vortices produced along the interface can serve as a stirring mechanism to promote local mixing. <b>Coriolis</b> and centripetal <b>accelerations</b> can introduce three dimensional effects such as interfacial distortions in meridional planes and spanwise migration of fluid elements...|$|R

The base of the polar low is in the mid to upper troposphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the polar cyclone has two centers on average. One center lies near Baffin Island and the other over northeast Siberia. In the southern hemisphere, it tends to be located {{near the edge of the}} Ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude.

40|$|Artificial gravity (AG) {{created by}} short-radius {{centrifugation}} is a promising countermeasure to the physiological de-conditioning {{that results from}} long-duration spaceflight. However, as on Earth, gravity alone does not ensure fitness. We will need to supplement passive exposure to AG with physical exercise to achieve a comprehensive countermeasure. Before AG exercise can be deemed safe and effective, we must understand how <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations</b> and a gravity gradient affect our biomechanics and how centrifuge-based exercises differ from Earth-upright ones. Two experiments were designed to investigate the squat biomechanics while upright in the laboratory and while lying supine on a horizontal, clockwise-rotating short-radius centrifuge at speeds up to 30 revolutions per minute. Constant force springs provided additional resistive force up to 25 % of body weight. Dependent measure included the three-dimensional position of {{the left and right}} knee, left and right foot reaction forces, and muscle activity. We investigated the Coriolis-induced mediolateral knee perturbations and the sensory-motor after-effects from a multiple repetition protocol. The upright and centrifuge biomechanics were compared for similarities and differences between them. In addition, a two-dimensional kinematic model was developed to predict foot reaction forces, <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations,</b> and joint torques. (cont.) Our results show that mediolateral knee travel during the AG squats was 1. 0 to 2. 0 centimeters greater than Earth-upright squats. Increasing the rotation rate or adding resistive force did not affect the results. The peak foot forces increased with rotation rate, but rarely exceeded 200 % body weight. The ratio of left-to-right foot force during centrifugation was non-constant and approximately sinusoidal, suggesting a postural correction for the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations.</b> There was a qualitative difference in the foot force vs. knee angle profile between upright and centrifuge-supine because of the centripetal acceleration. Muscle activity, however, was qualitatively similar between the conditions. The kinematic model was used to evaluate the exercise safety and extend the results to larger-radius centrifuges. We conclude that centrifugation provides a unique and challenging environment for exercise and that a brief artificial gravity squat can be carried out safely. The results are extended to cycle ergometry, when possible, and recommendations are made for future AG squat protocols.

40|$|Accurate {{representation}} of geostrophic and hydrostatic balance {{is an essential}} requirement for numerical modelling of geophysical flows. Potentially, unstructured mesh numerical methods offer significant benefits over conventional structured meshes, including the ability to conform to arbitrary bounding topography in a natural manner {{and the ability to}} apply dynamic mesh adaptivity. However, {{there is a need to}} develop robust schemes with accurate {{representation of}} physical balance on arbitrary unstructured meshes. We discuss the origin of physical balance errors in a finite element discretisation of the Navier-Stokes equations using the fractional timestep pressure projection method. By considering the Helmholtz decomposition of forcing terms in the momentum equation, it is shown that the components of the buoyancy and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations</b> that project onto the non-divergent velocity tendency are the small residuals between two terms of comparable magnitude. Hence there is a potential for significant injection of imbalance by a numerical method that does not compute these residuals accurately. This observation is used to motivate a balanced pressure decomposition method whereby an additional "balanced pressure" field, associated with buoyancy and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations,</b> is solved for at increased accuracy and used to precondition the solution for the dynamical pressure. The utility of this approach is quantified in a fully non-linear system in exact geostrophic balance. The approach is further tested via quantitative comparison of unstructured mesh simulations of the thermally driven rotating annulus against laboratory data. Using a piecewise linear discretisation for velocity and pressure (a stabilised P 1 P 1 discretisation), it is demonstrated that the balanced pressure decomposition method is required for a physically realistic representation of the system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The numerical analysis is based on a highly detailed tire model, including complex material properties by means of frequency dependent viscoelastic material definitions. A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the correspondence and differences between experimentally and numerically obtained modal parameters of a rolling tire. The analyses also show how the footprint contact, established due to loading of the tire, acts as a boundary condition for the structural waves and thus influences the dynamic behavior of the rolling tire. The results show that a rotating tire is subjected to <b>Coriolis</b> <b>accelerations</b> which make the wave speed of the positive- and negative-going wave to diverge from each other.
