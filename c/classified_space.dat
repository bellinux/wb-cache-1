"Far {{out in the}} uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy [...] " Stone {{disease has}} {{affected}} mankind since earliest recorded history and will trouble us as we strive for the stars. Zero and microgravity are risk factors for urolithiasis, but the incidence is not yet known. Yet, the possible "century of space exploration " lies before us if payloads can be inexpensively offloaded from Earth's surface to orbit. The scientific publications about medical conditions of astronauts, deep water environments (submarine) and extreme conditions (Arctic and Antarctic) were reviewed {{to better understand the}} urologic risks. Actual events were next sought and any scientific data regarding therapeutic intent was carefully scrutinized. Incidence and risk potential could then be calculated and potential for intervention would then be known.

Thus, the resulting <b>classifying</b> <b>spaces</b> are not homotopy equivalent to the 2 –completed <b>classifying</b> <b>space</b> of any finite group.

40|$|For a {{topological group}} G, the <b>classifying</b> <b>space</b> BG is an aspherical CW-complex such that its {{fundamental}} group is G and the universal cover is contractible. In the algebraic K- and L-theories, many long-standing conjectures use {{notions of the}} <b>classifying</b> <b>space</b> and the <b>classifying</b> <b>spaces</b> for various families of subgroups. Therefore, finding concrete and simple models of the <b>classifying</b> <b>spaces</b> is an important subject. The proper <b>classifying</b> <b>space</b> is the <b>classifying</b> <b>space</b> for the family of finite subgroups. There are many finite dimensional models for proper <b>classifying</b> <b>spaces,</b> {{many of which are}} finite, meaning that they consist of only finitely many equivariant cells. As observed by Adem and Ruan and proved by Ji, the Borel-Serre partial compactification provides finite models of the proper <b>classifying</b> <b>space</b> for arithmetic groups in semisimple Lie groups. Margulis’s arithmeticity theorem implies that the Borel-Serre parital compactification also provides finite models for irreducible lattices in higher rank semisimple Lie groups. The existence of finite models of the proper <b>classifying</b> <b>space</b> for general lattices in semisimple Lie groups is not yet fully known until now. The thesis presents the method of constructing finite models of the proper <b>classifying</b> <b>space</b> for general lattices in a semisimple Lie group of R-rank one. This is a generalization of the Borel-Serre partial compatification of rank one symmetric spaces. The resulting finite model is a manifold with boundary and it is obtained from the rank one symmetric space by attaching geometrically rational boundary components with respect to the lattice in concern. The main tools used in the proof are the topology defined by convergence class of sequences, the continuous and proper action of the lattice extended from the canonical action on the interior, Garland and Raghunathan’s reduction theory on lattices in semisimple Lie groups of R-rank one, and Illman’s theorem on the existence of G-CW-complex structures on subanalytic G-manifolds...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II Australian space {{activity}} has been confined largely to providing land to support the space ambitions and activities of its major allies. In the 1940 s and 1950 s, the Woomera test range supported the ambitions of the United Kingdom {{to develop nuclear weapons}} and an intercontinental ballistic missile. From the 1960 s, Australia has hosted a range of ground stations which support <b>classified</b> <b>space</b> activities conducted by the United States as well as unclassified programs conducted by NASA, ESA and others. More recently Australia has recognised that Space Situational Awareness (SSA) capabilities are essential to the regulation of the space environment, which is so easily harmed and so hard to repair, in the interests of all of humanity. This paper describes recent developments with respect to SSA in Australia, both in the military and civil domains and places this within a broader context of policy development and international cooperation. The paper discusses the importance, from the perspective of SSA, of Australia’s geo-strategic position in the world. Located in the southern hemisphere and also proximate to Asia and the Indian sub -continent, Australia has a unique vantage point from which to monitor space objects which will be a vital factor for peace and stability in the Indo- Pacific Century...|$|E
40|$|Houses are distinctively {{organised}} spatial {{networks that}} embody social norms {{and meaning of}} a given culture. Normally it is accepted that visually identifiable house ‘types’ which also closely fit the culture of a group are adopted by society. In Sri Lanka, there was popular house ‘types’ among the middle class until about 1980. Today, house forms {{of the middle class}} are diverse with apparent new trends in recent years. If contemporary middle class house forms are not visually characterized by type/s, how does ‘culture’ influence house form? This paper explores whether there are ‘types’ with distinctive spatial networks among the diverse house forms and the nature of embodied social norms. In the context of apparent change, such exploration advances the understanding of the association of house form and culture for the contemporary society of Sri Lanka. By using space syntax analysis, this paper argues that although eclectic in visual appearance, middle class houses share a cultural ‘gene’ in their spatial configuration as a ‘genotype’ that operate beneath the visual. Analysis of forty houses revealed that an older genotype named as the O model is diminishing and that a new genotype named as the M model had stabilised after 1980. The contemporary ‘genotype’ classifies space to accommodate meanings of a new everyday home life. The older genotype which <b>classified</b> <b>space</b> to accommodate meaning of a by-gone lifestyle is no longer popular. The negotiation between the new genotype and heterogeneous phenotypes allow for the affirming of class solidarities in new ways in contemporary Sri Lank...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{segmentation}} of data in 2 D and 3 D by texture analysis using Fourier domain filtering. The field of texture analysis is a well-trodden one in 2 D, but many applications, such as Medical Imaging, Stratigraphy or Crystallography, {{would benefit from}} 3 D analysis instead of the traditional, slice-by-slice approach. With the intention of contributing to texture analysis and segmentation in 3 D, a multiresolution volumetric texture segmentation (M-VTS) algorithm is presented. The method extracts textural measurements from the Fourier domain of the data via sub-band filtering using a Second Orientation Pyramid. A novel Bhattacharyya space, based on the Bhattacharyya distance is proposed for selecting of the most discriminant measurements and produces a compact feature space. Each dimension of the feature space is used to form a Quad Tree. At {{the highest level of}} the tree, new positional features are added to improve the contiguity of the classification. The <b>classified</b> <b>space</b> is then projected to lower levels of the tree where a boundary refinement procedure is performed with a 3 D equivalent of butterfly filters. The performance of M-VTS is tested in 2 D by classifying a set of standard texture images. The figures contain different textures that are visually stationary. M-VTS yields lower misclassification rates than reported elsewhere ([104, 111, 124]). The algorithm was tested in 3 D with artificial isotropic data and three Magnetic Resonance Imaging sets of human knees with satisfactory results. The regions segmented from the knees correspond to anatomical structures that {{could be used as a}} starting point for other measurements. By way of example, we demonstrate successful cartilage extraction using our approach...|$|E
