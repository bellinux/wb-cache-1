40|$|Many {{guidelines}} and recommendations for sugarcane farming are aimed at achieving {{a large number of}} ratoon crops. One of the reasons for this is that the replanting costs can be considerable when a field is conventionally tilled and replanted. Thus, delaying reestablishment makes financial sense provided the cost savings are greater than any yield and revenue penalties. An alternative is to introduce a <b>controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> and zero-till <b>farming</b> system (CTF), thereby lowering re-establishment costs and potentially allowing for fewer ratoon crops and more frequent green manure or break crops. A rigorous yield, sucrose content, costing and cash-flow analysis, based on published research findings and detailed costing of representative machinery, showed that a CTF system with only three ratoon crops was far more profitable than a conventional farming system involving eight ratoon crops and more intensive tillage operations. A doubling in profitability was shown when the yield benefits reported with break crops and the yield decline rates reported under conventional farming systems were included in the analysis. Substantial gains in water use productivity were also shown, up to nearly 80 % improvement over a conventional farming system. Adoption of a CTF system with only three ratoon crops is therefore highly recommended and should be taken very seriously by decision-makers in the sugarcane industry...|$|R

50|$|<b>Controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>farming</b> is {{a system}} which {{confines}} all machinery loads to the least possible area of permanent traffic lanes. Current farming systems allow machines to run at random over the land, compacting around 75% of the area within one season and at least the whole area by the second season. Soils don’t recover quickly, taking {{as much as a}} few years. A proper CTF system on the other hand can reduce tracking to just 15% and this is always in the same place. CTF is a tool; it does not include a prescription for tillage although most growers adopting CTF use little or none because soil structure {{does not need to be}} repaired. The permanent traffic lanes are normally parallel to each other and this is the most efficient way of achieving CTF, but the definition does not preclude tracking at an angle. The permanent traffic lanes may be cropped or non-cropped depending on a wide range of variables and local constraints.|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{mechanisation}} is a {{major factor}} underlying the high productivity and low cost of most Australian crop production systems. Efficiency has generally been associated with greater work rates, achieved by using equipment of greater power and weight. This trend has continued until very recently, despite a reduction in tillage for weed control. Scientists have warned of erosion and soil structural degradation caused by tillage and traffic, but tillage, rather than field traffic was seen as the major problem, and reduction of tillage as the solution. Reduced tillage has provided major benefits, but adoption has occurred slowly and sustained zero tillage is still rare, except in <b>controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>farming</b> systems. The first part of this paper presents research evidence of the direct cost, practical impact and long-term effects of wheel traffic on cropped soil. Direct cost is associated with the energy requirements of disturbing wheeled soil. Practical impact occurs {{as a result of the}} lost opportunities and additional operations associated with wheel ruts. Long-term productivity and environmental impact occur because wheel traffic reduces plant available water and increases runoff and erosion. In controlled traffic all equipment wheels are restricted to compacted permanent traffic lanes, so that soil in the crop beds and traffic lanes can be managed respectively for optimum cropping and optimum trafficability. <b>Controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>farming</b> recognizes the symbiosis between controlled traffic and zero tillage in providing opportunities for more productive and sustainable farming of soil uncompromised by wheel effects. The beneficial effects of controlled traffic have been demonstrated in widely different soils and mechanisation systems (e. g. Australia and China), and it has been vigorously advocated in both the USA and Europe, but large-scale adoption has been rare. The second part of this paper discusses cropping system response to <b>controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>farming,</b> and the program which led to large-scale adoption in Australia. This happened first in extensive grain production, but adoption has since occurred in many Australian farming systems, supported by the availability of high-precision field guidance systems and a greater range of compatible equipment. <b>Controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>farming</b> reduces soil degradation and the energy requirements of cropping.

40|$|<b>Controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>farming</b> (CTF) uses a {{range of}} {{technologies}} to confine traffic-induced compaction to permanently defined tramlines within a farm's cropping area. CTF concentrates and improves trafficability whilst simultaneously supporting soil structure improvement between tramlines, thereby raising crop yields and offering other advantages such as reduced overlap that saves on crop inputs. This study uses whole-farm modelling to assess the profitability and role of CTF in different farming systems in Australian dryland agriculture. Farming system scenarios with and without the CTF are compared. Stepwise analysis, combined with sensitivity analysis, reveals the characteristics of CTF that most affect its value. Results indicate that the most valuable aspect of the technology is its beneficial impact on the yield and quality of crops grown on soils most subject to compaction. Hence, on farms dominated by these soils and where their faming system emphasizes cropping, CTF forms an especially valuable role. For a typical farm in the study region, employing conservative measures, farm profit increases by around 50 % through use of CTF. Hence, CTF represents a remarkably profitable innovation for farming systems, offering input savings and output increases. <b>Controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>farming</b> Farm modelling Farming systems Profit...|$|E

Few if any researchers attempted to develop on-farm systems using existing machinery until the mid 1990 s when a small and dedicated team in Australia encouraged farmers to experiment. This quickly led to rapid expansion across the continent to its present day c. 13 % of the cropped area.

In an on-farm field experiment in green pea, spinach, onions and carrots, SCTF with traffic lanes at 3. 15 -m centres was compared with conventional random traffic farming (RTF) using low ground pressures in spring from 2002 till 2005. Compared with RTF, the topsoil structure in the SCTF system improved, {{also in terms of}} lower spatial variability, for the crops sown on the flat but not for carrot grown on ridges.

SCTF was economically feasible for hypothetical 50 -ha and 200 -ha organic farms. An important advantage of SCTF over RTF is the increase in number of days that field operations can be executed.

This study, {{as part of a}} research on <b>controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>farming,</b> assessed the impact of compaction from wheel traffic on filtration properties of the soil that had not been trafficked for five years. Soil compaction induced by different rear axle weight was conducted on a clay soil to simulate effects of traffic typical of grain production operations in the northern Australian grain belt. A portable rainfall simulator was used to determine infiltration characteristics. Crop performance was also monitored. Time to ponding, steady infiltration rates and total infiltration were reduced significantly with axle load, although the soil surface was covered by 80 per cent crop residue. Poor crop establishment occurred on the wheeled plots, where plants were generally unhealthy compared with those under non-wheeled plots. Roots of plants on the wheeled plots were not able to penetrate the soil, while those from non-wheeled plots were longer and denser. Mean dry matter production of sweet corn decreased with axle loads, but none of these differences were significant. These results demonstrated that soil compaction induced by wheel traffic has significant effects on infiltration properties and crop performance. The exclusion of wheel traffic under a <b>controlled</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>farming</b> system, combined with residue cover under conservation tillage practices, provides a way to enhance the sustainability of cropping this soil for improved infiltration, increased stored soil water and reduced runoff and environmental damage...|$|E
