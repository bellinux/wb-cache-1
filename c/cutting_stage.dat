The removal of the remaining part of allowance takes place close to the tool tip as the material has sufficient rigidity to allow cutting only in this area in final developed stage and secondary burr will be formed; primary burr will be formed in final developed stage if the remaining material has no rigidity to allow cutting continually in final developed stage. The burr size and burr shapes form simulation results are consistent with the experimental results.

En partant du haut de la tige, cette teneur augmente jusqu’à la feuille à l’aisselle de laquelle est située la première inflorescence au stade «liseré violet» (rang 0) puis décroît régulièrement jusque vers la base de la tige. La teneur en rubisco de la feuille de rang 0 a été déterminée, aux époques de récolte, sur 11 génotypes. Elle ne semble pas corrélée aux teneurs en matière sèche ou en azote de cette feuille mais varie entre 5 et 15 % de la teneur en matière sèche selon le cycle de récolte et le génotype. La teneur en rubisco augmente nettement entre le 1 er et le 2 e cycle puis reste sensiblement constante du 2 e au 4 e pour les types méditerranéens. Dans le cas des types flamands, on observe une teneur maximale marquée au 2 e ou au 3 e cycle. The {{content of}} ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) {{has been determined}} in leaves on the main stem of plants at the late budding stage by an immunochemical method. Starting from the stem top, the content of rubisco increases up to the leaf where the 1 st inflorescence at the late budding stage is located (0 level) and then decreases towards the oldest part of the main stem (table I). Rubisco content of the 0 level leaf has been determined at the cutting (late budding) stages in 11 populations of alfalfa (table II, fig 1). Rubisco content varies much more than dry matter or nitrogen, and varies more between cutting stages than between populations (table III). Rubisco content {{does not seem to}} be correlated with dry matter or nitrogen content of the 0 level leaf (table IV), but ranges between 5 and 15 % of the dry weight, depending on the population and on the <b>cutting</b> <b>stage.</b> The content of rubisco clearly increases from the first to the second <b>cutting</b> <b>stage</b> and remains nearly constant from the second to the fourth <b>cutting</b> <b>stage</b> in mediterranean type populations.

40|$|Sheet {{metal working}} remains an {{important}} industry. It is argued that, to be competitive, the complete production chain {{needs to be}} optimised. Therefore, {{this article focuses on}} the optimisation of the production plan. The sheet metal shop is configured as a two-stage flow shop with laser cutting and air bending. In the literature, theoretical production planning models can be found for both individual processes. Unfortunately, those planning models have a low applicability in sheet metal working small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) {{due to the fact that}} they only focus on one single production step while in reality the planning decisions taken at the <b>cutting</b> <b>stage</b> affect the production plan for the air bending stage. An integrated production planning methodology is proposed to overcome this problem of individual optimisation by taking into account relevant bending information already at the <b>cutting</b> <b>stage.</b> An integer program is presented, incorporating some important practical requirements: (1) the planning model is suited for normal workpieces, rush orders, special workpieces and multiple-machine sheet metal shops and (2) the computational times to generate the production plan are limited. Ten real-life industrial test cases are used to evaluate the proposed methodology. The integrated production planning methodology results in schedules with a reduced makespan and a reduced set-up time at the press brake compared to the current way of planning.
