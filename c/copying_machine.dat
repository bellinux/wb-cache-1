500|$|Before {{the show}} aired, Ricky Gervais {{acknowledged}} {{that there were}} feelings of hesitation from certain viewers. The first season of The Office was met with a mixed response from critics {{with some of them}} comparing it to the short-lived NBC series Coupling which was also based on a British version. The New York Daily News called it [...] "so diluted there's little left but muddy water," [...] and USA Today called it a [...] "passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original." [...] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating, [...] "(Steve Carell) just seems to be trying too hard ... Maybe in later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant's script, he'll come into his own. But right now he's a pale imitation." [...] Tom Shales of the Washington Post said it was [...] "not the mishmash that [...] turned out to be, but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim, like when the <b>copying</b> <b>machine</b> is just about to give out." ...|$|E

"Though much of The Sword and the Shield {{is drawn}} from Andrew's earlier works and collaborations, the book does contain fresh revelations" [...] and then he adds that [...] "several of the much-publicized revelations, however, hardly qualify as such. For instance, the authors tell how the K.G.B. forged a letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to E. Howard Hunt, the former C.I.A. officer and later Watergate conspirator, in order to {{implicate}} the C.I.A. in the Kennedy assassination. Actually, this story surfaced in Henry Hurt's Reasonable Doubt, written 13 years ago. Similarly, the story that the K.G.B. considered schemes for breaking {{the legs of the}} ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev for defecting to the West was first reported in a book written six years ago." [...] And he added that [...] "it does seem odd that a key K.G.B. archivist never had access to a <b>copying</b> <b>machine,</b> but had to copy thousands of pages in longhand. Still, the overall impact of this volume is convincing, though none of the material will send historians scurrying to rewrite their books." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of <b>copy</b> <b>machines</b> on late twentieth-century print cultures. Specifically, this article makes a case for “dry copying,” the method of print reproduction perfected by Xerox in the late 1950 s, as a unique medium rather than a weak imitation of other printing methods. Following {{the claim that the}} widespread availability of <b>copy</b> <b>machines</b> {{in the late twentieth century}} represented the arrival of a new medium, this article further examines how understandings of authorship, established with print culture, came undone in the era of the <b>copy</b> <b>machine.</b> Finally, this paper makes a case for understanding <b>copy</b> <b>machines</b> as a form of “social media” that opened up opportunities for writers, readers and publishers to create, share, exchange and comment on texts and images in communities and networks of their own making in the decades preceding the development of the web...|$|R
