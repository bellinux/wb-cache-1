5|$|Established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad {{remained}} {{under the}} rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the Mughals captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during the British Raj, and remained so for , with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as the <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> Hyderabad State after it was brought into the Indian Union in 1948, and became the <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> Andhra Pradesh after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 1956, Rashtrapati Nilayam in the city has been the winter office of the President of India.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{provides}} a farm sector comparison <b>of</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> input for fourteen OECD countries {{for the period}} 1973 - 2002. The starting point for construction of a measure <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> input is the measurement <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> stock. Estimates <b>of</b> depreciable <b>capital</b> are derived by representing capital stock at each point of time as a weighted sum of past investments. The weights correspond to the relative efficiencies <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods <b>of</b> different ages, so that the weighted components <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> stock have the same efficiency. Estimates of the stock of land are derived from balance sheet data. We convert estimates <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> stock into estimates <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> service flows by means <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> rental prices. Comparisons <b>of</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> input among countries require data on relative prices <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> input. We obtain relative price levels for capital input via relative investment goods prices, {{taking into account the}} flow <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> input per unit <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> stock in each country...|$|R
