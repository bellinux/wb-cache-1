25|$|A {{heat pump}} uses an {{electrically}} driven compressor {{to operate a}} refrigeration cycle that extracts heat energy from outdoor air, the ground or ground water, and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. A liquid contained within the evaporator section of the heat pump boils at low pressure, absorbing heat energy from the outdoor air or the ground. The vapor is then compressed by a compressor and piped into a <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> within the building to be heated. The heat from the hot dense gas is absorbed by {{the air in the}} building (and sometimes also used for domestic hot water) causing the hot working fluid to condense back into a liquid. From there the high pressure fluid is passed back to the evaporator section where it expands through an orifice and into the evaporator section, completing the cycle. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed to move heat out of the conditioned space and to the outside air.|$|E

The heated seawater enters {{the lower part of the}} first chamber, then drains over a weir and passes to the second chamber, encouraged by the differential vacuum between them. The brine produced by a flash distiller is only slightly concentrated and is pumped overboard continuously.|$|E

50|$|Air-cooled and evaporatively cooled {{chillers}} {{are intended}} for outdoor installation and operation. Air-cooled machines are directly cooled by ambient air being mechanically circulated directly through the machine's <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> to expel heat to the atmosphere. Evaporatively cooled machines are similar, except they implement a mist of water over the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> to aid in condenser cooling, making the machine more efficient than a traditional air-cooled machine. No remote cooling tower is typically required with either {{of these types of}} packaged air-cooled or evaporatively cooled chillers.|$|E
50|$|Because an air {{conditioner}} moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil.</b> Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as {{picked up by the}} evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.|$|E

50|$|HVAC makes {{extensive}} use of tortuosity in evaporator and <b>condenser</b> <b>coils</b> for heat exchangers, whereas Ultra-high vacuum makes use of the inverse of tortuosity, which is conductivity, with short, straight, voluminous paths.|$|R
50|$|The {{water that}} {{condenses}} on the evaporator {{in an air}} conditioner is usually routed to remove extracted water from the conditioned space. Newer high-efficiency window units use the condensed water to help cool the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> by evaporating the water into the outdoor air, while older units simply allowed the water to drip outside.|$|E
50|$|Inside the unit, the air {{passes over}} the {{evaporator}} coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> {{where it is}} warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) {{that is to be}} conditioned.|$|E
50|$|Discharge {{pressure}} (also called {{high side}} pressure or head pressure) is the pressure generated on the output {{side of a}} gas compressor in a refrigeration or air conditioning system. The discharge pressure is affected by several factors: size and speed of the condenser fan, condition and cleanliness of the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil,</b> {{and the size of}} the discharge line. An extremely high discharge pressure coupled with an extremely low suction pressure is an indicator of a refrigerant restriction.|$|E
50|$|Circulating {{refrigerant}} vapor {{enters the}} compressor, where its pressure and temperature are increased. The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor {{is now at}} a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser. Here it is cooled by air flowing across the <b>condenser</b> <b>coils</b> and <b>condensed</b> into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air. The removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the <b>condenser</b> <b>coils,</b> making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve.|$|R
40|$|This study {{constructed}} a parameter analysis {{for improving the}} energy performance of air-cooled water chillers by altering the angle configuration of the <b>condenser</b> <b>coils.</b> The mathematical models for energy and exergy analyses of the individual components and overall system of air-cooled water chillers are presented. This study investigated the potential enhancement of performance efficiency in air-cooled chillers and the energy conversion efficiency of each component, {{in order to determine}} how the angle configuration of <b>condenser</b> <b>coils</b> influences chiller performance. This study found that the overall performance of an air-cooled chiller could be improved by approximately 3. 4 %, and the total irreversibility could be reduced by approximately 2. 7 %. With each 1 % increase in average wind speed over the <b>condenser</b> <b>coils,</b> the overall performance of an air‑cooled chiller was found to be enhanced by approximately 0. 43 %, and its total irreversibility was reduced by approximately 0. 35 %. The results of this study can be effectively applied to air-cooled condenser units, and can provide an important basis of reference for developing and enhancing the energy efficiency of air-cooled chillers...|$|R
50|$|A few {{manufacturers}} offer {{dual compressor}} models. These models have separate freezer and refrigerator compartments that operate independently of each other, sometimes mounted {{within a single}} cabinet. Each has its own separate compressor, <b>condenser</b> and evaporator <b>coils,</b> insulation, thermostat, and door. Typically, the compressors and <b>condenser</b> <b>coils</b> are mounted {{at the top of}} the cabinet, with a single fan to cool them both.|$|R
50|$|The {{refrigerator}} uses three substances: ammonia, hydrogen gas, and water. The {{cycle is}} closed, with all hydrogen, water and ammonia collected and endlessly reused. The system is pressurized {{to the pressure}} where the boiling point of ammonia {{is higher than the}} temperature of the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> (the coil which transfers heat to the air outside the refrigerator, by being hotter than the outside air) This pressure is typically 14-16atm, at which pressure the dew point of ammonia will be about 35 °C (95 °F).|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical/refrigeration dehumidifiers, {{the most}} common type, usually work by drawing moist air over a {{refrigerated}} coil with a fan. The cold evaporator coil of the refrigeration device condenses the water, which is removed, and then the air is reheated by the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil.</b> The now dehumidified, re-warmed air is released into the room. This process works most effectively at higher ambient temperatures with a high dew point temperature. In cold climates, the process is less effective. It is most effective at over 45% relative humidity; higher if the air is cold [...]|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{dehumidifier}} {{differs from}} a standard air conditioner in {{that both the}} evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy {{out of the room}} because its <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.|$|E

25|$|Today, steam, evaporator, and <b>condenser</b> <b>coils</b> {{are made}} from copper and copper alloys.

25|$|The {{advantage}} of the flash distiller over the compound evaporator is its greater operating efficiency, in terms of heat supplied. This is due to working under vacuum, thus low temperature, and also the regenerative use of the <b>condenser</b> <b>coils</b> to pre-heat the seawater feed.|$|R

While the trio is distracted, their dog smashes some bottles of samogon. The dog also takes the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil,</b> and while being chased by the trio, leads them to the militsiya.|$|E
50|$|A {{specialized}} {{air conditioner}} {{that is used}} only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier. It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy {{out of the room}} because its <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.|$|E
5000|$|A {{heat pump}} is an air {{conditioner}} in which the refrigeration cycle can be reversed, producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also {{commonly referred to as}} a [...] "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating. Some homeowners elect to have a heat pump system installed as a feature of a central air conditioner. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil,</b> producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).|$|E

Note that all other thermal considerations for these <b>condensing</b> <b>coils</b> {{have been made in}} D 0 EN 3740. 512 - 234. The conclusion of this report is the feed lines, previously deemed appropriate without detailed analysis, have been demonstrated to be adequately designed for the intended service and require no further investigation...|$|R
25|$|A {{limitation}} of the flash distiller is its sensitivity to seawater inlet temperature, as this affects {{the efficiency of the}} <b>condenser</b> <b>coils.</b> In tropical waters, the distiller flowrate must be throttled to maintain effective condensation. As these systems are more modern, they are generally fitted with an electric salinometer and some degree of automatic control.|$|R
50|$|Although PTACs {{are used}} mostly to heat or cool a single living space using only {{electricity}} (with resistive and/or heat pump heating), there are cooling-only PTACs with external heating through a hydronic heating coil or natural gas heating. Typical PTAC {{heating and cooling}} capacity values range from 2 to 5.5 kilowatts (7,000-19,000 BTU/h) nominal. One characteristic of PTACs is that condensate drain piping is not required because the condensate water extracted from the air by the evaporator coil is drawn by the condenser fan onto the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> surface where it evaporates. Conventional PTACs still require condensate drain piping to be installed. The first practical through the wall air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at Chrysler Motors and offered for sale starting in 1935.|$|E
50|$|Air-source {{heat pumps}} are more popular in milder winter climates where the {{temperature}} is frequently {{in the range of}} 40-55 °F (4-13 °C), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil,</b> so that it can heat up and defrost. A heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.|$|E

40|$|Demands {{for higher}} energy {{efficiencies}} in both {{residential and commercial}} refrigeration and air conditioning systems {{have resulted in a}} trend toward heat exchanger designs that are more compact with higher capacities for heat transfer. Traditional copper tube/aluminum fin coil manufacturing technology remains prevalent throughout the industry and, when modified for smaller diameter copper tubes of 5 mm or less, significant improvements in heat transfer can be achieved. When coupled with internal enhancements to the copper tubes such as microgrooves, coil designs can be smaller, more efficient and less costly. Using a commercially available heat exchanger design and simulation software and CFD modeling, this paper compares optimized 3 -ton air conditioning <b>condenser</b> <b>coils</b> manufactured with small-diameter internally enhanced copper tubes against condensers with aluminum microchannel tubes. Simulated operating conditions are held constant, including refrigerant inlet pressure and temperature, as well as air flow rate and inlet temperature. Comparisons of material consumption, refrigerant charge, volume, and heat transfer performance are demonstrated. It was found that using internally enhanced copper tubes with a diameter of 5 mm, <b>condenser</b> <b>coils</b> can be designed to operate with less refrigerant charge and have the potential to be lighter and more compact than commercially available, optimized aluminum coil designs with microchannel tubes...|$|R
