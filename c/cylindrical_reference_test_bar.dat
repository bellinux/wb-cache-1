We conclude that the two <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> are not compared by shifting gaze location or attention from one <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> to the other, nor by attending to two spatial locations. In addition, observers can discriminate the orientation difference and mean orientation of two <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> that, each of which is rendered visible by a different sub-modality (motion, disparity or luminance). Taking into account the findings reported here and previously reported findings on the early processing of luminance-defined form (Vis. Res. 40 (2000) 2291, Vis. Res. 42 (2002) 49) and cyclopean form (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B 268 (2001) 213) we propose that the human visual system contains a fast long-distance comparator that compares the orientation and locations of two <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> while being insensitive to stimuli in the space between the <b>test</b> <b>bars,</b> and that this process is independent of whether the <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> are rendered visible by only one of three kinds of contrast (luminance, disparity, motion) or by combinations of the three. One role of this comparator mechanism may be to rapidly bind the spatial aspects of the retinal image across sub-modalities immediately after each saccade...|$|R

The deviations strongly correlated with horizontal (right ^ left) but not with vertical (forward ^ backward) distance.

In a meta-analysis of diagnostic studies, the evaluation of test accuracy is impeded {{by the use of}} different imperfect <b>reference</b> <b>tests.</b> The aim of our study is to summarize sensitivity and specificity of BS for CRPS 1 and to identify factors to explain heterogeneity. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to model test accuracy and threshold, and we present different models accounting for the imperfect nature of the <b>reference</b> <b>tests,</b> and assuming conditional dependence between BS and the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> results. Further, we include disease duration as explanatory variable in the model. The models are compared using summary ROC curves and the deviance information criterion (DIC). Our results show that those models which account for different imperfect <b>reference</b> <b>tests</b> with conditional dependence and inclusion of the covariate are the ones with the smallest DIC. The sensitivity of BS was 0. 87 (95 % credible interval 0. 73 - 0. 97) and the overall specificity was 0. 87 (0. 73 - 0. 95) in the model with the smallest DIC, in which missing values of the covariate are imputed within the Bayesian framework. The estimated effect of duration of symptoms on the threshold parameter was 0. 17 (- 0. 25 to 0. 57).

40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{studies on}} <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> cases are of capital {{importance}} {{to support the}} development of models and coupling strategies for simulations on fluid-structure interaction problems. The need for experimental test cases specially addressed for the validation and diagnostic of numerical tools has triggered the present contribution to design and to study two-dimensional <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> cases both in laminar and turbulent flows. From the experimental view point, investigations on coupled unsteady flow and structure motions require specially adapted test rigs and measuring techniques to obtain accurate time-phase resolved results. Therefore a new experimental facility to be operated with a large range of viscous liquids was built exclusively for the present study. It made possible to perform measurements, using optical laser measurement techniques, in laminar and turbulent flows under very well controlled boundary and working conditions. A Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measuring system was adapted to measure both the periodical flow velocity field and the structure deflection modes.
