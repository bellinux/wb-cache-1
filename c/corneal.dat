5|$|The eye {{problems}} associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, <b>corneal</b> dystrophy, distichia, entropion, microphthalmia, optic disc drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for <b>corneal</b> dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|The eyes {{should be}} copiously {{irrigated}} with physiological saline or water and examined for <b>corneal</b> abrasions.|$|E
5|$|Congenital endothelial {{dystrophy}} type 2, a rare form of <b>corneal</b> dystrophy, {{is linked}} to mutations in SLC4A11 gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the intracellular concentration of boron.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{problems}} are also possible in some Labradors, particularly progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, <b>corneal</b> dystrophy and retinal dysplasia. Dogs which {{are intended to}} be bred should be examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist for an eye score.|$|E
5|$|A 1999 {{study of}} Cavaliers {{conducted}} by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems. They include hereditary cataracts, <b>corneal</b> dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, microphthalmia, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{individuals}} with this disorder have not been diagnosed and consequently are not receiving lipid-lowering treatments. Physical examination findings can help a physician make the diagnosis of FH. Tendon xanthomas are seen in 20-40% {{of individuals}} with FH and are pathognomonic for the condition. A xanthelasma or <b>corneal</b> arcus may also be seen. These common signs are supportive of the diagnosis, but are non-specific findings.|$|E
5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is due {{to an increase in}} the refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a <b>corneal</b> or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, <b>corneal</b> ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and <b>corneal</b> ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
5|$|Other eye {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include cataracts in juveniles, <b>corneal</b> dystrophy, progressive retinal atrophy and posterior vitreous detachment. Non-eye breed related {{conditions which}} may affect a Parson are deafness and patella luxation. The average lifespan of a Parson Russell Terrier is between 14 and 15 years.|$|E
5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at a {{large and}} important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and <b>corneal</b> changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though {{it was unclear whether}} it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to <b>corneal</b> ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} reflects Bruegel's {{mastery of}} observation. Each figure {{has a different}} eye affliction, including <b>corneal</b> leukoma, atrophy of globe and removed eyes. The men hold their heads aloft to make better use of their other senses. The diagonal composition reinforces the off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression. It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger, and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by Charles Baudelaire and William Carlos Williams, and a novel by Gert Hofmann.|$|E
5|$|The site of S.iniae {{infection}} and its clinical presentation vary from species to species. In tilapia, S.iniae causes meningoencephalitis, with symptoms including lethargy, dorsal rigidity, and erratic swimming behavior; death follows {{in a matter}} of days. In rainbow trout, it is typically associated with septicemia and central nervous system damage. Symptoms are consistent with septicemia, and include lethargy and loss of orientation (as in tilapia), exophthalmia, <b>corneal</b> opacity, and external and internal bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Where {{there is}} still a <b>corneal</b> reflex or {{spontaneous}} motor response to painful stimulus but all other criteria are satisfied, or where any of the criteria cannot be performed but the remaining criteria are satisfied, the irreversible cessation of all brain functions can be determined by a combination of the criteria that have been satisfied and the performance of a supplementary test. These tests are cerebral angiography to confirm that there is no intracranial blood flow, and a radionuclide scan to confirm that there is no intracranial perfusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{instruments}} used by ophthalmologists {{to measure}} the <b>corneal</b> power (keratometers, <b>corneal</b> topographers) cannot obtain accurate measurements in eyes that have undergone <b>corneal</b> refractive surgery. Most manual keratometers measure at the 3-mm zone of the central cornea, which often misses the central flatter zone of effective <b>corneal</b> power.|$|E
25|$|Wearing lenses {{designed}} for daily wear overnight has {{an increased risk}} for <b>corneal</b> infections, <b>corneal</b> ulcers and <b>corneal</b> neovascularization—this latter condition, once it sets in, cannot be reversed and will eventually spoil vision acuity through diminishing <b>corneal</b> transparency. The most common complication of extended wear is giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), sometimes associated with a poorly fitting contact lens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Corneal</b> ulcers {{are one of}} {{the most}} common eye {{diseases}} in dogs. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause <b>corneal</b> ulcers, such as entropion, distichiae, <b>corneal</b> dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). There have been at least two cases where <b>corneal</b> ulceration was caused by canine herpesvirus.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of <b>corneal</b> ulcers {{includes}} topical {{antibiotic therapy}} to prevent infection, and pain medications, including topical atropine to stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. Atropine may decrease tear production and interfere with <b>corneal</b> healing. Superficial ulcers usually heal {{in less than}} a week. Deep ulcers and descemetoceles may require <b>corneal</b> suturing, conjunctival grafts or conjunctival flaps, soft contact lenses, or <b>corneal</b> transplant. Topical corticosteroids and anesthetics should not be used on any type of <b>corneal</b> ulcer because they prevent healing and will often make them worse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Corneal</b> ectasia is a {{progressive}} thinning of the cornea; {{the most common}} form of this condition is keratoconus. Collagen cross-linking by applying riboflavin topically then shining UV light is a method to slow progression of <b>corneal</b> ectasia by strengthening <b>corneal</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Corneal</b> ulcer, or {{ulcerative}} keratitis, is {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} cornea involving loss of its outer layer. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause <b>corneal</b> ulcers, such as entropion, distichia, <b>corneal</b> dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca.|$|E
25|$|PMD lacks apical <b>corneal</b> scarring, Rizutti's phenomenon, Munson's sign, and {{the central}} <b>corneal</b> {{thickness}} is usually normal.|$|E
25|$|X-linked endothelial <b>corneal</b> {{dystrophy}} is {{an extremely}} rare disease of cornea associated with Xq25 region. Lisch epithelial <b>corneal</b> dystrophy is associated with Xp22.3.|$|E
25|$|<b>Corneal</b> ulcer - an {{inflammatory}} or infective {{condition of the}} cornea involving disruption of its epithelial layer with involvement of the <b>corneal</b> stroma.|$|E
25|$|Soft lenses {{are often}} used in the {{treatment}} and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. A bandage contact lens protects an injured or diseased cornea from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids thereby allowing it to heal. They {{are used in the}} treatment of conditions including bullous keratopathy, dry eyes, <b>corneal</b> abrasions and erosion, keratitis, <b>corneal</b> edema, descemetocele, <b>corneal</b> ectasis, Mooren's ulcer, anterior <b>corneal</b> dystrophy, and neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis. Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, a {{case report}} of keratomycosis {{in a healthy}} 46-year-old farmer, found E. rostratum {{as the cause of}} <b>corneal</b> {{infection}} after an incident of local trauma with vegetable matter. An eye examination revealed a central <b>corneal</b> ulcer about 8mm with a greyish-white slough, feathery edges and diffuse <b>corneal</b> edema was seen in the right eye.|$|E
25|$|There {{is almost}} {{invariably}} a secondary uveitis present with <b>corneal</b> ulceration, {{and signs of}} this may also be seen: miosis, <b>corneal</b> oedema, aqueous flare, hypopyon, IOP changes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Corneal</b> {{dystrophy}} is {{a condition}} characterized by bilateral, noninflammatory opacity of the cornea. It appears as grayish white lines, circles, or clouding of the cornea. <b>Corneal</b> dystrophy can also have a crystalline appearance.|$|E
25|$|The first {{successful}} <b>corneal</b> allograft transplant {{was performed in}} 1837 in a gazelle model; the {{first successful}} human <b>corneal</b> transplant, a keratoplastic operation, was performed by Eduard Zirm at Olomouc Eye Clinic, now Czech Republic, in 1905.|$|E
25|$|Culture and {{sensitivity}} {{is recommended for}} rapidly progressive or deep <b>corneal</b> ulcers. Cotton swabbing is often inadequate, and <b>corneal</b> scraping, for example, with the blunt side of a scalpel blade is usually required. This can be greatly facilitated {{by the use of}} local nerve blocks and topical anaesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Dry eyes (due to loss of <b>corneal</b> moisture).|$|E
25|$|Bacterial and fungal {{infection}} occurs readily {{after the initial}} ulceration, as disruption of the <b>corneal</b> epithelium allows attachment and colonisation of the underlying tissues by normal <b>corneal</b> commensals. Commonly isolated bacteria include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Pseudomonas, and empirical anti-microbial therapy should be effective against these bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Keratoconjunctivitis is the {{combination}} of conjunctivitis and keratitis (<b>corneal</b> inflammation).|$|E
25|$|Mishandling {{of contact}} lenses {{can also cause}} problems. <b>Corneal</b> {{abrasions}} can increase the chances of infection. When combined with improper cleaning and disinfection of the lens, a risk of infection further increases. Decreased <b>corneal</b> sensitivity following extended contact lens wear may cause a patient to miss {{some of the earliest}} symptoms of such complications.|$|E
25|$|The <b>corneal</b> {{thickness}} from mild (> 506 μm) {{to advanced}} (< 446 μm).|$|E
25|$|Cataract {{extraction}} following {{refractive surgery}} poses special {{problems for the}} patient and the surgeon because the <b>corneal</b> change as a result of refractive surgery complicates accurate keratometry, a key element of lens implant power calculation. After laser refractive surgery for myopia, this could result in overestimation of <b>corneal</b> power, underestimation of the IOL power required, and hyperopic outcomes after cataract surgery.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, <b>corneal</b> transplants (also {{known as}} <b>corneal</b> grafts) for {{keratoconus}} are usually performed under sedation as outpatient surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, {{the operation is}} commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) {{for a number of}} years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed, people can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses. Complications of <b>corneal</b> transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the <b>corneal</b> tissue and rejection of the donor cornea. Vision loss is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful. Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue. The long-term outlook for <b>corneal</b> transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.|$|E
