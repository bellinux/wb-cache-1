The result is internal (compressive) stress that can appear {{to add to the}} hardness measured for a sample of DLC. Hardness is often measured by nanoindentation methods in which a finely pointed stylus of natural diamond is forced into the surface of a specimen. If the sample is so thin that there is only a single layer of nodules, then the stylus may enter the DLC layer between the hard cobblestones and push them apart without sensing the hardness of the sp3 bonded volumes. Measurements would be low. Conversely, if the probing stylus enters a film thick enough to have several layers of nodules so it cannot be spread laterally, or if it enters on top of a cobblestone in a single layer, then it will measure not only the real hardness of the diamond bonding, but an apparent hardness even greater because the internal compressive stress in those nodules would provide further resistance to penetration of the material by the stylus. Nanoindentation measurements have reported hardness as great as 50% more than values for natural crystalline diamond. Since the stylus is blunted in such cases or even broken, actual numbers for hardness that exceed that of natural diamond are meaningless. They only show that the hard parts of an optimal ta-C material will break natural diamond rather than the inverse. Nevertheless, from a practical viewpoint it does not matter how the resistance of a DLC material is developed, it can be harder than natural diamond in usage. One method of testing the <b>coating</b> <b>hardness</b> is by means of the Persoz pendulum.|$|E

In this article it is experimentally shown, that pure amorphous carbon thin films with hardness between 15 and 63 GPa can be slip-rolling resistant several million load cycles under a maximum Hertzian contact pressures of up to 3. 0 GPa.

The outer integument of immature seeds consisted of thin-walled epidermal fibres from which outgrowths of emerging protrusions were observed. In comparison, mature seed coats were characterised by the thickening of the cell walls of the epidermal fibres from which arose numerous protrusions covered by an extensive mucilage layer. Immature seeds, with incomplete embryo and seed-coat histodiffereniation, had a low mean germination percentage of 4 ± 4 %. Premature seeds, with a differentiated embryonic axis, were capable of much higher levels of germination (51 ± 10 %) before the attainment of mass maturity.

40|$|The Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) {{magnetron}} sputtering process {{is one of}} the widely used techniques for depositing thin film coatings on substrates for various applications such as integrated circuit fabrication, decorative coatings, and hard coatings for tooling. In the area of coatings on cutting tools, tool life can be improved drastically with the application of hard coatings. Application of coatings on cutting tools for various machining techniques, such as continuous and interrupted cutting, requires different coating characteristics, these being highly dependent on the process parameters under which they were formed. To efficiently optimise and customise the deposited coating characteristics, PVD process modelling using RSM methodology was proposed. The aim of this research is to develop a PVD {{magnetron sputtering}} process model which can predict the relationship between the process input parameters and resultant coating characteristics and performance. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used, this being one of the most practical and cost effective techniques to develop a process model. Even though RSM has been used for the optimisation of the sputtering process, published RSM modelling work on the application of hard coating process on cutting tool is lacking. This research investigated the deposition of TiAlN coatings onto tungsten carbide cutting tool inserts using PVD magnetron sputtering process. The input parameters evaluated were substrate temperature, substrate bias voltage, and sputtering power; the out put responses being <b>coating</b> <b>hardness,</b> coating roughness, and flank wear (coating performance). In addition to that, coating microstructures were investigated to explain the behaviour of the developed model. Coating microstructural phenomena assessed were; crystallite grain size, XRD peak intensity ratio I 111 /I 200 and atomic number percentage ratio of Al/Ti. Design Expert 7. 0. 3 software was used for the RSM analysis. Three process models (hardness, roughness, performance) were successfully developed and validated. The modelling validation runs were within the 90 % prediction interval of the developed models and their residual errors compared to the predicted values were less than 10 %. The models were also qualitatively validated by justifying the behaviour of the output responses (hardness, roughness, and flank wear) and microstructures (Al/Ti ratio, crystallographic peak ratio I 111 / 1200, and grain size) with respect to the variation of the input variables based on the published work by researchers and practitioners in this field. The significant parameters that influenced the <b>coating</b> <b>hardness,</b> roughness, and performance (flank wear) were also identified. <b>Coating</b> <b>hardness</b> was influenced by the substrate bias voltage, sputtering power, and substrate temperature; coating roughness was influenced by sputtering power and substrate bias; and coating performance was influenced by substrate bias. The analysis also discovered that there was a significant interaction between the substrate temperature and the sputtering power which significantly influenced <b>coating</b> <b>hardness,</b> roughness, and performance; this interaction phenomenon has not been reported in previously published literature. The correlation study between coating characteristics, microstructures and the coating performance (flank wear) suggested that the coating performance correlated most significantly to the <b>coating</b> <b>hardness</b> with Pearson coefficient of determination value (R 2) of 0. 7311.
