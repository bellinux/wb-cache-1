With an increasing light intensity yield of dry matter, the contents of dry matter, water-soluble carbohydrate and 'rest' (residue) increased; those of nitrate, <b>crude</b> protein, ash <b>and</b> <b>crude</b> fibre decreased. A rising temperature caused some yield increase, dry matter content hardly changed, <b>crude</b> protein <b>and</b> water-soluble carbohydrate diminished and so sometimes did the ash content whereas <b>crude</b> fibre <b>and</b> 'rest' increased.

5|$|The {{north-east}} {{coast of}} the United States depended on these supplies of oil, importing both <b>crude</b> <b>and</b> refined products. Across most of Texas, there had been little interest in building pipelines to transport oil, and petroleum was typically moved from the south-west to the north-east coast using a mixture of sea freight and railroad transport. In early 1941, 70,000 barrels of oil were moved on the railroads each day, but this method was expensive, and {{the bulk of the}} oil was moved using barges, some with a capacity of up to 15,000 barrels, operating up and down rivers and the Atlantic Coast.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{communities}} grew {{quickly in}} many parts of the empire (and especially in the East) after 260, when Gallienus brought peace to the Church. The data to calculate the figures are nearly non-existent, but the historian and sociologist Keith Hopkins has given <b>crude</b> <b>and</b> tentative estimates for Christian population in the 3rd century. Hopkins estimates that the Christian community grew from a population of 1.1 million in 250 to a population of 6 million by 300, about 10% of the empire's total population. Christians even expanded into the countryside, where they had never been numerous before. Churches in the later 3rd century were no longer as inconspicuous as they had been in the first and second. Large churches were prominent in certain major cities throughout the empire. The church in Nicomedia even sat on a hill overlooking the imperial palace. These new churches probably represented not only absolute growth in Christian population, but also the increasing affluence of the Christian community. In some areas where Christians were influential, such as North Africa and Egypt, traditional deities were losing credibility.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} <b>crude</b> oil <b>and</b> its polar {{fractions}} oil-water interfacial film dilational viscoelasticity has important significance {{to understand the}} stability of crude oil emulsion. By interfacial expansion rheological determinator, the Gudao <b>Crude</b> oil <b>and</b> its fractions dilational viscoelasticity under different pH value and dilational frequency was tested. The result shows that the dilational modulus of Asphaltene, Resin, <b>Crude</b> oil <b>and</b> Oil fraction reduced gradually under different dilational frequency and pH value, which has a relationship with polar groups in the <b>crude</b> oil <b>and</b> its fractions. When pH value was different, <b>crude</b> oil <b>and</b> its fractions dilational modulus and dilational frequency was similar. Dilational modulus increased with the increases of dilational frequency, but increasing amplitudes were different. Under the same pH value, dilational viscosity and phrase angle of <b>Crude</b> oil <b>and</b> its fractions were decreased {{with the increase of}} dilational frequency. The influence degree on different fractions was different, the influence degree of Oil fraction of dilational viscosity and phrase angle was small, Asphaltene was big. The dilational elasticity of <b>Crude</b> oil <b>and</b> its fractions increased with the increase of dilational frequency. Under different dilational frequency, the dilational modulus of <b>Crude</b> oil, Resin <b>and</b> Asphaltene increased with the increase of pH value, and it had no influence on dilational modulus of Oil fraction. The total dilational elasticity tendency of <b>Crude</b> oil, Resin <b>and</b> Asphaltene was increase, while dilational elasticity of Oil fraction decreased with the increases of pH value.

However, modern researchers maintain that the copies could have been produced locally in a clandestine manner.

The castles were built by the more powerful lords of Anjou in the late 10th and 11th centuries, in particular Fulk III and his son, Geoffrey II, who built {{a great number of}} them between 987 and 1060. Many of these earliest castles would have appeared quite <b>crude</b> <b>and</b> rustic by later standards, belying the power and prestige of their builders. William the Conqueror, as the Duke of Normandy, is believed to have adopted the motte-and-bailey design from neighbouring Anjou. Duke William went on to prohibit the building of castles without his consent through the Consuetudines et Justicie, with his legal definition of castles centring on the classic motte-and-bailey features of ditching, banking and palisading.|$|E
