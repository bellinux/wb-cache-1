5000|$|<b>Cioteronel</b> (CPC-10997; Cyoctol, Ethocyn, X-Andron): A {{structurally}} unique first-generation NSAA. It {{was under}} development as an oral medication {{for the treatment}} of benign prostatic hyperplasia and as a topical medication {{for the treatment of}} acne and pattern hair loss. It reached phase II and phase III clinical trials for these indications prior to discontinuation due to insufficient effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cioteronel</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} CPC-10997; former {{tentative}} brand names Cyoctol, Ethocyn, X-Andron) is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) {{that was never}} marketed. It was under development between 1989 and 2001 for the topical treatment of androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness) and acne and for the oral treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia; it reached phase III clinical trials for acne and phase II studies for androgenetic alopecia, but was ultimately discontinued due to poor efficacy.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} AR antagonists have been {{developed}} for topical use but have not completed development and hence have never been marketed. These include the steroidal AR antagonists cortexolone 17α-propionate, cyproterone, rosterolone, and topterone and the nonsteroidal AR antagonists <b>cioteronel,</b> inocoterone acetate, RU-22930, RU-58642, and RU-58841. However, one topical AR antagonist, topilutamide (fluridil), has been introduced in a few European countries for the treatment of androgenic alopecia in men. In addition, a topical 5α-reductase inhibitor and weak estrogen, alfatradiol, has also been introduced in some European countries for the same indication, although its effectiveness is controversial. Spironolactone has been marketed in Italy {{in the form of a}} topical cream under the brand name Spiroderm for the treatment of acne and hirsutism, but this formulation was discontinued and hence is no longer available.|$|E
