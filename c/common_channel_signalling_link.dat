For technological reasons, i. e. electromechanical switching centres, call routing is now defined according to some fixed static procedure. In order to provide protection against important di sturbances, the network has then to be overdimensioned at the planning stage. The emergence of stored program control networks consisting of electronic switching centres inter-connected by <b>common</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>links</b> is making possible a new strategy- adaptive traffic routing-, which allows real-time reaction to changes of the network state due to overloads or failures. Several adaptive traffic routing algo-ri thms are therefore descri bed and compared on a testbed network in order to improve network performances...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to perform simulation modeling of the Signaling System No. 7 (SS 7) network with particular emphasis on modeling of the Message Transfer Part Level 2. The basics of <b>common</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> using Signaling System No. 7 is initially outlined and discussed {{with reference to the}} ITU-T Q. 7 xx-Series Recommendations.

The model uses a multi-layer modular approach, with each layer corresponding to the SS 7 layer it is modeling. The functional blocks within each layer are thought of as processes. With their buffers and processors, these processes form a complex interlinked queuing model that is complicated to analyze but is readily simulated.
