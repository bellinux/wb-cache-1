Additionally, prime-time usage charges were $2.30 per minute and after-hours access was 44 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> for basic services and general information, and $1.76 a minute for detailed reports such as S.E.C. filings.

50|$|The IPKall {{business}} model {{appears to be}} based on its ability to charge termination rates for calls reaching its subscribers, estimated at about $.01/min, as the service is free for end users. The wholesale price for major interexchange carriers to terminate calls to independent telcos in rural Washington (state) and similar locations (such as northern Minnesota and Iowa) is often several <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> higher than typical US48 rates; this money is effectively a subsidy to the destination local rural exchange.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large number}} of calling card and conference service {{providers}} operate in area 641. When one calls a rural number in area 641, the long distance provider has to pay the termination fee to the receiving telecom party: up to 8 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Using this arbitrage, some of the service providers operate here and require one to dial the 'local access number' in area 641. Large telecom providers are the hardest hit with the costs for these so-called free service providers. AT&T filed a suit to withhold these arbitrage payments (AT&T got a $2 million bill a month).

For example, at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) temporary guides met visitors at ticketing posts and showed {{off the new}} passenger terminal and ramp. To go along with this, at every gate across the airport different airliners were showing off their latest planes. United Airlines showed off its Douglas DC-8 and Boeing 720 jets, Convair 340, and Douglas DC-7A cargo-liner. Bonanza Air Lines opened its Fairchild F-27; Pacific Air Lines a Martin 4-0-4, and National Airlines a Lockheed Constellation. On the LAX ramp sat Western Airlines’s tiny 1926 Douglas M-2 biplane.|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{production}} costs for producing tea are attributable {{to the process of}} drying the tea. E-manufacturing can assist companies to reduce these production costs by making crucial information available to decision-makers so that they can make informed decisions. This paper presents an application of e-manufacturing to the design of an automatic tea drying control system. This control system will ensure that the multiple drying parameters such as temperature, dryer-exit tea moisture content, and fuel consumption are maintained at optimal states {{during the course of the}} drying of tea. The additional aim of this system is to balance the cost of production and the quality of the final product. Using the Guggenheim-Anderson-De Boer (GAB) model, the optimum drying temperature was found to be 100 - 110 °C, while maintaining a dryer-exit tea moisture content of 3 to 3. 12 per <b>cent,</b> at <b>a</b> drying rate of 3 per <b>cent</b> per <b>minute.</b> <b>A</b> Barix control application to control the system’s activities, using the web user interface (WUI), was also developed. ...|$|R

5000|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, the steep {{discounts}} {{were no longer}} offered, rates increased as much as 80 percent in fall 2002, with 10-10-321 going from 10 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> to 18 cents on October 1, 2002. A year earlier, a 9.9 percent [...] "Universal Service Fund" [...] charge had been added. The television advertising has since become much less common. In addition, the widely increased use of cell phones in the early 2000s, and subsequent decline {{in the use of}} landline phones, has rendered the service somewhat antiquated. Much of this is because many phone service plans do not charge additionally for long distance calls; voice over IP in particular renders the distinction between local and long distance meaningless.|$|E
50|$|The cost {{of making}} a {{telephone}} call via callback consists of two parts, as the caller is effectively paying for an outbound and inbound call at the same time. For example, if a customer from Spain is calling a phone number in Australia, and it costs 8 cents per minute to phone Spain from the US (the callback, which is an incoming call) and 20 cents per minute to phone Australia from the US (the destination call, which is an outgoing call), then the caller will pay a total of 28 US <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> This may still be less expensive than calling directly from Spain to Australia, which is primarily why callbacks are used.|$|E
50|$|Payment for inbound long {{distance}} calls to small rural telephone companies is normally handled through a shared pool, the National Exchange Carrier Association (“NECA”). Individual telcos {{are free to}} opt out of this process. For the first two years, they are then free to bill interexchange carriers directly at an initially-high rural rate of five to thirteen <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> After two years the carrier either rejoins the NECA pool, provides evidence to support continuing to charge the high rural rate or reduces rates to a level that can be supported. A sudden increase in inbound calling volume {{at about the same time}} as a telephone company leaves the NECA pool therefore can represent a very profitable two years for that firm.|$|E
