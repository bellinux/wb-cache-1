5|$|The Valkyrie was {{designed}} to be a high-altitude Mach3 bomber with six engines. Harrison Storms shaped the aircraft with a <b>canard</b> surface and a delta wing, which was built largely of stainless steel, sandwiched honeycomb panels, and titanium. The XB-70 {{was designed}} to use supersonic technologies developed for the Mach3 Navaho, as well as a modified form of the SM-64 Navaho's all-inertial guidance system.|$|E
5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from <b>canard</b> to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E

5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic <b>canard,</b> {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Isa served as governor of Damascus in 861, but according to Marius <b>Canard</b> this is a confusion with Isa ibn Muhammad al-Nawshari. In 865, according to al-Tabari, he defeated and captured a Kharijite rebel named al-Muwaffaq. At the time, he held a post in Syria, since al-Tabari records him asking for aid from the Caliph al-Mutawakkil in preparing a raid against Byzantium, including four ships to be set ready in Tyre. He was probably already governor of Jund Filastin (Palestine) district at the time, a post which he seems to have held, according to Ya'qubi, {{at the time of the}} deposition of Caliph al-Musta'in in January 866. According to Ya'qubi, Isa was one of the governors who refused to immediately acknowledge the new Caliph, al-Mu'tazz, perhaps because his old patron Bugha still remained loyal to al-Musta'in. This led al-Nawshari to campaign against him, and the two armies clashed by the Jordan River. Al-Nawshari's son was killed, but Isa was defeated and fled to Egypt with what wealth he could gather, while al-Nawshari occupied the capital of Palestine, Ramla. In Egypt, Isa finally conceded the oath of loyalty (bay'ah) to al-Mu'tazz, while al-Nawshari in his turn fell out with the Caliph, who had not sanctioned his seizure of Ramla and dispatched an army under Muhammad ibn al-Muwallad to drive him out. Isa then returned to Palestine, bringing with him money, supplies, and possibly troops recruited in Egypt, and built a fortress called al-Husami, situated between Ramla and Ludd. From this base, he managed to withstand the repeated attacks of Ibn al-Muwallad, until—probably after a truce was agreed—both returned to the caliphal capital, Samarra.|$|E

5|$|On {{account of}} the rivalry between the chiefs of Bobbili and Vizianagaram, in 1756 there was a {{rebellion}} among the local chieftains which necessitated strong military measures. General Bussy attacked the rebel forces with a contingent of European forces, supported by 11,000 troops of the Raja of Vizianagaram as a token of his loyalty. The Raja of Vizianagaram instigated General Bussy by a <b>canard</b> stating that the Raja of Bobbili was behind the rebellion. It is {{also said that the}} Raja bribed his interpreters to persuade General Bussy to direct Ranga Rao, the Raja of Bobbili to vacate the Bobbili Fort and shift southward. General Bussy cautiously made an offer to the Chief of Bobbili that he would be pardoned if he moved away from Bobbili, and in return given a compensatory package of equivalent land elsewhere. But this was not acceptable to the Chief of Bobbili. Then, General Bussy attacked the fort several times, breached the mud fort with cannons, and took control of the ramparts of the fort. Although the Raja of Bobbili and his defenders realized their precarious condition, they fought fiercely but eventually lost the battle. When General Bussy entered the fort with his depleted strength of soldiers he found dead bodies scattered in the fort area. At that time an old man approached General Bussy and handed him a child who he said was the son of the dead Raja of Bobbili. The Raja of Vizianagaram, happy with his victory in the hard fought battle, rejoiced by entering the Bobbili city and hoisted the Flag of France. But his jubilation was short lived. Three days after this event, the Raja of Vizianagaram's camp was attacked in the night by three people of Bobbili, including Tandra Paparayudu who had rushed to the demolished Bobbili Fort to help his sister's family. He killed the Raja of Vizianagaram and then committed suicide along with his accomplices.|$|E
25|$|McCornack {{had first}} {{installed}} a <b>canard</b> elevator on a Pfledge in 1978, {{but did not}} create a production model until 1980. The <b>canard</b> was operated by a side-mounted control stick. Fore-and-aft movement of the stick moved the <b>canard</b> and sideways movement controlled the tip-rudders. The <b>canard</b> was constructed with tubular spars, aluminum ribs and covered in standard aircraft fabric.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of a tailless delta design, {{such as in the}} Viggen, is that the elevons, which replace more conventional control surfaces, operate with a small effective moment arm; their use adds substantial weight to the aircraft at takeoff and landing. Hinged leading edge surfaces can help counteract this, but an even more effective tool is the <b>canard.</b> The <b>canard</b> surfaces were positioned behind the inlets and placed slightly higher than the main wing, with a higher stall angle than the wing, and were equipped with flaps. The lifting <b>canard</b> surfaces act as a vortex generator for the main wing and therefore provide more lift. An added benefit was that they also improved roll stability in the transonic region. The <b>canard</b> flaps were deployed in conjunction with the landing gear to provide even more lift for takeoff and landing.|$|E

40|$|Summary. <b>Canards</b> are {{periodic}} orbits {{for which}} the trajectory follows both the at-tracting and repelling parts of a slow manifold. They {{are associated with a}} dramatic change in the amplitude and period of a periodic orbit within a very narrow interval of a control parameter. It is shown numerically that <b>canards</b> occur in an appropriate param-eter range in two- and three-dimensional models of the platinum-catalyzed oxidation of carbon monoxide. By smoothly connecting associated stable and unstable manifolds in an asymptotic limit, we predict parameter values at which such <b>canards</b> exist. The relationship between the <b>canards</b> and saddle-loop bifurcations for these models is also demonstrated. Excellent agreement is found between the numerical and analytical results...|$|R
30|$|To {{conclude}} this article, {{we discuss}} other neuronal systems in which torus <b>canards</b> might occur. We propose that torus <b>canards</b> exist in other models that exhibit {{the types of}} bursting - sub-Hopf/fold cycle, circle/fold cycle, and fold/fold cycle - studied here. For example, the top-hat burster of Best et al. [44] is known to exhibit fold/fold cycle bursting and we therefore hypothesize that torus <b>canards</b> also appear in this model, although there may exist some technical differences {{since this is a}} fourth-order model.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} their radar cross-section (RCS), all fifth-generation fighters use chines instead of standard leading edge extensions and lack <b>canards,</b> though the Sukhoi T-50 has engine intake extensions that seem to function somewhat like <b>canards</b> and the Chengdu J-20 designers have chosen the agility enhancements of <b>canards</b> {{in spite of their}} poor stealth characteristics. They all have twin canted vertical tails (similar to a V-tail) also to minimize side RCS. Most fifth-generation fighters with supermaneuverability achieve it through thrust vectoring.|$|R
