5|$|Most {{people in}} the stadium were unaware that the (first) Ibrox {{disaster}} had happened. People even re-occupied the damaged area, despite the danger of further collapse. A definite reason for the disaster was not agreed upon, partly {{because there was no}} public inquiry held. Some experts blamed the quality of wood and the supplier was tried for <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide,</b> but was acquitted. The design was also cited as a possible cause. Generally, wooden structures of that size were not trusted. Rangers removed the wooden terraces, reducing capacity to 25,000. The criticism of the design did not deter Rangers from hiring Leitch in the future. He designed an expansion of Ibrox to a 63,000 capacity by 1910, using slopes made of earth. By this point, the city of Glasgow had the three largest purpose-built football grounds in the world.|$|E
25|$|In {{the former}} scenario, Nanavati would be charged under the Indian penal code 302, for <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide,</b> {{with a maximum}} {{punishment}} of 10 years. In the latter, he would be charged with murder, with the sentence being death or life imprisonment. Nanavati pleaded not guilty. His defence team argued {{it was a case}} of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> not amounting to murder, while the prosecution argued it was premeditated murder.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the prosecution's {{argument}} that the murder was premeditated and sentenced Nanavati to life imprisonment for <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> amounting to murder. On 24 November 1961, the Supreme Court of India upheld the conviction.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} {{scenario}} (i.e. premeditated murder), Nanavati would {{be charged with}} murder, with the sentence being death or life imprisonment.

25|$|In December 2006, Sidhu {{was found}} guilty and sentenced to a three-year prison term for <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> {{following}} a road rage incident. Following the sentencing, Sidhu resigned as a Member of Parliament and in January 2007 appealed to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court stayed his conviction and sentence allowing him to contest and win the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat in February 2007.|$|E
25|$|A 36-year-old British man, Anthony Cooper of Gowerton, {{was arrested}} on the 26th after {{allegedly}} discarding a burning cigarette butt from his car after stopping on the mountain. In addition to being charged with arson, he faces a <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> charge {{after the death of}} the British tourist. The City of Cape Town noted its intention to pursue a civil claim against Cooper.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Eadie and Scott, Sinclair also {{pleaded guilty to}} <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> of his eight-year-old neighbour Catherine Reehill in Glasgow in 1961, when he was sixteen, and given another life sentence in 2001 for the 1978 murder of 17-year-old Mary Gallacher on a footpath in Glasgow. He {{is thought to have}} also killed four other women between 1977 and 1978; all within a seven-month period of the murders of Eadie and Scott.|$|E
25|$|On April 15, 1966, two {{suspects}} in the so-called Bathroom Coup in Sri Lanka, Corporal Tilekawardene and L.V. Podiappuhamy (otherwise known as Dodampe Mudalali), were said by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to have jumped to their deaths from the fourth floor of the CID building in the Fort. At the inquest, following receipt of new evidence, the magistrate altered the verdict of suicide to one of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide.</b> The remainder of the suspects were acquitted.|$|E
25|$|Several {{people have}} been convicted of {{involuntary}} manslaughter in cases involving insufficient and slow medical help to athletes who experienced commotio cordis during sports events, as well as in cases of intentional delivery of contusive blows. In 1992, Italian hockey player Miran Schrott died after a blow to his chest from the stick of Canadian-Italian player Jimmy Boni. Boni was charged with <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide,</b> and eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter, paying a $1,300 fine and $175,000 restitution to Schrott's family.|$|E
25|$|The {{solicitor}} {{representing the}} three railwaymen protested that the committing {{of them to}} trial was outside the Coroner's jurisdiction, as the alleged offence had been committed in Scotland. The Coroner stated {{that he had been}} instructed to proceed with the inquest by the Home Office. The verdict of the English inquest was to leave Tinsley in an unusual position, as he was arrested by the Scottish authorities on 29 May 1915, and charged with <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide.</b> He now faced a charge of manslaughter in England based on the same facts. After discussion between the Law Officers of England and Scotland, it was decided to proceed against the three men in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} inquiry, {{completed on}} 17 June 1915 for the Board of Trade, found {{the cause of}} the collision to be neglect of the rules by two signalmen. With the northbound loop occupied, the northbound local train had been reversed onto the southbound line to allow passage of two late running northbound sleepers. Its presence was then overlooked, and the southbound troop train was cleared for passage. As a result, both were charged with manslaughter in England, then convicted of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> after trial in Scotland; the two terms are broadly equivalent. After they were released from a Scottish jail in 1916, they were re-employed by the railway company, although not as signalmen.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{the local}} Bhopal {{authorities}} charged Anderson, who had retired in 1986, with manslaughter, {{a crime that}} carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Bhopal on 1 February 1992 for failing to appear at the court hearings in a <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> case {{in which he was}} named the chief defendant. Orders were passed to the Government of India to press for an extradition from the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the decision of the lower federal courts in October 1993, meaning that victims of the Bhopal disaster could not seek damages in a U.S. court.|$|E
25|$|New France {{had been}} conquered by the British in 1760 {{as part of}} the Seven Years' War and was under the {{administration}} of the British Army at this time. On hearing the rumours the local British military authorities charged with keeping order set up an inquiry into Dodier's death. The inquiry opened in Quebec City on March 29, 1763, at the Ursulines of Quebec, charging Joseph Corriveau and his daughter Marie-Josephte, before a military tribunal made up of 12 English officers and presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Roger Morris. The case ended, on 9 April, with Joseph Corriveau being sentenced to death, for <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> of his son-in-law. Marie-Josephte was found to be an accomplice to murder, and sentenced to sixty lashes and branded with the letter M on her hand. One of Joseph Corriveau's nieces, Isabelle Sylvain (who he employed as a servant), had testified but changed her story several times during the hearing; she was found guilty of perjury and given thirty lashes and branded with the letter P.|$|E
500|$|Policy options {{raised by}} Findlay {{included}} increasing the minimum wage, reintroduction of council house building, {{reduction in the}} use of the private sector in NHS Scotland, and allowing councils to set their own taxes to help reverse job losses within local government. He described himself as [...] "no machine politician", and called for a return to the [...] "timeless Labour values of community, solidarity, fairness and justice". He said that if elected as leader, his 2016 election campaign would focus on tackling youth unemployment, the introduction of a living wage, and improvements to health and social care. He said that he wanted to make the party more [...] "autonomous" [...] by involving its members and trade unions to create a party that was [...] "more collective and co-operative in nature". He also expressed the desire to establish a public inquiry into the practice of trade union blacklisting. Among his plans for devolution was for Holyrood to have power over employment regulations to enable the creation of a Scottish Health and Safety Executive and the introduction of corporate <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> legislation.|$|E
500|$|In an {{oral history}} interview, Singh {{said that one}} of the murder trials that he had presided over, the [...] "Body in the Box" [...] case, led to the {{abolition}} of jury trials in Singapore criminal cases. Following the trial of a young man, Freddy Tan, for the murder of his friend whose decomposed body was found stuffed into a box, Singh agreed with the jury to convict Tan of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> not amounting to murder and sentence him to life imprisonment. However, he later learnt that in the jury room a bullying Dutch juror had wanted to impose the death penalty, but because the other jurors disliked his attitude they voted to impose a lower verdict on Tan. The father of the deceased felt an injustice had been done and went to see the Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee then sent for Singh, and Singh informed him of what had happened with the jurors. Lee asked Singh, [...] "Well what do you think. Shall I abolish the jury?" [...] Singh replied that if he had tried Tan without a jury, he would have convicted him of murder without hesitation. Following a public inquiry, jury trials were abolished for all criminal cases in 1969.|$|E
500|$|For {{many decades}} the Scots legal system was unique {{for being the}} only legal system without a parliament. This ended {{with the advent of}} the Scottish Parliament, which legislates for Scotland. Many {{features}} within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: [...] "guilty", [...] "not guilty" [...] and [...] "not proven". Both [...] "not guilty" [...] and [...] "not proven" [...] result in an acquittal, typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of double jeopardy. There is however the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice – see the provisions of the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011. Many laws differ between Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom, and many terms differ for certain legal concepts. Manslaughter, in England and Wales, is broadly similar to <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> in Scotland, and arson is called wilful fire raising. Indeed, some acts considered crimes in England and Wales, such as forgery, are not so in Scotland. Procedure also differs. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three more than is typical in many countries.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the trial it was revealed that Angus Sinclair was already a convicted murderer and serial sex offender, and was actively serving two life sentences at HMP Peterhead when his case was brought forward in the World's End Murders. [...] It was also revealed that Sinclair had previously completed a prison sentence for <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 22 May 1915, a {{troop train}} {{was in a}} head-on {{collision}} at Quintinshill, Dumfriesshire due to a signalman's error. An express passenger train then ran into the wreckage. A fire then broke out which killed 226 people and injured 246 in what remains the deadliest railway accident in the United Kingdom [...] Two signalmen were later jailed for <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The crux of {{the case}} was whether Nanavati shot Ahuja in the [...] "heat of the moment" [...] {{or whether it was}} a premeditated murder. In the former scenario, Nanavati would not have been charged under the Indian penal code for <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide,</b> with a maximum {{punishment}} of 10 years. This is because he could have invoked exceptions 1 and 4 of section 300 of IPC (which defines murder). Exception 1 states: ...|$|E
2500|$|A murder, defined broadly, is an {{unlawful}} killing. [...] Unlawful {{killing is}} probably the act most frequently targeted by the criminal law. [...] In many jurisdictions, the crime of murder is divided into various gradations of severity, e.g., {{murder in the first}} degree, based on intent. [...] Malice is a required element of murder. [...] Manslaughter (<b>Culpable</b> <b>Homicide</b> in Scotland) is a lesser variety of killing committed in the absence of malice, brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial of}} the three men started on 24 September 1915 in the High Court in Edinburgh. The [...] Lord Justice General, Lord Strathclyde, presided over the trial; [...] the Lord Advocate, Robert Munro KC prosecuted and the three men were defended by Condie Sandeman KC. [...] Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson all {{pleaded not guilty to}} the charges of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> and breach of duty against them. [...] The trial lasted a day and a half; after the {{prosecution}} had concluded their case, Sandeman submitted to the Lord Justice General that there was no case to answer by Hutchinson.|$|E
2500|$|Such was the {{narrative}} which was brought before Smuts the next morning. [...] The Zarps had {{gained a reputation}} for use of excessive force, even brutality. [...] Smuts {{was aware of the}} delicate political aspects of the situation; a Transvaal constable had shot and killed a British subject. [...] It was essential that the situation be seen to be handled with the utmost rigour and impartiality. [...] Smuts’s hopes were immediately dealt a blow when the public prosecutor reduced the charge against Jones from murder to <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide.</b> [...] Jones was thereafter bailed for the relatively small amount of £200.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Raid, the British government had every reason to hold back the League, with widespread support for Kruger throughout the Afrikaner population of South Africa. [...] But now this organisation, with their allies in the English-speaking newspapers, now proceeded to whip up the latent hostility of the uitlanders towards the Zarps. [...] The Transvaal government were accused of displaying undue leniency towards Constable Jones; the League protested at the reduction of the charge to <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> and his release on £200 bail, a sum which was less than that typically imposed upon uitlanders for relatively trivial offences. [...] These protests found a receptive audience amongst the broad mass of uitlanders; the ground was laid for confrontation.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} actress's death, the Johannesburg Metro Police {{released}} a statement, speculating Callie {{may have been}} to blame for her accident. According to the official statement, Callie drove {{on the wrong side}} of the road. While alcohol may have been a factor, according to a Johannesburg metro spokesperson, Edna Mamonya, neither driver's blood at the time of the incident was tested for alcohol. However, on 28 August 2008, the driver of the second car appeared in the Randburg magistrate's court, charged with <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide,</b> and reckless and negligent driving. Sources describe the charge as a [...] "triple-whammy" [...] for his family: his father committed suicide a month after the accident, and his mother had her own accident in April 2008. The charges came as a shock; the family were expecting [...] "just a hearing".|$|E
2500|$|The legal {{position}} was complicated because although the accident occurred in Scotland, {{some of the}} injured subsequently died in England where the law was different. [...] In Scotland, deaths were investigated by the procurator fiscal who, if he found culpability {{on the part of}} anyone, could order their arrest and charge them with <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide.</b> [...] In England the coroner investigated death and, if the coroner's jury found that death was due to neglect, then the coroner could indict charges of manslaughter against the named parties. [...] The coroner for Carlisle, Mr T S Strong, asked for guidance from the Home Office and was instructed to conduct inquests on those who had died in England in the normal way. [...] The inquest opened on 25 May but was immediately adjourned until 23 June to allow Lt-Col. Druitt to finish his investigation. [...] After two days hearing evidence from, among others, Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson, Strong summed up the evidence to the nineteen-man jury. He highlighted that if Meakin and Tinsley had obeyed the rules on any of (a) blocking back, (b) lever collars or (c) a correctly kept train register, they could not have forgotten the stationary train. [...] He concluded his summing up with: ...|$|E
2500|$|Sinclair's first {{conviction}} {{occurred in}} 1961, at age 16, when {{he pleaded guilty}} and was convicted of the <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> of eight-year-old Catherine Reehill and served six years in prison. Sinclair sexually assaulted and strangled her in his family home. In 1982, {{five years after the}} World's End Murders, he pleaded guilty to 11 of 13 charges libelling various rapes and indecent assaults committed against young girls, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In June 2001, still in prison, he went to trial and was given another life sentence for the murder of 17-year-old Mary Gallacher on a footpath near the Barnhill railway station in Glasgow in November 1978 [...] thirteen months after the World's End Murders. The teenager had been dragged into bushes, sexually assaulted, had had her throat cut and a ligature tied round her neck. Again Sinclair failed to accept any responsibility for the crime and denied all knowledge, despite being found guilty by a majority verdict and faced with the reality that the chances of a DNA sample matching anyone other than Sinclair, were [...] "a billion to one." [...] Sinclair was only caught, for the 1978 murder, after a cold case review by Strathclyde Police revealed the presence of new DNA evidence not uncovered during the initial investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{incident}}, Burroughs claimed the [...] "William Tell" [...] incident never happened, {{and that he}} had dropped his gun and it had accidentally fired. Burroughs spent 13 days in jail before his brother came to Mexico City and bribed Mexican lawyers and officials to release Burroughs on bail while he awaited trial for the killing, which was ruled <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide.</b> Vollmer's daughter, Julie Adams, went to live with her grandmother, and William S. Burroughs Jr. went to St. Louis to live with his grandparents. Burroughs reported every Monday morning to the jail in Mexico City while his prominent Mexican attorney worked to resolve the case. According to James Grauerholz, two witnesses had agreed to testify that the gun had fired accidentally while he was checking {{to see if it was}} loaded, with ballistics experts bribed to support this story. Nevertheless, the trial was continuously delayed and Burroughs began to write what would eventually become the short novel Queer while awaiting his trial. Upon Burroughs's attorney fleeing Mexico in light of his own legal problems, Burroughs decided, according to Ted Morgan, to [...] "skip" [...] and return to the United States. He was convicted in absentia of homicide and was given a two-year suspended sentence.|$|E
6000|$|With {{scarcely}} {{a word of}} reply Walter Tyrrel turned and strode away from the spot. [...] "I must go now," [...] he muttered faintly, {{looking at his watch}} with some feigned surprise, as a feeble excuse. [...] "I've an appointment at home." [...] He hadn't the courage to stay. His heart misgave him. Once fairly round the corner he fled like a wounded creature, too deeply hurt even to cry. Eustace Le Neve, raising his hat, hastened after him, all mute wonder. For several hundred yards they walked on side by side across the open heathy moor. Then, as they passed the first wall, Tyrrel paused for a moment and spoke. [...] "NOT a murderer!" [...] he cried in his anguish; [...] "oh, no, not quite as bad as a murderer, surely, Eustace; but still, a <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide.</b> Oh, God, how terrible." ...|$|E
60|$|On the 7th of January a Swazi, named Infofa, who had greatly {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} his bravery in the Secoceni War, but was now undergoing {{a term of}} penal servitude for <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide,</b> performed an act of singular bravery. The Boers had during the night erected a small earthwork {{on the outside of}} the Vaal River; 400 yards nearer the town stood a house, and fearing that this might be occupied by the Putch, it was determined to destroy it. Infofa with a party of Kaffirs volunteered for the duty; he crossed the river with his party, and the Kaffirs began to pull down the house. Infofa, however, took his gun, and marched boldly away to the Boer earthwork, 400 yards distant, to the astonishment of the lookers-on. It happened that at the moment no Boers were present in the works, and the man reached it without a shot being fired at him; inside he found some tools, and with these he deliberately set to work and levelled the breastwork; this accomplished, he returned to the party.|$|E
