This paper extends Cournot's model to allow for competition between <b>complements</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side of the market. Consider two complements, A and B, where the A + B bundle is valuable only when purchased together. Good A is supplied by a monopolist (e. g., Microsoft) and there is competition in the B goods from vertically differentiated suppliers (e. g., Intel and AMD). In this simple game, {{there may not be}} a pure-strategy equilibria. In the standard case where marginal costs are weakly positive, there is no pure strategy where the lower quality B firm obtains positive market share. We also consider the case where A has negative marginal costs, as would arise when A can expect to make upgrade sales to an installed base. When profits from the installed base are sufficiently large, a pure strategy equilibrium exists with two B firms active in the market. Although there is competition in the complement market, the monopoly Firm A may earn lower profits in this environment. Consequently, A may prefer to accept lower future profits in order to interact with a monopolist complement in B. ...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{complement}} or alexin {{be measured}} in hemolytic, opsonic, bactericidal, or combining units, these units refer only to the smallest volume of guinea pig or other serum producing the effect in question and give no indication of the actual amount of complement involved. The present study was undertaken {{in the hope of}} filling this gap and providing, in place of these relative and often variable units, an absolute measure of complement in weight units. The need for this seemed all the more indicated by the extension of knowledge and the results of theoretical and practical interest that followed substitution of the old relative dilution methods by quantitative, absolute methods of antigen and antibody estimation conforming to the criteria of analytical chemistry (1 - 3). It has been known for many years that the titer of added complement or alexin is reduced by antigen-antibody precipitation in rabbit antisera; but the actual addition of a complement component to such precipitates has not been shown directly although hemolysis is generally interpreted as mediated by the addition of complement to the red cell. Indeed, Muir (4) has defined complement as "that labile substance of normal serum which is taken up by the combination of an antigen and its anti-substance (immune-body). " Owing to the accuracy with which specifically precipitable nitrogen may be measured, the quantitative precipitin method (5) seemed worthy of trial as a means of estimating any actual uptake of complement. It was thought that any difference between the amounts of specifically precipitable nitrogen found in the presence of active <b>complement,</b> <b>on</b> the <b>one</b> hand, and in the presence of inactivated <b>complement</b> <b>on</b> the other, might serve as a measure, in milligrams of nitrogen per milliliter...|$|R

Therefore, we worked on merging folksonomies from the Social Web with ontologies from the Semantic Web. This merge has the following advantages: 1) Creating semantic relations between tags of folksonomy; 2) Enabling reasoning on the Social Web. 3) Augmenting the authoring process of adaptive hypermedia, by providing rich, free, but also hierarchically structured data from the combined Social and Semantic Web...|$|R

We have reached two conclusions: (i) <b>complement</b> fixation depends <b>on</b> the lateral mobility of the lipid hapten at low hapten concentrations in the plane of the membrane (less than or equal 0. 1 mole %) and does not depend strongly on this mobility at high hapten concentrations; (ii) cholesterol may have two distinct effects <b>on</b> <b>complement</b> fixation, <b>one</b> arising from an enhancement of hapten exposure to antibody binding sites and a second due to a modulation of membrane fluidity...|$|R

In embryogenesis, a largely unsolved problem is {{the means by which}} cell-cell recognition, necessary for the build up of a normal tissue, is mediated (1). Under pathological conditions this hitherto unrevealed mechanism of physiological interactions seems to be lost. In immunology numerous phenomena are based on cell-cell interactions.

In addition, the action of activated T cells on target cells is obviously a cell-cell interaction phenomenon (4). Macrophages are an essential participant in some of these interactions (5). In this paper we want to outline in detail some mechanisms by which complement components might play a role in these cell-cell interaction phenomena.

40|$|The Hybrid Signed Digit (HSD) {{representation}} {{introduced in}} [9] employs both signed and unsigned digits and renders the maximum length of carry propagation {{equal to the}} maximum distance between two consecutive signed digits. This representation offers a continuum of choices from two’s <b>complement</b> representation <b>on</b> <b>one</b> extreme (where there are no signed digits) {{all the way to}} the conventional fully signed digit (SD) representation on the other extreme, wherein every digit is signed. The area-delay tradeoffs associated with each of the HSD formats have been analyzed in [9]. Possibility of reducing power consumption by utilizing the HSD representation was also mentioned therein. This paper investigates the impact of the HSD representation on power consumption. Adder based on a well known fully SD implementation [2] (which is adopted in a microprocessor [4]) is compared with the adder based on HSD representation. Layouts of basic adder cells based on SD and HSD representations are exhaustively simulated to obtain the average number of transitions and power dissipation per addition. The results are then used to estimate power dissipation in adders of various word lengths and indicate that adopting HSD representation can lead to a reduction in power consumption over a fully SD representation. The power (and area) reduction is achieved as a result of algorithm level change. This leaves room for additional power reduction by employing standard techniques at lower levels of the design process (such as circuit level, layout level etc). Furthermore, The HSD representation offers a continuum of choices to the designer. By increasing the distance between the signed digits, lower power dissipation can be achieved at the expense of slower speed. Thus, if the worst case delay is predetermined, the designer can select a hybrid representation that minimizes power dissipation under the delay constraint. ...|$|R
