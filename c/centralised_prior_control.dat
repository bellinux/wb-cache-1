40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is an optimization technique for applications like control or scheduling problems. It {{is used in}} learning situations, where success and failure of the system are the only training information. Unfortunately, {{we have to pay}} a price for this powerful ability: long training times and the instability of the learning process are not tolerable for industrial applications with large continuous state spaces. From our point of view, the integration of prior knowledge is a key mechanism for making autonomous learning practicable for industrial applications. The learning control architecture Fynesse provides a uni ed view onto the integration of <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> knowledge in the reinforcement learning framework. In this way, other approaches in this area can be interpreted as special cases of Fynesse. The key features of Fynesse are (1) the integration of <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> knowledge like linear controllers, control characteristics or fuzzy controllers, (2) autonomous learning of control strategies and (3) the interpretation of learned strategies in terms of fuzzy control rules. The bene ts and problems of dierent methods for the integration of a priori knowledge are demonstrated on empirical studies...|$|R

These phenomena appeared to be common to many corticosteroids (Collins et a!., 1963). These reports were consistent with the fact that adrenal steroids not only inhibit the entry of endogenous calcium into the bone, enhance calcium secretion into the gastrointestinal tract but also promote the resorption of recently in-corporated calcium from bone. They confirmed the conclusions (Milhaud et at., 1960) in the rat that cortisone slowed the rates of calcium fixation in bone, diminished intestinal absorption and in-creased secretion. In previous studies (Garrett et at., 1963) the analog computer was used to fit a basic model to the Ca 47 blood level data.

The other limitation was related to the general propensity of Iranian students towards text-based materials which may affect the way they interact with the task-based materials. Besides, if videotaping was used as an instrument for data collection, a better tacking of behavioral level of engagement could be achieved. Task engagement and individual regulation of the tasks in educational setting are potentially interesting for further research.|$|R

Therefore Fynesse allows the integration of a priori knowledge about the control strategy. In this paper, different techniques for the integration are proposed. In experiments it is shown that the integration of <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> knowledge reduces the number of interactions with the process dramatically.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess safety and {{efficacy}} of thrombolysis in the setting of aggressive blood pressure (BP) control as it compares to standard BP control or no BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) between 2004 - 2011. We compared the outcomes of patients treated with tPA for AIS who required aggressive BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis to those requiring standard or no BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis. The primary outcome of interest was safety, defined by all grades of hemorrhagic transformation and neurologic deterioration. The secondary outcome was efficacy, determined by functional status at discharge, and in-hospital deaths. Results: Of 427 patients included in the analysis, 89 received aggressive BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis, 65 received standard BP control, and 273 required no BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis. Patients requiring BP control had more severe strokes, with median arrival National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 10 (IQR [6 - 17]) in patients not requiring BP control versus 11 (IQR [5 - 16]) and 13 (IQR [7 - 20]) in patients requiring standard and aggressive BP lowering therapies, respectively (p= 0. 048). In a multiple logistic regression model adjusting for baseline differences, there were no statistically significant differences in adverse events between the three groups (P> 0. 10). Conclusion: We observed no association between BP control and adverse outcomes in ischemic stroke patients undergoing thrombolysis. However, additional study is necessary to confirm or refute the safety of aggressive BP <b>control</b> <b>prior</b> to thrombolysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study investigates variational image segmen-tation with an {{original}} data term, {{referred to as}} statistical overlap prior, which measures the conformity of overlap be-tween the nonparametric distributions of image data within the segmentation regions to a learned statistical description. This leads to image segmentation and distribution track-ing algorithms that relax the assumption of minimal over-lap and, as such, are more widely applicable than existing algorithms. We propose to minimize active curve function-als containing the proposed overlap prior, compute the cor-responding Euler-Lagrange curve evolution equations, and give an interpretation of how the overlap <b>prior</b> <b>controls</b> such evolution. We model the overlap, measured via the Bhat-tacharyya coefficient, with a Gaussian prior whose parame-ters are estimated from a set of relevant training images. Quantitative and comparative performance evaluations of the proposed algorithms over several experiments demon-strate {{the positive effects of}} the overlap prior in regard to segmentation accuracy and convergence speed...|$|R

A <b>prior</b> <b>control</b> study on the same subjects ensured that colouring target words outside of a Wikipedia/Web context had no influence upon reading behaviour. Participants were asked to read for comprehension but were unable to click any links. Analyses demonstrated that hyperlinks had no early effects on reading behaviour but re-reading increased when the target word was a hyperlink and low frequency. In all likelihood, the suggestion of additional information concerning the target word (i. e. hyperlinking to other explanatory Web pages) combined with its lexical difficulty (i. e. low frequency) caused our participants to re-analyse previous text sections<br/...|$|R

Drawing on Malaysia’s experiences in regulating the capital account during the 1990 s, it finds, in an error-correction model, that capital controls generally have statistically insignificant effects on the exchange rate.

In particular, our Generalized Approximate Reasoning-based Intelligent Control (GARIC) architecture: (1) learns and tunes a fuzzy logic controller even when only weak reinforcements, such as a binary failure signal, is available; (2) introduces a new conjunction operator in computing the rule strengths of fuzzy control rules; (3) introduces a new localized mean of maximum (LMOM) method in combining the conclusions of several firing control rules; and (4) learns to produce real-valued control actions. Learning is achieved by integrating fuzzy inference into a feedforward network, which can then adaptively improve performance by using gradient descent methods.
