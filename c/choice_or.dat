5|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social <b>choice</b> <b>or</b> game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field {{has come to be known}} as science and technology studies.|$|E

Modeling those <b>choices</b> <b>or</b> decisions as an optimization problem provides a means to select the best available set of <b>choices</b> <b>or</b> decisions. In some settings, solutions to this problem may be provided by heuristic methods; in others, by numerical optimization methods; in others, by strict mathematical methods.|$|R

5|$|After the United Kingdom's {{entry into}} World War I in 1914, Wheeler {{volunteered for the}} armed forces. Although preferring solitary to group activities, Wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering. For the next seven months, he was posted as an {{instructor}} in the University of London Officer Training Corps. It was during this period, in January 1915, that a son was born to the Wheelers, and named Michael. Michael was their only child, something that was a social anomaly at the time, although it is unknown if this was by <b>choice</b> <b>or</b> not. In May 1915, Wheeler transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force) and shortly thereafter was appointed captain. In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain, often bringing {{his wife and child}} with him; his responsibility was as a battery commander, initially of field guns and later of howitzers.|$|E
5|$|Czechoslovak {{education}} in the Czech and German language ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechoslovaks emigrated to core Czechoslovakia (the later Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) by <b>choice</b> <b>or</b> forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in nature {{to that of the}} Czechoslovak ones before 1938. Two political factions appeared: socialists (the opposition) and rightists (loyal to the new Polish national authorities). Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often fired from work. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie. The local Poles continued to feel like second-class citizens and a majority of them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938. Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only 11 months until the invasion of Poland started on 1 September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic <b>choice</b> <b>or</b> the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

5|$|On 1 October 1938 Zaolzie was annexed by Poland {{following}} the Munich Conference. The Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed {{an area of}} 801.5km² (309.5mi²) {{with a population of}} 227,399. The Polish side argued that Poles in Zaolzie deserved the same rights as Germans in the Munich Agreement. The vast majority of the local Polish population enthusiastically welcomed the change, seeing it as a liberation and a form of historical justice. But they quickly changed their mood. The new Polish authorities appointed people from Poland to various positions from which Czechs had been dismissed. The Polish language became the sole official language. Rapid Polonization followed. Czech organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. Czech education ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechs emigrated to Czechoslovakia by <b>choice</b> <b>or</b> forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in nature to that of the Czech authorities before 1938. Two political factions appeared: socialists (the opposition) and rightists (loyal to the new authorities). Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often dismissed from their jobs. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie. Local Polish people continued to feel like second-class citizens and a majority of them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938. Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only eleven months.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational <b>Choice</b> <b>or</b> Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, {{a policy}} of Konfrontasi (Confrontation) against the newly formed Federation of Malaysia was {{announced}} by the Sukarno regime. This further exacerbated the split between the left-wing and right-wing military factions, with the left-wing faction and the Communist Party taking part in guerrilla raids {{on the border with}} Malaysia, while the right-wing faction was largely absent from the conflict (whether by <b>choice</b> <b>or</b> orders of Sukarno is not clear).|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} {{giving the}} sum of a convergent series is linear, and it follows from the Hahn–Banach theorem {{that it may be}} extended to a summation method summing any series with bounded partial sums. This fact is not very useful in practice, since there are many such extensions, inconsistent with each other, and also since proving such operators exist requires invoking the axiom of <b>choice</b> <b>or</b> its equivalents, such as Zorn's lemma. They are therefore nonconstructive.|$|E
