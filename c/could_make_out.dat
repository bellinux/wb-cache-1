5|$|After dark, the 48th Battalion {{took over}} the line from the {{remainder}} of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.|$|E
25|$|At 12:02 Yavuzs first {{artillery}} officer <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the Russian ships {{through the}} fog and ordered the crew to target Evstafi. The first salvo overshot the ship, though one shell pierced the center funnel and caused splinter damage to the wireless antennae. The Ottomans' third salvo scored two hits on Evstafi. The first one disabled the forward starboard 6-inch casemated gun and caused casualties among its crew. The second shell penetrated the casemate armour, setting fire to some 6-inch cartridges and detonating in the officers' galley, causing severe damage while some splinters penetrated the deck {{and went into the}} boiler room below. A near miss caused extensive splinter damage to an unarmoured part of the ship, destroying a bulkhead in the infirmary.|$|E

He then published his observations {{in a series of}} letters to the Royal Society of London. Bacteria were Leeuwenhoek's most remarkable microscopic discovery. They were just at the limit of what his simple lenses <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> and, {{in one of the most}} striking hiatuses in the history of science, no one else would see them again for over a century.His observations had also included protozoans which he called animalcules, and his findings were looked at again in the light of the more recent findings of [...] cell theory.|$|E

Mutual's Chicago affiliate [...] WGN radio threatened to stop carrying the Weems broadcasts from Chicago's Palmer House if Weems's new singer did not improve. Weems had recordings of some previous radio programs; one evening he and Como listened to them after the show. From listening to them, Como was shocked to realize that no one <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the words to the songs he was singing. Weems told Como {{there was no need for}} him to resort to vocal tricks; what was necessary was to sing from the heart.|$|E

500|$|Located {{at the end}} of {{pleasure}} gardens called Beckford's Ride which ran from his house in Lansdown Crescent all the way north to the tower at the top of Lansdown Hill, Beckford used the monument as both a library and a retreat. He also made it his habit to ride up to the tower to view the progress of gardens and works then walk back down to Lansdown Crescent for breakfast. From the top of the tower, with a strong spyglass, Beckford <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> shipping in the Bristol Channel. Beckford wished that he had built the tower forty feet higher and admitted: [...] "such as it is, it is a famous landmark for drunken farmers on their way home from market".|$|E

By 18:38, Malaya disappeared in the haze and Prinzregent Luitpold was forced to cease fire.

Prinzregent Luitpold and her three sisters destroyed Nomad with their secondary guns while the ISquadron battleships dispatched Nestor. At around 19:00, the German battle line came into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; Prinzregent Luitpold fired two salvos from her main battery at an unidentified four-funneled cruiser at 19:03 but made no hits.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 19th-century report, {{members of}} the Alawite sect centred on Lattakia in Syria had a {{particular}} aversion towards being hanged, and {{the family of the}} condemned was willing to pay [...] "considerable sums" [...] to ensure its relation was impaled, instead of being hanged. As far as Burckhardt <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> this attitude was based upon the Alawites' idea that the soul ought to leave the body through the mouth, rather than leave it in any other fashion.|$|E
