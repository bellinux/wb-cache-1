Among the defining elements of any pension scheme {{among the most important}} are (a) the share of <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and (2) tax base. In the present <b>social</b> security <b>contributions</b> will be applied in the following countries are not EU Member States: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, Macedonia, Moldova, Norway, Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, Turkey, Ukraine, Japan, United States of America. For a better comparison and <b>social</b> security <b>contributions</b> are presented in Romania. In the vast majority of these countries (a) base contributions is the gross income, (2) are used to calculate the progressive contribution rates for retirement, particularly in most developed countries, (3) pension contribution is supported both by the employee (employee) and employer, almost equally. pensions, pension scheme <b>contributions,</b> <b>compulsory</b> <b>social</b> <b>contributions,</b> pension contributions, share; progressive taxation, the flat tax, the tax base, taxable matter, the taxpayer, the basic salary, gross income...|$|R

This contradicts recent studies that hold that dictatorships have no significant effect on social policy.

It identifies the elements of tax design and enforcement that discriminate against the small business and drive non-compliance. It argues that these drivers are related mainly to the disproportionate tax burden of <b>compulsory</b> <b>social</b> insurance <b>contributions</b> and income taxation of sole proprietors, {{as well as to the}} higher compliance costs faced by the small business in Bulgaria. In this framework it studies Bulgarian experience with two presumptive taxes - the patent tax and the minimum insurance income thresholds - and discusses the opportunities and costs of their optimization. tax compliance, transition economies, Bulgaria...|$|R
30|$|The German {{welfare system}} was {{substantially}} reformed {{at the beginning}} of 2005, when the so-called unemployment benefits II (UBII) were introduced which replaced the former unemployment assistance and social assistance. UBII are means-tested benefits that do not depend on former earnings and cover some direct cash payments and <b>compulsory</b> <b>social</b> insurance <b>contributions</b> and costs of housing. Additional expenses for special needs may also be covered. The means-test takes into account the wealth and income of all individuals living in the household. 5 In order to be eligible for UBII, persons have to be aged between 15 and 64 years and be able to work for at least 15 hours per week. It {{is important to note that}} unemployment is not a prerequisite for receipt of UBII. Individuals who are employed but whose household income is too low are also eligible for UBII. Claimants capable of work have to register with the local welfare agency and are obliged to participate in active labor market policy programs. UBII recipients’ rights and duties in the activation process are set out in a so-called ‘integration contract’ (Eingliederungsvereinbarung), an agreement between the welfare agency and the benefit recipient containing obligations with respect to program participation and job search activities as well as detailing the services provided by the welfare agency. The integration contract is usually set up after the first meeting of a UBII recipient with the caseworker.|$|R

40|$|Since 1945, the {{provision}} {{of health care in}} France has been grounded in a social conception promoting universalism and equality. The French health-care system is based on <b>compulsory</b> <b>social</b> insurance funded by <b>social</b> <b>contributions,</b> co-administered by workers' and employers' organisations under State control and driven by highly redistributive financial transfers. This system is described frequently as the French model. In this paper, the first in The Lancet's Series on France, we challenge conventional wisdom about health care in France. First, we focus on policy and institutional transformations that have affected deeply the governance of health care over past decades. We argue that the health system rests on a diversity of institutions, policy mechanisms, and health actors, while its governance has been marked by the reinforcement of national regulation {{under the aegis of the}} State. Second, we suggest the redistributive mechanisms of the health insurance system are impeded by social inequalities in health, which remain major hindrances to achieving objectives of justice and solidarity associated with the conception of health care in France...|$|R

30|$|Public {{economics}} literature highlights two alternative {{definitions of}} the nature of <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> On the one hand, they can represent a deferred salary if the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and <b>social</b> benefits (pensions and unemployment benefits) is high. This is the case of pension systems with defined contributions. On the other hand, they might be considered a regular payroll tax (such as the labour income tax), if the tax-benefit link is weak, {{as is the case in}} many defined-benefit pay-as-you-go pension systems. In this paper we opt for an intermediate position, so <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> would be treated as a particular labour tax whose revenues are partially affected by social security financing. Therefore, we will concentrate on the labour market dynamics to analyse the incidence of <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and, in general, of labour taxes.|$|R
40|$|Public social {{protection}} can be funded through either <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> or general taxation. Does this matter for employment? Yes, {{for a number}} of reasons. First, <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> tend to weigh on labour costs and thus may affect employment – unless workers are prepared to accept lower net wages to compensate for <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> Other funding bases like income taxes and value-added taxes may also raise labour costs, but because they are typically levied on broader population groups – and not just wage earners – they may be less detrimental to employment than <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> The chapter also considers the specific cases of switching to taxes on capital, including real estate, and activities detrimental to environment. Second, the “progressivity ” of the funding system also matters. Adverse employment effects can be alleviated by taxing less low-paid employment than high-paid employment. Third, strengthening the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and pension entitlements and introducing experience-rating for certain social schemes like sickness benefits may be helpful. 157 4.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the optimal {{relation}} between social security benefits and retiree age depends on balancing the advantage of providing an otherwise unavailable actuarially fair annuity against the lower rate of return earned in a pay-as-you-go social security system. The ability of <b>compulsory</b> <b>social</b> security programs to provide an actuarially fair annuity implies that benefits should increase with age while the lower return on <b>social</b> security <b>contributions</b> than on private saving implies that a larger fraction of total benefits should be paid {{during the early years}} of retirement. In an economy that contains a mixture of rational life cycle savers and completely myopic individuals who do no saving, it is optimal for benefits to decline during the earlier part of the retirement period and then to begin rising. Numerical calculations based on actual macroeconomic parameters and representative survival probabilities suggest that the optimal age for minimum benefits occurs before age 75. ...|$|R
