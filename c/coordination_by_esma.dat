Through close analysis of pivotal scenes, including that of Death in the Castle in The Seventh Seal and the Frostnäs church service in Winter Light, the article exposes the unremitting pessimism that pervades the films’ atmospheres. In essence, the article asserts that the two films, Winter Light in particular, are among the most pessimistic in Bergman’s cinema. </p...|$|R
50|$|On {{stage and}} in her music videos, Esma Redžepova plays with {{stereotypes}} linked to Gypsy women and uses traditional attires and dancers. The Middle-Eastern character of her performances was often enhanced to please non-Romani audiences. In the same way, costumes worn <b>by</b> <b>Esma</b> or her dancers can be inaccurate to Macedonian Roma culture. For instance, some videos show Hungarian or Russian costumes, in order to match the expectations of a non-Romani on Romani culture and traditional dresses. Although Esma used sensuality and seduction in many of her early songs, such as her numerous čoček, she put a limit by not wearing immodest belly dance outfits. Instead, she usually wore the Roma dimije, which she personalized by using modern fabrics.|$|R

50|$|Ioan Ivancea was {{diagnosed}} with cancer in 2005 and, after a short illness, died in October 2006. After a period of mourning Fanfare Ciocârlia determined that they would continue. Balkan Gypsy music was now at the zenith of its popularity and Fanfare Ciocârlia were considered to be amongst the genre's most popular bands, their concerts attracting large audiences while Djs played their records in clubs. Ernst and Neumann decided that an effective way of both celebrating Ivancea's life and capitalising on the public's enthusiasm for Gypsy music was Queens & Kings. This involved getting an array of guest vocalists to sing on selected songs with Fanfare Ciocârlia backing them. The vocalists engaged for Queens & Kings were Esma Redzepova (Macedonia), Saban Bajramovic (Serbia), Kaloome (France), Ljiljana Butler (Bosnia), Jony Iliev (Bulgaria), Florentina Sandu (Romania), Dan Armeanca (Romania), Mitsou (Hungary). The album finished with Farewell March, a funeral ballad sung by Ioan Ivancea that had been recorded by Ernst but never previously released, and Born To Be Wild, Fanfare Ciocârlia's rendition of the Steppenwolf song that the band had recorded for the soundtrack to Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for MakeBenefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. The first Gypsy Queens & Kings concert took place in Bucharest, Romania, in December 2006 and found Fanfare Ciocârlia both playing Romania's capital city {{for the first time and}} joined on stage <b>by</b> <b>Esma</b> Redzepova, Jony Iliev and Mitsou. The Queens & Kings album was released by Asphalt Tango in 2007 and they began touring Gypsy Queens & Kings across Europe and to Australia. The tour initially featured Fanfare Ciocârlia joined <b>by</b> <b>Esma</b> Redzepova, Kaloome,Jony Iliev and, occasionally, Mitsou or Ljiljana Butler. After touring Gypsy Queens & Kings for more than two years Fanfare Ciocârlia took a year off to rest at home in Romania and the Gypsy Queens & Kings tour continued with Bucharest-based Gypsy band Mahala Rai Banda backing the vocalists for the latter part of 2009 and much of 2010.|$|R
