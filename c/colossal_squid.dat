5|$|Molluscs are {{the largest}} marine phylum, {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the <b>colossal</b> <b>squid</b> is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E
25|$|The {{giant squid}} is the second-largest mollusc {{and one of}} the largest of all extant invertebrates. It is only {{exceeded}} by the <b>colossal</b> <b>squid,</b> Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, which may have a mantle nearly twice as long. Several extinct cephalopods, such as the Cretaceous vampyromorphid Tusoteuthis, the Cretaceous coleoid Yezoteuthis, and the Ordovician nautiloid Cameroceras may have grown even larger.|$|E
500|$|Sperm whales usually dive between , and {{sometimes}} , {{in search of}} food. Such dives can last more than an hour. They feed on several species, notably the giant squid, but also the <b>colossal</b> <b>squid,</b> octopuses, and fish like demersal rays, but their diet is mainly medium-sized squid. Some prey may be taken accidentally while eating other items. Most {{of what is known}} about deep sea squid has been learned from specimens in captured sperm whale stomachs, although more recent studies analysed feces. One study, carried out around the Galápagos, found that squid from the genera Histioteuthis (62%), Ancistrocheirus (16%), and Octopoteuthis (7%) weighing between [...] were the most commonly taken. Battles between sperm whales and giant squid or <b>colossal</b> <b>squid</b> have never been observed by humans; however, white scars are believed to be caused by the large squid. One study published in 2010 collected evidence that suggests that female sperm whales may collaborate when hunting Humboldt squid. Tagging studies have shown that sperm whales hunt upside down at the bottom of their deep dives. It is suggested that the whales can see the squid silhouetted above them against the dim surface light.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{cephalopod}} {{species are}} noted for having individual body parts of exceptional size. The giant and <b>colossal</b> <b>squids,</b> for example, {{have the largest}} known eyes among living animals.|$|R
50|$|The giant and <b>colossal</b> <b>squids</b> {{have the}} largest {{recorded}} eyes of any living animal, with a maximum diameter of at least 27 cm. Only the extinct ichthyosaurs {{are known to have}} had larger eyes.|$|R
50|$|Between 1868 - 70 he was {{professor}} of comparative anatomy and entomology in the University of Wisconsin. From 1860 Verrill investigated the invertebrate fauna of the Atlantic coast, with special {{reference to the}} corals, annelids, echinoderms, and mollusks, and became the chief authority on the living cephalopods, especially the <b>colossal</b> <b>squids</b> of the North Atlantic.|$|R
500|$|Molluscs {{have more}} varied forms {{than any other}} animal phylum. They include snails, slugs and other gastropods; clams and other bivalves; squids and other cephalopods; and other lesser-known but {{similarly}} distinctive subgroups. The majority of species {{still live in the}} oceans, from the seashores to the abyssal zone, but some form {{a significant part of the}} freshwater fauna and the terrestrial ecosystems. Molluscs are extremely diverse in tropical and temperate regions, but can be found at all latitudes. About 80% of all known mollusc species are gastropods. Cephalopoda such as squid, cuttlefish, and octopuses are among the neurologically most advanced of all invertebrates. The giant squid, which until recently had not been observed alive in its adult form, is one of the largest invertebrates, but a recently caught specimen of the <b>colossal</b> <b>squid,</b> [...] long and weighing , may have overtaken it.|$|E
2500|$|The world's largest invertebrate, the <b>colossal</b> <b>squid</b> (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), roams {{the deep}} {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean where it is {{believed}} to be an ambush predator of prey such as chaetognatha, large fish such as the Patagonian toothfish, and other squid. It is thought to have a slow metabolic rate, needing only around [...] of prey daily. [...] A single 5kg Antarctic toothfish provides enough nourishment for a 500kg <b>colossal</b> <b>squid</b> to survive for 200 days. [...] These estimates of its energetic demands suggest it is a slow-moving ambush predator which uses its large eyes primarily for predator detection rather than active hunting.|$|E
2500|$|In February2007, a New Zealand {{fishing vessel}} caught a <b>colossal</b> <b>squid</b> {{weighing}} [...] and measuring around [...] {{off the coast}} of Antarctica. This specimen represents the largest cephalopod to ever be scientifically documented.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} marine animals exist and rely, {{directly}} or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, <b>colossal</b> <b>squids</b> and fur seals. The emperor penguin {{is the only}} penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The southern rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.|$|R
25|$|Typical ichthyosaurs {{had very}} large eyes, {{protected}} within a bony ring, {{suggesting that they}} may have hunted at night or at great depths; the only extant animals with similarly large eyes are the giant and <b>colossal</b> <b>squids.</b> Sight thus seems to {{have been one of the}} main senses employed while hunting. Hearing might have been poor, given the very robust form of the stapes. Grooves in the palate however, suggest that smell might have been acute or even that electro-sensory organs might have been present.|$|R
50|$|Only the extinct ichthyosaurs {{are known}} to have {{approached}} these dimensions, with some species having eyes up to 35 cm in diameter (Nilsson et al., 2012:687). Despite their size, the eyes of giant and <b>colossal</b> <b>squids</b> {{do not appear to be}} disproportionately large; they do not deviate significantly from the allometric relationship seen across other squid species (Schmitz et al., 2013:45). Many sources state that the vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis) has the largest eyes of any animal relative to its size, with a 15 cm specimen having eyes around 2.5 cm in diameter (Ellis, 1996:177; though see Young et al., 2015).|$|R

2500|$|In 2003, a large {{specimen}} of an abundant but poorly understood species, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni (the <b>colossal</b> <b>squid),</b> was discovered. This species may grow to [...] in length, {{making it the}} largest invertebrate. Squid have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom. The kraken is a legendary tentacled monster possibly based on sightings of real giant squid.|$|E
2500|$|Sea monsters are beings from {{folklore}} {{believed to}} dwell {{in the sea}} and often imagined to be of immense size. Marine monsters can take many forms, including sea dragons, sea serpents, or multi-armed beasts. They can be slimy and scaly and are often pictured threatening ships or spouting jets of water. The definition of a [...] "monster" [...] is subjective, and some sea monsters may {{have been based on}} scientifically accepted creatures such as whales and types of giant and <b>colossal</b> <b>squid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} first {{discovered}} {{in the form of}} two tentacles found in the stomach of a sperm whale in 1925. In 1981 a Russian trawler in the Ross Sea, off the coast of Antarctica, caught a large squid with a total length of 4 m, which was later identified as an immature female of M. hamiltoni. In 2003 a complete specimen of a subadult female was found near the surface with a total length of 6 m and a mantle length of 2.5 m. This specimen shows that <b>colossal</b> <b>squids</b> may grow larger than 500 kg, possibly up to 750 kg.|$|R
50|$|O'Shea {{began work}} with the giant squid whilst working for the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand in 1996. He became the Director of the Earth and Oceanic Sciences Research Institute at the Auckland University of Technology in 2005, and was a Discovery Channel Quest Scholar. In 2009 he {{resigned}} from his Discovery Quest position to focus research on coastal conservation, environmental matters and postgraduate supervision and teaching; despite this he has remained active in squid research, but is best known (in the popular press) for his involvement with large cephalopod taxa, particularly giant and <b>colossal</b> <b>squids,</b> and their preservation. In 2011 he resigned from his position at the Auckland University of Technology.|$|R
40|$|Ophthalmosaurinae is a {{recently}} recognized clade of derived ichthyosaurs (marine reptiles) {{ranging from the}} Bajocian (Middle Jurassic) to the late Albian (late Early Cretaceous). Whereas the Middle–Late Jurassic ophthalmosaurine Ophthalmosaurus is often regarded as a hyperspecialized deep diver, very {{little is known about}} the anatomy, evolutionary history and ecology of Cretaceous ophthalmosaurines because of the scarcity of the fossils and the lack of well-preserved skull material. Here, we describe the skull of a new basal ophthalmosaurine ichthyosaur, Leninia stellans gen. et sp. nov., from the lower Aptian of western Russia, and compare the ocular characteristics of ophthalmosaurids. Leninia is recovered as a basal ophthalmosaurine; it possesses unique traits such as a star-shaped frontal–parietal suture as well as features previously thought to be unique to Ophthalmosaurus such as a supratemporal–stapes contact. A large sclerotic aperture – significantly larger than in platypterygiine ophthalmosaurids and similar to that of the largest-eyed modern animals (giant and <b>colossal</b> <b>squids)</b> – and reduced dentition appear widespread within ophthalmosaurines. This conservatism suggests ophthalmosaurine ophthalmosaurids occupied similar ecological niche(s) throughout their long evolutionary history...|$|R
2500|$|The {{giant squid}} has a {{sophisticated}} nervous system and complex brain, attracting great interest from scientists. [...] It {{also has the}} largest eyes of any living creature except perhaps the <b>colossal</b> <b>squid</b> – up to at least [...] in diameter, with a [...] pupil (only the extinct ichthyosaurs {{are known to have}} had larger eyes). Large eyes can better detect light (including bioluminescent light), which is scarce in deep water. The giant squid probably cannot see colour, but it can probably discern small differences in tone, which is important in the low-light conditions of the deep ocean.|$|E
2500|$|The {{giant squid}} (genus Architeuthis) is a deep-ocean {{dwelling}} squid {{in the family}} Architeuthidae. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size due to deep-sea gigantism: recent estimates put the maximum size at [...] for females and [...] for males from the posterior fins {{to the tip of}} the two long tentacles (second only to the <b>colossal</b> <b>squid</b> at an estimated , one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about [...] long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles (but including head and arms) rarely exceeds [...] Claims of specimens measuring [...] or more have not been scientifically documented.|$|E
50|$|Many {{sperm whales}} have scars on their backs, {{believed}} {{to be caused by}} the hooks of <b>colossal</b> <b>squid.</b> <b>Colossal</b> <b>squid</b> are a major prey item for sperm whales in the Antarctic; 14% of the squid beaks found in the stomachs of these sperm whales are those of the <b>colossal</b> <b>squid,</b> which indicates that <b>colossal</b> <b>squid</b> make up 77% of the biomass consumed by these whales. Many other animals also feed on <b>colossal</b> <b>squid,</b> including beaked whales (such as the southern bottlenose whale), pilot whales, southern elephant seals, Patagonian toothfish, sleeper sharks (Somniosus antarcticus), and albatrosses (e.g., the wandering and sooty albatrosses). However, beaks from mature adults have only been recovered from large predators (i.e. sperm whales and sleeper sharks), while the other predators only eat juveniles or young adults.|$|E
