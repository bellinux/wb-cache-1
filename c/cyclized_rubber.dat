50|$|Natural rubber {{was first}} used as {{material}} for adhesives starting in 1830. In 1839, Charles Goodyear discovered that a rubber and sulfur mixture, when heated, becomes elastic. In 1843, Thomas Hancock named this process vulcanization. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by electrodeposition to obtain a stronger bond to rubber. The development of the automobile {{and the need for}} rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable bonds of rubber and metal. This spurred the development of <b>cyclized</b> <b>rubber</b> treated in strong acids. By 1927, this process was used to produce solvent-based thermoplastic rubber cements for metal to rubber bonding.|$|E
40|$|Grafting of Maleic Anhydride onto <b>Cyclized</b> Natural <b>Rubber</b> {{has been}} {{performed}} in the Internal Mixer at 150 oC and 80 rpm. The grafted product were analysed by Fourier Transformed Infra Red to determine the presence of Maleic Anhydride onto <b>Cyclized</b> Natural <b>Rubber</b> and Differential Scanning Chalorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis to investigated their thermal properties. Fourier Transformed Infra Red spectra confirmed that the grafted product accured by appearance of characteristic band at 1720 cm- 1. The higher concentration of Maleic Anhydride reacted the higher of grafting degree of Maleic Anhydride by means of carbonyl index. Futhermore, the glass transition temperature values increase with increasing the grafting degree of Maleic Anhydride and Thermogravimetric Analysis thermogram showed the thermal properties of grafted product did not change significantly compared with the <b>Cyclized</b> Natural <b>Rubber</b> blank...|$|R
