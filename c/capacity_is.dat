5|$|Although the station's <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> small {{compared}} to other London terminals, it has a high footfall, averaging around 16 million passengers annually. A report in 2001 showed approximately 3,000 people commuted daily from Castle Point to the city via Fenchurch Street, while a 2013 report {{said it was the}} busiest station on the LTSR route, with 46,000 daily peak-time passengers.|$|E

5|$|The arena {{often gets}} uncomfortably hot when the <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> full and the organisers were criticized {{for the water}} priced at 44 NOK (approximately $7,2) for a cup with water.|$|E
5|$|The club's record home {{attendance}} is 23,002, for an FA Cup match against QPR on 10 January 1948, a record which {{will almost certainly}} never be broken unless the club relocates to a larger ground, given that Priestfield Stadium's current <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> approximately half that figure.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} two tower complexes, there is a {{reception}} office, administrative block, monastic quarters, meditation halls and a kitchen complex where lay supporters prepare meals for the monks and visitors. The monastic quarters and meditation hall are not open to laypeople and can provide accommodation for hundreds of monks. This large <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> often utilised during the Rains Retreat. This retreat commemorates events during {{the life of the}} Buddha, when the rainy season came between the full moons of the fourth and seventh lunar months. As a result, monks of the time stayed in one place to practice rather than travel from place to place.|$|E
5|$|CV-22B : U.S. Air Force variant for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). It conducts {{long-range}} {{special operations}} missions, and {{is equipped with}} extra wing fuel tanks, an AN/APQ-186 terrain-following radar, and other equipment such as the AN/ALQ-211, and AN/AAQ-24 Nemesis Directional Infrared Counter Measures. The fuel <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> increased by 588 gallons (2,230 L) with two inboard wing tanks; three auxiliary tanks (200 or 430 gal) can also be added in the cabin. The CV-22 replaced the MH-53 Pave Low.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> more than double, {{allowing}} it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can {{spend as much time}} as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the first Colombian Professional Football {{championship}} (1948 Campeonato Profesional), the stadium's <b>capacity</b> <b>was</b> of 23,500 seated persons.

In 2009 around 1,600,000 {{barrels per day}} of <b>capacity</b> <b>were</b> installed worldwide, with an equal share of 800,000 barrels per day for SAAU and HFAU technologies. On the 1st January 2016 according to the Oil & Gas Journal the worldwide installed alkylation <b>capacity</b> <b>was</b> 2,056,035 barrels per day.

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{cartridge}} space, {{many ideas}} were abandoned during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is killed by the Prince of Cannock's sister if he dies in the final battle. Some elements were later used in remakes or sequels: a subplot about the Prince of Cannock being cursed was added to the Super Famicom remake and later remakes. Also, the Promontory of Olivia in Dragon Quest III was initially an idea for Dragon Quest II. The game cartridge's ROM <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> 1 Mbit, but only about 10 bytes of free space remains in final products.|$|E
5|$|From hot springs, {{geothermal}} energy {{has been used}} for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for electricity generation. Worldwide, 11,700 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power is online in 2013. An additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, Juventus {{returned}} {{to play in}} the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi. Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> 41,507. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season.|$|E
50|$|The stadium {{was built}} in 1998 and used for {{football}} matches of FC ViOn Zlaté Moravce sport club. The original <b>capacity</b> <b>was</b> 3,300 spectators. Due to renovation work in 2014 the <b>capacity</b> <b>was</b> increased to 4,000.|$|R
50|$|An {{internal}} audit in 2006 observed that <b>capacity</b> factors <b>were</b> overestimated by applicants, so less <b>capacity</b> <b>was</b> actually supplied than intended.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of tenders rebuilt from the Type TM, the water <b>capacity</b> <b>was</b> reduced from 4000 to 3900 imp gal, while the coal <b>capacity</b> <b>was</b> {{increased}} from 8 lt 5 lcwt t to 8 lt 15 lcwt t.|$|R
5|$|In January 2013, {{construction}} {{added another}} 368 {{seats in the}} north endzone and two observation decks. The $11million project also includes a significantly upgraded jumbotron with a new sound system, a Spanish Renaissance-themed colonnade, and a north end zone concourse that connects the two stadium halves. Along with the other additions, 157feet of ribbon board will be added on the north end zone, more than 160 linear feet {{in the northeast and}} northwest corners of the stadium, and 94 lineal feet in the south end zone over the athletic offices. The construction was completed during the 2013 season. The stadium's <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> 60,862, making it the third-largest on-campus stadium in Texas.|$|E

As of 2014, total seating <b>capacity</b> <b>is</b> 10,300. Games can be watched from one of four picnic areas—one behind home plate, one on the third base line, one in the third base stands, and one beyond the right field wall. A rentable hot tub deck {{is located in the}} right field corner. There is a concert stage and family fun zone located on The Plaza inside the concourse entrance.|$|E
5|$|Siemens and Vestas are {{the leading}} turbine {{suppliers}} for offshore wind power. DONG Energy, Vattenfall and E.ON {{are the leading}} offshore operators. As of October 2010, 3.16 GW of offshore wind power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe. According to BTM Consult, more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed {{before the end of}} 2014 and the UK and Germany will become the two leading markets.
