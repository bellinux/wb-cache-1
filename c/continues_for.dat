5|$|At the Nyack line, NY59 becomes {{known as}} Main Street. As Main Street, NY59 runs under the Thruway one final {{time before the}} Thruway heads over the bridge. The route {{continues}} toward downtown Nyack; however, it ends at an intersection with US9W before it reaches the central district. Main Street <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> several blocks into downtown Nyack.|$|E
5|$|In {{all species}} {{copulation}} {{takes place at}} the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> 3–10days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build a nest) sometimes in the pouch, and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.|$|E
50|$|COBRA {{also allows}} for {{coverage}} for up to 18 months in most cases. If the individual is deemed disabled by the Social Security Administration, coverage may <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> up to 29 months. In the case of divorce from the former employee, the former spouse's coverage may <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> up to 36 months. In the case of death of the former employee, the widow's coverage may <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> up to 36 months.|$|R

5|$|It intersects {{a number}} of city streets as it heads to the northeast, {{traversing}} several mixed-use blocks before crossing over Onondaga Creek, a north–south waterway that passes through most of Syracuse. On the northeast bank of the creek, NY175 turns east onto West Kennedy Street, a short connector between the creek and US11. The route <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> three more blocks along the mostly residential street to US11, where {{the east end of}} West Kennedy Street also marks the east end of NY175.|$|E
5|$|On the Sunday evening {{nine days}} before the {{scheduled}} All-Star game, the rosters are announced and the All-Star Final Vote nominees are announced on a nationally broadcast show. The voting commences after {{the announcement of the}} nominees {{toward the end of the}} show, and <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> a prescribed number of days. Generally, a single daily update of the ballot standings is released during the voting. After voting concludes, the top vote-getter for each league is announced. Over the course of the seven years of the voting, over 100 million votes have been cast.|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} from East Lenox, PA106 continues southeastward through {{fields and}} soon into {{a region of}} residences. The southeastern stretch <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> several miles into the community of West Clifford. There, PA106 passes some homes and intersects with PA374. The two designations become concurrent, paralleling the alignment of the Milford and Owego Turnpike Road through West Clifford. PA106 and PA374 head southward and soon turn southwestward through forestry, until clearing into the community of Royal. In the small community, PA106 and PA374 fork, with PA374 heading southwestward to Glenwood and PA106 heading southeastward through Royal. PA106 continues further, entering deep woods once again after leaving Royal. At the intersection with Cemetery Road, the highway enters a large cemetery and into Clifford. There, the route crosses through a large residential and commercial community, intersecting with State Route2008 (SR2008). The route continues southeastward through the residential area before crossing the county line into Lackawanna County.|$|E
5|$|An annual {{gathering}} of followers, called ijtema, is summoned at {{headquarters of the}} respective countries. A typical ijtema <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> three days and ends with an exceptionally long prayer. These gatherings are considered moments of intense blessings by Tabligh Jamaat members and are known to attract members in excess of 2million in some countries. The oldest ijtema of the World started in Bhopal, capital city of Madhya Pradesh, India. It attracts {{people from all over}} World. Almost 2 million people gather for this annual gathering. The largest of such annual gatherings is held in Bangladesh. The Bengali gathering, called Bishwa Ijtema (World Gathering), converges followers from around the World in Tongi near Dhaka, Bangladesh, with an attendance exceeding 3million people. The second largest Tabligh Jamaat gathering takes place in Raiwind, Pakistan which was attended by approximately 1.5million people in 2004. In 2011 Pakistan divided the Ijtema into two parts and total 1 million People attended each of the two Ijtema.|$|E
5|$|County Route 626 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Beach Avenue (County Route 604) {{in the city}} of Cape May. The route heads northward on Broadway through the residential portions of Cape May, reaching an intersection with Sunset Boulevard (County Route 606) and West Perry Street (County Route 633). County Route 626 <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> several blocks before curving to the northwest into West Cape May. The route heads northward, passing into a commercial district along Broadway, turning to the northeast. Route 626 leaves West Cape May and switches names to Seashore Road through rural Cape May. The route passes several large farms before intersecting with Bridge Road and Seashore Road (County Route 641). At this intersection, the state takes over maintenance as State Route 162.|$|E

5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths and <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> {{several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The {{maximum recommended dose}} is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|PA371 {{continues}} eastward {{through the}} rural regions, continuing {{its way through}} Mount Pleasant Township. The highway intersects with Township Road 613, where the highway makes a hairpin turn to the south. The route continues to the southeast into a denser portion of Lebanon Township. The route <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> a distance to the east until an intersection with Lebanon Township Road 614 {{in the community of}} Cold Spring. In Cold Spring, PA371 turns to the southeast through deep forests until an intersection with Township Roads 612 and 617. There, the forests break, and the route continues to the southeast. A short distance later, PA371 intersects with PA191 (Hancock Highway) in the community of Rileyville. There, the route begins to follow the alignment of the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike. PA371 continues through rural farmlands until a hairpin turn in the deep forests nearby.|$|E

5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
5|$|The golden-crowned sifaka is a {{seasonal}} breeder, often mating {{during the last}} week of January. Its gestation period is a little less than six months, and its lactation period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season (late January), and <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> approximately 170 days. Parturition occurs {{in the middle of the}} dry season (late June or July). Weaning occurs during the middle of the wet season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period.|$|E
5|$|They again hear Josh's agonized {{cries for}} help and follow them to a derelict, {{abandoned}} house containing symbols and children's bloody hand-prints on the walls. Mike races upstairs {{in an attempt to}} find Josh while Heather follows. Mike then says he hears Josh in the basement. He runs downstairs while a hysterical Heather struggles to keep up. Upon reaching the basement, something attacks Mike and causes him to drop the camera and go silent. Heather enters the basement screaming, and her camera captures Mike facing a corner. Something then attacks Heather, causing her to drop her camera and go silent as well. The footage <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> another moment and then ends.|$|E

5|$|A deep {{stop was}} {{originally}} an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a greater depth than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm or tables. This practice {{is based on}} empirical observations by technical divers such as Richard Pyle, who found that they were less fatigued if they made some additional stops for short periods at depths considerably deeper than those calculated with the currently published decompression algorithms. More recently computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep stops have become available, but these algorithms {{and the practice of}} deep stops have not been adequately validated. Deep stops are likely to be made at depths where ingassing <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> some slow tissues, so the addition of deep stops of any kind can only be included in the dive profile when the decompression schedule has been computed to include them, so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account. Nevertheless, deep stops may be added on a dive that relies on a personal dive computer with real-time computation, as the PDC will track the effect of the stop on its decompression schedule. Deep stops are otherwise similar to any other staged decompression, but are unlikely to use a dedicated decompression gas, as they are usually not more than two to three minutes long.|$|E
5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E
