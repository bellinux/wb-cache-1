40|$|Superfine <b>cement</b> is a <b>cement</b> {{ground to}} a much higher {{fineness}} than ordinary <b>cement.</b> The addition of a small quantity of superfine <b>cement</b> to fill into the voids of ordinary <b>cement</b> can improve the packing density of the <b>cement</b> and thereby {{reduce the amount of}} mixing water needed to fill the voids. In this study, the effects of superfine <b>cement</b> on the packing density of <b>cement</b> (directly measured by a wet packing test), the water film thickness of <b>cement</b> paste (taken as the excess water to solid surface area ratio), and the flowability, rheology and strength of <b>cement</b> paste were investigated. The results showed that the addition of 10 % to 20 % superfine <b>cement</b> can significantly increase the packing density of the <b>cement</b> and the water film thickness of the <b>cement</b> paste. Such increases in packing density and water film thickness would then improve the flowability, rheology and strength of the <b>cement</b> paste.
