Although Spivey was not convicted when the <b>case</b> <b>went</b> to trial in 1953, he was {{prevented}} from competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) afterward. Spivey instead played professionally for various minor league teams. In 10 Eastern Basketball League (EBL) seasons, his teams won three championships. Spivey retired in 1968 and became a businessman, working in sales and operating restaurants. Upset by the accusations against him in the early 1950s, he was reclusive in his final years.|$|E
5|$|Tai Loong appealed, {{working out}} stipulations with NOAA to {{expedite}} that process. Foremost {{among them was}} an agreement on {{the market value of}} the fins, $618,956, to be forfeited if the appeals court ruled in Tai Loong's favor. The district court granted the forfeiture in the middle of 2005, and the <b>case</b> <b>went</b> to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The <b>case</b> <b>went</b> {{to trial}} in June 1982 in Philadelphia. Judge Albert F.

Due to Abu-Jamal's continued disruptive behavior, Sabo ruled that Abu-Jamal forfeited his right to self-representation.|$|E

5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} <b>case</b> <b>went</b> to court in 1871, details emerged {{suggesting that the}} Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, {{who had gone to}} sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E
5|$|Edward DeVoe Tompkins, Inc. {{suffered}} numerous {{delays in}} the construction of the bridge and sued the City of Bridgeport. The <b>case</b> <b>went</b> to the Connecticut Supreme Court in Edward DeV. Tompkins v. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Tompkins sued the City of Bridgeport for breach of contract on the grounds that City of Bridgeport was unresponsive, and did not clear the site as scheduled. Tompkins also cited other concerns relating to the design and construction of the bridge including the design engineers from the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company being located in Chicago. The City of Bridgeport alleged that Tompkins was incompetent and uncooperative, but the Connecticut Supreme Court disagreed and ruled in favor of Tompkins. The Court awarded Tompkins the full contract as damages.|$|E
5|$|Gruban {{successfully}} appealed {{against his}} internment, {{and as soon}} as he was freed brought Booth to court. The case was so popular that the involved barristers found it physically difficult to get into the court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the <b>case</b> <b>went</b> almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of Patrick Hastings, and his victory in it led to him applying to become a King's Counsel.|$|E

5|$|In January 1908, Sheppard {{published}} {{a report on}} colonial abuses in the American Presbyterian Congo Mission (APCM) newsletter, and both he and Morrison were sued for libel against the Kasai Rubber Company (Compagnie de Kasai), a prominent Belgian rubber contractor in the area. When the <b>case</b> <b>went</b> to court in September 1909, the two missionaries had support from the CRA, American Progressives, and their lawyer, Emile Vandervelde, a prominent Belgian socialist. The judge acquitted Sheppard (Morrison had been acquitted earlier on a technicality) {{on the premise that}} his editorial had not named the major company, but smaller charter companies instead. However, {{it is likely that the}} case was decided in favor of Sheppard as a result of international politics; the U.S., socially in support of the missionaries, had questioned the validity of King Leopold II's rule over the Congo.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{broke into}} the NHL in 1989, playing for the St. Louis Blues. In the {{off-season}} following the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils. Shanahan was a restricted free agent, and thus the Devils were entitled to compensation. The teams could not agree on what the compensation was; the Blues offered Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind'Amour, and two draft picks, while the Devils wanted Scott Stevens. Joseph {{seemed to be the}} answer the Devils were looking for in goal, however the <b>case</b> <b>went</b> to arbitration, and a judge ruled that Stevens was to be awarded to the Devils in September 1991.|$|E

The <b>case</b> <b>went</b> to a second trial, which ended within days in a mistrial. A third trial on the charge of murdering her husband ended in a hung jury in July 1964. Kinne was released on bond following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.|$|E

5|$|Stevens' {{time with}} the Blues would only last one season. In the offseason {{following}} the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils, who, like Stevens the year before, was a restricted free agent, entitling the Devils to compensation. As the Blues still owed first round picks to the Capitals (now five instead of two, as the 1991 pick given up ended up being the 21st pick), other compensation had to be negotiated, and the Blues and Devils could not agree on what the compensation was; the Blues offered goalie Curtis Joseph, forward Rod Brind'Amour, and two draft picks, but the Devils only wanted Stevens. The <b>case</b> <b>went</b> to arbitration, and arbitrator Edward Houston awarded Stevens to the Devils as compensation on September 4, 1991.|$|E
5|$|The German navy put little {{emphasis}} on camouflage. After the Battle of Jutland, German naval effort in any <b>case</b> <b>went</b> into submarine warfare. However, Germany {{made use of}} disguise, such as by painting ships in the colour schemes of British or neutral shipping. For example, the Kronprinzessin Cecilie was painted to resemble the British liner Olympic, and managed to reach America, evading the British blockade in 1914. In 1915 and 1916, the Germans further made use of commerce raiders, converted freighters with hidden weapons and long range, able to slip through the British blockade and then attack shipping {{as far away as}} the south Atlantic. German First World War merchant ships were rarely camouflaged, nor did they use Q-ships, as the Allied navies did not attack merchant shipping.|$|E

He was required to complete 18 months of probation, in which he was not allowed to play in a game against Brashear. Brashear returned to play prior {{to the end of the}} season. McSorley, who missed the remaining 23 games of the regular season, had his suspension officially set at one year following the conviction. However, he ultimately never played in another NHL game during his career.|$|E

Mitchell's case was tried by county {{attorney}} Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts {{and the personal}} attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby Andrews County discouraged Tidwell from trying the case. At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to his patients. Roberts sold the supplements, {{but he said that}} his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with the nurses and {{that he did not have}} a business relationship with Arafiles.|$|E
5|$|Those who {{witnessed}} the collision were sworn to secrecy due to national security concerns. The loss was not publicly reported until after the war ended, although the Admiralty filed a writ against Queen Marys owners, Cunard White Star Line, on 22 September 1943 in the Admiralty Court of the High Court of Justice. Little happened until 1945, when the <b>case</b> <b>went</b> to trial in June; it was adjourned to November and then to December 1946. Mr. Justice Pilcher exonerated the Queen Marys crew and her owners from blame on 21 January 1947 and laid all fault on Curacoas officers. The Admiralty appealed his ruling and the Court of Appeal modified the ruling, assigning two-thirds of the blame to the Admiralty and one third to Cunard White Star. The latter appealed to the House of Lords, but they upheld the decision.|$|E

The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family members' income, and the <b>case</b> <b>went</b> first to the Board of Tax Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals, which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two-to-one decision.
