5|$|In the DNA-study by Fain and Houde (2004) {{they were}} {{included}} in the Metaves, together with the Columbiformes. In the larger study by Hackett et al. (2008) they were once again positioned close to the Columbiformes, in Columbimorphae, but also with the Mesites. The intricately patterned, precocial downy young and egg colouration (though not shape) closely resemble those of many <b>Charadriiformes.</b> Eggs are near elliptical.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin is {{a species}} of seabird in the order <b>Charadriiformes.</b> It is in the auk family, Alcidae, which {{includes}} the guillemots, typical auks, murrelets, auklets, puffins and the razorbill. The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and the puffins are closely related, together composing the tribe Fraterculini. The Atlantic puffin is the only species in the genus Fratercula {{to occur in the}} Atlantic Ocean. Two other species are known from the northeast Pacific, the tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata) and the horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata), the latter being the closest relative of the Atlantic puffin.|$|E
5|$|The bird life is {{dominated}} by species from the Siberian taiga, which are otherwise not common in Norway. Species inhabiting the park include Siberian jay, pine grosbeak, Bohemian waxwing, common crane and whooper swan. Several species of sparrow and <b>charadriiformes</b> are also common. There are also three species of Falconiformes—rough-legged buzzard, merlin and osprey, the latter which can be seen hunting over Ellenvatn and Ødevatn. The great grey owl and northern hawk-owl are common in years with good access to rodents.|$|E
25|$|The {{white-rumped sandpiper}} {{is placed in}} class Aves, which is {{contains}} all birds. As a shorebird, it {{is placed in the}} order <b>Charadriiformes</b> along with gulls, alcids, plovers and oystercatchers. Its family, Scolopacidae, encompasses all sandpipers, and as a stint it is classified in the genus Calidris. It is classified as monotypic species, meaning that no population differentiation or subspecies have been described.|$|E
25|$|The chicks of passerines are altricial: blind, featherless, and {{helpless}} when hatched from their eggs. Hence, the chicks require extensive parental care. Most passerines lay coloured eggs, {{in contrast with}} nonpasserines, most of whose eggs are white except in some ground-nesting groups such as <b>Charadriiformes</b> and nightjars, where camouflage is necessary, and in some parasitic cuckoos, which match the passerine host's egg. Vinous-throated parrotbill has two egg colours, white and blue. This can prevent the brood parasitic Common cuckoo.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} jacana, on {{the other}} hand, {{is a member of}} the order <b>Charadriiformes,</b> a group clearly not closely related to either Musophagidae or Galliformes. This makes it highly unlikely that turacoverdin in Jacana reflects common ancestry with either turacos or galliforms. If the green pigment in Jacana is truly turacoverdin, then the pigment must have evolved independently in this order. This is further supported by the fact that the pigment in Jacana is located only in the remiges, while in all musophagid and galliform species, the pigment is found mainly in body feathers.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} bird {{species of the}} river basin reduced sharply over the past 100–150 years. The {{disappeared}} species include steppe eagle, tirkusha, sociable lapwing, bustard, black and winged lark. Less common are geese, swans, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, honey buzzard and osprey. The reduction is mainly caused by the destruction of forests, especially old groves along the river banks. The creation of artificial forest belts (windbreaks) in the basin in the 1960s brought insectivorous birds new to this area, such as Streptopelia, European magpie and shrikes. From the traditional bird types, still common are several species of ducks, crows, <b>Charadriiformes,</b> Podiceps, great reed warbler and much less common are herons and storks. Only 12 individuals of demoiselle cranes remain in the area, near Svyatogorsk city. During the migratory season, the region is visited by greylag and black geese.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} some older fossils that are {{sometimes}} assigned to the Gaviiformes. From the Late Cretaceous, the genera Lonchodytes (Lance Formation, Wyoming, United States) and Neogaeornis (Quinriquina Formation, Chile) have been described; both are usually allied with orders which are considered related to loons. In particular the latter is still sometimes explicitly proposed as a primitive loon as they both were initially, but other authors consider Neogaeornis a hesperornithiform; note however that neither Gaviiformes nor Hesperornithiformes are known from the Southern Hemisphere or anywhere near it. Lonchodytes was more certainly quite close to loons, but probably closer still {{to some of the}} loons' relatives. Of similarly doubtful validity and surrounded by considerable dispute is the supposed Late Cretaceous loon Polarornis (Seymour Island, Antarctica). Eupterornis from the Paleocene of Châlons-sur-Vesle (France) has some features reminiscent of loons, but others seem more similar to <b>Charadriiformes</b> such as gulls (Laridae).|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} birds are tetrachromatic, with {{dedicated}} cone cells for perceiving wavelengths in the ultraviolet and violet regions of the light spectrum. These cells contain a combination of short wave sensitive (SWS1) opsins, SWS1-like opsins (SWS2), and long-wave filtering carotenoid pigments for selectively filtering and receiving light between 300 and 400 nm. There {{are two types of}} short wave color vision in birds: violet sensitive (VS) and ultraviolet sensitive (UVS). Single nucleotide substitutions in the SWS1 opsin sequence are responsible blue-shifting the spectral sensitivity of the opsin from violet sensitive (λmax = 400) to ultraviolet sensitive (λmax = 310-360). This is the proposed evolutionary mechanism by which ultraviolet vision originally arose. The major clades of birds that have UVS vision are Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous), <b>Charadriiformes</b> (shorebirds, gulls, and alcids), Trogoniformes (trogons), Psittaciformes (parrots), and Passeriformes (perching birds, representing {{more than half of all}} avian species).|$|E

500|$|The <b>Charadriiformes</b> {{order of}} birds {{contains}} 18 coastal seabird and wader families. Within the order, the terns form a lineage with the gulls, and, less closely, with the skimmers, skuas, and auks. Early authors such as Conrad Gessner, Francis Willughby, and William Turner did not clearly separate terns from gulls, but Linnaeus recognised the distinction in his 1758 Systema Naturae, placing the gulls in the genus [...] Larus and the terns in Sterna. He gave Sterna the description rostrum subulatum, [...] "awl-shaped bill", {{referring to the}} long, pointed bills typical of this group of birds, a feature that distinguishes them from the thicker-billed gulls. Behaviour and morphology suggest that the terns are {{more closely related to}} the gulls than to the skimmers or skuas, and although Charles Lucien Bonaparte created the family Sternidae for the terns in 1838, for many years they were considered to be a subfamily, Sterninae, of the gull family, Laridae. Relationships between various tern species, and between the terns and the other <b>Charadriiformes,</b> were formerly difficult to resolve because of a poor fossil record and the misidentification of some finds.|$|E
500|$|The Pteroclididae was {{formerly}} {{included in the}} Galliformes due to the similarities the family shares with the true grouse. However, it was later discovered that these similarities are superficial and a result of convergent evolution. Sandgrouse were later placed near the Columbiformes largely due to their reported ability to drink by the [...] "sucking" [...] or [...] "pumping" [...] action of peristalsis of the esophagus, an unusual characteristic. More recently, {{it has been reported}} that they cannot suck up water in this way, and they are now treated separately in the order Pteroclidiformes. They have been considered near passerine birds and are considered by some to be closer to the shorebirds (<b>Charadriiformes).</b>|$|E
500|$|There exists {{no single}} {{definition}} of which groups, families and species are seabirds, and most definitions {{are in some}} way arbitrary. In the words of two seabird scientists, [...] "The one common characteristic that all seabirds share is that they feed in saltwater; but, as seems to be true with any statement in biology, some do not." [...] However, by convention all of the Sphenisciformes and Procellariiformes, all of the Pelecaniformes except the darters, {{and some of the}} <b>Charadriiformes</b> (the skuas, gulls, terns, auks and skimmers) are classified as seabirds. The phalaropes are usually included as well, since although they are waders ("shorebirds" [...] in North America), two of the three species are oceanic for nine months of the year, crossing the equator to feed pelagically.|$|E
500|$|Standing about [...] {{tall and}} {{weighing}} approximately [...] as adult birds, the flightless great auk was the second-largest member of both its {{family and the}} order <b>Charadriiformes,</b> surpassed only by the mancalline Miomancalla. The great auks that lived farther north averaged larger in size than the more southerly members of the species. Males and females were similar in plumage, although there is evidence for differences in size, particularly in the bill and femur length. The back was primarily a glossy black, and the belly was white. The neck and legs were short, and the head and wings small. The great auk appeared chubby due to {{a thick layer of}} fat necessary for warmth. During summer, it developed a wide white eye patch over each eye, which had a hazel or chestnut iris. During winter the great auk moulted and lost this eye patch, which was replaced with a wide white band and a gray line of feathers that stretched from the eye to the ear. During the summer, the its chin and throat were blackish-brown and the inside of the mouth was yellow. In winter, the throat became white. Some individuals reportedly had grey plumage on their flanks, but the purpose, seasonal duration, and frequency of this variation is unknown. The bill was large at [...] long and curved downward at the top; the bill also had deep white grooves in both the upper and lower mandibles, up to seven on the upper mandible and twelve on the lower mandible in summer, although there were fewer in winter. The wings were only [...] in length and the longest wing feathers were only [...] long. Its feet and short claws were black, while the webbed skin between the toes was brownish black. The legs were far back on the bird's body, which gave it powerful swimming and diving abilities.|$|E
2500|$|Canada's {{avifauna}} comprises 462 species, {{members of}} seventeen orders of bird. The two most diverse orders are the passerines and the <b>charadriiformes.</b> The most commonly known birds include the Canada goose, snowy owl, {{and the common}} raven. [...] Another prominent Canadian bird is the whooping crane, whose only breeding grounds are protected in Wood Buffalo National Park.|$|E
2500|$|The Sibley-Ahlquist {{taxonomy}} still allied the loons {{with the}} grebes in its massively paraphyletic [...] "Ciconiiformes", {{and it is}} almost certain that the relationships of loons lie {{with some of the}} orders placed therein. Namely, other recent authors have considered loons to share a rather close relationship with seabirds such as penguins (Sphenisciformes), tubenoses (Procellariiformes), waders (<b>Charadriiformes)</b> – and perhaps the newly discovered clade Mirandornithes which unites grebes (Podicipediformes) and their closest living relatives, the flamingos (Phoenicopteriformes). It is perhaps notable that some early penguins had skulls and beaks that were in many aspects {{similar to those of the}} living and fossil Gaviiformes.|$|E
