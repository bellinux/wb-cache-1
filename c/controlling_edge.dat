The Taylor-taper loading developed by Haupt and Liepta [6] proved superior to the power-law taper overall. As expected, the stronger off-specular backscattering with the power-law taper demonstrated in Fig. 3 interferes with the true surface scattering, giving poorer accuracy. However, the sidelobe level {{is not the only}} limiting factor {{in the use of the}} tapers, as evidenced by the small errors that appear in the VV scattering in Fig. 7 as the grazing angle decreases below 10. This loss of accuracy is consistent with the behavior of the surface current in Fig. 4. Due to the downward slope of the leading edge of the surface, the local illumination grazing angle on the leading edge is less than 30 in this region, which is also the grazing angle at which the current on the flat plate becomes significantly perturbed in Fig. 4.

Our model provided {{a more realistic}} assessment of edge effects than those based on traditional methods. Unique characteristics of the D-AEI model included: (1) preservation of the spatial characteristics of the landscape structure; (2) incorporation {{of the most critical}} parameters <b>controlling</b> <b>edge</b> effects, such as edge orientation, edge contrast, prevailing direction of edge effects, decay value, and interior approximation; and (3) ability to quantify edge effects for various variables at multiple scales. The model is flexible so that the users can define key parameters and generate ecologically relevant output based on environmental and spatial characteris-tics of the study area and the study purpose. Our results demonstrated that: (a) edge effects were not symmetrically distributed in all directions around clearcuts; (b) AEI was not necessarily continuous around patches; and (c) boundary dynamics and multiple edge effects were clearly reflected across the landscape. Results from this research are important for current and future resource assessments, biological conservation and wildlife habitat management, biodiversity studies of flora and fauna, microclimatic research, future studies on edges and their importance in landscape design and analysis.

40|$|I {{attended}} the 20 th biannual International Conference on Plasma Surface Interaction (PSI) in Fusion Devices in Aachen, Germany, hosted {{this year by}} the Forschungszentrum Julich (FZJ) research center. The PSI conference {{is one of the main}} international forums for the presentation and discussion of results on plasma surface interactions and edge plasma physics relevant to magnetic confinement fusion devices. I disseminated the recent results of FESP/LLNL tokamak research by presenting three posters on: (i) understanding reconnection and <b>controlling</b> <b>edge</b> localized modes (ELMs) using the BOUT++ code, (ii) simulation of resistive ballooning mode turbulence, and (iii) innovative design of Snowflake divertors. I learned of many new and recent results from international tokamak facilities and had the opportunity for discussion of these topics with other scientists at the poster sessions, conference lunches/receptions, etc. Some of the major highlights of the PSI conference topics were: (1) Review of the progress in using metallic tungsten and beryllium (ITER-like) walls at international tokamak facilities: JET (Culham, UK), TEXTOR (FZJ, Germany) and Alcator CMOD (MIT, USA). Results included: effect of small and large-area melting on plasma impurity content and recovery, expected reduction in retention of hydrogenic species, increased heat load during disruptions and need for mitigation with massive gas injection. (2) A review of ELM control in general (T. Evans, GA) and recent results of ELM control using n= 2 external magnetic perturbations on ASDEX-Upgrade (MPI-Garching, Germany). (3) General agreement among the international tokamak database that, along the outer midplane of a low collisionality tokamak, the SOL power width in current experiments varies inversely with respect to plasma current (Ip), roughly as 1 /Ip, with little dependence on other plasma parameters. This would imply roughly a factor of 1 / 4 of the width that was assumed for the design of the ITER tokamak. The first studies of the implications for ITER (A. Kukushkin, ITER) have shown a great reduction in operational parameter space that, at present, can only be lifted by increasing target plate heat flux limits. During my visit to the CRPP at the EPFL, I delivered an invited talk in order to disseminate new results of the recent publication [1] on using non-axisymmetric perturbations of the SOL to control the edge plasma. I was given a tour of both the TCV tokamak and the TORPEX simple magnetized plasma device/divertor simulator. TORPEX is an excellent laboratory for exploring the physics of simple magnetized plasmas that are relevant to the scrape-off layer of a tokamak. Properly designed experiments on TORPEX can potentially be used to test the theory of controlling the edge plasma using non-axisymmetric potentials and currents in the SOL developed by LLNL described in [1]...|$|E
40|$|Fabrication of a 3 D {{structure}} and surface texture using excimer laser mask projection ablation processes typically requires the machine operator {{to develop a}} specific NC part program for the desired structure geometry, and also incorporate appropriate machine parameters to achieve the desired surface finish. The capability of the laser ablation process could therefore be significantly improved by developing a CAD/CAM system that automatically generates the NC part program using the 3 D information of the CAD model of the desired structure. Accordingly, {{the focus of this}} research was to develop such a system that is, an effective CAD/CAM system specifically for excimer laser mask projection micromachining tools. To meet these requirements, a unique combination of commercially available systems was used to develop the new CAD/CAM system. The systems used comprised of a computer aided, feature based parametric design system (SolidWorks), together with its extended programming capabilities based on Automated Programming Interface (API) functions for Windows applications, and Visual Basic (VB) 6. 0 programming utilities. The system's algorithms use a novel methodology to extract the 3 D geometry of a microstructure. Two different techniques have been developed to extract the 3 D data. First, where 3 D geometry information from a CAD model was defined as a Stereolithography (STL) file, and second, where this information has been contained in a set of bit-map (BMP) files that represent a sliced or layered structure of a CAD model. Based on this, first an algorithm to create NC part programs to support Step-and-repeat micromachining technique was developed and then successfully extended to be applicable for another commonly used micromachining method, Workpiece-Dragging technique. The systems algorithms for both techniques are based on the raster-colour programming technique, resulting in substantially reduced mathematical complexity and computational time. This is the first time this approach has been used to support direct conversion of 3 D geometry from a CAD model into an NC part program compatible with the excimer laser CNC controller. 2 D mathematical models for <b>controlling</b> <b>edge</b> and stitching errors were also implemented in the system. An additional technique, named as 'Common Nest' has been developed with the aim to enable automatic NC part programming when microstructure design to be completed successfully, requires use of multiple complex mask patterns as a projection tool instead of just a single square aperture. The effectiveness of the system was verified by NC part program generation for several 3 D microstructures and subsequent machining trials using polycarbonate (PC) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and optimised processing parameters. Excellent agreement was obtained between the laser machined geometries and the microstructure CAD models. The Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSCM) measured the lateral dimensions tolerance of 2 m. The system was also successfully applied for a practical micro-engineering application, {{for the development of a}} microfluidics cell transportation device...|$|E

40|$|Diagnostics of edge plasma {{parameters}} {{are important because}} plasma properties {{in the region have}} key role to determine the global plasma confinement. In particular, transport barriers are of strong interest. Understanding and <b>controlling</b> <b>edge</b> plasmas are also important for the divertor design in fusion reactors. In order to study plasma structure in the area, two-dimensional measurements are essential. 　A lithium beam probe (LiBP) {{is one of the best}} techniques for the measurement of edge plasma density profile. The LiBP utilizes the emission of the LiI resonance line (2 s- 2 p, 670. 8 nm) from the injected neutral lithium by electron impact excitation. The LiBP can probe plasmas from the edge to the core crossing the last closed flux surface (LCFS) without perturbation or contamination to the plasma. It has been used in many magnetic confinement devices, but all those measurements are in one dimensional along the fixed beam line. 　A LiBP system that can measure two-dimensional plasma structure in the edge plasma region including the separatrix has been designed and installed on CHS. This system has a beam injector with variable injection angle and amulti-channel optical detection system. The beam injector is located on the upside of the torus, which consists of an ion gun with a Li source (6 mm diameter) which is thermoionic emission typeβ-eucryptite, a Pierce extractor and cylindrical lens. This section is covered with magnetic shield in order to prevent the effect of CHS stray field. The beam energy is in the range from 10 to 20 keV with an equivalent neutral beam current of about 0. 1 mA. The ion beam is neutralized in the Cs neutralizing cell operated at the temperature about 180 ℃. The beam energy is selected so that it offers both adequate spatial resolution and beam penetration. For the 15 keV beam, the spatial resolution is less than l. 7 cm and beam penetration depth is characterized by the 2 x 10 18 m - 2 of line-integrated density. The neutral beam diameter is about 20 mm in the CHS vacuum chamber. 　Light collection optics, which detects the emission from the LiI resonance line, is located on the side port of the torus. The optical system consists of a lens, optical fibers, optical interference filters and Avalanche photodiode (APD) detectors. Since the angle between beam line and sight line is not at right angle, the observed spectral line suffers Doppler shift. Maximum Doppler shift at beam energy of 15 keV is 0. 9 nm. So the optical interference filters are selected with the bandwidth of 2. 0 nm. Twenty-five couplers for optical fibers are prepared on the light collection lens corresponding to twenty-five observation points along the beam with about 8 mm spacing. Eight channel optical fibers can select eight observation points by choosing eight couplers among those. The injection beam line angle can be varied between + 18 ﾟand - 18 ﾟin the major radius direction. Two-dimensional profile is obtained by changing the beam injection angle shot by shot. Since the signal to noise ratio for the present beam intensity is less than unity (S/N 　The CHS is a low-aspect-ratio helical device that has a major radius of 1. 0 m and minor radius of 0. 2 m. The pole number and the toroidal periodic number of the helical field coils are l= 2 and m= 8, respectively. The maximum magnetic field strength is 1. 8 T. Magnetic field configuration can be varied over a wide range by controlling the coil current and its direction. Hydrogen plasmas are produced by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) heating (170 kW) and additionally heated by the two neutral beam injectors (1. 3 MW). The electron density is in the range of 0. 5 - 5 x 10 19 m - 3 and typical electron and ion temperatures are l keV and several hundreds of eV, respectively. Low aspect ratio helical device characterizes broken helical symmetry due to strong toroidicity forming ergodic magnetic field line structure outside the LCFS. In CHS, variety of edge magnetic field configuration can be realized by changing the position of the magnetic axis. 　Beam emission profiles are obtained both for ECH and NBI heated plasmas of limiter configuration. Electron density is reconstructed from this emission profiles. In this study, multiple atomic processes related with transitions between 2 s, 2 p and ionized states are taken into account. There are two methods to convert the beam emission profile to the electron density profile. The first one is the beam attenuation method and the second one is the beam intensity method. When the plasma density is large, full emission intensity distribution is measured. Then the density profile can be reconstructed using the beam attenuation method. No calibration is necessary, which is the advantage of this method. The beam intensity method is used when the beam is not fully attenuated within the observation area. The electron density is derived from the beam emission intensity based on the atomic data, sensitivity of the optical system and the beam density. Two-dimensional electron density profiles are derived using those two methods depending on the beam penetration depth. 　The experimental data suggests that the ECH plasma is well confined inside the LCFS. Plasmas with density above 10 18 m - 3 do not exist outside of it. In contrast, the NBI plasma is spreading outside the LCFS toward the separatrix region and noticeable amount of plasma is confined in this ergodic region even though the magnetic field line in the ergodic layer is cut by the vacuum chamber wall (inboard limiter configuration). The plasma with the density of 10 19 m - 3 exists even 4 cm apart from the LCFS along the equatorial plane. 　Edge density profile steeping associated with H-mode like transitions (Edge Transport Barrier) is also observed. The characteristic scale length of the electron density gradient at the LCFS is reduced to 80 % of the original one. 　Such 2 D-diagnostics is expected to play a key role in understanding and the design of helical diverter in future...|$|E

As it is infeasible to enumerate and analyze each path individually, analyses compromise by soundly merging information about executions along multiple paths. However, this frequently results {{in a loss of}} precision. We present a program analysis technique that we call Satisfiability Modulo Path Programs (SMPP), based on a path-based decomposition of a program. It is inspired by insights that have driven the development of modern SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solvers. SMPP symbolically enumerates path programs using a SAT formula over <b>control</b> <b>edges</b> in the program. Each enumerated path program is verified using an oracle, such as abstract interpretation or symbolic execution, to either find a proof of correctness or report a potential violation. If a proof is found, then SMPP extracts a sufficient set of <b>control</b> <b>edges</b> and corresponding interference edges, as a form of proof-based learning. Blocking clauses derived from these edges are added back to the SAT formula to avoid enumeration of other path programs guaranteed to be correct, thereby improving performance and scalability. We have applied SMPP in the F-Soft program verification framework, to verify properties of real-world C programs that require path-sensitive reasoning.
