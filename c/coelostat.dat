The tube (beneath the stairs) was parallel to the polar axis of the Earth. The building at the base of the tower had a sliding roof and housed a 30 in optical flat <b>coelostat</b> mirror driven equatorially and reflecting light from any unobscured part of the sky through both a 15 in photographic and a 10 in visual guide telescope, both of the same focal length, 600 inches.|$|E

50|$|Between 1904 and 1914, Schmidt's {{business}} boomed and {{he acquired}} an immense reputation in Germany. Not {{only did he}} produce {{some of the most}} difficult and precise mirrors ever attempted up to that time, but he was entrusted with correcting and improving lenses originally supplied by famous optical houses, for example the 50 cm Steinheil visual refractor at the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory. As his business increased, he hired several assistants, two of whom have left valuable accounts of Schmidt's working methods. Schmidt also bought an automobile, a rare luxury then, and employed a friend as chauffeur. Using a long focus horizontal mirror and a plane <b>coelostat,</b> both of his own manufacture, he took impressive photos of the sun, moon, and major planets. When one considers that he did much of the fabrication literally using just one hand, it is difficult not to be astonished at Schmidt's skill.|$|E
50|$|From 1916 onward Schmidt {{had been}} in contact with Professor Richard Schorr, the {{director}} of the Hamburg Observatory, a facility located outside Hamburg in the countryside near the village of Bergedorf. Schorr had become interested in Schmidt's horizontal mirror and <b>coelostat</b> telescope and ordered one to be built for his observatory. After the war when Schmidt's economic situation became increasingly difficult, Schmidt began making overtures to Schorr for some kind of work at the observatory. Schorr had only a little to offer: Schmidt could come to Bergedorf and lodge for free; there was repair work to do on the horizontal telescope, for which he would be paid a small fee. This was in 1926. For a time Schmidt did not accept. He had a number of patents to his credit, one of which involved using a wind-driven propeller to power boats forward. Schmidt hoped to turn this invention into something profitable. He also went back to Estonia for a family visit and to scout out opportunities in optics, as Estonia had become an independent republic after World War I.|$|E
50|$|An Abbot silver-disk {{pyrheliometer}} {{was placed}} on the platform outside the observatory tunnel to measure the solar irradiance.The instrument was on an equatorial mount, so that the sun could be followed by adjusting a single screw. Exposures needed to be accurately timed, for which purpose a pendulum beating half seconds was used. The altitude of the sun at the time of each observation was measured with a theodolite, so that the amount of air through which the radiation had passed could be calculated. A pyranometer was used to measure irradiance from a circular region of sky around the sun, excluding the sun itself. It was on the same mount as the pyrheliometer, so that it would automatically point in the same direction. The stone platform also contained a <b>coelostat,</b> consisting of two flat mirrors, one of which was driven by clockwork and mounted so as to keep the sun's rays reflected continuously through an opening in the northern wall of the tunnel. The mirrors were made of stellite, a hard cobalt alloy that does not form tarnish easily. Inside the tunnel a well dispersed spectrum of the sun was slowly passed over the sensitive strip of a bolometer. The resulting bolograph displayed the relative amounts of energy at each wavelength in the visible and infrared region of the spectrum, which could be used to determine atmospheric absorption at various wavelengths. After various corrections, the value of the solar constant could be calculated.|$|E

After matriculation he studied at Stellenbosch University and graduated cum laude in 1927 and went on to obtain his M.Sc. in 1929, winning the Van der Horst Prize. In 1930 he joined the Solar Research Station run by the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution at Brukkaros, the caldera of an extinct volcano in South West Africa. American researcher William H. Hoover and his colleague Frederick Atwood Greeley, ran an observatory on the mountain from 1926 to December 1931, collecting solar radiation data so as to find a correlation with the earth’s weather. To this end detailed observations were made of the Solar Constant. High-altitude observatories were set up at various locations - Mount Montezuma in Chile, initially at Mount Harqua Hala in Arizona (later moved to Table Mountain in California) and lastly Mount Brukkaros, a site selected by Charles Greeley Abbot, and later moved to Mount St. Katherine on the Sinai peninsula. The Brukkaros observatory consisted of a 10m deep tunnel in the flank of the mountain. A solar telescope or <b>coelostat</b> {{at the mouth of the}} tunnel passed sunlight to a spectrograph, an Ångström compensation pyrheliometer and a bolometer further in.In 1932 Bleksley was appointed as Junior Lecturer in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Witwatersrand, eventually becoming head of the department. Whilst there he worked on and completed his doctoral thesis A Statistical and Analytical Study of the Phenomenon of Long-period Stellar Variability. During this period he took sabbatical leave and studied under Sir Arthur Eddington at Cambridge, Professor Hans Ludendorff of the Astrophysical Observatory at Potsdam and Ejnar Hertzsprung at Leiden. He was President of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 1948/49 and one of about 100 people who attended the founding of the SA Institute of Physics on 7 July 1955.|$|E

Dr. Hale took the telescope on loan from Yerkes, although it has been here ever since. Unlike the two tower solar telescopes (which were built later), the light path for the Snow Telescope is horizontal. The building is long and originally was covered in canvas. This was a great fire hazard, and the crude building was replaced with an aluminum shell in 1911. Light from the Sun is reflected off the <b>coelostat</b> mirror (on the right partially in shadow) to another 30 -inch mirror (at center) and reflected nearly horizontally 100 feet {{to the back of the}} building. There, it falls on a 24 -inch concave mirror with a 60 -foot focal length and is then brought to a focus at the entrance slit of the spectrograph as an image 6 1 / 2 inches across.

40|$|The auroral {{observations}} {{carried out}} by the 11 th wintering party of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition, 1970 - 1971, are; 1. Photographic, observations of auroras with 16 mm and 35 mm all-sky cameras on routine basis. 2. Visual and photographic observations of auroras. 3. Observations of the space and time variations of proton auroras with the H_β tilting-filter meridian-scanning photometer and electron auroras with the multicolor meridian-scanning photometers. 4. Observations of auroral pulsations with the zenith photometers. The principal aim of these observations is to study the dynamical morphology of proton and electron auroras during magnetospheric substorms. A high time-resolution scanning photometer was constructed to measure the H_β emissions in proton auroras. The equipment consists of the <b>coelostat</b> for scanning the sky along the geomagnetic meridian and the tilting-filter photometer for detecting the intensity and Doppler shift of the H_β emission. The scanning period of the <b>coelostat</b> was 45 s, and the tilting period of the filter was 1 s. The lower threshold of the detection was 0. 25 R/Å. In order to study the space and time variations of the electron flux and energy spectra of auroral electrons, observations with the multicolor meridian-scanning photometers were carried out. The scanning period of these photometers was 5 s. The observed emission lines were N_ 2 ^+_λ 4278, OI_λ 5577 and OI_λ 6300.

The {{purpose of this}} experiment, detected with high accuracy of the linear polarization of the Ly lines to 0. 1 % by using a Hanle effect is to measure the magnetic field of the chromosphere-transition layer directly. For total flux of the sun visible light overwhelmingly larger and about 200 000 times the Ly line wavelength region, also hinder to 0. 1 % of the polarization photometric accuracy achieved in the stray light of slight visible light.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{high resolution}} spectroscopy {{of the solar}} corona during the total solar eclipse of 22 July 2009 in two emission lines: the green line at 5303 due to Fe xiv and the red line at 6374 due to Fe x, simultaneously from Anji (latitude 30 A degrees 28. 1 ' N; longitude 119 A degrees 35. 4 ' E; elevation 890 m), China. A two-mirror <b>coelostat</b> with 100 cm focal length lens produced a 9. 2 mm image of the Sun. The spectrograph using 140 cm focal length lens in Littrow mode and a grating with 600 lines per millimeter blazed at 2 mu m provided a dispersion of 30 m and 43 m per pixel in the fourth order around the green line and third order around the red line, respectively. Two Peltier cooled 1 k x 1 k CCD cameras, with a pixel size of 13 mu m square and 14 -bit readout at 10 MHz operated in frame transfer mode, were used to obtain the time sequence spectra in two emission lines simultaneously. The duration of totality was 341 s, but we could get spectra for 270 s after a trial exposure at an interval of 5 s. We report here on the detection of intensity, velocity, and line width oscillations with periodicity {{in the range of}} 25 - 50 s. These oscillations can be interpreted in terms of the presence of fast magnetoacoustic waves or torsional Alfv,n waves. The intensity ratios of green to red emission lines indicate the temperature of the corona to be 1. 65 MK in the equatorial region and 1. 40 MK in the polar region, relatively higher than the expected temperature during the low activity period.
