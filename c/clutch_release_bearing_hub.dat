40|$|Abstract. Commercial vehicle <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> <b>bearings</b> {{working at}} high speed, strong vibration,high temperature, damp and easy {{pollution}} conditions. Fatigue life analysis {{is based on}} the <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> rings or rolling body began to appear fatigue spalling, in which this kind of phenomenon is under cyclic stress. The contact stress distribution is not uniform, the contact stress is mainly concentrated near the surface; influenced by the geometry and physical properties and lubrication of the surface significantly. Contact between the two types of fatigue crack extension methods: fatigue crack surface under expansion and surface fatigue crack propagation. The surface crack growth mainly originated from two kinds of cases: crack caused by surface pre crack and contact between the two surface asperity each other. New life prediction model for the <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> based on L-P theory and Tallian model,in which influence factors of fatigue life is introduced on the smelting process, surface defect, surface roughness, residual stress, elastohydrodynamic lubrication oil film, environmental cleanliness, temperature, the effect of varying load characteristics and other factors of fatigue life. The results show that: the <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> life prediction model of new and more close to the real conditions of automobile clutch, provide the theory basis {{for the development of a}} new generation high-speed heavy-duty <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> of the commercial vehicle...|$|R
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated <b>clutch</b> and <b>release</b> <b>bearing.</b> The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R
40|$|The moto of this {{research}} paper is to design and simulation of a fully automated and high speed assembly system design for self-centering <b>release</b> <b>bearing,</b> which can reduce human efforts, time consumption and eventually cost of a final product. This system increases efficiency and production rate on an assembly line. This system has been designed by using PTC Creo 2. 0 a modelling software. For the gripping purpose a self-centering gripper is used, which is designed {{in such a way}} that it holds the <b>bearing</b> <b>hub</b> with center matching technology and assemble it over self-centering <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> within the exact tolerance zone. To control all motions of the grippers and the center matching tools the rod less pneumatic cylinders are used.

The flash geometry is very important in hot forging process because the flash geometry effects on the metal flow, material losses, forging load, die pressure and so on. In this study, the problem of designing the flash geometry is studied with flash thickness and width considering the maximum die pressure to apply an automatic transfer system in hot forging process for <b>bearing</b> <b>hub.</b> The numerical analysis was conducted by means of the commercial S/W DEFORM. On the basis of numerical analysis the flash geometry of hot forging die was redesigned, and experiment was conducted.

50|$|Friction-disc {{clutches}} {{generally are}} classified as push type or pull type depending on {{the location of the}} pressure plate fulcrum points. In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the <b>release</b> <b>bearing,</b> pulling on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> is pushed into the clutch disengaging the vehicle drive.

Special attention is given the problem of simulating start and stop of a vehicle with rolling resistance at zero speed. Only principles for simulating the system with variable structure is of interest and therefore the models are maintained at lowest possible complexity.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} vehicles, {{friction clutches}} {{are exposed to}} increased engine performances, i. e. increased torque, particularly for vehicles equipped with diesel engines. Demands for low mass and low moments of inertia of the moving parts are more pronounced. Towards the aim of meeting those demands, {{there is a tendency}} for manufacturing of clutch covers by drawing from a thin tin sheet metal, thus decreasing their axial stiffness, and increasing the path of the <b>release</b> <b>bearing.</b> Such a situation in conditions of increasing vehicle speed endangers the fast and precise work and functionality of the friction clutch. Concomitantly, the effort and the work that the driver needs to make and do during its <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> increase. These factors need to be within certain limits. This paper provides an analysis of a possible response to this kind of challenges. The focus is pertinent to the analytical and experimental analysis of the capacity to decrease backlash in the process of <b>release</b> of the <b>clutch</b> with an inexpensive technological procedure for profiling the fingers of the diaphragm-spring as a way to increase their stiffness. The impact of the analyzed interventions on the dynamic durability of the diaphragm-spring is also assessed through an adequate experiment.

40|$|Abstract: A typical {{clutch system}} for {{automotive}} manual transmissions transfers hydraulic pressure generated by driver's pedal manipulation to the clutch diaphragm spring. The foot effort history {{during the period}} of push is different than the period of the clutch pedal’s return. The effort or load difference is called clutch foot effort hysteresis. It is known that the hysteresis is caused by friction. The frictional force and moment are produced between various component contact points such as between the rubber seal and the inner wall inside the hydraulic cylinder and between the diaphragm spring and the pressure plate, etc. Understanding the clutch pedal foot effort hysteresis is essential for a <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> system design and analysis. The dynamic model for a <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> system is developed for the foot effort hysteresis prediction and a simulation analysis is performed to propose a tool for analysing a clutch system...|$|R
