50|$|CNC {{horizontal}} machining {{is performed}} using horizontally-configured lathes, machining <b>centers,</b> <b>boring</b> machines, or boring mills. The equipment used typically consists of rotating cylindrical cutters {{moving up and down}} along five axes. These machines are capable of producing a variety of shapes, slots, holes, and details on a three-dimensional part.|$|R

50|$|Heavy-duty tire changers require larger {{equipment}} {{because these}} changers deal with larger, heavier tires and wheels. Heavy-duty tire changers {{can work with}} some wheels up to 56 inches in diameter and tires up to 90.5 inches in diameter and 43 inches wide. Heavy-duty tire changers are used for agricultural, off-road and construction vehicles. However, now, bigger versions of the heavy-duty tire changers are designed to mount/demount tires up to 95 inches in diameter and also features a hydraulically operated self-centering four jaw chuck with clamping jaws that can clamp from 14 to 58 inches either from the wheel’s inside or from the <b>center</b> <b>bore.</b>|$|E
50|$|Typically, the {{compressed}} air is first filtered with a high-quality coalescing filter. This filter removes liquid water, oil and particulate from {{the compressed}} air. The water vapor-laden air then {{passes through the}} <b>center</b> <b>bore</b> of hollow fibers in the membrane bundle. At the same time, {{a small portion of}} the dry air product is redirected along the outside surface of the fibers to sweep out the water vapor which has permeated the membrane. The moisture-laden sweep gas is then vented to the atmosphere, and clean, dry air is supplied to the application. The membrane air dryers are designed to operate continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Membrane air dryers are quiet, reliable and require no electricity to operate.|$|E

40|$|Ammonia is {{the primary}} {{alkaline}} gas in the atmosphere and contributes to fine particle mass, visibility problems, and dry and wet deposition. The objective {{of this research was}} to measure ammonia and other exhaust emissions from a large sample of on-road vehicles using California phase 2 reformulated gasoline with low sulfur content (~ 10 ppm by weight). Vehicle emissions of ammonia, NOx, CO, and CO 2 were measured in the <b>center</b> <b>bore</b> of a San Francisco Bay area highway tunnel on eight 2 -h afternoon sampling periods during summer 1999. Ammonia concentrations were divided by total carbon (mainly CO 2) concentrations to compute an emission factor of 475 ± 29 mg L- 1 (95 % C I.). The molar ratio of nitrogen emitted in the tunnel in the form of ammonia to that emitted in the form of NOx was 0. 27 ± 0. 01. Emissions of NOx and CO have been measured at this tunnel sampling location since 1994. From 1994 to 1999, emissions decreased by 41 ± 4 % for NOx and 54 ± 6 % for CO. These reductions include the impacts of turnover in the vehicle fleet and the use of reformulated gasoline. Between 1997 and 1999, when fuel properties did not change significantly, emissions of NOx and CO decreased by 26 ± 2 % and 31 ± 3 %, respectively. While use of three-way catalytic converters has contributed to decreases in NOx and CO emissions, their use, in combination with fuel-rich engine operation, is the likely cause of the ammonia emissions from motor vehicles observed during this study...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of carbonyls by motor {{vehicles}} are of concern because these species can be hazardous {{to human health}} and highly reactive in the atmosphere. The objective {{of this research was}} to measure carbonyl emission factors for California light-duty {{motor vehicles}}. Measurements were made at the entrance and exit of a San Francisco Bay area highway tunnel, in the <b>center</b> <b>bore</b> where heavy-duty trucks are not allowed. During summer 1999, approximately 100 carbonyls were identified, including saturated ahphatic aldehydes and ketones, unsaturated ahphatic carbonyls, ahphatic dicarbonyls, and aromatic carbonyls. Concentrations were measured for 32 carbonyls and were combined with NMOC, CO and CO 2 concentrations to calculate by carbon balance emission factors per unit of fuel burned. The measured carbonyl mass emitted from light-duty vehicles was 68 +/- 4 mg L^- 1. Formaldehyde accounted for 45 % of the measured mass emissions, acetaldehyde 12 %, toluadehydes 10 %, benzaldehyde 7. 2 %, and acetone 5. 9 %. The ozone forming potential of the carbonyl emissions was dominated by formaldehyde (70 %) and acetaldehyde (14 %). Between 1994 and 1999, emission factors measured at the same tunnel for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and benzaldehyde decreased by 45 - 70 %. Carbonyls constituted 3. 9 % of total NMOC mass emissions and 5. 2 % of NMOC reactivity. A comparison of carbonyl emissions with gasoline composition supports previous findings that aromatic aldehyde emissions are related to aromatics in gasoline. Carbonyl concentrations in liquid gasoline were also measured. Acetone and MEK were the most abundant carbonyls in unburned gasoline, 8 other carbonyls were detected and quantified...|$|E

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 84 – 94 Reliability-based design, such as LRFD, aims at meeting desired {{probability}} of failure levels for engineered structures. The present work attempts to contribute to this field by analyzing the influence of spatially variable soil/rock strength on the axial resistance uncertainty of single and multiple shafts in group layouts. This includes spatial variability over the individual shaft surfaces, effects of limited data, random measurement errors, and workmanship. A possible correlation between boring data inside or near the footprint of a foundation and the foundation itself is considered. In a geostatistical approach, spatial averaging (upscaling) and a degenerate case of ordinary kriging are applied to develop variance reduction charts and design equations {{for a series of}} foundation group layouts (single, double, triple, and quadruple). For the potential situation of an unknown horizontal correlation range at a site, the worst case scenarios are identified and demonstrated in an example problem. Resulting probabilities of failure are applied to the whole foundation (i. e., group) rather than single objects. It is found that a <b>boring</b> at the <b>center</b> of a group footprint can significantly reduce resistance prediction uncertainty, especially under the worst case scenario for unknown horizontal correlation range. In contrast, independent of the presence of a <b>center</b> <b>boring</b> or not, the uncertainty reduction through additional borings becomes small, once four or five borings are available...|$|R

50|$|The paper, {{typically}} a thick, sturdy variety, keeps the undersized bullet <b>centered</b> in the <b>bore.</b> As each shot leaves progressively more fouling in the barrel {{from the black}} powder, this makes each shot {{harder and harder to}} load.

Officials of all three companies involved insist that the Volvo V8 is not related to the SHO engine; the die-cast open-deck aluminum Volvo block is clearly different from the sand-cast closed-deck aluminum SHO engine block although the two engines share many common dimensions including <b>bore</b> <b>centers,</b> stroke, bearing journal diameters, and deck height.|$|R
50|$|This engine shared {{much with}} the {{original}} Triumph design, including <b>bore</b> <b>centers</b> and bearings, but was substantially redesigned. The redesign kept the unusual waterpump arrangement, which consisted of a cast aperture in the block, and the pump shaft with bearing, seals and impeller pressed into the aperture. The pump is driven by a jackshaft and helical gear. Later B engines used a fine tooth gear which is easily damaged and is a weak link in an otherwise very reliable engine.|$|R
5000|$|Starting with 2016 Cadillac models a new {{generation}} of High Feature V6s were developed.

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{reworked}} substantially in 2000 {{in order to}} meet increasing emission requirements; with the 2.5 and 3.0 being replaced by lower compression 2.6 and 3.2 units. While displacement was changed the <b>bore</b> <b>centers</b> and deck height were retained. These later power plants had a revised engine management system setup, which utilised quad lambda sensor control, coil per plug ignition system and drive by wire throttles. The 3.2 also received a stronger steel crankshaft. As a result of these changes the EGR and secondary air injection system were removed.|$|R
50|$|The B20 {{displaced}} 2.0 L (1986 cc/121 in³) and {{was produced}} from 1969 to 1981. All B20 engines displace 1986 cc via an 88.9 mm bore X 80 mm stroke on 105/108mm split <b>bore</b> <b>centers</b> (2&3 are wider apart than 1&2 and 3&4). The b20 engine was used from 1969 to 1981 in the Volvo 120, 1800, 140, C202 and 240 series, {{and also in}} the Haubits 77 Bofors howitzer. The design is virtually identical to the predecessor B18, simply with an enlarged 88.9mm (3.5") bore, thus most parts are functionally interchangeable, albeit with running changes to the manufacture & design of components.|$|R

5000|$|It is not {{a simple}} cut-down V8.

The LX5 displaced [...] and produced 215 hp (160 kW) @ 5,600 rpm and 234 lb·ft (312 N·m) @ 4,400 rpm. Bore is 89.5 mm and stroke is 92 mm. It was also one of GM's first engines to use coil-on-plug ignition. Compression ratio is 9.3:1.|$|R
50|$|Considered {{the higher}} end of Soviet {{military}} side-mount telescopic sights, {{the quality of}} the PSO-1 is higher than most other PSO-style telescopic sights. The PSO-1 has neither a focus adjustment nor a parallax compensation control. Most modern military tactical scopes with lower power fixed magnification such as the ACOG, C79 optical sight or SUSAT (intended for rapid close-intermediate range shots rather than long-range sniping) lack such features as well. Modern fixed magnification military high-end-grade sniper telescopic sights scopes intended for long-range shooting usually offer one or both of these features. The positioning of the scope’s body {{to the left of the}} <b>bore’s</b> <b>center</b> line may not be comfortable to all shooters.|$|R
50|$|Another {{technical}} {{significance of}} the FW series, which was carried over to the FWM, is an interpretation of Harry Ricardo's intake turbulence theory, whereby intake and exhaust valves are tilted to {{the same side of}} the engine where the intake and exhaust ports are located. In the SOHC reverse-flow cylinder head design, where valves are actuated directly under the camshaft, and where the intake and exhaust ports are located fore and aft of the cylinder <b>bore</b> <b>center,</b> this arrangement allows intake and exhaust flows to encourage a swirl in the same rotational direction in the combustion chamber going into and coming out of the cylinder.|$|R

5000|$|Gas {{pressures}} in Kalashnikov rifles {{are known to}} be high and further complicating reliable performance of suppressors mounted on Kalashnikov rifles is inconsistency in <b>bore</b> <b>centering</b> and suppressor threading {{at the end of the}} barrel. [...] Bores in Kalashnikov rifles are frequently off-center. In addition, the threading at the end of the barrel may frequently be at an axis not parallel to the bore. Both of these conditions tend to cause projectiles to exit the barrel at a slightly opposed angle to the bore of a suppressor. As a result, the PBS-1 Suppressor body is prone to baffle strikes in the interior of the suppressor.|$|R
