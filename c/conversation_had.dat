25|$|Survivor Valeen Schnurr {{claims that}} she was the one {{questioned}} as to her belief in God by Harris. Joshua Lapp thought Bernall had been queried about her belief, but was unable to correctly point out where Bernall was located, and was closer to Schnurr during the shootings. Another witness, Craig Scott, whose sister Rachel Scott was also portrayed as a Christian martyr, claimed that the discussion was with Bernall. When asked to indicate where the <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> been coming from, he pointed to where Schnurr was shot.|$|E
25|$|Celebrity Rapper and New York City native Jay Z {{attended}} {{the game at}} MetLife Stadium and was seen having a brief conversation with Jerry Jones on the field prior to kickoff. This was some what of an event due to Jay Z's agency, Roc Nation, signing on as Dez Bryant’s representation earlier in the month. The pair spoke briefly before the game, which led to questions about whether they were discussing Bryant’s contract negotiations. Jones later claimed that the brief <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to do with}} contract negotiations.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{press release}} stated that Peterson resigned, but Hunt {{had said the}} <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> been on-going throughout the season. Hunt said his decision to relieve Peterson of duties was not based on what happened the previous day, when the Chiefs lost an 11-point lead in the final 73seconds and were beaten 22–21 by San Diego, dropping their record to 2–12. Hunt {{also said that the}} fate of head coach Herman Edwards would be settled after the season. Hunt said he would split the duties previously held by Peterson and have someone in charge of the business side and someone else in charge of football for the franchise. Hunt said he plans on hiring someone from outside the organization.|$|E

25|$|A {{suitable}} {{pretext for}} war arose in 1870, when the German Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen {{was offered the}} Spanish throne, vacant since a revolution in 1868. France pressured Leopold into withdrawing his candidacy. Not content with this, Paris demanded that Wilhelm, {{as head of the}} House of Hohenzollern, assure that no Hohenzollern would ever seek the Spanish crown again. To provoke France into declaring war with Prussia, Bismarck published the Ems Dispatch, a carefully edited version of a conversation between King Wilhelm and the French ambassador to Prussia, Count Benedetti. This <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> been edited so that each nation felt that its ambassador had been slighted and ridiculed, thus inflaming popular sentiment on both sides in favor of war. Langer, however, argues that this episode played a minor role in causing the war.|$|E
500|$|After a short break, {{the group}} {{gathered}} again in Ecclestone's office to find Renault team principal Flavio Briatore {{on the phone}} with Max Mosley. Mosley had apparently rejected all of their proposals, and it was stated that [...] "Mosley had informed Mr Martin, the FIA's most senior representative in the USA, that if any kind of non-championship race was run, or any alteration made to the circuit, the US Grand Prix, and indeed, all FIA-regulated motorsport in the US, would be under threat". On the same day that Stoddart's version of events was published, the FIA issued a statement denying that Mosley had made the reported threat, or that any such <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> taken place.|$|E
500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it my own way, as if the <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E

2500|$|This {{created a}} rift within the government, {{as it was}} widely {{believed}} that the wiretapping was ordered by Interior Minister Tzvetan Tzvetanov. Later those tapes were declared [...] "manipulated" [...] (not being able to tell if they were fake or not) by two independent examinations. In early July, Borisov admitted that the <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> been genuine, though tampered with, while giving an interview to Bulgarian bloggers {{in the presence of}} the Interior Minister. A March 2013 investigation by the Prosecutor General suggests that the wire-tapping was ordered by Tzvetan Tzvetanov, Borisov's trusted deputy in the GERB party, with the aim of getting rid of Customs Head Vanyo Tanov.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, amidst {{rumors of}} a [...] "beef" [...] within G-Unit between 50 Cent and Young Buck, 50 Cent officially {{expelled}} Young Buck from the group, though assuring that Buck was still signed with the label. Numerous slander songs then arose on the internet from both camps, with Young Buck being included on a track with former rival and ex-G-Unit member, Game. 50 Cent then leaked a taped phone conversation between himself and Young Buck, which showed one of the true reasons for the falling out: 50 Cent was owed money by the Southern rapper. Young Buck later stated the <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> taken place over {{a year before the}} leak. The two camps have since released a multitude of songs aimed at each other, though the feud seems to have settled down as of late 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Penniman was 18 when Ethan Allen, {{liberated from}} the Tower of London, {{returned}} to his native State. [...] "I should like," [...] said Penniman, one evening in a mixed company in her step-father's parlor, [...] "above all things to see this Mr. Allen, of whom we hear such incredible things." [...] This saying reached the ears of Allen, who soon after {{paid a visit to}} the house of Mr. Wall, and was introduced to Penniman. There was a mutual and agreeable surprise, both manifestly pleased with the tone of thought and conversation, which ran on with a natural flow, and developed traits of kindred sympathies of intellect and feeling. It was late in the evening before Mr. Allen rose. He had not failed to observe the interest his <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> excited in Penniman. [...] "And now," [...] said he, as he stood erect before her, and was about to depart—" [...] and now, Miss Brush, allow me to ask, how do you like this Mr. Allen?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{cartoonist}} visited John Lennon and Yoko Ono {{at their}} 1969 Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, and their testy exchange later {{appeared in the}} documentary film [...] (1988). Introducing himself with the words [...] "I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?," [...] Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their [...] nude album cover: [...] "I think that everybody owes {{it to the world}} to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it." [...] Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono ("Good God, you've gotta live with that?"), and is asked to [...] "get out" [...] by Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay however, but the <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his Ballad of John and Yoko song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify Capp! [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell {{became an}} outspoken {{supporter}} {{of gun control}} and a major figure in the Million Mom March. During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, [...] "You {{are not allowed to}} own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison." [...] O'Donnell previously had remarked, [...] "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem." [...] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of [...] "assault weapons." [...] She said {{at the end of the}} segment the <b>conversation</b> <b>had</b> [...] "not gone the way I had hoped" [...] and added [...] "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today." [...] Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line [...] "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" [...] from the song [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] and agreed to perform [...] "My Defenses Are Down" [...] instead.|$|E
