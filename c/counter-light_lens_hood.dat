50|$|Correctly made {{rectangular}} or square <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> {{are generally}} more efficient than cylindrical or conical ones because those shapes closely resemble {{the shape of the}} photograph. However, rectangular or square <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> should not be used with zoom lenses whose front elements rotate as the focal length is changed, as the hood will rotate as well, blocking parts of the angle of view. The same also applies to petal <b>lens</b> <b>hoods.</b> For these types of lenses, only cylindrical or conical <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> will work effectively.|$|R
50|$|The lens {{has a small}} {{shiftable}} in-built <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> {{and another}} bigger <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> which can be attached to it and fixed via a thumb screw. It has be criticised by some photographers {{that there is not}} a bayonet in order to allow faster attachment and detachment of the <b>lens</b> <b>hood.</b> However, under extreme backlight conditions the images of the telephoto lens can suffer from lens flare.|$|R

5000|$|Maximum {{aperture}} {{also affects}} {{the shape of}} a <b>lens</b> <b>hood.</b> As the aperture gets larger the amount of light and consequentially the amount of the frame the sensor [...] "sees" [...] increases. This can be seen when comparing two <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> of the same focal length but with differing apertures - compare the <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> of a telephoto 4 lens with that of the same lens but with a maximum aperture of 2.8.|$|R

50|$|The {{shape of}} a <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> can vary from a plain {{cylindrical}} or conical section (much like a lamp shade) to a more complex shape, sometimes called a petal, tulip, or flower hood. These more complex shapes {{take into account the}} final image's shape and aspect ratio. This allows the <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> to block stray light with the longer portions of the <b>lens</b> <b>hood,</b> while allowing more light into the corners of the image through the shorter portions of the hood, thereby reducing the amount of mechanical vignetting (reduction of light around the periphery) in the final image.|$|R

5000|$|A filter may be {{incompatible}} {{with the use of}} a <b>lens</b> <b>hood,</b> since not all filters have the required threading for a screw-in hood or will allow a clip-on hood to be attached. Adding a <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> on top of one or more filters may space the hood away from the lens enough to cause some vignetting.|$|R

A special adapter is required which allows 72 mm filters and the included <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> to be attached to the barrel of the camera. Alternatively, adapters are available from third-party manufacturers that allow less expensive 62 mm filters to be used.|$|R

50|$|In photography, a <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> or <b>lens</b> shade is {{a device}} {{used on the}} front end of a lens to block the Sun or other light source(s) to prevent glare and <b>lens</b> flare. Lens <b>hoods</b> may also be used to protect the lens from {{scratches}} and the elements without having to put on a lens cover.The geometry of a <b>lens</b> <b>hood</b> is dependent on three things: the focal length of the lens, the size of the front lens element and the dimensions of the image sensor or film in the camera.|$|R

50|$|An unusual {{aspect of}} the f/2.8 Mk I lens (and the 28-70mm f/2.8L) is that its barrel extends as it zooms toward its {{shortest}} focal length. When used with the supplied <b>lens</b> <b>hood,</b> which attaches to a non-moving part of the lens, this extension results in a properly matched shade at every angle of view. Most zoom <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> are designed for only the widest angle of view, offering progressively inadequate shade at longer focal lengths.|$|R
50|$|Lens hoods {{that are}} {{supplied}} by the manufacturer of the lens are often designed to fit onto the matching lens facing either forward, for normal use, or backwards, so that the hood may be stored with the lens without occupying much additional space. Rubber <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> are flexible and generally collapse for storage. However other <b>lens</b> <b>hoods</b> must be removed if these features are not available and length extension of the lens is not preferred during storage.|$|R
5000|$|A unique {{aspect of}} the 28-70 mm 2.8L (and 24-70 mm 2.8L) is that its barrel extends as it zooms toward its {{shortest}} focal length.
