40|$|<b>Curtain</b> <b>coating</b> is one the {{preferred}} methods for precision coating {{that has been}} used to manufacture single and, most notably, multilayer coatings and patch coatings on substrates or webs moving at relatively high speeds.

In this process, the flow can be divided into several subregions to systematically analyze the flow dynamics of this process: film flow region on the inclined slide, curtain forming region around the slide lip where the liquid changes its direction, curtain flow region beyond the lip where the falling liquid experiences uniaxial extensional deformation by gravity force, impingement region where falling liquid impacts the moving substrate, and take-away region where liquid attains fully developed plug flow with the substrate speed.

40|$|Coating flows have a {{vast array}} of applications, whereby a thin liquid film coats the surface of a solid substrate. <b>Curtain</b> <b>coating</b> is a lucrative method due to being able to coat {{multiple}} layers {{at the same time in}} one process. Combining many different components of fluid mechanics into one industrial process, fully understanding all the mechanisms involved in <b>curtain</b> <b>coating</b> is essential to fully utilise its potential of efficiently and uniformly coating multiple layers simultaneously. This thesis considers two of these components; film flow along an inclined plane and the stability of a liquid curtain, including both during and after curtain break-up, combining experimental and theoretical studies. An experimental investigation of the flow down the inclined plane of the coating die is presented, for a wide range of physical properties and parameters, with the results compared to a simple mathematical model derived from multi-layered film flow along an inclined surface. Furthermore, a mathematical model of a free-falling surfactant laden liquid curtain under gravity is derived. Incorporating the effect of an insoluble surfactant is found to alter steady state profiles, as well as stabilizing the curtain to small perturbations about the steady state. An experimental study into the liquid curtain during break-up is then presented, investigating the hysteresis phenomenon of curtain stability, as well as the origins of break-up and the speed of sheet retraction. Finally, a mathematical model of the spacing between the array of liquid jets that is formed after the curtain disintegrates is developed...|$|E

Considered is the <b>curtain</b> <b>coating</b> problem, with specific emphasis on trilayer and bilayer flows, and the breakup of a viscous thread with a solid core. Experiments on <b>curtain</b> <b>coating</b> and sheet breakup are mostly conducted by industry and as such are hidden in patents or kept secret by companies trying to gain an edge in a competitive market. Experiments on curtain breakup concentrating on the effect that surfactants have upon the stability {{and the effect of}} differing fluid properties are discussed.

Single and multi-layer fluid flow down an inclined plane is studied with the emphasis on the effect of an insoluble surfactant. Bilayer and trilayer flow down an inclined plane is considered. The main point of interest here is the existence of multiple unstable modes for a single set of parameters. A long wave model describing the multi-layer flow is discussed. Time-dependent solutions to this model system lead to the discovery of travelling wave solutions present in the dynamics. The travelling wave solutions are further investigated through Fourier analysis leading to the discovery of branches of solutions emerging from wavenumbers for which the flow is neutrally stable.

40|$|<b>Curtain</b> <b>coating</b> is {{non-contact}} pre-metered coating process, {{which offers}} {{great potential for}} improved coverage at lower coat weights for the coated paper industry. Absence of shear and hydrostatic force leads to differences in coating-basesheet interactions and process dynamics currently experienced with other conventional coating processes. These differences may lead to surface characteristics of curtain coated papers that {{are very different from}} those obtained by conventional coating methods. Due to these differences, printing attributes of curtain coated papers are crucial to their acceptance in the marketplace. Due to the absence of shear, pigment alignment is not as strong as in other conventional coating processes. In addition, as there is little hydrostatic pressure, binder migration is minimal, so more binder is present at the surface. The increase in binder at the surface improves the interaction of the coating layer with the ink, resulting in a thicker layer of ink transfer to the base sheet in offset printing.

We formulate the governing equations, simplified by making a thin film approximation, from which we obtain equations describing the steady-state profiles. We then examine the response of the curtain to small perturbations about this steady state to identify conditions under which the curtain is unstable, finding the addition of surfactants stabilizes the curtain.

Dynamic wetting {{is crucial to}} processes where a liquid displaces another fluid along a solid surface, such as the deposition of a coating liquid onto a moving substrate. Numerous studies report the failure of dynamic wetting when process speed exceeds some critical value. Typically, wetting failure is a precursor to air entrainment, which produces catastrophic defects in coatings. However, the hydrodynamic factors that influence the transition to wetting failure remain poorly understood from empirical and theoretical perspectives. This work investigates the fundamentals of wetting failure {{in a variety of}} systems that are relevant to industrial coating flows. A hydrodynamic model is developed for planar and axisymmetric geometries where an advancing fluid displaces a receding fluid along a smooth, moving substrate. Numerical solutions predict the onset of wetting failure at a critical substrate speed, which coincides with {{a turning point in the}} steady-state solution path for a given set of system parameters. Flow-field analysis reveals a physical mechanism where wetting failure results when capillary forces can no longer support the pressure gradients necessary to steadily displace the receding fluid. Novel experimental systems are used to measure the substrate speeds and meniscus shapes associated with the onset of air entrainment during wetting failure. Using high-speed visualization techniques, air entrainment is identified by the elongation of triangular air films with system-dependent size. Air films become unstable to thickness perturbations and ultimately rupture, leading to the entrainment of air bubbles. Meniscus confinement in a narrow gap between the substrate and a stationary plate is shown to delay air entrainment to higher speeds for a variety of water/glycerol solutions. In addition, liquid pressurization (relative to ambient air) further postpones air entrainment when the meniscus is located near a sharp corner along the plate. Recorded critical speeds compare well to predictions from the model, supporting the hydrodynamic mechanism for the onset of wetting failure. Lastly, the common practice of <b>curtain</b> <b>coating</b> is investigated using the hydrodynamic model. Due to the complexity of this system, a new hybrid method is developed to reduce computational cost associated with the numerical analysis. Results show that the onset of wetting failure varies strongly with the operating conditions of this system. In addition, stresses from the air flow dramatically affect the steady wetting behavior of <b>curtain</b> <b>coating.</b> Ultimately, these findings emphasize the important role of two-fluid displacement mechanics during high-speed wetting. Although this work was motivated by coating flows, it is also relevant to a number of other applications such as microfluidic devices, oil-recovery systems, and splashing droplets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{experimental}} study of dynamic wetting in metering and pre-metered forward roll coating shows that the dimensionless applicator flow rate λA, is the key parameter as it defines whether dynamic failure occurs by air entrainment (λA>λA, trans) or cascade (λA< λA, trans). λA, trans is the flow rate when the regime switches from metering to pre-metered and λA, min, the minimum flow rate in the pre-metered regime. When Ca was varied in the range 0. 2 → 5, λA, trans and λA, min were in the range 1. 40 → 1. 29 and 1. 20 → 1. 18 respectively. These values compare very well with theoretical predictions. The air entrainment speeds V*M {{were found to be}} similar to the corresponding speeds V*plunging, measured in plunging tape flow but the cascade speeds V**M can be smaller or larger depending on λA. This led to exploring hydrodynamic assistance and drawing an analogy with <b>curtain</b> <b>coating,</b> which was supported by the data. It was also observed that cascade occurred in the pre-metered regime because the dynamic wetting line XD, moves near the minimum gap position just as in reverse roll coating. Indeed the cascade speeds conform to correlations developed for reverse roll coating. Finally the study gives data on XD, and compares them with theoretical predictions. The agreement in this case is only qualitative and this points to deficiencies in current modeling of the dynamic wetting region...|$|E
