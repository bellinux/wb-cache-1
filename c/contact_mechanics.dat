In general, there are two model of hip prostheses which are widely used in total hip replacement, i. e. unipolar and bipolar models. Wear in the bipolar model is more complex than the unipolar model due to its contact motion. The bipolar model has two contact mechanisms while the unipolar model has only one contact mechanism. It means that the bipolar model has two wear positions, i. e. wear on inner and outer liner surface.

The finite element software ANSYS® is used to analyze the von Mises stress distribution, radial stress and deformation with different layer parameters and coefficient of frictions. Frictionless and frictional sliding contact simulations with coefficient of friction of 0, 1; 0, 3; and 0, 5 are conducted with two variables of interference, namely: ω*= 1 and ω*= 4. Results are presented for sliding contact between cylinders without layer, with one layer for one cylinder and with one layer for each cylinder. The result performs trend of the maximum von Mises stress at the contact interface increase with the increasing of friction coefficient.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of an oscillating Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) tip tapping on a polymer surface {{are key to}} understanding the nanoscale physical properties of polymer samples. This is because dynamic AFM observables such as energy dissipation or phase contrast are linked to nanoscale physical properties such as local viscoelasticity and adhesion. Attard and co-workers [1 - 5] developed a rigorous, mathematical model to compute surface deformation and forces due to a prescribed motion of an axisymmetric AFM tip. The model included tip-sample surface forces through a Lennard-Jones pressure term as well as sample deformation through a linear viscoelastic constitutive model. We adapt this formalism and develop an approach to model the physics of oscillating tips interacting with polymer samples in amplitude or frequency modulation AFM (AM-AFM, FM-AFM). The approach is validated against other computational codes. The predictions are compared with data acquired in AM-AFM on an elastomer (E) polycarbonate (PC) polypropylene (PP) blend where the constitutive properties of each component are determined over a wide frequency range at room temperature using DMA measurements and time-temperature superposition. The theoretical and computational approach presented in this work not only does away with artefacts arising {{from the use of}} ad hoc viscoelastic <b>contact</b> <b>mechanic</b> models [6] but it also provides deep insight into the role of surface forces and polymer relaxation times on the dynamic AFM observables. ...|$|R
