40|$|As the {{mountain}} pine beetle (mpb) infestation expands, changes to British <b>Columbia’s</b> lodgepole <b>pine</b> forests will affect hillslope hydrology and streamflow in many watersheds (Figure 1). Stream channels, water quality, aquatic habitat, public infrastructure, and private property {{may also be}} affected. Recent literature reviews have described the hydrologic effects of logging and wildfire and then interpreted the relevance of this information to mpb-related stand mortality (e. g., Stednick and Troendle 2004; Hélie et al. 2005; Uunila et al. 2006; Redding and Pike 2007). This article summarizes the key hydrologic changes expected and highlights the initial results of new research under way throughout the B. C. Interior to quantify changes in standscale hydrologic processes and the potential watershed-scale effects of mpb-related stand mortality and salvage logging.

30|$|Some {{previous}} {{reports have}} suggested that MPB-killed stands may pose a fuels hazard many years after beetle attacks. Understory releases of various conifer species have been documented to occur 2 to 10 years after MPB outbreaks (Cole and Amman 1980, Heath and Alfaro 1990) and could contribute to increased fuel loading and fuel continuity in the post-MPB regenerating stand (Jenkins et al. 2008). A recent experimental burn was conducted in heavy fuels ∼ 20 to 25 years after severe MPB attacks in an eastern British <b>Columbia</b> lodgepole <b>pine</b> stand; measured spread rates were comparable to those in this study: ROS of 27.6 m min− 1 at an adjusted ISI of 9.4 (Kubian et al. 2009). Similarly, explosive crown fire behaviour was described many years earlier on the 1961 Sleeping Child Fire (Montana, USA), 30 to 35 years post-MPB attack, as discussed recently by Jenkins et al. (2012). Some of the areas most heavily affected by MPB may gradually resemble heavy slash as the dead overstory trees collapse; however, very little data on fire behaviour in these stands is currently available and most assumptions are still based on model outputs.|$|R
5000|$|Pinus ponderosa {{is a large}} {{coniferous}} pine (evergreen) tree. The bark {{helps to}} distinguish it from other species. Mature to over-mature individuals have yellow to orange-red bark in broad to very broad plates with black crevices. Younger trees have blackish-brown bark, referred to as [...] "blackjacks" [...] by early loggers. Ponderosa pine's five subspecies, as classified by some botanists, can be identified by their characteristically bright, green needles (contrasting with blue-green needles that distinguish Jeffrey pine). The Pacific subspecies has the longest—19.8 cm—and most flexible needles in plume-like fascicles of three. The <b>Columbia</b> ponderosa <b>pine</b> has long—12.0 - 20.5 cm—and relatively flexible needles in fascicles of three. The Rocky Mountains subspecies has shorter—9.2 - 14.4 cm—and stout needles growing in scopulate (bushy, tuft-like) fascicles of two or three. The southwestern subspecies has 11.2 - 19.8 cm, stout needles in fascicles of three (averaging 2.7 - 3.5 in). The central High Plains subspecies {{is characterized by the}} fewest needles (1.4 per whorl, on average); stout, upright branches at narrow angles from the trunk; and long green needles—14.8 - 17.9 cm—extending farthest along the branch, resembling a fox tail. Needles are widest, stoutest, and fewest (averaging 2.2 - 2.8 in) for the species.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} I characterize the early post-disturbance forest light environment {{and structure of}} lodgepole pine forests in the southern interior of British <b>Columbia</b> after mountain <b>pine</b> beetle attack, wildfire and salvage logging. These different, and at times sequential, disturbances influence structural complexity, overstory composition and the heterogeneity of light transmission in different ways. Beetle disturbance left complex patterns of gap light in the mixed-species canopy, which accelerated the growth release of surviving trees. After wildfire, there were predominantly dead structural legacies and high variability of light and residual structural elements. Salvage logging after fire or beetles significantly reduced the amount and diversity of biological legacies {{and led to a}} more homogeneous, bright light environment than after only the natural disturbances. The resulting homogeneity of post-salvaged stands and variability of light and structure in unsalvaged stands will influence patterns of forest development and have implications for management...|$|R
40|$|Twentieth-century weather {{records and}} {{temperature}} proxies (boreholes in the earth, ice cores in Montana glaciers) show temperature increases throughout western North America, northern precipitation increases, but decreases in the Southwest. Montane snowpacks are shrinking, flow patterns in western streams are changing. Climate models predict intensification of these trends, and optimum climate for wine-grape production shifting north out of California to Oregon, Washington, and British <b>Columbia.</b> Massive mountain <b>pine</b> beetle outbreaks are killing lodgepole pines in the Northwest, and in British Columbia where no outbreaks occurred historically. Shifting distributions {{and timing of}} plant and animal species are changing structures of natural communities. In Alaska, glaciers are receding, thermofrost is thawing, lakes are disappearing, forests are dying, natives’ coastal villages are no longer protected from erosion by sea ice and must be moved.

40|$|The Warren root collar weevil, Hylobius warreni Wood, is a {{phytophagous}} pest of conifers in {{the interior}} region of British <b>Columbia,</b> particularly lodgepole <b>pine</b> (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). Literature suggests the weevils locate hosts based on vision and random movements, while the mechanisms of host assessment are unknown. Tracking individuals with harmonic radar, I found predominantly random overall movements, while movements during host location were based on tree size and proximity. These results were supported by the analysis of an existing capture-mark-recapture data set. In further experiments, I found that lodgepole pine seedlings under induced stress produced differential concentrations {{of a number of}} terpenes based on parental resistance to the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and that weevils fed differentially on branches of different chemical compositions. These findings strengthen the evidence for host location by vision and random movements, and provide new evidence for host assessment involving chemosensory signals. [...] Leaf ii.

40|$|The {{ecological}} disturbance from wildfire (2004) on ~ 10, 000 {{hectares of}} forests near the Kenny Dam presented {{a unique opportunity}} to study the natural and artificial regeneration in burned mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) infested stands in north-central British <b>Columbia.</b> Mountain <b>pine</b> beetle (MPB) has been documented as a natural disturbance agent that may precede wildfire in lodgepole pine forests (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). The objectives of this study were to i) characterize lodgepole pine regeneration and related micro-site conditions associated with wildfire, ii) identify limitations for germination, survival and recruitment of natural and artificial regeneration in relation to site moisture, fire severity, and vegetative competition, iii) determine if regeneration was limited by belowground factors (soil characteristics, ectomycorrhizal inoculum, nitrogen-cycling bacterial communities), and iv) provide guidance on local operational management of MPB-killed stands. The germination, survival and recruitment of lodgepole pine seedlings over two growing seasons were compared on 18 disturbance plots (replicated three times) with three fire severity classes (high, moderate, low), two moisture regimes (dry and wet), two seed provenances (wild and improved Class-A), and two seedbed types (disturbed and undisturbed). In the growing seasons following the fire (2005 and 2006), seeded plots experienced bursts of spring germination followed by continuous minor waves of new germination (that ended by August 2006). Results showed that natural regeneration was highest on wet sites and seedling density increased with declining fire severity. On dry sites, new germinants were rare and limited by microsite conditions associated with high and moderate fire severity, with highest germination rates experienced on low fire severity. Seed provenance did not influence germination and survival rates. In contrast to the germination, survival and recruitment results, growth rates were highest on the dry sites and increased with increasing fire severity. Thus, although recruitment on dry sites is unlikely to sufficiently restock these stands with lodgepole pine, the recruits show the highest growth rates. Conversely, recruitment on the wet sites will fully sufficient to fully restock these stands, but the growth rates of the seedlings will likely be impeded by competition with other vegetation. Although we documented adverse impacts of MPB and burning on soil properties, and lower diversity of ectomycorrhizal communities and nitrogen-cycling bacterial communities on the dry sites, {{there is no evidence that}} these factors are limiting growth of recruits on these dry sites. We are reviewing these results and preparing publications, and will make final management recommendations once the data are completely analyzed...|$|R
50|$|Subalpine fir is {{ubiquitous}} in the ESSF {{and is the}} most common associate of spruce throughout. Lodgepole pine {{is the most common}} seral species. Deciduous species, such as trembling aspen, paper birch, and black cottonwood, are present but uncommon. Whitebark pine and, in southeastern British <b>Columbia</b> only, limber <b>pine</b> and alpine larch occur in association with spruce, especially in the driest ecosystems, usually at high elevations, where spruce is not abundant. At low elevations in the ESSF, associates of spruce are Douglas-fir, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western white pine. Mountain hemlock and amabilis fir (Abies amabilis) are also found with spruce in the ESSF, principally adjacent to the Mountain Hemlock Zone. The dominant plant community in the ESSF has an understorey of ericaceous shrubs, mainly Rhododendron albiflorum, Vaccinium membranaceum, and Menziesia ferruginea, with Vaccinium ovalifolium in high-precipitation areas and V. scoparium in dry areas. Ribes lacustre, Oplopanax horridus and Lonicera involucrata are common shrubs on moist to wet sites. Herbs characteristic of the ESSF forest include Valeriana sitchensis, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Rubus pedatus, Streptopus roseus, Veratrum viride, Athyrium filix-femina, Cornus canadensis, Lycopodium annotinum, Tiarella spp. and Arnica cordifolia. Dominant bryophytes are Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum spp., and Barbilophozia spp. Lichens are abundant on the forest floor and include Peltigera spp., Nephroma arcticum, and Cladonia spp. At the upper parkland elevations of the ESSF, closed forest and tree islands of spruce and subalpine fir are interspersed with moist herb meadows and drier ericaceous heath. The meadows typically include the herbs: Valeriana sitchensis, Veratrum viride, Senecio triangularis, Lupinus arcticus, Thalictrum occidentale, Epilobium angustifolium, Pedicularis bracteosum, Castelleja miniata, Erigeron peregrinus, Carex spp. and Luzula spp. Subalpine heath includes Empetrum nigrum, Cassiope mertensiana, C. tetragona, Phyllodoce empetriformis, P. glandulifera, and Vaccinium caespitosum (Coates et al. 1994).|$|R
