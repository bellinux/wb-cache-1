40|$|The central {{issues with}} which {{this study is}} {{concerned}} revolve around the major determinants of agricultural export instability in Nigeria. Specifically, the study {{examined the relationship between}} oil export and the agricultural export performance in Nigeria. In trying to achieve this objective, an ordinary least square multiple regression approach was adopted for the data analysis. Some statistical tools were employed to determine the statistical significant relationship between these variables. The analysis started with the test of stationarity and co-integration of Nigeria’s time series data. The empirical study found that the data were stationary and co integrated. The multiple regression results showed a significant but negative relationship between oil export and the agricultural export performance in Nigeria. These results were robust to a number of econometric specifications. Our findings and conclusion support the need for the government to diversify the oil sector and encourage agriculture through incentives to farmers, mechanization and positive policy measures. In complement of the above, {{it is important for the}} government to consolidate and maintain export incentives comprising a duty draw-back scheme, explicit export bonuses, <b>currency</b> <b>retention</b> scheme and other direct fiscal incentives (such as the exemption of export transactions from stamp duties) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{credible}} {{model to}} account for the overall energy benefits with retention of historic buildings has been needed since preservation became national policy in 1966. The initial need to measure energy capital in buildings arose from the two energy crises in the 1970 s, with a second need to address the sustainability goals of the 1990 s/ 2000 s. Both responses measure overall energy efficiency of historic buildings by attempting {{to account for}} the 2 ̆ 2 energy capital. 2 ̆ 2 The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation introduced the first model in 1979, focused on measuring embodied energy and it has remained embedded in preservation vocabulary and is a reflexive argument utilized to advocate for the retention of historic structures over new construction. The second model, the life cycle assessment/avoided impacts is a response to the evolving metrics and currency of sustainability. The Preservation Green Lab further matured the capabilities of the life cycle assessment/avoided impacts model in 2012 with their innovative report, The Greenest Building: Quantifying the Environmental Value of Building Reuse. This thesis evaluates the future of the preservation field to communicate with a common <b>currency</b> regarding <b>retention</b> of historic structures...|$|R

This may include, {{but is not}} limited to Hospital and Health Services and Queensland Health. It is not intended to cover private health facilities. This Schedule is to be used in conjunction with the General Retention and Disposal Schedule for Administrative Records (GRDS). References to repealed legislation within this Schedule may be taken to be a reference to current legislation if the context permits. In the event of an administrative change, or the transfer of a function from one public authority to another, this retention and disposal schedule will continue to apply to the records covered by the schedule.
