50|$|Work {{toward the}} Christmas Tree Promotion, Research, and Information Order began in April 2008 {{when a group}} of farmers and {{retailers}} began to study similar programs in agricultural industries of similar size. The group's work included more than 100 meetings across the United States. Initially, the proposed rule was published in the Federal Register in November 2010, one year before the order was first implemented. Upon the order's initial publication, the USDA requested input in the form of comments from growers, retailers and the general public. The primary <b>commenting</b> <b>period</b> went from the time the proposed rule was first published, November 8, 2010 until February 7, 2011. After the USDA received several letters from producers, a second <b>commenting</b> <b>period</b> was opened from February 22, 2011 until March 9, 2011. During these two <b>comment</b> <b>periods</b> the USDA received 565 comments concerning the proposed rule; 398 supported it, 147 opposed it and the remaining 20 comments fell into some other category.|$|R

500|$|In 1994, {{as part of}} an {{attempted}} resolution to the element naming controversy, the IUPAC ratified names for elements 101–109. For element 102, it ratified the name nobelium (No) on the basis that it had become entrenched in the literature over the course of 30 years and that Alfred Nobel should be commemorated in this fashion. Because of outcry over the 1994 names, which mostly did not respect the choices of the discoverers, a <b>comment</b> <b>period</b> ensued, and in 1995 IUPAC named element 102 flerovium (Fl) as part of a new proposal, after either Georgy Flyorov or his eponymous Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions. This proposal was also not accepted, and in 1997 the name [...] "nobelium" [...] was restored. Today, the name [...] "flerovium", with the same symbol, now refers to element 114.|$|E
500|$|In the end, Secretary Chao heeded the Republican letter's arguments, and {{deferred}} {{the grant}} {{in a letter}} written by FTA Executive Director Matthew Welbes to Caltrain which stated the FTA needed [...] "additional time to complete review of this significant commitment of Federal resources". Caltrain had expected Secretary Chao to approve the grant and sign the grant agreement by March 1, which is normally a pro forma step performed after the thirty-day <b>comment</b> <b>period</b> for a highly-rated project, and had already awarded construction contracts. Balfour Beatty Construction and Stadler Rail had already begun preparations to upgrade the existing tracks and build electrical trainsets, respectively. Caltrain negotiated an emergency four-month contract extension at a potential cost of $20 million. Under the preliminary budget proposal released in mid-March 2017, the United States Department of Transportation's Capital Investment Grant Program would be eliminated, although approved projects {{would continue to be}} funded. Since Secretary Chao had withheld grant approval for the electrification project, its future fell into doubt.|$|E
500|$|In January 1999, the Air Transportation Association of America (ATA), a {{lobbying}} group and trade organization representing several airlines, {{filed a lawsuit}} in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit against the FAA over alleged misuse use of Passenger Facility Charge funds for the project. In March, Judge Laurence Silberman ruled that the FAA did not misuse PFC funds in constructing the Van Wyck section of the AirTrain; however, he also found that after the AirTrain's public <b>comment</b> <b>period</b> had lapsed, the FAA had incorrectly continued to collect and make use of comments posted after the deadline. As a result, the project's approval was vacated. The FAA then opened a second request for public comment, and the approval was accepted again. In 2000, the Southeast Queens Concerned Neighbors (SQCN) and the Committee for Better Transit (CBT), two advocacy groups consisting of local residents, also filed a federal lawsuit in which they claimed that the FEIS had published misleading statements {{about the effects of}} the elevated structure on southern Queens neighborhoods. The ATA, along with the SQCN and the CBT, [...] appealed the funding decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The ATA subsequently withdrew from the lawsuit following negotiations with the Port Authority. However, the CBT proceeded with an appeal, which it lost. In denying the lawsuit, Judge Robert Katzmann wrote that [...] "...the FAA's interpretation of the PFC statute is reasonable and consistent with the statute's purpose." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the federal}} level, Cape Wind {{originally}} {{applied for a}} permit in 2001 under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 with the US Army Corps of Engineers. [...] The Army Corps eventually presented a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In a public <b>comment</b> <b>period,</b> many Federal agencies, local governments, and community groups found the draft EIS to have deficiencies. Due to passage of the 2005 Energy Bill, the regulatory authority for off-shore energy projects has been transferred from the Army Corps to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) within the Department of the Interior. Whereas Cape Wind had expected to obtain approval quickly from the Army Corps, this transfer of authority to the MMS delayed the project.|$|E

2500|$|Pursuant to the 2009 {{management}} plan, FWP began considering {{new rules}} governing the Smith River Recreational Waterway in 2010. Two of these proved highly controversial.

Although the rule was designed to ensure more people enjoyed the river, {{members of the public}} said it was unfair to those who had to cancel. The second proposal would require anyone using the new Deep Creek boat camp to pack out their human waste. The agency was forced to extend the <b>comment</b> <b>period</b> from 30 to 45 days to accommodate the controversy these two proposals engendered. Far less controversial was the proposal to create a new [...] "super permit" [...] lottery. Under this scheme, members of the public would be able to purchase, for $5 ($ in [...] dollars), an unlimited number of chances to win a single permit to float any day they wanted during the float season.

2500|$|There {{had been}} {{simplification}} initiatives aimed at eradicating characters entirely and establishing the Hanyu Pinyin romanization {{as the official}} written system of the PRC, but the reform never gained quite as much popularity as the leftists had hoped. After the retraction of {{the second round of}} simplification, the PRC stated that it wished to keep Chinese orthography stable. Years later in 2009, the Chinese government released a major revision list which included 8,300 characters. No new simplifications were introduced. However, six characters previously listed as [...] "traditional" [...] characters that have been simplified, as well as 51 other [...] "variant" [...] characters, were restored to the standard list. In addition, orthographies (e.g., stroke shape) for 44 characters were proposed to be modified slightly to fit traditional calligraphic rules. [...] Also, the practice of unrestricted simplification of rare and archaic characters by analogy using simplified radicals or components is now discouraged. A State Language Commission official cited [...] "oversimplification" [...] as the reason for restoring some characters. The language authority declared an open <b>comment</b> <b>period</b> until August 31, 2009 for feedback from the public. [...] The proposed orthographic changes to 44 characters were not implemented due to overwhelmingly negative public opinion.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, Truesdale also {{pushed for}} the Board {{to engage in a}} {{rulemaking}} regarding the Supreme Court's decision in Communications Workers of America v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735 (1988). [...] In that decision, the Court held that, in a union security agreement, unions are authorized by statute to collect from non-members only those fees and dues necessary to perform its duties as a collective bargaining representative. The rights identified by the Court in Communications Workers of America v. Beck have since {{come to be known as}} [...] "Beck rights." [...] In October 1991, White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray began criticizing the Board and then-chair James M. Stephens for not adequately enforcing workers' Beck rights. Stephens had already proposed at this time a rulemaking on the issue, and in October 1991 and May 1992 Stephens acceded to requests by White House staff to show them the rule so they could provide comments on it. In May 1992, for only the second time in its history, the National Labor Relations Board undertook a regulatory rulemaking aimed at resolving the divergent, complex issues raised by the Beck decision. On September 3, 1992, even though the public <b>comment</b> <b>period</b> on the rule had closed, the White House sent a memo to Executive Secretary Truesdale indicating that comments on the rule were coming from the White House, that these comments should not be made public, that the White House expected these comments to be incorporated into the rule, and that the White House wanted to see the final rule before it was published. Truesdale and the Board's Solicitor General, John Higgins, sent a memo to the Board the following day outlining the White House's requests and positions. The Board voted 4-to-1 (with Member Dennis Devaney dissenting) not to consider or review the White House memo.|$|E
2500|$|After Campbell {{announced}} his resignation the BC Liberal Party leadership election began, {{the winner of}} which would become premier. In mid-December 2010 Lake endorsed George Abbott, citing Abbott's [...] "collaborative and engaging style to governing" [...] and his profile as a fellow Interior and rural MLA. Christy Clark would eventually win the leadership race. When the 39th Parliament resumed with a third session and Clark as premier, she promoted Lake to Minister of Environment and made him the deputy government house leader. Clark and Lake committed {{to continue with the}} carbon tax and a carbon neutral public service, but backed away from the province's legislated greenhouse gas reduction targets. The issue about BC's participation in the Western Climate Initiative was reviewed by the entire cabinet, who decided to continue with WCI's planned cap-and-trade system. An emphasis in the Ministry of Environment was placed on BC Parks with announcements by Clark and Lake on the elimination of parking fees at parks, a one-year youth passport program, new online tools to facilitate park usage, a park bench sponsorship program, and a $500,000 program to celebrate B.C. Parks' 100th-anniversary. Lake came under criticism for not publicly releasing the report and recommendations of the Species at Risk Task Force. To compensate for the slow action on the task force, the opposition environment critic Rob Fleming re-introduced his own Species at Risk Protection Act in June 2011. Lake released the task force report in July for a public <b>comment</b> <b>period.</b> As the Minister of Environment, Lake had to defend the Environmental Assessment Office following a review by the Auditor General who identified short-comings and continued criticism regarding the rigorousness of the environmental review process as a proposed copper-gold mine, which was approved by Lake's predecessor, was refused by the federal government. Lake came under criticism from fellow BC Liberal MLAs John Les, John van Dongen, and Donna Barnett after Lake approved Metro Vancouver's waste-management plan which included proposals to incinerate garbage; Les and van Dongen felt the plan would significantly lower air quality in their Fraser Valley ridings and Barnett advocated for continuing the hauling of garbage to the Cache Creek landfill in her riding.|$|E
