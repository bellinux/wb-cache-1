500|$|In {{response}} to the lessons learned at the disastrous Dieppe raid, the Allies developed new technologies to help ensure the success of Overlord. To supplement the preliminary offshore bombardment and aerial assaults, some of the landing craft were equipped with artillery and anti-tank guns to provide <b>close</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>fire.</b> The Allies {{had decided not to}} immediately attack any of the heavily protected French ports and two artificial ports, called Mulberry harbours, were designed by COSSAC planners. Each assembly consisted of a floating outer breakwater, inner concrete caissons (called Phoenix breakwaters) and several floating piers. The Mulberry harbours were supplemented by blockship shelters (codenamed [...] "Gooseberries"). With the expectation that fuel would be difficult or impossible to obtain on the continent, the Allies built a [...] "Pipe-Line Under The Ocean" [...] (PLUTO). Specially developed pipes [...] in diameter were to be laid under the Channel from the Isle of Wight to Cherbourg by D-Day plus 18. Technical problems and the delay in capturing Cherbourg meant the pipeline was not operational until 22 September. A second line was laid from Dungeness to Boulogne in late October.|$|E
50|$|Unlike rockets, guns (or howitzers as some armies {{still call}} them) and mortars are {{suitable}} for delivering <b>close</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>fire.</b> However, they are all suitable for providing deep supporting fire although the limited range of many mortars tends to exclude them from the role. Their control arrangements and limited range also mean that mortars are most suited to direct supporting fire. Guns are used either for this or general supporting fire while rockets are mostly used for the latter. However, lighter rockets {{may be used for}} direct fire support. These rules of thumb apply to NATO armies.|$|E

50|$|Citation:Technical Sergeant Yeiki Kobashigawa {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} extraordinary heroism in action on 2 June 1944, {{in the vicinity}} of Lanuvio, Italy. During an attack, Technical Sergeant Kobashigawa's platoon encountered strong enemy resistance from a series of machine guns providing supporting fire. Observing a machine gun nest 50 yards from his position, Technical Sergeant Kobashigawa crawled forward with one of his men, threw a grenade and then charged the enemy with his submachine gun while a fellow soldier provided covering fire. He killed one enemy soldier and captured two prisoners. Meanwhile, Technical Sergeant Kobashigawa and his comrade were fired upon by another machine gun 50 yards ahead. Directing a squad to advance to his first position, Technical Sergeant Kobashigawa again moved forward with a fellow soldier to subdue the second machine gun nest. After throwing grenades into the position, Technical Sergeant Kobashigawa provided <b>close</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>fire</b> while a fellow soldier charged, capturing four prisoners. On the alert for other machine gun nests, Technical Sergeant Kobashigawa discovered four more, and skillfully led a squad in neutralizing two of them. Technical Sergeant Kobashigawa's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.|$|E
5000|$|Outpost Harry's {{elevation}} {{was around}} 1,280 feet and positioned some 320 yards south {{of a larger}} landmass occupied by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) called [...] "Star Hill" [...] and some 425 yards northeast of United Nations Command positions. A service road that wound from the Main Line of Resistance (MLR) along an intermittent stream led {{to the rear of}} the outpost where a medical aid station and a supply point were located. Harry was an outpost east of the Chorwon Valley with sister outposts to the west called Tom and Dick. Outpost Dick was about 100 yards in front of the Main Line of Resistance, and Tom was about 250-300 yards in front and below the MLR. The latter was the floor of the valley. Harry, which was over 400 yards from the MLR, was also higher than the MLR, making supply much more difficult. The route to the outpost was under constant enemy observation and fire, and its height made it harder to pack supplies up the hill. Unlike Tom and Dick, which could get supporting fire from the MLR, Harry got less <b>close</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>fire</b> from the MLR because company 60mm mortars and the heavy machine guns did not have enough range. Harry relied more on artillery and heavy mortar companies.|$|E

The Western Task Force included the battleships , , and , plus eight cruisers, 28 destroyers, and one monitor. The Eastern Task Force included the battleships [...] and [...] and the monitor , twelve cruisers, and thirty-seven destroyers. Naval bombardment of areas behind the beach commenced at 05:45, {{while it was still}} dark, with the gunners switching to pre-assigned targets on the beach {{as soon as it was}} light enough to see, at 05:50. Since troops were scheduled to land at Utah and Omaha starting at 06:30 (an hour earlier than the British beaches), these areas received only about 40 minutes of naval bombardment before the assault troops began to land on the shore. Some of the landing craft had been modified to provide <b>close</b> <b>support</b> <b>fire,</b> and self-propelled amphibious Duplex-Drive tanks (DD tanks), specially designed for the Normandy landings, were to land shortly before the infantry to provide covering fire. However, few arrived in advance of the infantry, and many sank before reaching the shore, especially at Omaha.|$|R
5000|$|SILVER STAR FIRST LIEUTENANT ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ BALINASHEADQUARTERS 3D INFANTRY DIVISION GENERAL ORDERS # 197 - MAY 29, 1952Citation:First Lieutenant Antonio Rodriguez Balinas, # 01685780, Infantry, Company [...] "F", 65th Infantry, 3d Infantry Division, United States Army. On December 23, 1951, Company [...] "G", {{reinforced}} by the weapons platoon of Company [...] "F", attacked heavily fortified hostile positions on Hill 200, near Sangyon-Myon, Korea. Lieutenant Rodriguez Balinas, platoon leader of the weapons platoon, attached himself to the assault platoon in order to direct <b>close</b> <b>support</b> <b>fire</b> from the mortars and 57 millimeter rifles of his platoon. After the <b>supporting</b> <b>fire</b> was lifted, he joined the assault platoon in its attack on the well entrenched enemy. Firing his carbine and throwing hand grenades, he effectively destroyed one hostile position. During {{the course of this}} vicious fighting, Lieutenant Rodriguez Balinas lost his carbine but, armed with only two hand grenades, he undauntedly charged another position manned by an enemy machine gun crew. He fearlessly walked through the lethal hail of fire directly toward the hostile bunker, hurled his hand grenades and completely destroyed the position and its occupants. Although painfully wounded in this action, he refused evacuation until the last of the wounded men had been removed to safety. Lieutenant Rodriguez Balinas' outstanding gallantry and inspirational leadership were instrumental in the success of the mission and reflect the highest credit upon himself and the military service. Entered the Federal Service from Puerto Rico.|$|R

50|$|Mortars today, while {{substantially}} {{similar in}} design to the Stokes mortar, are greatly improved versions; these offer a weapon that is light, adaptable, easy to operate, and yet possesses enough accuracy and firepower to provide infantry with quality <b>close</b> <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> against soft and hard targets {{more quickly than}} any other means.|$|R
50|$|Air assault units {{can vary}} in organization; using {{helicopters}} {{not only in}} transport but also as <b>close</b> air <b>fire</b> <b>support,</b> medical evacuation helicopters and resupply missions.
