40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear rate in conical thrust bearings, which is {{responsible}} for field failures of stepper motors in optical disk drives (ODD). These bearings support the stepper motor worm shaft and consist of a steel ball supported in a polymer conical <b>bearing</b> <b>cup.</b> The tribological behaviors of polymers used in bearing application has been addressed by using Archard's wear model, a well known classical model for fretting wear in the literature. However, these studies were for planar bearing surfaces and other geometries, not for the conical geometry addressed in this study. Tests were designed and implemented to study the wear rate of the conical <b>bearing</b> <b>cups</b> at with different load levels. The tribological behavior of Delrin in conical thrust bearing applications has been characterized, by quantifying the wear factors used in the modified Archard's model. Distinct reduction of wear rate is observed due to formation of a polymer transfer film on the steel ball. The variability of the wear properties is explored through replication of the test conditions. Destructive physical analysis is conducted to gain insight into the fundamental wear mechanisms as a part of this study. The results of the wear tests are used to develop a life model of the stepper motor as a case study, to demonstrate an application of this approach. The life model is used to study the effect of variability in the initial axial bearing preload (due to manufacturing tolerances), on the wear rate and life of the stepper motor...|$|R

50|$|In the {{threadless}} headset system, the spacers {{are important}} in placing the stem and preload bolt in the correct position on the steerer tube. Thus the stack height of the stem becomes important. The steerer tube of the fork must be cut to length such that it leaves at least enough of the steerer tube protruding above the headset for the stem to clamp on to; if the steerer tube is cut longer than the stem, then spacers are used {{to fill the gap}} between the stem and the conical compression washer.

40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the {{indentation}} marks on the rollers and the cracks on the <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> were resulted during {{the impact of the}} aircraft on the port main wheel.

On the other hand, the damages seen on the roller elements of the bearing were progressive in nature and were caused over a period of time. The rollers of the bearing had failed by flaking, a form of fatigue failure. Analysis shows that the most probable reason for the premature flaking in the bearing could be excessive axial load. The failure pattern and the aircraft behaviour during take-off roll strongly support this conclusion. However, the possibility of excessive axial load on the port main wheel needs to be examined...|$|R

50|$|Tightening a {{threadless}} headset requires {{tightening the}} preload bolt (or cap bolt) in {{the cap on}} the top of the stem. This bolt is connected to a star nut driven down into the steerer tube that acts as an anchor by gripping the inside of the steerer tube with a downward force. The star nut may be replaced by a self expanding wedge in some designs. The bolt compresses the stem down onto spacers, usually aluminum, which in turn compress the headset <b>bearing</b> <b>cups.</b> The preload bolt does not hold the fork onto the bike; after the preload is set, the stem bolts must be tightened to secure the fork in place. The adjustment must be made such that there is no play in the bearings, but allow the fork to turn smoothly without binding or excessive friction.|$|R

5000|$|Many modern {{bicycles}} {{use what}} is called a [...] "cartridge" [...] bottom bracket instead. Sealed cartridge bottom brackets are normally two pieces, a unit holding the spindle and bearings that screws into the bottom bracket shell from the drive side and a support cup (often made of light alloy or plastic) that supports the spindle/bearing assembly on the non-drive side. Other designs are three piece, the spindle is separate, but the <b>bearing</b> <b>cups</b> incorporate cheaply replaceable standard cartridge bearing units. Either arrangement makes servicing the bottom bracket a simple matter of removing the old cartridge from the bottom bracket shell, and installing a new one in its place. Cartridge bottom brackets generally have seals to prevent the ingress of water and dirt. The early Shimano LP bottom brackets from the 1990s had the support cup on the drive side and used loose bearings inside; they could be dismantled and serviced much like cup and cone bearings.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psJxGx3cVR8 ...|$|R
40|$|Bearing setting has a {{significant}} impact on bearing life and system performance. A strain based load measurement technique that has been previously developed and patented will be used to measure preload in automotive drive axle pinion bearings. This technique utilizes strain gages placed in notches that have been machined into the outer diameter of a <b>bearing</b> <b>cup.</b> The performance of two gage types, semiconductor and metal foil, are compared. Preload in the pinion bearings is simulated in a machine by applying an axial load to a bearing assembly. The bearing assembly is rotated at various speeds and temperatures for each set of axial loads. Two notch geometries are compared for each set of tests conducted. An effort has been made to develop a finite element model {{that can be used to}} verify the results of the gage calibration. The results of the calibration reveal that metal foil and semiconductor gages can provide preload measurements that are accurate to within 3. 7 % and 7. 7 % of the full scale input load (73 lbs. and 155 lbs.) respectively. by Anthony H.

30|$|The {{main problem}} {{for using the}} {{framework}} oil-seal of ranging arm’s high-speed shaft is its premature failure, i.e., the failure before the service life of the framework oil-seal. The main causes of the premature failure for the framework oil-seal at the ranging arm shaft I are as follows: poor quality framework oil-seal, e.g., poor quality port, and defects; poor quality of self-tightening spring; the magnitude interference between port inner diameter and shaft I outer diameter is too small, which results in low radial pressure; and the material of framework oil-seal is not good, which results in wearing out at port. Design and machining: there are some misalignments at some positions, such as ranging arm, shaft I and bearing cup; there is a low degree of finish at shaft I that amounted with framework oil-seal; and inappropriate heat treatment, etc. Assembly: damage on the port of framework oil-seal, inclination of <b>bearing</b> <b>cup,</b> loose spring, different type of grease or different quantify of grease on oil-seal port and shaft surface. To overcome {{the problems associated with}} the framework oil-seal of ranging arm shaft I, and to increase the sealing reliability of high-speed shaft of ranging arm, the following measures were taken: select high quality framework oil-seals; maintain the machining precision of key components; checking and maintenance on oil leakage of the framework oil-seal.|$|R
5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent development, integrated headsets {{do away with}} the upper and lower <b>bearing</b> <b>cups</b> on threadless headsets and instead seat the bearings directly against the head tube of the frame. Favored sometimes for their aesthetic appeal, integrated headsets reduce the number of parts involved in the headset assembly. Prominent standards for integrated headsets include Cane Creek's [...] "IS" [...] and Campagnolo's standard, which is nameless apart from the manufacturer name. Chris King, a leading headset manufacturer, offers a vehement argument against the implementation of integrated headsets. The basis of King's argument is that headtubes with bearing [...] "seats" [...] are far from being machined with reasonable precision. The headset cartridge bearings therefore sit somewhat loosely in the headtube of the bicycle (as opposed to being press fit). During use, the bearings, under thrust loads, will rock in their seats and will easily damage the softer frame material (often aluminum, although some titanium frames are manufactured for integrated headsets). Given enough damage to the frame, there would be no choice but to replace the frame, especially if the frame is made of an aluminum alloy (titanium and steel can potentially be repaired, but usually at great cost to the consumer).King also argues that the integrated headset is largely a cost-cutting measure for many of the larger bicycle manufacturers, since integrated headsets are somewhat cheaper and take less time to install.|$|R
