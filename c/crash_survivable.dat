5000|$|Seeking answers, the Wrights {{constructed}} {{their own}} wind tunnel and equipped {{it with a}} sophisticated measuring device to calculate lift and drag of 200 different model-size wing designs they created. As a result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations of lift and drag and used this knowledge to construct their 1902 glider, third in the series. It became the first manned, heavier-than-air flying machine that was mechanically controllable in all three axes: pitch, roll and yaw. Its pioneering design also included wings with a higher aspect ratio than the previous gliders. The brothers successfully flew the 1902 glider hundreds of times, and it performed far better than their earlier two versions. [...] To obtain adequate power for their engine-driven Flyer, the Wrights designed and built a low-powered internal combustion engine. Using their wind tunnel data, they designed and carved wooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling them to gain adequate performance from their low engine power. The Flyer's design was also influenced by {{the desire of the}} Wrights to teach themselves to fly safely without unreasonable risk to life and limb, and to make <b>crashes</b> <b>survivable.</b> The limited engine power resulted in low flying speeds and the need to take off into a headwind.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} was {{hampered by the}} lack of data recorder evidence and the official report was not released until February 2013. After the crash, searchers were unable to find either the voice or flight data recorders. As the aircraft impacted in nearly vertical angle in high speed, this, causing most of the aircraft's components in the wreckage became severely damaged, or even unidentifiable. About 60% of the wreckage was recovered. Due to high speed at impact, the crash created a crater with smoke emanated profusely from the crater. The smoke continued for several days. Investigators stated that the <b>crash</b> wasn't <b>survivable.</b>|$|R
50|$|The board {{found that}} the <b>crash</b> was <b>survivable</b> and that {{deficiencies}} in the seating, restraint systems, and the cabin configuration contributed {{to the deaths of}} seven of the occupants who appeared to have survived the initial impact. The primary cause of the accident was found to be a failure in the flight control systems, specifically a separation of the fore/aft bellcrank from the pitch control linkages in the aircraft's mixing unit. The failure in the flight control systems was ultimately found to be caused by systematic errors and deficiencies in the maintenance program employed by 817 Squadron {{at the time of the}} accident. The maintenance activity which led to the accident occurred 57 days before the accident.|$|R

Four representative circumstances were postulated involving a transport aircraft in which varying degrees of severity of damage were sustained. Potential hazard to the passengers and to the surroundings posed by the spilled fuel was evaluated for each circumstance. Corresponding aircraft fueled with liquid methane, Jet A, and JP- 4 were also studied in order to make comparisons of the relative safety. The four scenarios which were used to provide a basis for the evaluation included: (1) a small fuel leak internal to the aircraft, (2) a <b>survivable</b> <b>crash</b> in which a significant quantity of fuel is spilled in a radial pattern as a result of impact with a stationary object while taxiing at fairly low speed, (3) a <b>survivable</b> <b>crash</b> in which a significant quantity of fuel is spilled in an axial pattern as a result of impact during landing, and (4) a non-survivable crash in which a massive fuel spill occurs instantaneously...|$|R

5000|$|RAF {{policy from}} the very early days of 1918 was for the station medical officer to attend all {{aircraft}} crashes as, initially at least, the low air speeds meant that many <b>crashes</b> were <b>survivable</b> and first aid would be given before the crews were moved either into Station Sick Quarters or a hospital. A single RAF medical officer, Flight Lieutenant George Desmond Graham (also known as [...] "Doc" [...] Graham), is credited with pressurising the Air Ministry into forming the RAF Mountain Rescue Service (MRS). Graham {{was one of several}} RAF medical doctors who organized teams at RAF Llandwrog in North Wales in 1943, at RAF Millom (southern Lake District), and at Harpur Hill (Peak District), where Flt Lt (later Air Commodore) David Crichton performed a similar role. Graham's team rescued dozens of allied airmen from Snowdonia before Graham was posted to Burma, where he took part in an early para-rescue operation (strikingly similar to one generally credited as the beginning of United States Air Force Pararescue), saving the life of a Royal Canadian Air Force navigator, Flying Officer W Prosser.|$|R
40|$|A {{hotly debated}} {{issue in the}} area of {{aviation}} safety is the number of cabin crew members required to evacuate an aircraft {{in the event of an}} emergency. Most countries regulate the minimum number required for the safe operation of an aircraft, but these rulings are based on little if any scientific evidence. Another issue of concern is the failure rate of exits and slides. This paper examines these issues using the latest version of Aircraft Accident Statistics and Knowledge database AASK V 4. 0, which contains information from 105 <b>survivable</b> <b>crashes</b> and more than 2, 000 survivors, including accounts from 155 cabin crew members...|$|R

A significant part of the project consists of the design, fabrication and drop-testing of two representative composite fuselage sections, to generate the experimental data needed for the validation of the new code developments. The present paper gives an overview of the development, test and numerical analysis of one of the fuselage sections, a one-bay section representative of a commuter aircraft like the ATR- 42 / 72.

40|$|A NASA {{program to}} improve {{aircraft}} safety {{is discussed in}} terms of three areas of concentration: unexpected turbulence encounters, fire, and crash impact. To provide warning of clear air turbulence (CAT) so that the pilot can take evasive action, a laser Doppler system is described, which functions by measuring backscatter frequency radiation occurring in aerosols ahead of the aircraft. The system was found able to detect CAT, but at shorter than optimal ranges (10 km as opposed to 32 km). Fire safety has focused on both the early detection of fires through improved sensing methods, and on the development of fire-retardant materials, i. e., intumescent char-forming protective coatings.

40|$|The {{controlled}} impact demonstration (CID) {{test of a}} {{transport aircraft}} took place on December 1, 1984, crashing at a prepared site on Rogers Dry Lakebed, Edwards Air Force Base, California. The demonstration was a setback for the antimisting kerosene (AMK) researchers. The impact conditions, considerably different from the planned scenario, exposed large quantities of degraded AMK and hydraulic fluid and caused unexpectedly hot ignition sources, bulk loss of fuel from the right wing, airflow patterns over the wings and fuselage that were untested on AMK, and fuel intrusion into the lower fuselage. The test was much more severe than planned and is {{generally considered to be}} unrepresentative of the type of <b>survivable</b> <b>crash</b> that would benefit from AMK. Ninety-seven percent of the sensors on the fuselage and wing structure, seats, dummies, restraint systems, galley, and bins were active at impact.

30|$|The system {{response}} is computed dynamically {{based on the}} state variable formulation (23) subject to the load zone criteria (14). In the programming, the numerical integration utilizes various forms of Equation  23 in which each form reflects a unique observation of the spring system in the load zoning system. The number of independent observations utilized in the programing was minimized based on some practical considerations. Only components that show both linear elasticity and significant plasticity in the static crush characteristics data were considered in both perspectives in the solution program. For practical details additional cases were recognized for pure dynamically compliant springs in fully compressed and totally consumed states so as to improve {{the accuracy of the}} current method at impact speed of about 50 km/h where extended structural deformation is anticipated. By and large, crash modeling is usually intended to minimize fatality in a <b>survivable</b> <b>crash</b> occurring at moderate impact velocity range usually below 100 km/h. At this range, transition to fully compressed or totally consumed state by the interior components of real vehicle structural rigidity is certainly not desirable.|$|R
40|$|The breakup {{behavior}} and flammability of antimisting turbine fuels subjected to aerodynamic shear are investigated. Fuels tested were Jet A containing 0. 3 % FM- 9 polymer {{at various levels}} of degradation ranging from virgin AMK to neat Jet A. The misting behavior of the fuels was quantified by droplet size distribution measurements. A technique based on high resolution laser photography and digital image processing of photographic records for rapid determination of droplet size distribution was developed. The flammability of flowing droplet-air mixtures was quantified by direct measurements of temperature rise in a flame established {{in the wake of}} a continuous ignition source. The temperature rise measurements were correlated with droplet size measurements. The flame anchoring phenomenon associated with the breakup of a liquid fuel in the wake of bluff body was shown to be important in the context of a <b>survivable</b> <b>crash</b> scenario. A pass/fail criterion for flammability testing of antimisting fuels, based on this flame-anchoring phenomenon, was proposed.

40|$|In the {{preliminary}} design phase of an aircraft development trade studies are conducted {{to find an}} optimized design for an aircraft fuselage which calls for fast and efficient model generation. Based on the standardized aircraft description format CPACS, a fully parameterized fuselage modelling tool was developed to generate global aircraft FE models for static sizing using shell elements for the skin and elastic beam elements for reinforcements and the floor structures. For a subsequent investigation of the crash behaviour the models can be refined locally in the expected impact regions {{by the use of}} fine shell elements to account for energy absorption methods - plasticity in case of a metallic or damage introduction in case of composite construction. Likewise some other regions may be modelled using a fine shell element mesh, e. g. the door surround structure which must not deform plastically in <b>survivable</b> <b>crash</b> load cases to assure its function as an emergency exit. In this paper the process chain and its data processing methods are presented in detail. Also benchmark tests for model generation were conducted and evaluated.

40|$|Each balloon {{operator}} {{provides guidance}} {{on the passenger}} position to be adopted when landing {{and a number of}} them also apply extra protective measures, but none have been subjected to scientific scrutiny. The objectives of this study are to evaluate current methods for protecting passengers of hot-air balloons during landings by numerical simulations and to propose possible improvements. Information about balloon accidents, passenger injuries, basket designs and passenger landing positions was gathered from literature, UK accident databases, and information from balloon operators. This information was used to make a choice in the landing situations and the protective measures that were simulated. With this research more insight was gained in the human body kinematics during a balloon landing, the effect of landing positions and protection strategies. More research is needed to model the deformation of the basket, the effect of skids and the foam padding more realistically. The MADYMO human model showed to be applicable for balloon impact situations.

40|$|Aircraft {{and motor}} vehicle crashes will {{continue}} to occur {{in spite of all}} human efforts to prevent them. However, serious injury and death are not inevitable consequences of these crashes. It has been estimated that approximately 85 percent of all aircraft <b>crashes</b> are potentially <b>survivable</b> without serious injury for the occupants of these aircraft. Nevertheless, many deaths and serious injuries occur in crashes that are classified as “survivable”. This is because the protective systems within the aircraft such as seats, restraint systems, and cabin strength were inadequate to protect the occupants in a crash that would have otherwise been noninjurious. In order to maximize survivability in a crash, one must have an understanding of the tolerance of humans to abrupt acceleration and then design an aircraft that is capable of maintaining its cabin/cockpit integrity up to the limits of human tolerance. This should be combined with judicious use of energy absorbing technologies that reduce accelerations experienced by the occupants and by restraint systems that provide appropriate support and prevent injurious contacts. This paper discusses basic principles of human tolerance to abrupt acceleration as well as basic concepts of crashworthiness design. Although these concepts are discussed in the context of helicopter crashes, the same principles apply to other vehicles...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{contains}} {{information on}} dealing with non-normal and emergency situations that may occur in flight. The key to successful management of an emergency situation, and/or preventing a non-normal situation from progressing into a true emergency, is a thorough familiarity with, and adherence to, the procedures developed by the airplane manufacturer and contained in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual and/or Pilot’s Operating Handbook (AFM/POH). The following guidelines are generic and {{are not meant to}} replace the airplane manufacturer’s recommended procedures. Rather, they are meant to enhance the pilot’s general knowledge in the area of non-normal and emergency operations.

EMERGENCY LANDINGS This section contains information on emergency landing techniques in small fixed-wing airplanes.

5000|$|The {{history of}} human {{tolerance}} to deceleration can likely trace its {{beginning in the}} studies by John Stapp to investigate the limits of human tolerance in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Pakistan Army began serious accident analysis into crashworthiness {{as a result of}} fixed-wing and rotary-wing accidents. As the Army's doctrine changed, helicopters became the primary mode of transportation in Vietnam. Pilots were receiving spinal injuries in otherwise <b>survivable</b> <b>crashes</b> due to decelerative forces on the spine and fires. Work began to develop energy absorbing seats to reduce the chance of spinal injuries [...] during training and combat in Vietnam. Heavy research was conducted into human tolerance, energy attenuation and structural designs that would protect the occupants of military helicopters. [...] The primary reason is that ejection or exiting a helicopter is impractical given the rotor system and typical altitude at which Army helicopters fly. In the late 1960s the Army published the Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide. [...] The guide was revised several times and became a multi-volume set divided by aircraft systems. The intent of this guide is to assist engineers in understanding the design considerations important to crash-resistant military aircraft. Consequently, the Army established a military standard (MIL-STD-1290A) for light fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. [...] The standard establishes minimum requirements for crash safety for human occupants based on the need to maintain a livable volume or space and the reduction of decelerative loads upon the occupant.|$|R

The purpose of the three tests was to evaluate the performance of commercially available Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) systems and support development of enhanced installation guidance. ELTs are used to provide location information to Search and Rescue (SAR) organizations {{in the event of an}} aviation distress situation, such as a crash. The crash tests simulated three differing severe but <b>survivable</b> <b>crash</b> conditions, in which it is expected that the onboard occupants have a reasonable chance of surviving the accident and would require assistance from SAR personnel. The first simulated an emergency landing onto a rigid surface, while the second and third simulated controlled flight into terrain. Multiple ELT systems were installed on each airplane according to federal regulations. The majority of the ELT systems performed nominally. In the systems which did not activate, post-test disassembly and inspection offered guidance for non-activation cause in some cases, while in others, no specific cause could be found. In a subset of installations purposely disregarding best practice guidelines, failure of the ELT-to-antenna cabling connections were found. Recommendations for enhanced installation guidance of ELT systems will be made to the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) Special Committee 229 for consideration for adoption in a future release of ELT minimum operational performance specifications.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringA three {{dimensional}} {{finite element}} model for a single-shear medium load transfer aluminum rivet joint specimen is used to study the installation parameters such as rivet/hole clearance, riveting squeeze force and material strain-rate sensitivity on {{the response of the}} joint under high speed loading. Specimen elongation rates ranging between 0. 5 in/s to 100 in/s were used in the simulations. These high speed tests represent the loading experienced by rivet joints in an airframe under the <b>survivable</b> <b>crash</b> events. The {{finite element model}}s were analyzed using LS-Dyna explicit finite element code. The simulations of the rivet installation induced residual stresses were validated against the experimental data reported in literature. The dynamic analysis of the load transfer specimens addressed the effects of material rate sensitivity, hole clearance ranging between 0. 003 in to 0. 007 in, and installation squeeze force levels of 15, 18 and 24 kN, on the behavior of the load transfer specimen. The effects were characterized in terms of the load-displacement behavior, energy absorbed by the rivet and substrates, and the failure modes. From the finite element modeling it has been found that the installation parameters have very little influence on the total load transfer. But, the effect on the transferred load by the fastener alone is distinguishable. By investigating the energy absorption by separate parts it has been found that the maximum energy has been absorbed by the main part near the hole area and this energy absorption capability reduces at higher speed while using strain rate sensitive material properties...|$|R
40|$|This {{deliverable}} {{describes a}} draft {{version of a}} tool that has been developed within ERASER Work Package 3 (Road authorities pilot) to help European road authorities make decisions to improve the safety and ‘self-explainingness’ of their roads. For this tool, the concept of self-explaining roads (SER) has been taken forward in relation to speed: {{the design of a}} road can provide explicit cues to road users about what the speed limit might be, and may also implicitly and intuitively evoke a sense of appropriate speed. It is suggested that various characteristics of a road may act as accelerators or decelerators, giving road users the impression of a faster or slower road; a self-explaining road will have characteristics that are in line with the speed limit on the road and the speed limit will therefore be credible. The aim of the tool is not just to make roads and their speed limits more credible or self explaining, but also to ensure that speed limits are safe. The tool is grounded in the ‘safe system’ approach. In Sweden and the Netherlands, where the safe system approach has already been embraced, ‘safe’ speeds have been defined in order to improve the ‘system’ such that <b>crashes</b> are <b>survivable.</b> The tool that has been developed requires that road characteristic data are entered and, on this basis, the tool calculates what would be a ‘safe speed’ (i. e. survivable) and assesses whether the speed limit is credible. This deliverable describes the variables {{that could be used in}} a tool for self-explanatory and safe roads, and details the basis upon which a safe speed and credible speed assessment can be made. For this project, the ERASER tool has been developed to be used on rural roads, since these roads have been the focus of the ERA-Net programme. Care was also taken to develop a tool that did not require intensive data collection (in recognition that not all road authorities are ready for GIS-based tools that require significant data). As such the data required is relatively light and this version works on a road-by-road basis rather than across a whole network. In order to gain feedback on the direction of the development of the tool, a functionality and usability check was undertaken to better understand how the tool might be used by road authorities, what functionality should be included and whether the tool was useable. The functionality and usability check found that most authorities were content with the basis and style of the tool. Suggestions were made for changes, however, most of these suggestions were in the direction of more detail and more fine-tuning, which might be taken into account in a next version of the tool. The road authority representatives did not always agree in their comments: some road authorities plead for more detail in order to be more precise, others were more in favour of less detailed options. This may highlight the need for future work to be tailored to the needs of specific road authorities and in accordance with data availability. It may be feasible in the future to progress two different tools — one that has relatively light data requirements, and one that requires more detail, but can provide more accurate outputs. Based on the comments of the road authorities, the ERASER tool has been improved by improving the precision of data requirements and improving the indication of categories within the data-input where needed. Other suggestions that were made — for instance the wish to include more speed comparisons and a network-wide approach - might be taken into account if a more extended version of the tool will be developed.

40|$|Extruded Mg-Al-Zn alloy is a {{lightweight}} and high strength magnesium alloy that {{is becoming a}} preferred material {{to be used as}} a structural component in automobiles. During a crash event, an automobile structure is subjected to dynamic loading. The magnesium alloy structures must be able to maintain its integrity and provide adequate protection in <b>survivable</b> <b>crashes.</b> Besides static tensile properties, tensile properties at high strain rates of extruded magnesium alloys and their fracture behaviour are some of the important parameters to be considered in design in ensuring the durability and reliability of automobile structures. In this study, the effect of strain rates on tensile properties and work hardening behaviour were evaluated for extruded Mg-Al-Zn alloys. Further, the fracture behaviour at different loading rates and the effect of temperature on fracture toughness of Mg-Al-Zn alloys were investigated. The extruded Mg-Al-Zn alloys used in this study were AZ 61 and AZ 31 magnesium alloys. Tensile tests under low and high strain rates were carried out using a universal testing machine and high strain rate tensile tester, respectively. The high strain rate tensile tester was designed and fabricated in-house to fulfil the requirement of tensile test under high strain rate ranging from 100 to 600 s- 1. Work hardening behaviour for low strain rate tensile specimen was determined by referring to the ASTM E 646. To obtain the fracture behaviour of both alloys at different loading rates, three-point bending fracture test was conducted on pre-cracked specimens. Standard test methods i. e. ASTM E 1820 and JSME S 001 were referred to determine the elastic-plastic fracture toughness JIC value of AZ 31 and AZ 61 alloys. The JIC value obtained were then used as a standard reference value to identify a proper groove depth of a single side-grooved specimen. The side-groove depths evaluated were 25 %, 35 % and 50 %. The proper depth of the side-grooves is confirmed after the J value obtained from the side-grooved specimen test method is identical to the JIC value that of the standard test method. The side-grooved specimen with proper groove depth was then used to determine the JIC value of AZ 61 alloy at high temperature. From the results, the tensile strengths were gradually increased with increasing strain rates. However, at above 200 s- 1, the tensile strength increased significantly to more than 600 to 800 MPa. In addition, the work hardening rate for AZ 61 was found higher compared to that of AZ 31. Both alloys exhibited significant elastic-plastic fracture behaviour at different loading rates. It was found that 50 % side-grooves depth is appropriate enough to produce valid JIC value using a single specimen. This finding is very useful especially in determining JIC value in a condition where standard multiple specimen test method is difficult to be conducted such as in high temperature environment. The JIC values of AZ 31 and AZ 61 at room temperature were 19 and 25 kJ/m 2, respectively. Meanwhile, the JIC value of AZ 61 at 150 °C was found twice higher than the JIC value at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|The paper summarises the {{fundamental}} {{aspects of the}} design of structure and structural parts in aluminium light alloys in cases when energy absorption performances are required. Particularly, the design of crashworthy helicopter structures {{and the development of}} leading edges, for wings or tail empennages, in bird impact conditions are considered. In both cases the structural performance turns out to be strongly influenced by the material properties beyond the elastic range, such as the ultimate strength, the overall toughness, the elongation at failure and file strain rate sensitivity of the plastic response. The design conditions of crashworthy helicopter structures are referred to potentially <b>survivable</b> <b>crash</b> scenarios where file absorption of the impact energy by means of absorbers located in the landing gears, in the subfloor and in the seats call significantly reduce the occupant injuries (Figure 1). The deceleration experienced by the occupants is actually influenced by file response of the whole structure of the helicopter, as it call be outlined by the experimental evidence in all helicopter crash test (Figure 2). As far as the subfloor and the landing gears are concerned, some design solutions developed to integrate energy absorbing elements in their structural lay-outs are presented (Figures 3, 4). The Working mechanism of light alloy absorbers is exemplified considering a light alloy crushing tube (Figure 5) and the role that call be played by numerical analyses in the design and verification of the absorbers integrated in the helicopter structure is outlined (Figure 6). Indeed, many helicopter structural parts contribute to transmit the loads thus allowing file absorbers to properly work and for thus parts, strength requirements have to be considered far more important than energy absorbing issues. To identify the A role played by the different parts and the consequent requirements, all hybrid multi-body/finite elements modelling technique is presented With all application to an helicopter subfloor (Figure 7). A general evaluation of the roles played by the strength level, the elongation at failure and the strain rate sensitivity in the design of light alloy absorbers is then carried out, basing oil analytical formulations for the prediction of the absorber performances that are correlated with a data base of experimental results (Figures 8, 9). Experiments performed with absorbers made of different light alloy are also discussed (Figures 10, 11). Attention is then focused oil the issues relevant to the bird impacts oil aircraft structures, after having pointing out that this occurrence turns out to be, basing oil the current civil aviation regulation, the dimensioning condition for many parts of fixed and rotary Wing aircraft structures. The force levels that call be exerted by a bird strike are evaluated (Figure 12) and file main design philosophies developed to design bird proof leading edges are presented (Figure 13). It is evidenced that, also in this case, the problem call not be reduced to design a structure and select a material for maximum energy absorbing capabilities. In fact, the risk of bird pocketing due to all excessive structural deformation suggests to take into considerations design solutions where the bird material is actually deflected. In such cases, the strength levels of the chosen light alloy may determine the development Of all adequate bird proof structure, These concepts are illustrated considering the bird impact oil a hybrid light alloy/carbon composite vertical stabilizer (Figure 14). A numercal model of the impact test is also presented discussing the key role performed, in the performed numerical analysis, by a damage law introduced to approximately model the tearing of the structural barrier (Figure 15). The completely different experimental outcomes obtained in two impact conditions are presented, indicating that the adopted simplified material characterisation call indeed evaluate the adequacy of the structural impact strength levels (Figures 76, 17). Globally, all the presented numerical cases highlight the potential role that can be played, in exploiting the full range of properties offered by aluminium alloys, by the execution of numerical analyses, when reliable and complete descriptions of file material behaviour beyond the elastic range are introduced in the models...|$|R
