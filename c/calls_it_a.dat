5|$|Perhaps no {{work of art}} so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> metrical romance; he might have called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E
5|$|Mania {{initially}} expressed skepticism of the show's {{combination of}} gothic lolita, dolls, magic, and comedy but later <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> successful experiment and praised the character interactions and the dolls' designs. In their Rozen Maiden: Träumend review, Mania praised the visuals and characters but criticized the unbalanced comic and dark comments {{and described the}} revelations and finale as rushed. Anime News Network's review of Rozen Maiden: Träumend were mostly negative and addressed several points: the failed attempts at serious drama which were considered cliché and resulted in cheesy and melodramatic dialogue; the recycled background music; and the ending which was described as inconclusive and slapdash.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E

He points out the nuclear deal would yield such benefits for Iran and that is why it is in the interests of its citizens to succeed.|$|E
25|$|Alan W. Pollack also {{interprets the}} chord as a {{surrogate}} dominant, the G being an anticipation that resolves on the G major chord that opens the verse.

25|$|Gandhi's first {{action as}} Prime Minister was passing the anti-defection law in January 1985. According to this law, an elected Member of Parliament or {{legislative}} assembly could not join an opposition party {{until the next}} election. Historian Manish Telikicherla Chary <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> measure of curbing corruption and bribery of ministers by switching parties so they could gain majority. Many such defections occurred during the 1980s as elected leaders of the Congress party joined opposition parties.|$|E

Arkitekturang Filipino, a collaboration of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the United Architects of the Philippines, <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "clear {{example of his}} distinct architecture", and notes its resemblance to the Nicanor Abelardo Hall at the Cultural Center of the Philippines.

500|$|The Times Higher Education listed Requiem for a Species as [...] "Book of the week" [...] for 3 June 2010. Steven Yearley's review <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "provocative and sobering book". He {{says the}} heart of the book are the many {{explanations}} that Hamilton puts forward for the everyday, regular denial of the danger of changing climate. Yearley says this is also the most frustrating aspect of Requiem for a Species, because Hamilton proposes so many different explanations but does not make their relative significance clear.|$|E
500|$|However, by mid-1968 [...] "Who Do You Love" [...] {{took on a}} {{different}} arrangement. [...] Unterberger <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "template upon which to hang long instrumental guitar improvisations, [...] the tempo and the melody of the original tune all but disappearing". [...] A 25-minute live adaptation was included on Quicksilver's second album, Happy Trails, that was edited from 1968 recordings at the Fillmore East and/or Fillmore West. [...] The group performs it as a six-part suite that [...] "weave into and {{back out of the}} main theme", with sections allow for instrumental exploration by the individual band members.|$|E

500|$|Although sources {{describe}} the annex as eight storeys, the nomination <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "six story International Style addition". It is noted for banded windows and simple exterior. By {{the time of}} the nomination several showcase windows had been altered. According to the City of Los Angeles Office of Economic Development, the annex used [...] "Streamline Moderne Style, characterized by the absence of ornamentation and an emphasis on smooth wall surfaces, rounded corners, flat roofs and linear elements that give a horizontal emphasis." [...] The unifying exterior element between the original structure and its annex are the ground level colonnades.|$|E
500|$|This {{trend of}} mixing genres {{continued}} and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film [...] "does {{not belong to}} any genre". Ethan has described it as [...] "a buddy movie for the '90s". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro {{referred to it as}} a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> Künstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the movie as [...] "a retro-surrealist vision".|$|E
500|$|Many of Angelou's poems {{focus on}} racial {{subjects}} and themes. They continue {{the themes of}} mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies, and inject hope through humor. In [...] "Ain't That Bad?", she uses the Black English vernacular word [...] "bad" [...] to connote positive connections with Black culture, mores, customs, and leaders, and to help build Black pride. Scholar Lyman B. Hagen <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "shouting poem" [...] due to its short lines and repetition. [...] In [...] "Lady Luncheon Club", Angelou humorously describes an overly intellectual speaker at a woman's club.|$|E

500|$|Belenggu uses ellipses and {{internal}} monologues heavily {{to represent the}} main characters' turmoil; the Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "three-pronged interior monologue", noting that the novel has minimal use of descriptive passages and dialogue. Unlike works published by Balai Pustaka, Belenggu does not provide full exposition; instead, it only explicitly states key points and leaves the rest for the reader to interpret, thus inviting more active participation. Siregar notes that the characters are introduced one at a time, {{almost as if the}} novel were a film; he writes that, as a result, at times the transition between characters is unclear.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} is over, Patchy claims {{he took some}} time off, but Potty then tells the viewers that Patchy {{actually}} got fired, and Patchy gets back at Potty by saying that he got fired too, which is also true (but Potty also got a golden parachute). Patchy then says that they cannot replace him, but Potty tells him that they already did. When Patchy finds out that he's {{been replaced by a}} gorilla, he <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "smelly, hairy fleabag", to which the gorilla fiercely responds to by throwing patties at Patchy. The narrator then tell the Viewers to always follow your dreams (unless you're Patchy), and then the episode ends.|$|E

Moe's Tavern, renamed [...] "Flaming Moe's", soon becomes one of the trendiest nightspots in Springfield and Aerosmith's new hangout. Homer becomes angry with Moe and vows never {{to return to the}} tavern.
