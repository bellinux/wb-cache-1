This, {{in combination with the}} reduced damping and the outstanding slenderness of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges,</b> renders a unique dynamic response. A complete review on the state of knowledge about the seismic behaviour of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> is presented here, with special attention to the analysis techniques.

40|$|The model tuning through {{sensitivity}} analysis is a prominent procedure {{to assess the}} structural behavior and dynamic characteristics of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges.</b> Most of the previous sensitivity-based model tuning methods are automatic iterative processes; however, the results of recent {{studies show that the}} most reasonable results are achievable by applying the manual methods to update the analytical model of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges.</b> This paper presents a model updating algorithm for highly redundant <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> that can be used as an iterative manual procedure. The updating parameters are selected through the {{sensitivity analysis}} which helps to better understand the structural behavior of the bridge. The finite element model of Tatara Bridge is considered for the numerical studies. The results of the simulations indicate the efficiency and applicability of the presented manual tuning method for updating the finite element model of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges.</b> The new aspects regarding effective material and structural parameters and model tuning procedure presented in this paper will be useful for analyzing and model updating of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Albert Bridge is a {{road bridge}} over the River Thames in West London, {{connecting}} Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank. Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish–Lefeuvre system modified <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{it proved to be}} structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{project cost}} NOK 910 million, of which NOK 513 {{was for the}} pontoon bridge, NOK 81 million was for the <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridge,</b> NOK 25 million {{was used for the}} waterway, NOK 115 million was used on planning, and NOK 176 million was used on {{auxiliary}} roads and the tunnel. The bridge was financed with NOK 41 million in state grants, NOK 139 million from tolls paid in advance, and NOK 730 million in debt which would be repaid by the tolls.

40|$|<b>Cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> {{are highly}} statically redundant, light and {{flexible}} structures. This complexity highlights {{the role of}} the structural system identification (SSI) method in the calibration of the actual properties of the simplified models of these structures.

The effects of the inclination and inertia of the stay cables and the existence of pylon and deck cracking in the observability of different <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> are studied.

5|$|Prior to {{the current}} bridge, four other bridges have spanned the Indian River Inlet, opened in 1934, 1940, 1952, and 1965, the latter widened by an {{additional}} span added in 1976. All were known informally as the Indian River Inlet Bridge, and all but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge. The 1965 bridge, a steel girder bridge, was subject to scouring from the inlet, leading {{to the need to}} replace it. Initial plans for a tied-arch bridge over the inlet in 2004 were over budget, and 2006 plans for a 1,400-foot (427-meter) <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridge</b> were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems. Construction of the current, 2,600-foot (792-meter) bridge began in 2008 as part of a design-build project, with Skanska awarded the contract to build the bridge. The current Indian River Inlet Bridge opened partially in January 2012 and completely in May 2012 at a cost of $150 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the pontoon bridge was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the high-strength low-alloy steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used to fasten the pontoon bridge to the <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridge,</b> came adrift during transport in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E

40|$|For {{practical}} purpose, buffeting {{response of}} <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> to wind excitation is usually analytically determined by single-mode-based method, {{and the resultant}} response is written as {{the composition of the}} resonant component and the background component by the square root of sum squares (SRSS) method. The background component is sometimes neglected for simplifying computations. In the present paper, numerical computations on four representative <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> in China indicate that the background component usually has a significant contribution to the buffeting response of long-span <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges.</b> Parametric studies on the effects of structural parameters on the buffeting background components for these four bridges are also performed. A simplified method introduced in literatures for estimation of the background component of buffeting response is then briefly discussed. Finally an approximate method for estimating the first vertical bending mode-buffeting response of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> is proposed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A long-span <b>cable-stayed</b> arch <b>bridge</b> is a {{new form}} of bridge {{structure}} that combines features of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> with characteristics of arch bridges. In the present study, we derived a practical calculation method for the lateral destabilization critical loading of <b>cable-stayed</b> arch <b>bridges</b> during the construction process based the energy principle. The validity of the method was verified with an example. The calculation method provides a quick and efficient way to evaluate the lateral stability of a <b>cable-stayed</b> arch <b>bridge</b> and a concrete filled steel tubular arch bridge during the construction process...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> {{have been}} {{developing}} {{rapidly in the}} last decade and have {{become one of the most}} popular types of long-span bridges. One of the important issues in the design and analysis of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> is determining the pre-Tensioning cable forces that optimize the structural performance of the bridge. Appropriate pre-Tensioning cable forces improve the damaging effect of unbalanced loading due to the deck dead load. Because the cable-stayed structure is a highly undetermined system, there is no unique solution for directly calculating the initial cable forces. Numerous studies have been conducted on the specification of cable pre-Tensioning forces for <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges.</b> However, most of the proposed methods are limited in their ability to optimize the structural performance. This paper presents an effective multi-constraint optimization strategy for <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> based on the application of an inverse problem through unit load method (ULM). The proposed method results in less stresses in the bridge members, more stability and a shorter simulation time than the existing approaches. The finite element (FE) model of the Tatara Bridge in Japan is considered in this study. The results show that the proposed method successfully restricts the pylon displacement and establishes a uniform deck moment distribution in the simulated cable-stayed bridge; thus, it might be a useful tool for designing other long-span <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges...</b>|$|R

40|$|The rapid bloom of <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> {{has been}} propitiated by the {{development}} of erection techniques and improvements of construction materials. Nevertheless, the economic boom of the last decade has deflected attention from economic cost to iconic aesthetical appearance increasing significantly designer’s freedom. This structural freedom has enabled the proliferation of a number of non-symmetric <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges.</b> Despite of the number of built examples, the analysis of non-symmetrical <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> has not received considerable attention from the researchers. In fact, the effects of the main design parameters in the structural behavior of these bridges are not addressed in detail in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper studies the structural response of a number of non-symmetrical <b>cable-stayed</b> <b>bridges.</b> With this aim, a parametric analysis is performed to evaluate the effect of each of the main design parameters (the ratio between the main and the back span length, the pylon, the deck and backstay stiffnesses, the pylon inclination, and the stay configuration) of this kind of bridges. Furthermore, the role of the geometrical nonlinearity and the steel consumption in stays are evaluated. Postprint (published version...|$|R
