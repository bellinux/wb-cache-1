5|$|The Buffalo nickel or Indian Head nickel is a <b>copper-nickel</b> five-cent {{piece that}} {{was struck by}} the United States Mint from 1913 to 1938. It was {{designed}} by sculptor James Earle Fraser.|$|E
5|$|The Coinage Act of 1864 {{passed into}} law on April 22 of that year. After {{entering}} circulation several months later, the bronze cent and two-cent piece circulated in trade without being hoarded. The bronze alloy {{was easier to}} strike than the <b>copper-nickel</b> one, allowing details to be brought forth sharply and extending the life of coinage dies.|$|E
5|$|Industrialist Joseph Wharton had a near-monopoly on {{the mining}} of nickel in the United States, {{and sought to}} promote its use in coinage. He was also highly {{influential}} in Congress. His friends there, though they had failed to obtain the metal's use for the two-cent piece, had been more successful with the base-metal three-cent coin. Pollock prepared a bill authorizing a five-cent coin of the same alloy as the three-cent piece, with a total weight not to exceed 60 grains (3.9 g). At the committee stage in the House of Representatives, the weight was amended to , ostensibly to make the weight equal to five grams in the metric system but more likely so that Wharton could sell more nickel. This made the new coin heavy, in terms of weight per $.01 of face value, compared to the three-cent <b>copper-nickel</b> coin. The bill passed without debate on May 16, 1866. The new <b>copper-nickel</b> coin was legal tender for up to one dollar and would be paid out by the Treasury in exchange for coin of the United States, excluding the half cent, cent and two-cent. It was redeemable in lots of $100 for banknotes. Fractional currency in denominations of less than ten cents was withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|In seawater, the alloys have {{excellent}} corrosion rates which remain low {{as long as}} the maximum design flow velocity is not exceeded. This velocity depends on geometry and pipe diameter. They have high resistance to crevice corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement that can be troublesome to other alloy systems. <b>Copper-nickels</b> naturally form a thin protective surface layer over the first several weeks of exposure to seawater and this provides its ongoing resistance. Additionally, they have a high inherent biofouling resistance to attachment by macrofoulers (e.g. seagrasses and molluscs) living in the seawater. To use this property to its full potential, the alloy needs to be free of the effects of, or insulated from, any form of cathodic protection.|$|R
2500|$|Extensive {{worldwide}} {{tests have}} proved that uncoated copper and copper alloys (e.g., brass, bronze, copper nickel, copper-nickel-zinc) have strong intrinsic antimicrobial properties with efficacies against {{a wide range}} of disease-resistant bacteria, molds, fungi and viruses. After years of testing, the U.S. approved the registration of over 300 different copper alloys (copper, brasses, bronzes, <b>copper-nickels,</b> and nickel-silvers) as antimicrobial materials. These developments are creating markets for antimicrobial copper and copper alloys in interior architecture. To meet the design needs for building surfaces, structures, fixtures, and components, antimicrobial copper-based products are available in {{a wide range of}} colors, finishes, and mechanical properties. Copper handrails, counter tops, hallways, doors, push plates, kitchens, and bathrooms are just some of the antimicrobial products approved for hospitals, airports, offices, schools, and army barracks to kill harmful bacteria. [...] See: a list of products approved in the U.S.|$|R
40|$|Seawater is an {{aggressive}} environment for materials particularly in warmer and polluted waters. In this environment, steel infrastructure, such as offshore platforms, pipelines, and tanks may corrode quickly, and for engineering and management purposes, {{the rate at}} which this occurs is of interest. Here, recently developed understanding of the corrosion processes over extended exposure periods is reviewed and recently developed science-based mathematical models for the prediction of corrosion and pitting of structural steels are described. The effect of various influencing factors is reviewed, including that of seawater quality and the effect of microorganisms on corrosion. Also, short discussions of the corrosion of stainless steels, aluminum, and <b>copper-nickels,</b> all materials that are used under marine exposure conditions, are given. This is followed by a description of recent observations of the corrosion of steel reinforcing bars in reinforced concrete, another widely used construction material in marine environments. It shows that reinforced concrete can be a highly successful construction material, even in long term and under marine conditions, but that severe loss of reinforcement may occur without obvious external signs detectable by visual inspection...|$|R
5|$|One {{proposal}} {{to revive the}} three-cent piece was made in 1911, when Mayors Brand Whitlock of Toledo, Ohio, and Newton D. Baker of Cleveland sent a joint memorial to Congress urging its return. The following year, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures held a hearing on bills to authorize a <b>copper-nickel</b> three-cent piece and to change {{the composition of the}} cent to <b>copper-nickel.</b> Mint Director George E. Roberts testified and indicated he had no objection to a three-cent piece, as there was at least limited demand for a coin larger than the cent and smaller than the nickel. In 1936, a bill for a three-cent nickel was among various coin legislation considered by the Senate Banking Committee. In 1942, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary the temporary authority to change the composition of the nickel because of wartime metal shortages, and if public demand for the five-cent piece required it, the Mint could strike three-cent pieces. Nothing came of any of the proposals. The three-cent piece was made fully legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965, which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to any amount for payment of public and private debt. By then, that coin had long since passed from the scene.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in <b>copper-nickel</b> the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{small change}} {{was made to}} the design to add the {{initials}} of the designer (FS) to the obverse, underneath Jefferson's portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with the initials were struck and presented to him. Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks, which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with <b>copper-nickel.</b> Beginning in 1968, mint marks were again used, and on the nickel were moved to {{the lower part of}} the obverse, to the right of Jefferson's bust. From 1971, no nickels were struck for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878.|$|E
5|$|Nickel, {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now had {{no place}} in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, who sought its return. Although Pollock {{made no mention of}} further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The <b>copper-nickel</b> cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel would be even more difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{alternatives}} to the difficult-to-work <b>copper-nickel</b> alloy, in June 1867 Longacre proposed that the five-cent piece be struck in aluminum. The new Mint director, Henry Linderman, objected to the proposal, stating that the price and supply of aluminum were as yet uncertain, and that the metal was too expensive to use in a minor coin. Numismatic historian Don Taxay, in his history of the United States Mint and its coins, noted that Linderman had proposed legislation increasing the proportion of nickel in the alloy to a third despite having earlier opposed the use of nickel in coins. Taxay suggested that Linderman was most likely influenced by Wharton and the metal's other advocates.|$|E
5|$|Silver half dimes {{had been}} struck {{from the early days}} of the United States Mint in the late 18th century. Those {{disappeared}} from circulation, along with most other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. In 1864, the Mint successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value. Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant financial interests. When the Mint proposed a <b>copper-nickel</b> five-cent piece, Congress required that the coin be heavier than the Mint had suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and {{there are very few}} rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the <b>copper-nickel</b> sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} silver are the ores of copper, <b>copper-nickel,</b> lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia. Peru, Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, {{and are still}} major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristóbal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico). Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (Bolivia), and Hackett River (Canada). In Central Asia, Tajikistan {{is known to have}} some of the largest silver deposits in the world.|$|E
5|$|Within Earth's crust, osmium, like iridium, {{is found}} at highest {{concentrations}} in {{three types of}} geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked {{from one of the}} former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, though the large <b>copper–nickel</b> deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of osmium. Smaller reserves {{can be found in the}} United States. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals. The second large alluvial deposit was found in the Ural Mountains, Russia, which is still mined.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the hoarded Flying Eagle cents re-entered circulation. Many {{remained}} there {{only a few}} years, being pulled out from among the new bronze cents in Treasury Department redemption programs in the 1860s and 1870s—thirteen million <b>copper-nickel</b> cents were retired by exchange for other base-metal coinage. By the 1880s, it was a rarity in circulation. The 2018 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1857, 1858 large letters, and 1858 small letters each at $30 in G-4 Good condition, the next to lowest collectable grade (AG-3). The 1856 is $6,500 in that grade, rising to $20,000 in uncirculated MS-63. The 1858/7 starts at $75 in G-4, rising to $11,000 in MS-63. An 1856 cent in MS-66 condition sold at auction in January 2004 for $172,500.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, {{the second}} year of the Civil War, government-issued coinage began {{vanishing}} from circulation. American citizens hoarded all coins with gold and silver, and eventually began hoarding <b>copper-nickel</b> cents as well. This made it extremely difficult for businesses to conduct transactions. In response, many merchants turned to private minters to fill the void left by the hoarded coins. The first of these privately minted tokens appeared in the autumn of 1862, by H. A. Ratterman, in Cincinnati, Ohio. New York issues followed in the spring of 1863, first with Lindenmueller currency store card tokens issued by New York City barkeep Gustavus Lindenmueller and then with Knickerbocker currency patriotic tokens issued by William H. Bridgens. It is estimated that by 1864, there were 25,000,000 Civil War tokens (nearly all redeemable for one cent) in circulation, consisting of approximately 7,000–8,000 varieties.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the Mint {{had begun}} to strike <b>copper-nickel</b> clad coins instead of silver, due to rises in bullion prices. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, and none, initially, were minted in the new metal. Beginning in 1969, legislators sought to {{reintroduce}} a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died in March of that year, {{there were a number}} of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President Richard Nixon, who had served as vice president under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing the new coin on December 31, 1970.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War caused most American coins {{to vanish}} from circulation, with the gap filled by such means as {{merchant}} tokens, encased postage stamps, and United States fractional currency, issued in denomination {{as low as}} three cents. Although specie (gold or silver coins) was hoarded or exported, the <b>copper-nickel</b> cent, then the only base metal denomination being struck, also vanished. In 1864, Congress began the process of restoring coins to circulation by abolishing the three-cent note and authorizing bronze cents and two-cent pieces, with low intrinsic values, to be struck. These new coins initially proved popular, though the two-cent piece soon faded from circulation. On March 3, 1865, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Mint to strike three-cent pieces of 75%copper and 25%nickel.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{had trouble}} {{striking}} the new design. This {{was due to}} the hard <b>copper-nickel</b> alloy {{and the fact that the}} eagle on one side of the piece was directly opposite parts of the reverse design; efforts to bring out the design more fully led to increased die breakage. Many Flying Eagle cents show weaknesses, especially at the eagle's head and tail, which are opposite the wreath. In 1857, Snowden suggested the replacement of the eagle with a head of Christopher Columbus. Longacre replied that as there had been objections to proposals to place George Washington on the coinage, there would also be opposition to a Columbus design. Despite the difficulties, the 17,450,000 Flying Eagle cents struck at Philadelphia in 1857 constituted the greatest production of a single coin in a year at a U.S. mint to that time.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of nickel}} (as a natural {{meteoric}} nickel–iron alloy) has been traced {{as far back}} as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), that personified the fact that <b>copper-nickel</b> ores resisted refinement into copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite, which often contains 1–2% nickel. Nickel's other important ore minerals include garnierite, and pentlandite. Major production sites include the Sudbury region in Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, and Norilsk in Russia.|$|E
5|$|After her obverse {{design was}} approved, Goodacre visited the Philadelphia Mint {{engraving}} department {{six times in}} order to finalize the designs. Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his original proposal, mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval. The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of manganese brass (containing about 77% copper, 12% zinc, 7% manganese, and 4% nickel) over a pure copper core. This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being electromagnetically identical to its predecessor, the <b>copper-nickel</b> Susan B. Anthony dollar. The first official striking of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of the coins. Because the coins were struck before 2000, it was not legal to release them during the first strike ceremonies. Instead, the coins were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them. Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, YouTube {{launched}} its Partner Program, a {{system based on}} AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site. YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.

5|$|The first {{shooting}} thaler {{was issued}} for the Chur shooting festival in 1842 and is denominated at four francs. The second, issued for Glarus, has a face value of forty batzen. The third, minted for the shooting festival in Geneva, is denominated at ten francs. A total of eighteen designs were {{struck in the}} nineteenth century, concluding with the Bern issue of 1885. All those struck from 1855 to 1885 bear the denomination of five francs. Many nineteenth-century issues were also struck in various other metals besides silver, including gold and white metal, in small quantities. In 1934, a new series began production. This series, however, was cut short due to the outbreak of World War II. Another series of shooting thalers began mintage in 1984. The first coins issued in this new series were those minted for the festival at Oberhasli. Every year since has seen the mintage of two coins, each bearing the same design, one struck in silver, the other in gold. The only exceptions are the issues of Zürich and Sion in 1999, {{one of which was}} struck in <b>copper–nickel,</b> two in silver and two in gold. Until 1995, silver issues were denominated at fifty francs, while gold pieces were denominated at 1,000 francs. Later, gold issues were denominated at 500 francs, excepting only the Zürich issues of 1999.|$|E
5|$|Two {{prototype}} dollars {{were struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed. Striking such {{large pieces of}} tough <b>copper-nickel</b> proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier reducing lathe to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore {{at least some of}} the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief. This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail. Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date. The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the San Francisco Mint) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to David Eisenhower (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.|$|E
25|$|Also, Agathocles and Pantaleon, {{along with}} their {{contemporary}} Euthydemus II, are unique in the ancient world, in {{that they were the}} first in the world to issue <b>copper-nickel</b> (75/25 ratio) coins1, an alloy technology only known by the Chinese at the time (some weapons from the Warring States period were in <b>copper-nickel</b> alloy2). These coins are indicative of the existence of trade links with China around that time (see Greco-Bactrian kingdom). <b>Copper-nickel</b> would not be used again in coinage until the 19th century in the United States.|$|E
25|$|<b>Copper–nickel</b> alloys {{for marine}} {{applications}} are usually 90% copper, 10% nickel, and {{small amounts of}} manganese and iron to enhance corrosion resistance. The seawater corrosion resistance of <b>copper–nickel</b> alloys results in a thin, adherent, protective surface film which forms naturally and quickly on the metal upon exposure to clean seawater.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, {{both the}} <b>copper-nickel</b> and 35% silver planchets {{were used for}} 5¢ coins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Copper–nickel</b> alloys were {{developed}} specifically for seawater applications over five decades ago. Today, these alloys are being investigated for their potential use in aquaculture.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{commemorative}} coins issued in the Soviet Union to honour the 20th and 30th anniversaries of his flight: 1 ruble coin (1981, <b>copper-nickel)</b> and 3 ruble coin (1991, silver). In 2001, {{to commemorate the}} 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness was issued in Russia: 2 ruble coin (<b>copper-nickel),</b> 3 ruble coin (silver), 10 ruble coin (brass-copper, nickel), and 100 ruble coin (silver). In 2011, Russia issued a 1,000 ruble coin (gold) and 3 ruble coin (silver) to mark the 50th anniversary of his flight.|$|E
25|$|Protective films can {{be applied}} to the inner surface of copper alloy tubes to {{increase}} corrosion resistance. For certain applications, the film is composed of iron. In power plant condensers, duplex tubes consisting of an inner titanium layer with outer <b>copper-nickel</b> alloys are employed. This enables the use of copper’s beneficial mechanical and chemical properties (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, ammonia attack) along with titanium’s excellent corrosion resistance. A duplex tube with inner aluminium brass or <b>copper-nickel</b> and outer stainless or mild steel can be used for cooling in the oil refining and petrochemical industries.|$|E
25|$|From {{this point}} in time, we can {{distinguish}} quite clearly between two classes of commemorative coins. Apart from the non-circulating medal-like coins referred to above, increasing numbers of circulating base metal commemorative coins have been issued in recent decades. When West Germany replaced the silver 5 mark coin with a <b>copper-nickel</b> one in 1975, the silver 5 mark commemoratives also reverted to <b>copper-nickel</b> (in 1979). Already in 1965, the Soviet Union issued a copper-nickel-zinc rouble commemorating the victory in World War II. This, and the next four commemorative roubles, were issued in several millions of copies, and circulated as regular currency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Copper-nickel</b> alloys {{have been}} proven over many years in sea water {{pipework}} and other marine applications. These alloys resist biofouling in open seas where they do not allow microbial slime to build up and support macrofouling.|$|E
25|$|Copper and <b>copper-nickel</b> alloys {{have a high}} natural {{resistance}} to biofouling relative to alternative materials. Other metals used in heat exchangers, such as steel, titanium and aluminium, foul readily. Protection against biofouling, particularly in marine structures, can be accomplished {{over long periods of}} time with copper metals.|$|E
25|$|Nickel-clad <b>copper-nickel</b> 5-franc and nickel-brass 10-franc coins {{replaced}} their silver {{counterparts in}} 1970 and 1974, respectively. Nickel 2 francs were finally introduced in 1979, followed by bimetallic 10 francs in 1988 and trimetallic 20 francs in 1992. The 20-franc coin {{was composed of}} two rings and a centre plug.|$|E
25|$|Salt water causes {{corrosion}} {{in metal}} parts. It {{can be difficult}} to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water. The use of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steels, high-nickel alloys, <b>copper-nickel</b> alloys, nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce, or eliminate, corrosion damage.|$|E
