Two capacity control algorithms were developed; the first is based on partitioning of Monte Carlo samples while the second is based on bid-pricing with high-frequency price adjustments. The algorithms were implemented in Java as a plugin module to SpaceNet 2. 0, an existing integrated modeling and simulation tool for space logistics. The module was tested on a lunar exploration concept which emphasizes global exploration of the Moon using mobile infrastructure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an e-logistics system for sea freight forwarding. The system {{was designed to}} suit {{a wide range of}} users including shippers, shipping lines, overseas agents, and forwarding operators. The entire system supports three main functions: e-booking, container selection and <b>cargo</b> <b>allocation,</b> and XML-based information exchange. The e-booking system provides a general platform for shippers and forwarders to interact and to exchange information. It is also able to help shippers to make shipment bookings and to find a shipping route that minimises shipping costs and shipping time. It also facilitates freight forwarders in exchanging their shipping orders via the Internet, thus increasing the efficiency and transparency of the market. To solve the container selection and <b>cargo</b> <b>allocation</b> problem, a heuristic-based solution for cargo to container allocation is incorporated in the system. The heuristic helps reduce shipping cost and shipping time through better cargo consolidation and better utilization of container space. To facilitate data entry and data exchange, an XML standard format is used throughout the web-based information system...|$|E
40|$|Some {{causes of}} the high {{logistic}} costs and significant disparity in Indonesia’s commodity price is the imbalanced distribution {{of the flow of}} goods between west and east regional of Indonesia and the slow development infrastructure. This issue can be happened because maritime transport infrastructure in Indonesia have not served effectively yet,. Therefore, the provider of shipping services should be able to design the Indonesian maritime logistics network that best suits with the current maritime conditions and provide the greatest benefits. This study aims to obtain a model of decision-making at all levels (strategic, tactical, operational) to determine the type of vessel, the shipping routes, and <b>cargo</b> <b>allocation</b> that gives the maximum profit.

Our model considers a general fuel consumption function that depends on speed and load.

Based on column generation techniques, we develop an iterative search algorithm that adaptively reorganizes the approximated formulation.

We assume that each cargo booking request is endowed with a random weight, volume and profit rate and propose a Markovian model for the booking request/acceptance/rejection process. The {{decision on whether to}} accept the booking request or to reserve the capacity for future bookings follows a bid-price control policy. In particular, a cargo will be accepted only when the revenue from accepting it exceeds the opportunity cost, which is calculated based on bid prices. Optimal solutions are derived by maximizing a reward function of a Markov chain. Numerical comparisons between the proposed approach and two existing static single-leg air <b>cargo</b> capacity <b>allocation</b> policies are presented. OR in airlines Revenue management...|$|R
40|$|The {{aircraft}} system 2 ̆ 7 s {{role in the}} United Stated Air Force is crucial. For the U. S. Air Force to maintain its air superiority in the world, the constant maintenance, upgrade, and acquisition of the systems must follow. As the cost of fuel rises and with the recent budget situation, {{the emphasis is on}} both running the Air Force fleet more efficiently and acquiring the platform that can reduce the fleet level operating cost and the fuel usage and yet brings same capabilities. The approach presented in the thesis combines approaches from multidisciplinary design optimization and operations research to improve energy efficiency-related defense acquisition decisions. The work focuses upon problems that are relevant to the U. S. Air Force-Air Mobility Command (AMC), which is the largest consumer of fuel in the Department of Defense. To reflect AMC problems, the approach must consider the uncertainty in cargo demand; historical data shows that the cargo demand for AMC varies on a daily basis. The approach selects requirements for a new cargo aircraft; predicts size, weight and performance of that new aircraft; and allocates the new aircraft along with existing aircraft fleet to meet the cargo transportation demand. The approach successfully provides a description of a new cargo aircraft that, given the abstractions and assumptions used, will reduce the fleet-level operating cost and / or the fuel needed to meet air <b>cargo</b> demand. The <b>allocation</b> problem incorporates scheduling-like features to account for time driven operational constraints. The results of this study demonstrate the approach for a simple three-route network and 22 -base network, using the Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) dataset. With addition of uncertainty in demand and random home base generation, the simulation result will suggest an aircraft design that is more flexible to the fluctuations in demand. The 22 -base network represents one day of operation of the AMC randomly selected from the GATES data. The result from the 22 -base network simulation under uncertain demand scenario for the strategic fleet suggests the introduction of five new aircraft that are capable of 24 pallets and 3, 300 nautical miles of unrefueled design range which will save 1. 10 percent in the expected direct operating cost and 4. 20 percent in expected fuel usage compared to the baseline allocation result without introduction of the new aircraft. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} study, we {{formulate}} the passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>allocation</b> problem as {{a variant of}} the price-dependent multi-item newsvendor model with capacity constraints. The effects of baggage weight, pricing, and costing on the number of passengers and amount of cargo carried are studied. Based on the model and the existing practice of carriers, we develop several illustrative cases and fend that to maximize profit, large aircraft may need to reduce their baggage limits significantly from the current policy. In the second study, we propose the dynamic partnership concept, which assures a feasible partnership in an online logistics community. After identifying the platform requirements, a preliminary knowledge framework which describes the collaborative knowledge and new knowledge managing approaches is suggested. In the third study, we provide a two-phase framework for an airfreight forwarder's resource planning. In each timed phase, an optimization model first determines the aggregates and a simulation model then examines the disaggregated situations evaluating whether the aggregate estimates are viable under disaggregation and uncertainties. Here, a set of measurements are established to evaluate the performance of a resource plan. For the inadequate plans, areas of possible improvements are identified for revision. Three studies in air cargo logistics are conducted respectively, covering the following three areas: carrier's passenger and cargo management, logistics service provider's partnership strategy, and an airfreight forwarder's resource planning. study 1.

40|$|Abstract:- Shipment {{consolidation}} is a laborious and, sometimes, tedious {{task for}} airfreight forwarders {{since there is}} enormous information to be considered and literally {{quite a number of}} practical constraints to be fulfilled. In Hong Kong, the unique forwarding operation and rapid cargo flow has further complicated the consolidating process {{in such a way that}} local forwarders are almost impossible to achieve the best selection of logistics workflow through the functions of human brain solely. However, none of the currently available intelligent logistics system is able to aid forwarders in making decisions on this crucial operation through the entire supply chain. This paper presents a Heuristics Iterative Reasoning System (HIRS) for solving shipment consolidation problem, adopting rule-based reasoning to provide expert advice for <b>cargo</b> <b>allocation</b> and subsequently applying container loading specific heuristics to support the cargo loading process. Afterwards, the iterative improvement mechanism of HIRS undertakes all outcomes until the most optimal solution is found.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} state-augmented {{shipping}} (SAS) network framework to integrate various activities in liner container shipping chain, including container loading/unloading, transshipment, dwelling at visited ports, in-transit waiting and in-sea transport process. Based on the SAS network framework, we develop a chance-constrained optimization {{model for a}} joint cargo assignment problem. The model attempts to maximize the carrier's profit by simultaneously determining optimal ship fleet capacity setting, ship route schedules and <b>cargo</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme. With a few disparities from previous studies, we take into account two differentiated container demands: deterministic contracted basis demand received from large manufacturers and uncertain spot demand collected from the spot market. The economies of scale of ship size are incorporated to examine the scaling effect of ship capacity setting in the cargo assignment problem. Meanwhile, the schedule coordination strategy is introduced to measure the in-transit waiting time and resultant storage cost. Through two numerical studies, it is demonstrated that the proposed chance-constrained joint optimization model can characterize the impact of carrier's risk preference on decisions of the container cargo assignment. Moreover, considering the scaling effect of large ships can alleviate the concern of cargo overload rejection and consequently help carriers make more promising ship deployment schemes.

40|$|Freight {{forwarding}} by {{air transport}} {{has been a}} growing business {{with the introduction of}} wide-bodied aircraft. The major reason of moving cargoes by air is that company losses are able to be alleviated by taking advantage of the speed of delivery. Hong Kong being an air-cargo hub in Asia, from year 2002 to 2003, almost 2. 55 million tones of air cargo passed through the Hong Kong International Airport and the figure shows that it has grown by more than 20 % in that year. In fact, the majority of these cargoes are the manufactured goods from the fast growing industrial powerhouse of the Peal River Delta. This situation has led to the rapid demand of exported-oriented processing services, resulting in the dramatic expansion of airfreight forwarding industry in Hong Kong. However, the business is still relied on human brain solely, there is no systematic way or intelligent system to help forwarders in making decision in the whole consolidation process.

H 577 P LMS 2017 Xiaviii, 103 pages :color illustrationsLiner {{shipping}} network {{design is}} a comprehensive decision problem for the carrier to plan their service operations. A series of related decisions from tactical and operational levels are coordinated to maximize the profits. In this thesis, we study two network design problems for carriers in liner shipping. The first work focuses on the joint decision makings for the network design, in which a general fuel consumption function is assumed. The second work studies the solution to a compact optimization model for the network design, in which the transshipment cost is taken into account. In this thesis, we have developed novel optimization techniques to solve both problems. In the first study, we develop a mathematical programming model that addresses fleet deployment, speed optimization, and <b>cargo</b> <b>allocation</b> jointly, so as to maximize total profits for carriers at the strategic level. To capture fuel costs precisely, our model adopts a general fuel consumption function that depends on both vessel speed and vessel load. To overcome intractability caused by nonlinear terms in the model, we separate fuel consumption costs into two terms associated with ship speed and ship load, respectively, so as to obtain a mixed integer linear programming formulation for approximation. Based on column generation techniques, we develop an iterative search algorithm that adaptively reorganizes the approximated formulation. We conduct extensive experiments using generated data sets from actual liner shipping services in {{different regions of the}} world to show the effectiveness of our approach as well as the significant impact of speed-load factors on fuel consumptions. Managerial insights are obtained by testing the model under different scenarios, which may greatly assist decision makers in the liner shipping industry. In the second study, we study a problem that aims at creating a set of regular services for a designated fleet of oceangoing ships to transport the containerized cargos among seaports. Containers can be transshipped from one ship to another at an intermediate port in order to improve the transportation efficiency. The objective of the problem is to maximize the revenues from the satisfied demands while minimizing the operating cost including the transshipment cost. For this issue, many solution methods known to be effective for problems assuming zero transshipment cost cannot directly apply, because the calculation of transshipment cost has significantly complicated the problem and its mathematical formulation. To tackle this challenge, we develop for this problem a new compact mixed-integer linear programming model. However, the new model may contain exponentially many variables and constraints, making its solution very challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel application of simultaneous column-and-row generation to solve the linear programming relaxation of the new model, so as to derive an upper bound for the profit of an optimal network design. Based on this, we have developed a branch-and-price to find optimal or near-optimal integer solutions for this problem. Results from experiments have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and solution methods. Department of Logistics and Maritime StudiesPh.
