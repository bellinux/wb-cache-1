Students are housed in 26 single-sex dormitories, each supervised by a dormitory head selected from the faculty.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, as {{a result}} of the efforts of Meister, the faculty, and the Parents Association, the school became co-ed, giving girls of New York equal {{opportunity}} to pursue a quality education in a specialized high school, previously denied to them. This expansion to <b>co-education</b> preceded its rivals Stuyvesant (1969) and Brooklyn Tech (1970) by more than two decades.|$|E
25|$|It thus had {{a two-year}} {{advantage}} over the purely senior societies in admitting female members. The Yale chapter's action also accomplished, albeit not without friction, <b>co-education</b> as a permitted status within the national fraternity.

25|$|At {{the age of}} nineteen, Colby went to Madison, Wisconsin to {{live with}} her grandparents, Stephen Chilton and Clara Medhurst Willingham Chilton. Here she entered the University of Wisconsin–Madison, then in its infancy, which was {{struggling}} with <b>co-education.</b> She exerted a marked influence in securing the admission of women to the university and the adoption of the principles of <b>co-education</b> in Wisconsin. She was graduated in 1869 as the valedictorian and Phi Beta Kappa in the first class of women graduated from the school. At once, she became a teacher of history and Latin in the institution, while pursuing graduate studies. She married Leonard Wright Colby, a graduate of the same university, in June 1871, and moved to Beatrice the following year, where {{he was elected to the}} Nebraska State Senate. Amidst the hardships of pioneer life in a new place, the young wife found her family cares all-absorbing, but her taste for study, her love of literature and her natural desire to improve the conditions about her, led her to establish Beatrice's free public library in 1873.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, parents {{seized the}} {{initiative}} by sending their daughters {{to what has}} become a <b>co-education</b> school in Mangar Kota, Swat. The village has only one primary school for girls, with just one teacher. The nearest secondary school is 12 kilometres away. The only way for girls to continue their education was to attend a boys school. Inspired by Malala Yusufzai the parents of 8 girls have enrolled their daughters in a boys school.|$|E
25|$|An early {{catalyst}} {{along the}} path to <b>co-education</b> had been the Labour government’s decision in 1974 to phase out the direct grant status of schools such as Stockport over a seven-year period commencing in 1976. The impact on the financial structure of the school became quickly apparent and in March 1975 the governors announced that they would go independent and launch the Stopfordian Trust to provide bursaries that were increasingly being requested by entrance exam candidates.|$|E

25|$|A decade into <b>co-education,</b> student {{assault and}} {{harassment}} by faculty became {{the impetus for}} the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center. In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine Broad Recognition, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate. In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.|$|E

25|$|In 1902, {{a series}} of {{philosophical}} papers was published in Germany by Dr. Heinrich Pudor, under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, who coined the term Nacktkultur. In 1906 {{he went on to}} write a three volume treatise with his new term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in <b>co-education</b> and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing. Richard Ungewitter (Nacktheit, 1906, Nackt, 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh air bathing, and then adding the nudist philosophy, contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view. Major promoters of these ideas included Adolf Koch and Hans Suren. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.|$|E

25|$|Only 87% of Pakistani {{children}} finish {{primary school}} education. The standard national system {{of education is}} mainly inspired from the British system. Pre-school education is designed for 3–5 years old and usually consists of three stages: Play Group, Nursery and Kindergarten (also called 'KG' or 'Prep'). After pre-school education, students go through junior school from grades 1 to 5. This is followed by middle school from grades 6 to 8. At middle school, single-sex education is usually preferred by the community, but <b>co-education</b> is also common in urban cities. The curriculum is usually subject to the institution. The eight commonly examined disciplines are Urdu, English, mathematics, arts, science, social studies, Islamic studies and sometimes computer studies (subject to availability of a computer laboratory). Provincial and regional languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto and others may be taught in their respective provinces, particularly in language-medium schools. Some institutes give instruction in foreign languages such as Turkish, Arabic, Persian, French and Chinese. The language of instruction depends {{on the nature of}} the institution itself, whether it is an English-medium school or an Urdu-medium school.|$|E

Asbury College (now Depauw University) was Methodist. Wabash College was Presbyterian; they led the Protestant schools.

500|$|Following the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, {{students}} began {{to withdraw from}} the university in large numbers to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. [...] The financial impact on the university had the potential to be devastating, but Tigert navigated the war years by making the university campus, dormitories and class rooms available for the training of U.S. Army Air Force flight crews. [...] Tigert kept the lights on, and the bills paid. [...] Veterans began to return to school with support from the GI Bill, and by the fall term of 1946, over seventy percent of the University of Florida's 7,000 students were returning World War II veterans. [...] Contributing to the shortage of facility space was the influx of new female students when the Florida Legislature reinstituted <b>co-education</b> in 1947.

500|$|Early in {{the history}} of the university, female {{students}} were separated from male students in many ways. [...] For example, they had a separate entrance and lounges in Willard Straight Hall, a separate student government, and a separate page (edited by women) in the Cornell Daily Sun. [...] The male students were required to take [...] "drill" [...] (a precursor to ROTC), but the women were exempt. One account of the history of coeducation at Cornell claims that in the very beginning, [...] "ale students were almost unanimously opposed to <b>co-education,</b> and vigorously protested the arrival of a group of 16 women, who promptly formed a women's club with a broom for their standard, and 'In hoc signo vinces' as their motto." [...] In the 1870s and 1880s, female Cornell students on campus were generally ignored by male students. [...] Women did not have a formal role in the annual commencement ceremony until 1935, when the student government selected a woman to be Class Poet. In 1936, the Willard Straight Hall Board of Managers voted to allow women to eat in its cafeteria. Until the 1970s, male students resided in west campus dormitories while women were housed in the north campus. [...] As of 2010, the only remaining women's dormitory is Balch Hall, due to a restriction in the gift that funded it. Lyon Hall (which for most of its history was a men-only dormitory), also currently disallows male residents on its lower floors.

2500|$|In practise, on September 14, 1965, Tunisia {{ratified}} the International Labour Organization's Convention number 111 concerning {{discrimination in the}} matter of employment and profession. Later, in 1968, ratification of the ILO's convention number 100 instituted equality of treatment in employment of men and women for work of equal value. These measures added to <b>co-education</b> in schools and as a consequence the entry of more and more young women into the workplace, involving the decline of marriage and of births of which the target was 46 per cent in 1966 and 30 per cent in 1971. Muhammad Baraket and Domenic Tabutin estimate that two-thirds of the reduction in births during the period 1966-1975 is the demographic consequences of these measures. In 1980, Tunisia's level of demographic growth was among the lowest in the Southern countries and is found to be the lowest of the Arab world.

2500|$|John David Buchanan {{took over}} from Talbot Griffith in 1958, and played himself in quietly until the Circular 10/65 which demanded comprehensivisation of {{maintained}} schools, of which Oakham was {{one as a}} Direct Grant school for the Rutland dayboys. He and the Rutland Local Education Authority did not {{see eye to eye}} on the possibilities of re-organisation of Rutland's schools, and as a result in 1970 the school (then 700 in size, all boys) reverted to full independence from the local authority, and in 1971, Oakham admitted female pupils for the first time, with the intention from the beginning of being co-educational throughout. The school is fully co-educational throughout the whole age range (10-18), with an approximately 50:50 split at all levels (c550 boys and c500 girls in 2011-12). There are an equal number of girls' houses (8) to boys' houses. When Buchanan retired in 1977 the school was 950 in total size (c550 boys and 400 girls), and the next headmaster, Richard Bull (1977-84, before he went on to be headmaster of Rugby) continued the <b>co-education</b> process; {{but it was not until}} 1990 that the process was completed during the headmastership of Graham Smallbone (1985-96) and equality of numbers gained. When Tony Little, later headmaster of Eton, took over in 1996 there were 528 boys and 510 girls in a school of 1038.

6000|$|... 'Really, you know, I'm quite {{converted}} to <b>co-education</b> and almost wish I'd remained here.

60|$|There is a {{movement}} in favour of <b>co-education,</b> especially in elementary education, because, owing to the inadequate supply of schools, the girls tend {{to be left out}} altogether unless they can go to the same school as the boys. The first time I met Professor and Mrs. Dewey was at a banquet in Chang-sha, given by the Tuchun. When the time came for after-dinner speeches, Mrs. Dewey told the Tuchun that his province must adopt <b>co-education.</b> He made a statesmanlike reply, saying that the matter should receive his best consideration, but he feared the time was not ripe in Hunan. However, {{it was clear that the}} matter was within the sphere of practical politics. At the time, being new to China and having imagined China a somewhat backward country, I was surprised. Later on I realized that reforms which we only talk about can be actually carried out in China.|$|E
6000|$|... "In that {{laboratory}} {{one gets}} to disregard these passions," [...] began Capes. [...] "Men are curious animals, with {{a trick of}} falling in love readily with girls about your age. One has to train one's self not to. I've accustomed myself to think of you--as if you were like every other girl {{who works at the}} schools--as something quite outside these possibilities. If only out of loyalty to <b>co-education</b> one has to do that. Apart from everything else, this meeting of ours is a breach of a good rule." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{could not}} be stopped without great parental sternness and the danger of deceit, for <b>co-education</b> will go on outside of school if not inside, and the safest way is to let {{sentiment}} and study go hand in hand, with teachers and parents to direct and explain the great lesson all are the better for learning soon or late. So the elders had to give in, acknowledging that this sudden readiness {{to go to school}} was a comfort, that the new sort of gentle emulation worked wonders in lazy girls and boys, and that watching these [...] "primrose friendships" [...] bud, blossom, and die painless deaths, gave a little touch of romance to their own work-a-day lives.|$|E

She's a specialised woman, specialising in womanhood, her sphere is the home. Soft, trailing, draping skirts, slow movements, a veiled face; for no Oriental veil could be more effectual than her beautiful Catholic quiet. Catholicism invented the invisible purdah. She is far more akin to that sweet little Indian lady with the wonderful robes whom Carmine brought over with her tall husband last summer, than she is to Letty or Cissie. She, too, undertook to play hockey. And played it very much as Madame Van der Pant played it....|$|E
6000|$|Of course, {{except in}} the loneliest and {{farthest}} places, they speak English as well as Welsh; and they misplace their aspirates, which they lost under the Normans as the Saxons did. But this did not happen to them by conquest as it did to the Saxons; they were beguiled of their h's when they were cheated with a Welsh-born prince instead of the Welsh prince they were promised in the succession of their ancient lines. They had been devout Christians, after their manner, in the earliest centuries; as the prefix Llan, or Saint, everywhere testifies, the country abounded in saints, whose sons inherited their saintship; and at the Reformation they became Calvinists as unqualifiedly as their kindred, the Bretons, remained Catholics. They have characterized the English and Americans with their strong traits in a measure which can be dimly traced in the spread of their ten or twenty national names, and they have kept even with the most modern ideals quite to the verge of <b>co-education</b> in their colleges. It is a fact which no Welshman will deny that Cromwell was of Welsh blood. Shakespeare was unquestionably of Welsh origin. Henry VII. was that Welsh Twdwr (or Tudor, as the Saeseneg misspell it), who set aside the Plantagenet succession, and was the grandsire of [...] "the great Elizabeth," [...] not to boast of Bloody Mary or Henry VIII. But if these are not enough, there is the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lloyd-George, {{who is now the}} chief figure of the English cabinet.|$|E
60|$|When {{we come to}} the {{positive}} problem {{of what to do with}} children if we are to give up the established plan, we find the difficulties so great that we begin to understand why so many people who detest the system and look back with loathing on their own schooldays, must helplessly send their children to the very schools they themselves were sent to, because there is no alternative except abandoning the children to undisciplined vagabondism. Man in society must do as everybody else does in his class: only fools and romantic novices imagine that freedom is a mere matter of the readiness of the individual to snap his fingers at convention. It is true that most of us live in a condition of quite unnecessary inhibition, wearing ugly and uncomfortable clothes, making ourselves and other people miserable by the heathen horrors of mourning, staying away from the theatre because we cannot afford the stalls and are ashamed to go to the pit, and in dozens of other ways enslaving ourselves when there are comfortable alternatives open to us without any real drawbacks. The contemplation of these petty slaveries, and of the triumphant ease with which sensible people throw them off, creates an impression that if we only take Johnson's advice to free our minds from cant, we can achieve freedom. But if we all freed our minds from cant we should find that for the most part we should have to go on doing the necessary work of the world exactly as we did it before until we organized new and free methods of doing it. Many people believed in secondary <b>co-education</b> (boys and girls taught together) before schools like Bedales were founded: indeed the practice was common enough in elementary schools and in Scotland; but their belief did not help them until Bedales and St George's were organized; and there are still not nearly enough co-educational schools in existence to accommodate all the children of the parents who believe in <b>co-education</b> up to university age, even if they could always afford the fees of these exceptional schools. It may be edifying to tell a duke that our public schools are all wrong in their constitution and methods, or a costermonger that children should be treated as in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister instead of as they are treated at the elementary school at the corner of his street; but what are the duke and the coster to do? Neither of them has any effective choice in the matter: their children must either go to the schools that are, or to no school at all. And as the duke thinks with reason that his son will be a lout or a milksop or a prig if he does not go to school, and the coster knows that his son will become an illiterate hooligan if he is left to the streets, there is no real alternative for either of them. Child life must be socially organized: no parent, rich or poor, can choose institutions that do not exist; and the private enterprise of individual school masters appealing to a group of well-to-do parents, though it may shew what can be done by enthusiasts with new methods, cannot touch the mass of our children. For the average parent or child nothing is really available except the established practice; and this is what makes it so important that the established practice should be a sound one, and so useless for clever individuals to disparage it unless they can organize an alternative practice and make it, too, general.|$|E
