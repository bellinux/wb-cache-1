25|$|Eden, {{who faced}} {{domestic}} pressure from his party to take action, {{as well as}} stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East, had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by Aneurin Bevan: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same thing; he could argue that he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what he is saying, and he may be, then he is too stupid to be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side. Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the Cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground told him it could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.|$|E
500|$|Stratford Caldecott also {{interpreted}} the Ring in theological terms: [...] "The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark {{magic of the}} corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly [...] "thin" [...] and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard {{to give up and}} corrupting in the long run".|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were {{enthusiastic}} on set, with editor Steve Tucker calling it a [...] "giddy party". Behr said of the {{cast and crew}} in the episode that [...] "They all were having fun. Just sitting on those sets, being on that bridge, it was a hoot, a real hoot." [...] Deirdre L. Imershein was brought in at the last minute to play Lt. Watley, as she was a friend of one of the production crew and had previously appeared as a Risan pleasure girl in The Next Generation episode [...] "Captain's Holiday". She was brought in because none of the actresses the producers had seen during the casting process <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> role's one line ("Deck 15") convincingly enough. Her involvement led to the role's being expanded into a second scene where she was revealed to be Bashir's great-grandmother.|$|E
500|$|The Dark Blues {{had turned}} to Ferguson to play for and manage the team because of his {{reputation}} as the most authoritarian captain in the game. He was an honest and upstanding citizen {{in a time when}} not many ballplayers <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same. However, he was also a domineering, dictatorial captain with a violent streak. [...] Team discipline did improve in his first season, but his overbearing ways proved divisive, causing the team to bicker amongst themselves. Ferguson's temper would flare up often, even when the team was winning. The Chicago Tribune reported that if anyone on the Hartford nine committed an error, [...] "Ferguson [...] swear until everything looks blue." [...] He was particularly rough on second baseman Jack Burdock, who {{on more than one occasion}} heard his captain publicly threaten [...] "to ram his fist down Burdock's throat." [...] Some players tolerated his behavior; others, however, refused to comply. Shortstop Tom Carey and center fielder Jack Remsen did not hesitate to yell back, while Burdock and pitcher Candy Cummings, on the other hand, often sulked. The situation in Hartford came to a head after a tough loss to the Red Stockings, a game in which Ferguson had committed several errors. Hartford's main pitcher, Tommy Bond, suggested that Ferguson was [...] "crooked". Ferguson denied the charge, and Bond quickly retracted his statement, claiming that he said it in anger. Bond then requested that he be able to leave the team because he could not play for Ferguson, a request that was granted by league president Morgan Bulkeley, a former owner of the Dark Blues.|$|E

2500|$|Gibson was {{initially}} reluctant {{to accept the}} role of Guy Hamilton. [...] "I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way." [...] Gibson saw some similarities {{between himself and the}} character of Guy. [...] "He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I guess you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same for me."

2500|$|Hart {{also found}} admirers in the Premier League, with several top-flight scouts {{attending}} matches. On 30 November 2005, the Shropshire Star newspaper reported that Everton goalkeeping coach Chris Woods {{had been present}} at Town's previous league match, a 4–3 loss at Rochdale. Manager Gary Peters said [...] "Everton have been to watch him, but you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same about Arsenal, Chelsea and every other team in the Premiership." [...] Speculation about his future continued {{for the duration of}} the season, and with the presence of their goalkeeping coach Tim Flowers at several matches, Manchester City became the most likely of his suitors.|$|E

2500|$|In 1914, ITU President James M. Lynch resigned, {{appointed}} by Governor Martin H. Glynn as New York State Commissioner of Labor.

Lynch would serve as ITU president 1925-1926. Employers sought concessions after World War I {{as part of their}} 'open shop' movement. A key goal was to lengthen the work day to 10 to 12 hours. The wartime ITU president Marsden G. Scott fought back with massive strikes all over the country.

2500|$|... "Yes, I {{could give}} you several examples. Near Quilali, at about 30 {{kilometers}} east of Quilali, {{there was a little}} village called El Coco. The contras arrived, they devastated it, they destroyed and burned everything. They arrived in front of a little house and turned their machinegun fire on it, without bothering to check if there were any people inside. Two children, who had taken fright and hidden under a bed, were hit. I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same thing of a man and woman who were hit, this was in the little co-operative of Sacadias Olivas. It was just the same. They too had taken fright and got into bed. Unlike El Coco, the contras had just been on the attack, they had encountered resistance and were now in flight. During their flight they went into a house, and seeing that there were people there, they threw grenade. The man and the woman were killed and one of the children was injured." ...|$|E
2500|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times {{found the}} film [...] "baggy, draggy, oddly timed and strangely off the mark" [...] and that [...] "Mr. Carter {{knows how to}} grab your {{attention}} visually, but the amalgam of trashy thriller clichés that he has compiled with Frank Spotnitz, another series regular, creates its own deadening effect". Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, likewise said, [...] "What plot there is plays like a PG-13 Se7en: body parts, gruesomeness, gloom and doom, but hey, not too much, and don't worry, there's nothing deeply upsetting", and while praising the cinematography, music and Gillian Anderson's performance, believes, [...] "It seems unlikely that this franchise will reach The X-Files X". Jason Anderson of Canada's CBC News called the film [...] "muddled" [...] with a [...] "hurried and half-baked" [...] climax, and said, [...] "Beyond the pleasure of seeing Duchovny and Anderson back in action and back on form," [...] the film [...] "offers little to either the longtime fans or newcomers". Jan Stuart from the Los Angeles Times commented, [...] "The X-Files was a load of malarkey. But it was thoughtful malarkey and compulsively watchable. One <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same about the first two-thirds of [...] "The X-Files: I Want to Believe" [...] before it spins {{out of control and}} into a delirious plane of awfulness." [...] M. A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the acting, locations and characterization, but felt that the script was the film's [...] "biggest weakness".|$|E
