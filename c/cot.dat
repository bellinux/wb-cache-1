The Doctor celebrates his victory, but finds Kovarian had been scanning Melody and found traces of Time Lord DNA; the Doctor speculates that Melody had been conceived while Amy and Rory were in transit on the TARDIS. The Doctor provides an old Gallifreyan <b>cot</b> for Melody, claiming it was his own.|$|E
5|$|For {{his next}} major action, Gandhi {{decided on a}} raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 25 miles south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was {{sleeping}} on a <b>cot</b> in a mango grove, the District Magistrate of Surat drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables. He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near Poona (now Pune).|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{government}} {{was eager to}} control the country's trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy. To this end it emphasised various social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions, and in 1965 transformed the Kenya Federation of Labour into the Central Organization of Trade (<b>COT),</b> a body which came under strong government influence. No strikes could be legally carried out in Kenya without COT's permission. Under Kenyatta, Kenya's first university—the University of Nairobi—was established, with several others following after.|$|E

40|$|Abstract For {{economic}} reasons, a {{new trend}} {{in the development of}} distributed hard real-time systems is to rely on the use of Commercial-O-The-Shelf (<b>cots)</b> hardware and operating systems. As such systems often support critical applications, they must comply with stringent realtime and fault-tolerance requirements. The use of <b>cots</b> components in distributed critical systems is subject to two fundamental questions: are <b>cots</b> components compatible with hard real-time constraints? are they compatible with fault-tolerance constraints? This paper gives the current status of the Hades project, aiming at building a distributed run-time support for hard real-time fault-tolerant applications on top of <b>cots</b> components. Thanks to our experience in the design of Hades, we can give some information on the compatibility between <b>cots</b> components and hard real-time and fault-tolerance constraints. ...|$|R
5|$|All {{prisoners were}} mustered. Walking sick cases were {{collected}} under {{shelter of the}} station buildings, and <b>cot</b> cases were transferred to 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance cacolets. The prisoners escorted by 5th Light Horse Regiment, less one squadron at Amman with one squadron 7th Light Horse attached, moved off to Amman at 07:15. All arms and equipment were collected and put in railway trucks. This task was finished by 15:30. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment remained to guard the sick until transport was organised. One hundred sick walking cases were sent on to Amman in New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade transport wagons and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade commenced its return journey to Amman. They arrived at 21:00, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade remained in charge at Ziza.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his actions at Broodseinde, McGee was awarded the Victoria Cross, one of two Australians to be so {{decorated}} that day. However, he never saw the announcement of the award. On 12 October 1917—eight days after McGee's Victoria Cross action—the 40th Battalion returned to the frontline, in an attempt to exploit the success of the previous week. The battlefield was drenched in rain, turning the ground into a quagmire that was additionally dominated by several German pillboxes. McGee—who had been appointed acting company sergeant major of B Company that morning—led his unit into the attack. As the men of the company advanced forward, a machine gun began firing upon them from the front, before a second opened up on their flank. Men ran to take cover in shellholes as the German fire inflicted several casualties. McGee, however, made a rush towards the guns in an apparent effort to silence them. As he ran towards the pillbox, a bullet struck him in the head, killing him instantly. McGee was later buried in Tyne <b>Cot</b> Cemetery; he was one of 248 members of the 40th Battalion killed or wounded during the Battle of Passchendaele. McGee's fellow Australian Victoria Cross recipient from Broodseinde, Lance Corporal Walter Peeler, was also severely wounded on this day, receiving a bullet wound to his arm.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cope began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a <b>cot</b> surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|E

5000|$|The {{idea for}} the Milldam was {{conceived}} by Uriah <b>Cotting,</b> a real estate merchant who had established a reputation for developing the Boston waterfront.

[...] The idea was developed in response to a shortage of industrial goods during the War of 1812, for <b>Cotting</b> believed Boston's tides could be utilized to power factories.|$|R
5|$|Reginald Blomfield's Menin Gate was {{the first}} {{memorial}} to the missing located in Europe to be completed, and was unveiled on 24 July 1927. The Menin Gate (Menenpoort) {{was found to have}} insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34,984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker's Tyne <b>Cot</b> Memorial to the Missing. Other memorials followed: the Helles Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet; the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme and the Arras Memorial designed by Edwin Lutyens; and the Basra Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward Prioleau Warren. The Dominions and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing: the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial for the forces of India, the Vimy Memorial by Canada, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial by Australia, the Delville Wood Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont-Hamel Memorial by Newfoundland. The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the Thiepval Memorial in 1932, though the Vimy Memorial would not be finished until 1936, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940.|$|E
