40|$|One of the {{problems}} that occur when working with regression models is regarding the sample size; once the statistical methods used in inferential analyzes are asymptotic if the sample is small the analysis may be compromised because the estimates will be biased.

In this work we used a set of soybean yield data and physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>soil</b> properties formed with fewer samples to determine a multiple linear regression model. Bootstrap methods were used for variable selection, identification of influential points and for determination of confidence intervals of the model parameters.

40|$|Abstract The interrelationship of {{soil and}} {{vegetation}} degradation is an emerging issue, where most studies have addressed severe degradation so far. We aimed at revealing changes in soil accompanying slight vegeta-tion degradation in a case study involving xeromeso-philous grasslands from Hungary. Slight degradation is of special interest here because the target community (Euphorbio pannonicae—Brachypodietum pinnati as-sociation) has great nature conservation value. Vegeta-tion status was related to <b>chemical</b> and structural <b>soil</b> properties by principal component analysis and redun-dancy analysis. Vegetation conditions were assessed by species abundances and by fine-scale spatial structure, which is proposed here for soil-vegetation studies. Slight vegetation degradation clearly manifested itself in soil properties. Differences in vegetation status when assessed by species abundances were mirrored in <b>chemical</b> <b>soil</b> properties. When structural vegetation descriptors were used, a soil structure property (bulk density) {{was responsible for the}} segregation according to naturalness. Vegetation-soil relationships were more consistent over biogeographic regions, when vegeta-tion structural descriptors were used. Differences in <b>chemical</b> <b>soil</b> properties reflected species abundance pattern, as was found in most non-grazing related degradation studies. However, changes to soil structure also accompanied slight degradation, and their impor-tance was revealed when vegetation structure was taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to limited}} {{availability}} of arable {{land and the}} high market demand for vegetables around the world, Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae crops are frequently cultivated under unfavorable soil conditions. These include salinity, alkalinity, heavy metals, and excessive amount of trace elements. Plants exposed to adverse <b>chemical</b> <b>soil</b> conditions exhibit various physiological and biochemical disorders leading to stunted growth and severe yield loss. One way to avoid or reduce losses in production caused by adverse <b>soil</b> <b>chemical</b> conditions in vegetables would be to graft them onto rootstocks capable of reducing the effect of external stresses on the shoot. Grafting is an integrative reciprocal process and, therefore, both scion and rootstock can influence tolerance of grafted plants to adverse <b>soil</b> <b>chemical</b> conditions. Grafted plants grown under adverse <b>soil</b> <b>chemical</b> conditions often exhibited greater growth and yield, higher photosynthesis, better nutritional status, and lower accumulation of Naþ and/or Cl, heavy metals, and excessive amount of trace elements in shoots than ungrafted or self-grafted plants. This chapter gives {{an overview of the}} recent literature on the response of grafted plants to adverse <b>soil</b> <b>chemical</b> conditions and the mechanisms of tolerance to adverse <b>soil</b> <b>chemical</b> conditions in grafted plants related to the morphological root characteristics and the physiological and biochemical processes. The chapter will conclude by identifying several prospects for future research aiming to improve the role of grafting in vegetable crops grown under abiotic stress conditions...|$|R

Strawberry yield was greater from the crop grown 3 years after T. patula than that after soil fumigation 4 years previously. About 2 t strawberry yield increase is necessary to allow the growth of Tagetes every 5 th year, without economic loss.
