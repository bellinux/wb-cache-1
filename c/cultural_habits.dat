The inaugural Tobis Filmkunst production, {{it was not}} a drama, but a {{documentary}} sponsored by a shipping line: Melodie der Welt (Melody of the World), directed by Walter Ruttmann. This was also perhaps the first feature film anywhere to significantly explore the artistic possibilities of joining the motion picture with recorded sound. As described by scholar William Moritz, the movie is [...] "intricate, dynamic, fast-paced... juxtapos similar <b>cultural</b> <b>habits</b> from countries around the world, with a superb orchestral score... and many synchronized sound effects." [...] Composer Lou Lichtveld was among a number of contemporary artists struck by the film: [...] "Melodie der Welt became the first important sound documentary, the first in which musical and unmusical sounds were composed into a single unit and in which image and sound are controlled by one and the same impulse." [...] Melodie der Welt was a direct influence on the industrial film Philips Radio (1931), directed by Dutch avant-garde filmmaker Joris Ivens and scored by Lichtveld, who described its audiovisual aims: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Even {{though there}} are many studies about {{religious}} life in Turkey, {{there are very few}} that examine religiosity within a specific profession. This study explores popular religiosity among Turkish elementary school teachers. Popular religion, folk religion, unofficial religion, invisible religion, common religion, religious populism—all of these terms point to a dimension of religious life that suggests a differentiation between the religion of ordinary people and the religion of theologians, reverends, and other religious professionals. In this study, I use the results of a survey that I conducted with 295 teachers in 12 public elementary schools in Turkey in 2005 to explore popular religiosity among teachers. The results show that popular religiosity is lower among teachers than the majority of population. However, some teachers make religion a part of their cultural life, and see the practice of religion as a <b>cultural</b> <b>habit...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{birth of}} Jamaah Tabligh {{was in fact}} a direct {{reaction}} to the emergence of aggressive Hindu proselytization movement, such as the Shuddhi (Purifying) and Sangathan (Consolidation) movement, which made wide-reaching attempt in the early 20 th century to "return" to Hinduism those who had "left" the religion and converted to Islam during the period of Muslim political power in India. The main target of these right-wing Hindu movements were those they called "borderline Muslims" who still maintained many beliefs and <b>cultural</b> <b>habit</b> that had come from Hinuism. Maulana Muhammad Ilyas, founder of Jamaah Tabligh, believed that only a grass-roots Islamic movement could challenge the effort of Shuddhi and Sangathan, thought "purifying" these "borderline" Muslims and educating them about basic faith and worship in order to save them from the process of Hindunisation.

Resulting from Anglo/Japanese research (Lisa Ullman Travelling Scholarship, 1999) into representations of death and attitudes to the body and change in Japanese culture, 'Blush' examines somatic intimacy with landscape, and time, as evidenced in Butoh dance, which sees dance/life/death as cyclical and inseparable. Cultural forms were observed and translated (in the performance of speech), rather than assimilated. Through a self-reflexive narrative, both performers and audiences are positioned as 'other'. Presented in the round, the audience seated on sofas, 'Blush' addresses questions of space, architecture, the body and <b>cultural</b> <b>habit,</b> employing varying tempos and vocabularies to produce a layered text, that de-stabilises and re-forms subjectivity around an 'unfixed', 'transitory' and fragmented sense of being. Imagery shot in Japan of Butoh dancers, Takenouchi Atsushi and Tokeda, is incorporated within a video poem (Higaki/postcard), alongside a written/spoken text, reflecting on the transience of being.
