In the absence of <b>closed-form</b> <b>solutions,</b> it is easy to get similar outcomes from numerical simulations.

25|$|Following {{early work}} by Louis Bachelier and later work by Robert C. Merton, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes {{made a major}} {{breakthrough}} by deriving a differential equation that must be satisfied by the price of any derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock. By employing the technique of constructing a risk neutral portfolio that replicates the returns of holding an option, Black and Scholes produced a <b>closed-form</b> <b>solution</b> for a European option's theoretical price. At the same time, the model generates hedge parameters necessary for effective risk management of option holdings. While the ideas behind the Black–Scholes model were ground-breaking and eventually led to Scholes and Merton receiving the Swedish Central Bank's associated Prize for Achievement in Economics (a.k.a., the Nobel Prize in Economics), {{the application of the}} model in actual options trading is clumsy because of the assumptions of continuous trading, constant volatility, and a constant interest rate. Nevertheless, the Black–Scholes model {{is still one of the}} most important methods and foundations for the existing financial market in which the result is within the reasonable range.|$|E
500|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{boundary layer}} was first defined by Ludwig Prandtl {{in a paper}} presented on August 12, 1904 at the third International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg, Germany. It simplifies the equations of fluid flow by dividing the flow field into two areas: one inside the boundary layer, dominated by viscosity and creating the majority of drag experienced by the boundary body; and one outside the boundary layer, where viscosity can be neglected without significant effects on the solution. This allows a <b>closed-form</b> <b>solution</b> for the flow in both areas, a significant simplification of the full Navier–Stokes equations. The majority of the heat transfer to and from a body also takes place within the boundary layer, again allowing the equations to be simplified in the flow field outside the boundary layer. [...] The pressure distribution throughout the boundary layer in the direction normal to the surface (such as an airfoil) remains constant throughout the boundary layer, and {{is the same as}} on the surface itself.|$|E

The agreement between the linearized triple-deck and interacting boundary-layer equations is good; however, the nonsimilar boundary layers, which fail to account for upstream influence, are shown to be in poor agreement with both interacting boundary layers and the linearized triple deck. The linearized <b>closed-form</b> <b>solutions</b> will therefore be very useful in future stability calculations...|$|R

Linear least squares problems are convex and have a <b>closed-form</b> <b>solution</b> that is unique, provided that the number of data points used for fitting equals or exceeds the number of unknown parameters, except in special degenerate situations.
