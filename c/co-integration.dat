His thesis (The Theory of the Durbin-Watson Statistic with special reference to the Specification of Models in Levels as against in Differences) led to many tests for unit roots that were used in <b>co-integration</b> analyses.

50|$|For {{integrated}} I(1) processes, Granger and Newbold {{showed that}} de-trending {{does not work}} to eliminate the problem of spurious correlation, and that the superior alternative is to check for <b>co-integration.</b> Two series with I(1) trends can be co-integrated only {{if there is a}} genuine relationship between the two. Thus the standard current methodology for time series regressions is to check all-time series involved for integration.

Phillips and Sam Ouliaris (1990) {{show that}} residual-based unit root tests {{applied to the}} {{estimated}} cointegrating residuals {{do not have the}} usual Dickey-Fuller distributions under the null hypothesis of no-cointegration. Because of the spurious regression phenomenon under the null hypothesis, the distribution of these tests have asymptotic distributions that depend on (1) the number of deterministic trend terms and (2) the number of variables with which <b>co-integration</b> is being tested. These distributions are known as Phillips-Ouliaris distributions and critical values have been tabulated. In finite samples, a superior alternative to the use of these asymptotic critical value is to generate critical values from simulations.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{electronic}} integration where silicon is {{the dominant}} material, system photonic integrated circuits have been fabricated {{from a variety of}} material systems, including electro-optic crystals such as lithium niobate, silica on silicon, Silicon on insulator, various polymers and semiconductor materials which are used to make semiconductor lasers such as GaAs and InP. The different material systems are used because they each provide different advantages and limitations depending on the function to be integrated. For instance, silica (silicon dioxide) based PICs have very desirable properties for passive photonic circuits such as AWGs (see below) due to their comparatively low losses and low thermal sensitivity, GaAs or InP based PICs allow the direct integration of light sources and Silicon PICs enable <b>co-integration</b> of the photonics with transistor based electronics.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{micromachining}} uses layers {{deposited on}} the surface of a substrate as the structural materials, rather than using the substrate itself. Surface micromachining was created in the late 1980s to render micromachining of silicon more compatible with planar integrated circuit technology, with the goal of combining MEMS and integrated circuits on the same silicon wafer. The original surface micromachining concept was based on thin polycrystalline silicon layers patterned as movable mechanical structures and released by sacrificial etching of the underlying oxide layer. Interdigital comb electrodes were used to produce in-plane forces and to detect in-plane movement capacitively. This MEMS paradigm has enabled the manufacturing of low cost accelerometers for e.g. automotive air-bag systems and other applications where low performance and/or high g-ranges are sufficient. Analog Devices has pioneered the industrialization of surface micromachining and has realized the <b>co-integration</b> of MEMS and integrated circuits.|$|E

If calculated F-statistic value is greater than upper critical bound values, then it shows that long-run (<b>co-integration)</b> relationship exists among variables. If computed F-statistics value is lower than lower critical bound value, then there is no <b>co-integration.</b> The decision of <b>co-integration</b> is inconclusive when the value of F statistic lies between lower and upper critical bounds.|$|E

First, we tested both MOB and INT with FI. Most of the test results were insignificant, indicating no <b>co-integration</b> relationship. However, when we tested each variable individually with FI, the majority of tests showed that MOB and INT were significant, clearly indicating that MOB and INT have a <b>co-integration</b> relationship with FI. Therefore, we can infer that an increase in MOB and INT are important sources for enhancing financial inclusion in SAARC countries.|$|E

Therefore, it is extremely urgent and crucial to explore how to reduce carbon emissions in the sector. This paper employs the <b>co-integration</b> method and scenario analysis to investigate how to reduce carbon emissions in the sector. The granger causality test is conducted and the result indicates that all the variables except lnPare granger-causes lnCE. Moreover, comparing the JJ (Johansen-Juselius) <b>co-integration</b> with the EG (Engle-Granger) <b>co-integration</b> based on the squared residual, the fitting effect and the prediction effect, {{we find that the}} EG <b>co-integration</b> method is better. Furthermore, we adopt the EG <b>co-integration</b> and scenario analysis and find that the emission reduction potential of the sector will be 63. 9 Mt in 2015 and 180 Mt in 2020 under the middle scenario; and 121. 4 Mt in 2015 and 327. 9 Mt in 2020 under the advanced scenario.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of multiple time series modelling under the condition of nonstationarity in means. It is well known that the economic time series are characteristic by nonstationary development. In the univariate case this problem is solved very simply, just by differencing. But in the multivariate case the differencing is not an effective way how to get rid of nonstationarity in means because of <b>co-integration</b> which can occure. If the <b>co-integration</b> between some time series does exists and is not respected it usually leads to the incorrect model of the multivariate time series. This model has to be transformed into a restricted form which is called the error correction model. The problem of <b>co-integration</b> and error correction model is relatively new. The relationship between <b>co-integration</b> and error correction models was first suggested by C. W. J. Granger (1981). A theorem showing precisely that <b>co-integration</b> series can be represented by error correction models was originally stated and proved in Granger (1983). This theorem was than presented in Engle, Granger (1987) under the name 'Granger Representation Theorem'. These articles were than followed by many other papers, especially concerning the testing of <b>co-integration</b> and the estimating of error correction models. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{matters such}} as {{efficient}} wages theory, bargaining theory, seeking work theory and contracts theories in macro economy has focused on relations among productivity, wages and unemployment. In this study, it is tried to obtain existing relations among those three variables for 1945 - 2005 period by time serial methods. In the long run, <b>co-integration</b> relation among productivity, wages and unemployment could not be determined. However, structural breaking in the serials of reel wages, productivity and uneployment has been determined in the years of 1966, 1967 and 1968 {{as a result of}} breaking test developed by Bai and Perron. The existence of structural breaking do not affect <b>co-integration</b> relation among variables. Because of this, data set is separated into two sub period: 1945 - 1966 and 1969 - 2005. As a result of <b>co-integration</b> test done for sub periods, <b>co-integration</b> relation among variables is fixed. Because existence of <b>co-integration</b> requires at least one Granger causality in the system, causality relation among variables is seen in the results of analysis done...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the asymptotic and finite sample {{properties of the}} most widely used information criteria for <b>co-integration</b> rank determination in ‘partial’ systems, i. e. in co-integrated Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models where a sub-set of variables of interest is modeled conditional on another sub-set of variables. The asymptotic properties of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HQC) are established, and consistency of BIC and HQC is proved. No- tably, consistency of BIC and HQC is robust to violations of the hypothesis of weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables with respect to the <b>co-integration</b> parameters. More precisely, BIC and HQC recover the true <b>co-integration</b> rank from the partial system analysis also when the conditional model does not convey all information about the <b>co-integration</b> parameters. This result opens up interesting possibilities for practitioners who can determine the <b>co-integration</b> rank in partial systems without being concerned with the weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables. A Monte Carlo experiment which considers large systems as data generating process shows that BIC and HQC applied in partial systems perform reasonably well in small samples and comparatively better than ‘traditional’ approaches for <b>co-integration</b> rank determination. We further show the usefulness of our approach and the benefits of the conditional system anal- ysis to <b>co-integration</b> rank determination with two empirical illustrations, both based on the estimation of VAR systems on U. S. quarterly data. Overall, our analysis clearly shows that the gains of combining information criteria with partial systems analysis are indisputable...|$|E

30|$|The {{presence}} of an error-correction term {{among a number of}} co-integrated variables shows that changes in the dependent variable is a function of both the level of disequilibrium in the <b>co-integration</b> relationship (represented by the ECM) and the changes in other explanatory variables. This therefore implies that any deviation from the long-run equilibrium will feed back into the changes in the dependent variable, thereby forcing the movement towards the long-run equilibrium (Masih, 2002).

40|$|Abstract. With {{the method}} of <b>co-integration,</b> the {{relationships}} between GDP and the total water use from 1980 to 2009 in the Weihe River basin are studied. The results {{show that there is}} a <b>co-integration</b> relation with a long time between GDP and the total water use. Foreword It goes without saying that water resources is indispensable to the development of GDP, however, whether both of them have a relationship of coordination and stability over long and short periods of time, it still need us to have a further study. The traditional regression equation is a model approach to study the intrinsic relationship between two variables, but subject to the requirements of stationarity of the data, it easily leads to “spurious regression”, and it can’t reflects the long and short periods relationship between variables.

Linear <b>co-integration</b> test is analyzed by the bound test approach, developed by Pesaran, Shin and Smith (2001), that does not need to be applied to the series that are stationary at the same level. Whereas, nonlinear <b>co-integration</b> analysis is investigated by Breitung (2001) rank test. Additionaly, because series has a structural break in trend in February 2001, analyzes are also employed for sub-periods. The empirical findings suggest there is a <b>co-integration</b> relationship between exchange rates and stock price index in the long run. This relationship is positive in long run and negative in short run. The direction of the relationship is from exchange rates to stock prices. Therefore, for Turkish Economy the "traditional approach” describing the relationship between stock prices and exchange rates is valid. ...|$|E
