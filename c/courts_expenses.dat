Most attorneys who practice collaborative divorce claim {{that it can be}} more cost-effective than other divorce methods, e.g., going to <b>court.</b> <b>Expense,</b> they say, has to be looked at under the headings of financial and emotional. Also, the experience of working collaboratively tends to improve communication between the parties, particularly when collaborative coaches are involved, and the possibility of going back to court post-separation or divorce is minimized.

The first meeting took place on 22 February 1787, nine days after the death of Vergennes on 13 February. Marie Antoinette did not attend the meeting and her absence resulted in accusations that the queen was trying to undermine its purpose. The Assembly was a failure. It did not pass any reforms and, instead, fell into a pattern of defying the king. On the urging of the queen, Louis XVI dismissed Calonne on 8 April 1787.|$|R

2500|$|France's {{financial}} problems {{were the result}} of a combination of factors: several expensive wars; a large royal family whose expenditures were paid for by the state; and an unwillingness on the part of most members of the privileged classes, aristocracy and clergy, to help defray the costs of the government out of their own pockets by relinquishing some of their financial privileges. As a result of the public perception that she had single-handedly ruined the national finances, Marie Antoinette was given the nickname of [...] "Madame Déficit" [...] in the summer of 1787. While the sole fault for the financial crisis did not lie with her, Marie Antoinette was the biggest obstacle to any major reform effort.

This action-crime genre film revolves around Durgaa, a soft-spoken girl who is exploited by various men in her life.

Durgaa sees her husband romancing and sleeping with other girls. Her husband tries to get Durgaa into trouble by hatching a plan to get her name tagged as a prostitute. She is then accused of murdering an innocent girl but seeks the help of a senior good looking man (Pran) to bear her <b>court</b> <b>expenses</b> so that she can fight the injustice against her. She is introduced to Mohan Babu (Rajesh Khanna), who has the reputation of winning every case he handles and so is hired as the advocate representing Durgaa. But Durgaa is not aware of the motive of the old man in helping her. The rest of the story is why Mohan was hired as the advocate by that old man, what the motive of the old man helping Durgaa was, will Durgaa ever forgive her husband, who murdered the girl etc. In the end Durgaa takes revenge on the devils in her life. Rajesh Khanna plays the savior of Durgaa in the last 50 minutes of the film, playing the Advocate representing Durgaa in court, and marries Durgaa in the end.The music is by Sonik Omi.|$|R
