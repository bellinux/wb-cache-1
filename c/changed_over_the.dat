5|$|Details of {{the modern}} climate record are known through the taking of {{measurements}} from such weather instruments as thermometers, barometers, and anemometers {{during the past few}} centuries.

5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, {{as can be seen}} by the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of the 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|E

5|$|The {{boundaries}} of the kingdom <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> centuries. At various times, the borders reached south to the jungles of the Sundarbans on the Bay of Bengal; east to Burma; and north to the boundary of the Kamarupa kingdom in Assam. There were several Muslim invasions of the region from the 13th century onward, which culminated in Mughal dominance of the plains of the kingdom in 1733, although their rule never extended to the hill regions. The Mughals had influence over the appointment of the Tripuri kings.|$|E

Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E

5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1940, {{during the}} Blitz bombing {{campaign}} against Britain, {{it was decided}} to increase the protection of the Cabinet War Rooms by the installation of a massive layer of concrete known as 'the Slab'. Up to 5 feet (1.5 metres) thick, the Slab was progressively extended and by spring 1941 the increased protection had enabled the Cabinet War Rooms to expand to three times their original size. While the usage of many of the War Rooms' individual rooms <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of the war, the facility included dormitories for staff, private bedrooms for military officers and senior ministers, and rooms for typists or telephone switchboard operators.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} ADF {{personnel}} has <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last 20 years. During the 1990s {{the strength of}} the ADF was reduced from around 70,000 to 50,000 permanent personnel as a result of budget cuts and the commercialisation of some elements of the military. The ADF began to grow from 2000 after the defence white paper released that year called for an expansion to the military's strength, though the size of the military decreased between the 2003–04 to 2005–06 financial due to problems with attracting further recruits. By 2009–10 the ADF was above its budgeted size, leading to reductions until 2014–15. The ADF has not met its recruitment targets over the period since the 1995–96 financial year.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} of matter and energy have <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> history of the Universe. Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume. The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, everyone in the office is excited when international promos for the documentary surface, but are soon horrified to discover how much candid filming has taken place. While everyone panics about their secrets being revealed, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reflects upon how much she and Jim (John Krasinski) have <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> past nine years. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) makes Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) jealous when he starts dating a Brussels sprout farmer. Meanwhile, at Athlead's office in Philadelphia, Jim and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) have a big meeting with baseball player Ryan Howard, who pitches a bizarre sci-fi sports movie about himself.|$|E

5|$|Scheduling of {{the series}} <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of its development. The first {{announcement}} {{of the series}} in May 2010 stated it would be broadcast during the spring 2011, but by August it was announced it would be moved up to the autumn schedule, before it was ultimately settled to broadcast in February 2011. The series premiere received overnight ratings of 967,000 viewers and a 4 per cent audience share. It became the second largest multichannel audience of the night, behind a repeat of EastEnders on BBC Three, which was seen by 1.061 million. The consolidated ratings for the first episode raised to 1.61 million viewers, which made the episode the second largest multichannel audience in its week, behind an episode of Glee on E4. It also became the 17th highest rated programme ever for Sky1. Overnight ratings declined steadily to 802,000 by episode two, and 691,000 by episode three. The first series finale went up to 938,000 viewers. The second series premiered on Sky1 on 19 January 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal has <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals {{had been known}} to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans {{and the destruction of}} the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E
