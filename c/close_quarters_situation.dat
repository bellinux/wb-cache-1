5000|$|Imminent {{collision}} alert: It may be warranted to urgently {{attempt to}} make radio contact with an approaching vessel that is running into danger or approaching a dangerous <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>situation</b> and therefore at risk of colliding with one's own vessel, and warning the operator to keep clear. This would be a 'bridge-to-bridge' communication and {{could be done in}} combination with sounding the [...] "your intentions are unclear or not understood" [...] sound signal, which is 5 or more short horn or whistle blasts, the 'danger signal'. A short blast is 1 second long, compared to a prolonged blast of 5 seconds duration under the COLREGS. An urgent warning could also be given over the radio, for example, if the called vessel appears to be unaware that it is potentially or at risk of endangering a person in a small boat or a person swimming, such as running the person down. A loud hailer could also be used along with a radio warning.|$|E
40|$|Navigation safety has a {{huge impact}} on the world economy and our {{everyday}} lives. One navigation safety simulation model in ECDIS based on international standard format (S- 57) is put forward, which is mainly involved in route plan and route monitoring. The universal kriging interpolation is used in the route planning and to compute the water depth of any place in the sea bottom. The man-machine conversation method is taken to amend planned route to obtain autodeciding of feasibility according to ECDIS information, and the route monitoring algorithm is improved by enhancing its precision caused by screen coordinate conversion. The DCQA (distance <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>situation</b> of approach) model and TCQA (time <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>situation</b> of approach) model are adopted to judge if the <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>situation</b> or the risk of collision between own ship and target ship is emerging. All these methods are proven to be reliable through the navigation simulator made by Dalian Maritime University which is certified by DNV to class A...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a case study}} of a potential <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>situation</b> between three vessels, viewed as a case of sociotechnical work and analysed using a model of navigational assistance developed using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). A large bulk carrier finds itself in a potential <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>situation</b> with two other vessels near the entrance to a deep water channel. Uncertainty regarding the vessel's draught restricts its manoeuvrability, increasing the risk of collision and grounding. Analysis of this case illustrates how a potentially unsafe situation may be identified, communicated and resolved by the interaction between vessels and shore, thereby improving safety in everyday operations. Furthermore, it shows how FRAM may be used effectively both for modelling a work practice on a generic level, and also for understanding how work is conducted safely in a specific situation...|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} using sight-reliant shooting, which {{relies on the}} use of the sights for aiming in <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> combat <b>situations,</b> versus point shooting, which does not rely on the sights for aiming in <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> combat <b>situations,</b> has been debated since as early as 1835.|$|R
25|$|To breach doors quickly, {{battering}} rams, shotguns with breaching rounds, or explosive charges {{can be used}} {{to break}} the lock or hinges, or even demolish the door frame itself. SWAT teams also use many non-lethal munitions and weapons. These include Tasers, pepper spray canisters, shotguns loaded with bean bag rounds, Pepperball guns, stinger grenades, flash bang grenades, and tear gas. Ballistic shields are used in <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>situations</b> to provide cover for SWAT team members and reflect gunfire. Pepperball guns are essentially paint ball markers loaded with balls containing Oleoresin Capsicum ("pepper spray").|$|R
50|$|The {{one thing}} that point {{shooting}} methods {{have in common is}} that they do not rely on the sights, and they strive to increase the shooter's ability to hit targets at short range under the less-than-ideal conditions expected in <b>close</b> <b>quarters,</b> life-threatening <b>situations,</b> self-defense, and combat situations.|$|R

50|$|Small arms, {{such as the}} M249 SAW, {{have been}} {{employed}} on a squad level to provide an overwhelming volume of fire in relatively <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>situations</b> (within 100-300 yds). The idea is that a large volume of accurate suppressive fire will immobilize the enemy, degrading their ability to perform. In addition, grenade launchers such as the M79, and particularly those that can be underslung on an assault rifle, such as the M203 or M320, are used to provide units with a disproportionate amount of firepower. These weapons are useful in situations where a unit is outnumbered and needs to respond immediately with fire superiority, such as in an ambush by forces not similarly equipped.|$|R
50|$|Communicable disease {{outbreaks}} are {{no stranger to}} college campuses, due to the highly concentrated population of individuals present in a comparatively small environment. Incidents such as the H1N1 outbreaks can potentially have serious consequences on university communities if action plans to ensure preparedness for a pandemic outbreak have not been implemented. Organizing plans for campus disease outbreak scenarios can be a difficult process, due to the fluctuating nature of these biological hazards. In situations where large numbers of students reside in <b>close</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>situations,</b> key objectives to planning emergency guidelines include an emphasis on prevention and response. Prevention strategies for campus outbreaks include stringent hygiene practices to prevent contamination or infection. Preparedness {{for the possibility of}} an outbreak can include the implementation of a command hierarchy and action guidelines, in order to ensure the most effective response.|$|R
50|$|The RMb-93 is a pump-action shotgun {{designed}} and manufactured by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau of Tula, Russia. It is the baseline {{model of the}} Rys ("Lynx") series of shotguns, taking the modelname of Rys-K. The RMb-93 has been conceived as a combat weapon for Special Forces and Police units that might face <b>Close</b> <b>Quarters</b> Battle <b>situations.</b> The weapon is thus engineered to reduce size and encumbrance as much as possible.|$|R
50|$|Point {{shooting}} — {{also known}} as target- or threat-focused shooting, instinctive aiming, instinctive firing, and instinctive shooting — is a method of shooting a firearm quickly and accurately that does not rely {{on the use of}} the sights in <b>close</b> <b>quarters,</b> life-threatening <b>situations</b> where there is the greatest chance being killed. Close-quarters fighting makes it difficult to apply proper marksmanship techniques, which is why point shooting advocates a less sighting-based style of shooting.|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} in the likelihood of navigational collisions in port waters has put focus on the collision avoidance process in port traffic safety. The most widely used on-board collision avoidance system is the automatic radar plotting aid which is a passive warning system that triggers an alert based on the pilot’s pre-defined indicators of distance and time proximities at the closest point of approaches in encounters with nearby vessels. To better help pilot in decision making in <b>close</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>situations,</b> collision risk {{should be considered as}} a continuous monotonic function of the proximities and risk perception should be considered probabilistically. This paper derives an ordered probit regression model to study perceived collision risks. To illustrate the procedure, the risks perceived by Singapore port pilots were obtained to calibrate the regression model. The results demonstrate that a framework based on the probabilistic risk assessment model can be used to give a better understanding of collision risk and to define a more appropriate level of evasive actions...|$|R
40|$|Accidents at sea {{are today}} much more rare than in present days. Improvement in {{technical}} reliability {{is a large}} reason for that. And also innovation in systems that aid the human in decision-making. These systems can be technical (like the GPS and AIS), but can also be organizational (like Traffic Separation Schemes and Safety Management Systems). Still accidents occur. IMOs e-Navigation concept aims at collecting, integrating, exchanging and presenting information to aid the awareness of dangerous situations and the analysis of risk situations. One such attempt is the route exchange concept developed in the EU projects EfficenSea, MONALISA and ACCSEAS. The idea is that by coordinating routes from all vessels in an area, <b>close</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>situations</b> can be predicted and avoided at an early stage. A prototype system has previously been built and tested in simulator trials with Swedish mariners with good results. This paper presents a ship trial in Korea with Korean cadets and experienced bridge officers. The tests showed no cultural differences and good acceptance to the suggested system. Some important concerns were also expressed...|$|R
5000|$|The C7A1 (Diemaco C7FT) {{replaces the}} iron sight/carrying handle {{used on the}} C7 with a {{modified}} Weaver rail for mounting optics. Canadian development of rails preceded U.S. standardization of the MIL-STD-1913 [...] "Picatinny rail", so the [...] "Canadian Rail" [...] or [...] "Diemaco Rail" [...] differs slightly. There are 14 slots instead of 13, and each slot is narrower. The height of the rail is also higher, allowing the use of normal-height front sight post whereas a Picatinny rail {{requires the use of}} a higher F-marked front sight post. During development, the original rails were vacuum-bonded {{to the top of a}} bare receiver. For production, the rail and receiver were made out of a single forging. The mount can use traditional iron sights or the ELCAN C79 Optical Sight 3.4× power optical sight, both of which can be adjusted for individual eye relief. The optical sight was designed for the C9 light machine gun and includes horizontal and vertical mil-bars used for range determination and deflection, and a tritium glow-in-the-dark aiming post rather than the traditional crosshairs. The 3.4× is powerful enough to properly see targets at the maximum accurate range of 400 m, though like most magnified optical sights it is prone to criticism for creating tunnel vision in <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>situations.</b> While the wide aperture helps to speed target acquisition, Canadian soldiers generally forgo the C79 sight in favour of non-magnified optical sights or backup iron sights when engaged or training in <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> battle. The front sight was changed from the square post to a round post 0.05 in in diameter.|$|R
40|$|Sea Traffic Management, STM, is a newly {{developed}} concept {{that will be}} validated and implemented in the near future. The concept aims to enhance safety at sea, improve the efficiency and reduce {{the environmental impact of}} the transportation of goods in the maritime industry. This is to be accomplished by an increase of the information exchange between all the actors involved in the concept. In order to investigate how the implementation of the concept will affect the safety at sea for marine traffic a System safety analysis is conducted. The analysis has identified hazards, risks and measures to mitigate accidents that might occur in the concept. System safety is a process commonly used to enhance safety in hazardous operations such as nuclear, chemistry process industry and in developing equipment used in a military context. The system safety process used in this thesis is mainly derived from the processes to enhance safety in the development of military systems and equipment. The results indicate that a number of areas in STM are subject to improvement regarding safety issues, such as ensuring robust routines to avoid over reliance in the system, dealing with actors not compliant to the system and ensuring that the use of the system does not lead to <b>close</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>situations</b> or exchange of incorrect data. The system safety process is regarded suitable in analysing complex systems like STM and a more thorough analysis using more resources may be beneficial in finding further areas to improve regarding safety in the concept...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the CQBR remains to provide {{operators}} with a weapon of submachine gun size, but firing a rifle cartridge, for scenarios such as VIP protection, urban warfare, and other <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> battle (CQB) <b>situations.</b> The CQBR {{is designed to provide}} improvement over previous AR-15/M16-type weapons in this category. The CQBR is usually issued as a complete weapon system, and not just an upper receiver. The CQBR was once only available to Naval Special Warfare units (and by extension, other US Special Forces units), but the Mk 18 Mod 0 has become general issue for Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) missions and, as of 2006, for NCIS agents deploying to active combat zones. The Mk 18 is also used by the Coast Guard's Tactical Law Enforcement Teams, Maritime Safety and Security Teams, and Maritime Security Response Team and the United States Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Operators. It is also used by Marine Force Recon's CQB operators, and is in most cases the standard weapons of choice for said operators where the range and accuracy of an M4 is not necessary.|$|R

50|$|Although {{there is}} {{considerable}} overlap, <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> combat is not synonymous with urban warfare, now sometimes known by the military acronyms MOUT (military operations in urban terrain), FIBUA (fighting in built-up areas) or OBUA (Operations in Built Up Areas) in the West. Urban warfare is a much larger field, including logistics {{and the role of}} crew-served weapons like heavy machine guns, mortars, and mounted grenade launchers, as well as artillery, armor, and air support. In <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> combat, the emphasis is on small infantry units using light, compact weapons that one person can carry and use easily in tight spaces, such as carbines, submachine guns, shotguns, pistols, knives, and bayonets. As such, <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> combat is a tactical concept that forms a part of the strategic concept of urban warfare, but not every instance of <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> combat is necessarily urban warfare—for example, a jungle is potentially a stage for <b>close</b> <b>quarters</b> combat.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{designed}} to approach {{the theme of the}} novel <b>Close</b> <b>Quarters,</b> which was written as the tenth novel in 1987 by William Golding, the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. For this purpose, first an attempt is made to compare the novel with the two other novels Rites of Passage and Fire Down Below, which were written respectively in 1980, 1989. <b>Close</b> <b>Quarters,</b> along with Rites of Passage and Fire Down Below, makes a trilogy whose binding theme is the making of the hero 2 ̆ 7 s soul, although each of them respectively has its own theme in it.
