5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. It is now clear the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and chordates) as was hypothesized earlier, but {{should be included in the}} Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid worms), in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the nucleotid sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe worms are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. For now, the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested to included horseshoe worms in the Brachiopoda as a class named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains one class, which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E
5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E

Contradicting these positive appraisals of the potential social impacts of new media are scholars such as Ed Herman and Robert McChesney who have suggested that the transition to new media has seen a handful of powerful transnational telecommunications corporations who achieve a level of global influence which was hitherto unimaginable.|$|E

50|$|There was {{one major}} {{misidentification}} which still causes confusion today. Acraea terpsicore, described as Papilio terpsicore by Linnaeus in 1758, {{was held to}} be the senior synonym of A. serena, described by Fabricius as Papilio serena in 1775. Hence, the former name was commonly used for that African species. But as it turned out, Linnaeus had actually described an Indian species—the well-known tawny coaster. Fabricius in 1793 believed it was new to science and described it again, as Papilio violae. <b>Consequently</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> long known as A. violae. It was also recognized that Fabricius' little-studied P. serena {{was none other than}} the orange acraea. For this, the name A. eponina, from the Papilio eponina established in the 1780 issue of Pieter Cramer's De uitlandsche Kapellen, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used all the time.

2500|$|The binding of gp120 to GalCer has {{the ability}} to start the fusion of HIV-1, but the binding of gp120 to {{sulfatide}} does not. Sulfatide is not a functional receptor. However, experiments have shown that sulfatide and GalCer compete for the ability to bind to gp120, and sulfatide has been shown to have the strongest binding affinity for recombinant gp120 of all the glycolipids tested. [...] Therefore, this suggests that when sulfatide is attached to HIV-1, it cannot interact with the chemokine co-receptor because of the instability of the complex between gp120 and sulfatide, which therefore prevents the initiation of the fusion process. This indicates that sulfatide can prevent HIV-1 infection by mediating gp120 binding, which, in turn, prevents the fusion process; <b>consequently,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> demonstrated that sulfatide treatments may lead to the inhibition of HIV-1 replication.|$|E

50|$|The scaled ground cuckoo (Neomorphus squamiger) is {{a species}} of cuckoo in the family Cuculidae.It is endemic to the Amazon {{rainforest}} near the Tapajos River in Brazil, but much confusion exists over the exact limits of its range and the features useful for separating it from the very similar rufous-vented ground cuckoo (the breast-markings of the Amazonian taxa are known to vary clinally). <b>Consequently,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> sometimes <b>been</b> considered a subspecies of the rufous-vented ground cuckoo.|$|R
60|$|The domesticated Guinea fowl is now {{believed}} by some naturalists to be {{descended from the}} Numida ptilorhynca, which inhabits very hot, and, in parts, extremely arid districts in Eastern Africa; <b>consequently</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> exposed {{in this country to}} extremely different conditions of life. Nevertheless it has hardly varied at all, except in the plumage being either paler or darker-coloured. It is a singular fact that this bird varies more in colour in the West Indies and on the Spanish Main, under a hot though humid climate, than in Europe. (8/44. Roulin makes this remark in 'Mem. de divers Savans, 1'Acad. des Sciences' tome 6 1835 page 349. Mr. Hill of Spanish Town in a letter to me describes five varieties of the Guinea fowl in Jamaica. I have seen singular pale-coloured varieties imported from Barbadoes and Demerara.) The Guinea fowl has become thoroughly feral in Jamaica and in St. Domingo (8/45. For St. Domingo see M. A. Salle, in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1857 page 236. Mr. Hill remarks to me, in his letter, on the colour of the legs of the feral birds in Jamaica.), and has diminished in size; the legs are black, whereas the legs of the aboriginal African bird are said to be grey. This small change is worth notice on account of the often-repeated statement that all feral animals invariably revert in every character to their original type.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{electric}} traction drive systems on {{basis of the}} induction motors fed by the static converters have lead to remarkable performances for the urban electric trains, concerning both the train dynamics and the environment issues. Moreover, the power converters {{on the basis of}} high techniques in the control electronics and the efficient anti-skidding systems have ensured the optimum traction characteristics and the minimum of the energy consumption. But, in case of the underground electric metro operation it is necessary to estimate the environmental impacts of the mechanical brake unrecovered energy, particularly the amount of the material developed (the brake blocks wear) in the mechanical brake process. Because this mechanical braking energy can be considered equal (as value) to the electrical energy (the active component) of the starting process, in the paper <b>had</b> <b>been</b> simulated a transient starting regime, using MATLAB software and SIMULINK-Sim Power Systems Extensions. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> evaluated the active braking material wear (the brake shoes wear) in the underground metro mechanical braking process, which has important environmental impacts.
