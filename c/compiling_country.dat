40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to present a {{conceptual}} model explaining relationship between Country competitiveness and technology-intensive innovative enterprises. Methodological aspects of <b>compiling</b> <b>Country's</b> competitiveness through the Technology-Intensive Innovative Enterprises Index are presented. Fundamental groups of factors country's competitiveness of the technology-intensive innovative enterprises aspect were identified. Analysis is based on a systematic approach characterized by identification separating factors of country competitiveness through the aspect of technology-intensive innovative enterprises and determining links between them and their groups. For evaluation of mentioned groups weigh coefficients, was applied a method of questionnaire. The coincidence of the opinions of experts participating in the poll was evaluated using Kendall's coefficient of concordance. Characterizing factors of Country's competitiveness through the technology-intensive innovative enterprises index were determined and their values were rated. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to attain more precise evaluative results...|$|R

The 1994 Oslo Agreement, signed {{by the government and}} the left wing guerrillas known as the National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity (URNG), established the legal mandate of the United Nations’ Historical Clarification Commission (CEH in Spanish). 3 Without having the capacity to prosecute, the Commission’s main goal was to <b>compile</b> the <b>country’s</b> official record by piecing together its history of war atrocities. The mandate called for everyone who had knowledge about killings, forced disappearances or torture during the war, regardless of their role, to tell their war stories to prevent the past from repeating itself. Eventually, it was assumed, the record would contribute to challenging the State’s widespread impunity and to achieving justice. Yet, it was told primarily by victims, leaving behind a legacy of collective silences, as I suggest in this brief essay...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), now in its fourth year of operations, is to provide aid to developing countries that have demonstrated a commitment to ruling justly, encouraging economic freedom, and investing in people. MCC provides assistance to eligible countries through multiyear compact agreements to fund specific programs targeted at reducing poverty and stimulating economic growth. MCC has received appropriations for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 totaling more than $ 7. 5 billion and has set aside about $ 6. 4 billion of this amount for compact assistance. As of August 2008, MCC had signed compacts with 18 countries totaling approximately $ 6. 3 billion; of the 18 signed compacts, 11 compacts had entered into force, obligating a total of approximately $ 3 billion. The President has requested an additional $ 2. 225 billion for MCC for fiscal year 2009, of which MCC plans to use $ 1. 88 billion for compact assistance to countries currently eligible for compacts. To develop these fact sheets, we compiled and summarized publicly available data {{from a number of}} sources, including our previous reporting on MCC. We used information from the World Bank and from Central Intelligence Agency Fact Books to provide a general overview of each country and its economy. To develop timelines of key compact events, we analyzed MCC data from its country quarterly status reports and our previous reporting. To summarize country performance on MCC selection criteria, we (1) compared World Bank data on per capita incomes with MCC's income eligibility thresholds published in its annual candidate country reports and (2) <b>compiled</b> <b>country</b> performance on MCC policy indicators from MCC's annual candidate country scorecards and eligible country reports. To summarize the compact and its project plans, we reviewed and analyzed MCC's compacts, compact summaries, and monitoring and evaluation plans. These summaries reflect the compact structure and expectations at the time of compact signature and do not incorporate any subsequent compact restructuring. Finally, to analyze compact obligations, disbursements, and commitments, we compiled public information from MCC's quarterly reports on obligations and disbursements published in the Federal Register and from MCC's quarterly country status reports. The planned disbursements we report are based on MCC's projections at compact signature and on the assumption that compact funds are disbursed evenly throughout the compact implementation year. Descriptions of any compact restructuring, included in our discussions of compact implementation, are based on MCC and compact country documents. To clarify and confirm our understanding of this information, we submitted written questions to MCC officials. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} Bayesian {{estimation}} method applied to an extended set of national accounts data and estimates of approximately 2500 variables. The method {{is based on}} conventional national accounts frameworks as <b>compiled</b> by <b>countries</b> in Central America, in particular Guatemala, and on concepts that are defined in the international standards of the System of National Accounts. Identities between the variables are exactly satisfied by the estimates. The method uses ratios between the variables as Bayesian conditions, and introduces prior reliabilities of values of basic data and ratios as criteria to adjust these values {{in order to satisfy}} the conditions. The paper not only presents estimates and precisions, but also discusses alternative conditions and reliabilities, in order to test the impact of framework assumptions and carry out sensitivity analyses. These tests involve, among others, the impact on Bayesian estimates of limited annual availability of data, of very low reliabilities (close to non-availability) of price indices, of limited availability of important administrative and survey data, and also the impact of aggregation of the basic data. We introduce the concept of `tentative' estimates that are close to conventional national accounts estimates, in order to establish a close link between the Bayesian estimation approach and conventional national accounting. ...|$|R

It is found that stock prices generally have predictive ability, but with substantial variation across countries. Moreover, stocks are substantially better leading indicators of investment than either GDP or consumption. Despite their value as leading indicators, however, stock prices do not generally increase forecasting ability as measured by root mean squared error in out-of-sample forecasting equations. ...|$|R
