40|$|The {{destruction}} of the cotton crop residues (cotton stalks) is a mandatory procedure in Brazil for prophylactic issues, but is a subject unexplored by the research and there are few studies that deal with this issue. However, this is not encouraged in recent decades, studies aimed at developing and evaluating equipment for this purpose. The present study had the objective to evaluate six methods for mechanical {{destruction of}} cotton crop residues. Each method was defined {{based on the principle}} of operation of the active parts of the equipment, which were tested in medium texture soil and in a clayey one. The variables used to evaluate the efficiency of the equipment were the regrowth rate, the theoretical field capacity and energy demand. The equipment with convergent <b>concave</b> <b>disks</b> (DCC) and flat cutters discs from manufacturer A (CPS-a) showed the best results in cotton stalks destruction in both soil types. The harrow disc (GPD) was efficient only in clay soil. It was concluded that the equipment with convergent <b>concave</b> <b>disks,</b> among those tested, was the most efficient to destroy cotton stalks, regardless of soil type, and that the harrow disc was not included among the best performers...|$|R
40|$|Kogo and Wagemans {{provide an}} {{intriguing}} way of assigning a polarity value to closed edges in fragmented images (solving the border ownership problem), but their model lacks generality and disregards connectability as a relevant aspect of visual completion. The lack of generality depends on considering <b>concave</b> <b>disk</b> sectors (pacmen) {{as the main}} inducers of illusory contours. Connectability is crucial for defining the occurrence, the salience and the shape of completed contours. A complete theory of completion should integrate border ownership and connectability, rather than emphasizing one aspect over the other...|$|R

6000|$|I {{will not}} enter on many more details; but I must remark that the curious {{structure}} of the northern Maldiva atolls receives (taking into consideration the free entrance of the sea through their broken margins) a simple explanation in the upward and outward growth of the corals, originally based both on small detached reefs in their lagoons, such as occur in common atolls, and on broken portions of the linear marginal reef, such as bounds every atoll of the ordinary form. I cannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these complex structures--a great sandy and generally <b>concave</b> <b>disk</b> rises abruptly from the unfathomable ocean, with its central expanse studded and its edge symmetrically bordered with oval basins of coral-rock just lipping {{the surface of the}} sea, sometimes clothed with vegetation, and each containing a lake of clear water! ...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} numerically {{the shadows of}} a compact object with {{magnetic}} dipole through the technique of backward ray-tracing. The presence of magnetic dipole yields that the dynamical system of photon motion is non-integrable, which affects sharply {{the shadow of the}} compact object. For the case with the smaller magnetic dipole parameter, the shape of shadow is a disk as in the usual static black hole spacetimes. The size of shadow decreases with the magnetic dipole parameter. For the case with the larger magnetic dipole parameter, we find that the shadow becomes a <b>concave</b> <b>disk</b> with eyebrows and it possesses a self-similar fractal structure arising from chaotic lensing. With the increase of magnetic dipole parameter, the eyebrows becomes long and the fractal structure becomes more rich. Our result show that the spacetime properties arising from the magnetic dipole yields the novel patterns for the shadow casted by a compact object with magnetic dipole.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the geometrical {{investigation of a}} three-dimensional dovetail joint that can lead (timber) frame construction to more than two-dimensional frames; the creation of timber construction with timber members meeting at irregular angles can {{be shown to be}} feasible, simplifying overall construction. Traditional joints in timber construction usually work only in two dimensions, in other words in planar surfaces, resulting thus in complicated assemblies in three-dimensions. Stemming from traditional timber dovetail joints, the universal joint under investigation is produced under revolution of the geometry of a dovetail fastener through its middle axis. The resulting <b>concave</b> <b>disk</b> can connect timber elements under irregular angles, without the need for the structural members to lie in the same plane. The joint works due to friction between members rather than using any other element of bonding, allowing for the assembly of joints and structural members with no specialized tools. The paper explores the geometric constraints and degrees of freedom that such a disk creates in timber construction, and consequently in similar linear construction systems...|$|R

DLR Lampoldshausen carried out tests to examine the flow field in a truncated ideal contour nozzle for low NPR. For NPR 20 a slight <b>concave</b> shaped Mach <b>disk</b> was found. Its curvature {{is limited to the}} centre and its height trend correlates with measured side loads. A <b>concave</b> shaped Mach <b>disk</b> being responsible for re-attached flows at low NPR could be excluded. The experiments were accompanied by numerical simulations of the flow field on various pressure ratios with regards on the shock pattern.

50|$|Once {{an ideal}} cooking heat is reached on the disk (usually medium to low heat works best) the first meat to be {{introduced}} is the bacon. This is placed {{at the center of}} the <b>concave</b> <b>disk</b> where the heat is concentrated. The natural fat from the bacon will prevent the meats from sticking. Beer or dark cola is added to create a broth for simmering the meats which also acts as a non stick agent. The bacon is placed away from direct heat onto the side of the disk once its cooked, and the sausage links are introduced to the remaining broth. As each piece of meat is removed from the direct heat, the meat's natural juices and the beer or cola create a broth for the next meat piece {{to be introduced}} to. Once cooked, the sausage is also set aside and the ham is added. The ham is set aside, and the chorizo is added next. The beef as well as the cook's choice of seasoning is finally added to the collective broth. Each meat is cooked for about 10 to 15 minutes. The beef is covered with a lid during the cooking process to contain its natural flavor and juices. The lid is then removed to allow the broth to reduce, and the meats can now be combined with the beef and the collective broth from the different meats. The onions, peppers, and tomatoes are chopped and added to the mix providing the dish with color and the meats with flavor.|$|R
40|$|Emission from {{neutron stars}} and {{accretion}} disks in low-mass X-ray binaries is not isotropic. The non-spherical {{shape of the}} disk as well as blocking of the neutron star by the disk and vice versa cause the observed flux {{to depend on the}} inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. This is of special importance for the interpretation of Type I X-ray bursts, which are powered by the thermonuclear burning of matter accreted onto the neutron star. Because part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst flux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star and reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance, mass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star equation of state. Previous studies made predictions of the anisotropy factor for the total burst flux, assuming a geometrically flat disk. Recently, detailed observations of two exceptionally long bursts (so-called superbursts) allowed for the first time for the direct and the reflected burst flux to each be measured, as opposed to just their sum. The ratio of the reflected and direct flux (the reflection fraction) was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk can account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors for different <b>disk</b> shapes, including <b>concave</b> <b>disks.</b> We present the anisotropy factors of the direct and reflected burst flux separately, as well as the anisotropy of the persistent flux. Reflection fractions substantially larger than unity are produced in case the inner accretion disk steeply increases in height, such that part of the star is blocked from view. Such a geometry could possibly be induced by the X-ray burst, if X-ray heating causes the inner disk to puff up.

40|$|Ginga {{observations}} of several bright Seyfert 1 galaxies have recently revealed the presence in their X-ray spectra {{of both the}} iron K fluorescence line and a high energy bump, which together are currently interpreted as due to the reprocessing of the primary radiation by cold matter located near the putative black hole. A number of quantitative model predictions on the reprocessed radiation, when the matter {{is assumed to be}} distributed in an accretion disk, are presented in this paper; they were obtained, on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations, for different geometries of the disk surface and of the primary X-ray source. The case of a flat disk and a point source placed above the disk on its symmetry axis is treated in greater detail, taking into account the general relativistic and kinematic effects, which have dramatic consequences on the shape of the K line and edge. These effects are less relevant for the equivalent width (W-alpha) of the line and for the strength of the high energy bump, and were therefore ignored for simplicity in computing these two quantities for other source geometries (an optically thin corona, which turns out to be well approximated by the point source, and an optically thick sphere), and for other configurations of the disk surface (conical and concave). Concerning W-alpha, its maximum value is about 150 eV for a flat, 180 eV for a conical and 230 eV for a <b>concave</b> <b>disk</b> seen face-on. Concerning the strength of the bump, {{it turns out to be}} an excellent indicator of strong deviations from the planar configuration, and it is shown that, being practically independent of the iron abundance, it can be used to constrain the abundance when used in conjunction with W-alpha. Several observational implications are discussed, in particular it is noted that the relativistic and kinematic effects on the shape of the edge might lead to a misinterpretation of low resolution measurements in terms of absorption by highly ionized iron...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} make sense of complex and {{ambiguous}} visual input, the visual system makes use of prior knowledge, or assumptions about the structure of the world. The use of these ‘priors’ is neatly incorporated into a Bayesian framework, which has been successfully employed to model many aspects of human visual perception. Priors are usually assumed to be based on observers' previous experience and the statistics of natural scenes. Little research, however, has examined how these priors are formed and adapted or how general or context-specific they are. Here we consider the ‘light from above’ prior that is used by the visual system to extract shape from shading. Observers viewed monocular disks with shading gradients at various orientations. The reported shape (convex or concave) as a function of stimulus orientation was used to recover the observer's assumed light position. During a training phase, observers could also ‘touch’ the disks. The stimulus orientations which were presented as haptically convex were consistent with a light source ± 30 ? from the observer's original assumed light position. Following the training, observers again judged the stimulus shape from purely visual information. In a control experiment, observers made lightness judgements of a mach-card type stimulus, before and after haptic training with the <b>concave</b> / convex <b>disk</b> stimuli. Firstly, our results confirm that observers assume a light position that is roughly overhead. Secondly, we found that haptic information can disambiguate the shading cue. Thirdly, using haptic feedback, observers were trained to use a slightly shifted light direction for their prior. Finally, the shift in prior light source direction was not specific to the trained task, but affected visual perception in a separate lightness judgement task...|$|R
