Each thyristor tower contains a complete twelve-pulse branch of the static inverter. In these thyristor towers, for each valve function, four thyristor modules are used, which are arranged in two floors. Between the thyristor modules of a floor, there is a coil with an iron core. Parallel to the thyristor modules of a floor, there is a <b>capacitator.</b> Parallel to each valve function, there is a surge arrester {{in the form of}} a varistor.|$|E
50|$|As AC-fiters, four {{resonance}} circuits {{are installed}} {{on both sides}} of the plant. Each of the filters consist of a series-connection of a two-microfarad <b>capacitator</b> with a coil to which a 615 ohm resistor is parallelized. One filter on each side uses a 41 mH air-core coil, while the other has a 29 mH air-core coil. On each power exit, there is also a bank of capacitors for reactive power compensation. The capacitors' values are two microfarads for the exit of the line toward Czech Republic and one microfarad for the exit toward Austria.|$|E
50|$|Each {{thyristor}} module {{consists of}} a connection of 11 thyristors, to which there are parallel connections from a capacitaor and a resistor. The energy for the steering circuits of the thyristors is taken from the <b>capacitator</b> and resistor. As the thyristors and their steering electronics are on high voltage potential, the transmission of the ignition impulses from the control electronic on ground potential takes place via fibreoptical cables. A second optical waveguide cable allows the transmission of data from the thyristor module to the main control electronics on ground potential. A programmable controller of the system SIMATIC S5 is used for controlling this system.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{charging}} induced damage (CID) to metal-insulator-metal-capacitator (MIMC), is reported. The {{damage is}} caused by the build up of charges on an oxide surface during a water rinsing step. The excessive charging over a large <b>capacitator</b> area results in a discharge over the inter metal dielectric layer (IMD) towards a grounded structure. This CID leads to direct severe yield loss. The charging has been detected, measured and reduced {{with the help of a}} non contact surface potential measurement. In this way further yield losses have been prevented. A modelfor the relation between the surface charging potential and the voltage difference between the <b>capacitator</b> and the grounded structure is presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{brain is}} our most complex organ, with an {{estimated}} 1011 neurons. With the spinal cord, it forms {{the central nervous system}} which controls our movements and our senses, holds our memories and creates our thoughts. Because of this, neurodegenerative disorders can be extremely distressing and a thorough understanding of how the nervous system develops is essential if progress is to be made in finding ways to treat them. Critically, this includes understanding how the nervous system forms, i. e., the nature of the signals that promote neural identity (neural induction) and determine correct positional information (patterning). The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become established as a model for embryological studies due to ease of experimental manipulation. Taking advantage of this, the aims of this PhD were to contribute to unravelling the molecular mechanisms of neural induction and patterning, using a variety of embryological and molecular methods. In the first project, functional analyses of the eve 1 gene identified a key factor for posterior neural development. Eve 1 was found to be a critical posteriorising factor, with an additional role in posterior neural induction. An outstanding question in neural induction is the relative contribution to this process of two key developmentally important signalling pathways, Bmp and Fgf. In the second project, differential analyses of maternal versus zygotic Bmp and Fgf signalling revealed crucial maternal roles for these two pathways in neural development as neural and epidermal <b>capacitators.</b> The results further suggested that Fgf signalling may be the critical neural inducer. Finally, as a third project, a zebrafish ectodermal explant assay was developed using the organiser-deficient ichabod mutant. The aim was to develop a system to analyse how key molecules directly affect ectoderm and neural development, free of mesoderm and endoderm influences, as signalling from these layers can directly or indirectly influence neural development.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The most {{accurate}} method for performing analog signal processing in MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) integrated circuits {{is through the}} use of switched-capacitor circuits. A switched-capacitor circuit operates as a discrete-time signal processor. These circuits have been used in a variety of applications, such as filters, gain stages, voltage-controlled oscillators, and modulators. A switched-capacitor circuit contains operational amplifiers (opamps), <b>capacitators,</b> switches, and a clock generator. Capacitors are used to define the state variables of a system. They store charges for a defined time interval, and determine the state variables as voltage differences. Switches are used to direct the flow of charges and to enable the charging and discharging of capacitors. Nonoverlapping clock signals control the switches and allow charge transfer between the capacitors. Opamps are used in order to perform high-accuracy charge transfer from one capacitor to another. The goal of this research is to design and explore future low-voltage switched-capacitor circuits, which are crucial for portable devices. Low-voltage operation is needed for two reasons: making reliable and accurate systems compatible with the submicron CMOS technology and reducing power consumption of the digital circuits. To this end, three different switched-capacitor integrators are proposed, which function with very low supply voltages. One of these configurations is used to design a lowpass Δ∑ modulator for digital-audio applications. This modulator is fabricated and tested demonstrating 80 dB dynamic range with a 1 -V supply voltage. The second part of this research is to show that these low-voltage circuits are suitable for modern wireless communication applications, where the clock and signal frequencies are very high. This part of the research has focused on bandpass analog-to-digital converters. Bandpass analog-to-digital converters are among the key components in wireless communication systems. They are used to digitize the received analog signal at an intermediate center frequency. Such converters are used for digital FM or AM radio applications and for portable communication devices, such as cellular phones. The main block, in these converters, is the resonator, which is tuned to a particular center frequency. A resonator must be designed such that it has a sharp peak at a specific center frequency. However, because of circuit imperfections, the resonant peak gain and/or the center frequency are degraded in existing architectures. Two novel switched-capacitor resonators were invented during the second part of this research. These resonators demonstrate superior performance as compared to previous architectures. A fourth-order low-voltage bandpass Δ∑ modulator, using one of these resonators, has been designed...|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, venous TBR {{values were}} lower than the {{arterial}} TBR values, especially in patients off therapy. This was due to higher plasma activity in venous samples than in arterial samples. As no difference in metabolism was observed between venous and arterial samples, the higher venous plasma activity values were only caused by a higher venous concentration of parent molecules. The reason for this finding is unclear. Possibly, the interstitial compartment together with EGFR molecules that are highly expressed at the epidermal tissue compartment act as a <b>capacitator,</b> by reversibly binding [11 C]erlotinib molecules. So, venous plasma collects not only the unbound [11 C]erlotinib molecules coming from the arterio-capillary route but also the [11 C]erlotinib molecules being released from the interstitial and peripheral tissue compartments. This can also explain why patients on therapy, who have more EGFR saturation, have less veno-arterial activity difference. Another cause that may be considered {{is the fact that}} a single venous cannula was used for tracer injection and blood withdrawal, which implies that venous activity may increase due to the presence of tracer molecules that remained sticking to the cannula wall during injection. However, this mechanism is unlikely as it cannot explain why the veno-arterial difference was higher in off therapy than on therapy. Nevertheless, venous sampling was found to be suitable for interlesional quantitative comparison using TBR, as long as venous values are not interchanged together with arterial values.|$|E
