Intensive selection for production traits, especially growth rate, {{is associated with}} increased nutritious requirement and thus feed consumption, but also reproductive dysfunctions and decreased sexual activity in broiler breeders. A first resulting serious welfare problem is the subsequent severe feed restriction which is applied during rearing, {{in order to prevent}} health problems and to reach better egg production. This severe feed restriction has negative effects on bird welfare as it causes chronic stress resulting from hunger. The use of normal fast growing broiler breeder hens require dedicated programmes of feed restriction, both to maximise egg and <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> and secondly to avoid metabolic disorders and mortality in broiler breeders. The negative correlation between muscle growth and reproduction effectiveness is known as the [...] "broiler breeder paradox".

This is why Nigeria still depends mainly on imported breeds of chicken for commercial production of chicken. In this study, the influence of Early Wet (EW), Late Wet (LW) and Early Dry (ED) and Late Dry (LD) seasons on reproductive parameters of Bovan Nera (BN) and Isa Brown (IB) parent-stock chickens were studied in the humid South-West Nigeria.

40|$|Complete egg {{production}} {{data from a}} pair breeding flock located in South Africa were used to generate annual reproductive records for all hens exposed to breeding. Traits analysed included measures of total egg and <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> and related traits, along with egg and chick weights. Both genetic and non-genetic factors significantly influenced reproductive performance. Seasonal effects, duration of the breeding season, hen age, and individual variation between hens were the key factors affecting total {{egg production}} and related measures. Variation between individual males, and their age, was important for traits related to egg fertility. With the exception of measures for clutching behaviour and fertility, which exhibited no additive variation, heritability estimates ranged between 0. 07 ± 0. 08 to 0. 19 ± 0. 10 for egg and <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> traits.

40|$|Fennoscandian grouse {{populations are}} facing habitat {{degradation}} {{and are in}} decline, though not {{to the same degree}} as in western and central Europe. To be able to identify factors causing population decline and initiate proper management actions, a well functioning monitoring program and management are essential. In this thesis I have used datasets on capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan. The datasets were sampled through large scale monitoring programs by volunteers. The volunteers were mainly hunters that already had field-experience and knowledge of grouse, and could do the work at low cost and with few logistical problems. I found that using a GPS to measure perpendicular distances less than 50 m from line transects reduced the reliability of the density estimates. Adding covariates such as habitat (open or closed), and flushed by dog or handler, improved the models of density estimates. In non-systematic sampling designs where hunters were free to go wherever they wanted during sampling, I found little bias in the habitat selection of hunters compared to that of capercaillie and black grouse, probably caused by the diversity in habitat use among the hunters. This indicates that such sampling of data can also provide unbiased indices of population density, given a sufficiently high number of hunters is used for monitoring. Based on the adult density and <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> from the density estimates, I found a positive relationship between the heterogeneity of the landscape and both adult density and <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> of capercaillie and black grouse. Forest of moderate to high productivity had a positive effect on adult density of both species while contrary to expectation the proportion of old forest seemed to {{have a negative effect on}} <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> of both species. I did not detect any clear relationship between willow ptarmigan and habitat at either the individual or the landscape scale. However, at the population scale habitat relationships were detected. Together, these results suggest that methods for monitoring grouse species are quite reliable, but could be improved by rather simple additions. Moreover, habitat composition seems to generate differences in demographic rates and population densities among populations, but these are not detectable at the individual or landscape scale. This suggests that management of grouse species should be done at a scale that captures the heterogeneity in the landscape, most likely over larger areas...|$|E

But, the success of hens in early successional CRP, relative to late successional CRP and other grassland habitats, {{has yet to be}} evaluated. The reproductive period is especially critical for populations of pheasants, and CRP’s benefits to hens and chicks may decrease as fields age because of loss of vegetative diversity, decrease in vegetation density, and accumulation of residual litter. During 2005 – 2006, we evaluated spatial and temporal variation in nest and brood survival for radio-marked hen pheasants in areas of northeastern Nebraska where portions of CRP fields had been recently disced and interseeded (DICRP) with legumes. Nests in DICRP tended to have a higher daily survival rate (0. 984; 95 % CI: 0. 957 – 0. 994) than nests in grasslands (including CRP) that were unmanaged (0. 951; 95 % CI: 0. 941 – 0. 972). The probability of 23 -day nest success was 0. 696 (95 % CI: 0. 631 – 0. 762) for DICRP and 0. 314 (95 % CI: 0. 240 – 0. 389) for unmanaged grasslands. Daily brood survival rates varied by habitat type, brood age, and date of hatch. The probability of a brood surviving to day 21 was 0. 710 (95 % CI: 0. 610 – 0. 856). Brood survival rates increased with time spent in DICRP and as the brood aged. Survival decreased as broods spent more time in cropland and peaked seasonally with broods that hatched on 15 June. Brood survival probability, to 21 days, would be reduced to 0. 36 (95 % CI: 0. 100 – 0. 701) if broods in our sample had not used DICRP. We combined nest and brood survival in a productivity model that suggested 2, 000 hens, in a landscape with no DICRP, would produce 1, 826 chicks, whereas the same hens in a landscape of 100 % DICRP would produce 5, 398 <b>chicks.</b> <b>Production</b> of first-year roosters more than doubled when hens nested in DICRP.

40|$|The {{high rate}} of {{embryonic}} mortality during artificial incubation of ostrich eggs {{is a major concern}} in the ostrich industry. Data from 48 126 individual egg records were available to derive genetic parameters for embryonic mortalities, modelled as a trait of the individual egg. Embryonic mortality was classified according to stage of death, i. e. early embryonic mortality that occurred before 21 days of incubation (EEM), late embryonic mortality that occurred after 21 days of incubation (LEM) and overall embryonic mortalities (OEM). LEM increased significantly for eggs laid by females > 10 years old. Transfer of eggs between incubators during incubation also impaired hatchability. An increase in OEM occurred for eggs freshly set (43 %) as well as for eggs stored for more than 6 days (50 %). Medium heritability (h 2) estimates were derived for all the embryonic death traits and ranged between 0. 16 ± 0. 02 for LEM and 0. 22 ± 0. 03 for EEM. The dam permanent environmental effect was low ranging between 0. 021 ± 0. 005 for LEM and 0. 046 ± 0. 008 for EEM. Hatchability of fertile ostrich eggs may consequently be improved by removing older females from breeding flocks, setting of eggs between 2 and 6 days after collection, and by refraining to transfer of eggs between incubators during incubation. Moderate h 2 estimates indicate that breeding may be used as a tool to enhance <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> in ostriches.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) was {{investigated}} {{for its ability}} to induce amino acid release from immature <b>chick</b> retina. The <b>production</b> of endogenous NO by activation of NO synthase after stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor caused a significant increase in basal release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamine, whereas a more modest increase in the glutamate release was also observed. The exposure of chick retina from 9 -day-old embryos to NO-generating compounds, S-nitroso-N-acetylpe-nicillamine (SNAP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) produced a dose dependent increase in GABA, glutamine, and glutamate release. This effect was reduced by about 80 % by haemoglobin. These results indicate that NO has a stimulatory effect on amino acid release from chick embryo immature retina. However, this effect does not appear to involve a cGMP-related mechanism because 8 -bromo-cGMP, a stable analogue of cGMP, failed to affect spontaneous amino acid release and because zaprinast did not enhance NMDA-stimulated release. In conclusion, our present observations may account for a role of NMDA-mediated events in the biochemical maturation under depolarizing conditions...|$|R

40|$|Adequate and {{appropriate}} nutrition {{is essential for}} the production of high quality commercially farmed animal species. Although South Africa has had a well-established ostrich industry for over a century, little information on ostrich nutrition, in particular the specific nutritional requirements at different stages of production, is available. The industry has consequently relied heavily on data derived from poultry and pigs, but this has often proved to be unsatisfactory for ostriches and has resulted in serious nutritional-related problems. Recent studies on the metabolisable energy of specific components of diet formulations and balanced diets have indicated that ostriches have enhanced digestibility compared with poultry and pigs. At the same time, in the present economic climate, it is necessary to find cost-effective diets for breeding birds without compromising egg and <b>chick</b> <b>production.</b> This study primarily assessed the effect of different dietary protein and energy levels on production parameters and body condition of breeding female and male ostriches. The energy content of the diet appears to be the main constraint to egg production and breeders on low energy diets laid fewer eggs and lost more body condition compared with breeders fed higher energy diets. A diet with 8. 5 MJ/kg DM and 10 % protein with well balanced amino acids appears to be sufficient for female breeders without compromising production and a diet with 7. 5 MJ/kg DM and 10 % protein appears suitable for breeding male ostriches. Different dietary energy and protein levels similarly had little or no effect on egg quality and composition. This study also assessed the carry-over effect of the nutritional regime in one year on the production in the following breeding season. Females fed diets as low as 7. 5 MJ/kg ME in the previous breeding season produced significantly fewer eggs in the next breeding season, which resulted in lower <b>chick</b> <b>production.</b> Energy had no effect on the percentage infertile eggs or on the initial egg weight.

The author studied on the growth of <b>chicks,</b> the egg <b>production</b> and feed consumption by raising 203 day old commercial chicks produced in Hy-line farm, U. S. A. The studies were conducted for 500 days from October 17 th, 1962 to February 28 th, 1964. The records were as follows. 1. Mortality to 150 days 3. 0 ％ 2. Mortality from 150 days to 500 days of age 1. 5 ％ 3. Days of age to 50 ％ egg production 157 days 4. Hen day production from age of 50 ％ production to 500 days of age 74. 3 ％ 5. Average number of eggs per pullet housed to 500 days of age 253. 8 eggs 6. Weight per one egg 57. 7 g 7. Body weight at the age of 50 ％ production 1730 g 8. Body weight {{at the end of the}} test 1847 g 9. Feed consumption per pullet to days of 50 ％ production 10. 6 kg 10. Feed per one kilogram of eggs produced 2. 5 kg The above records show rather better results as compared with those obtained in the, United States of America, Canada, and Japan. It can be safe to say that Okinawa is good place for raising chickens, though the Islands are located in the subtropical area...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the spring}} arrival dates of migrant birds have been {{reported}} {{from a range of}} locations and many authors have focused on long-term trends and their relationship to temperature and other climatic events. Perhaps more importantly, changed arrival dates may have consequences for the breeding dates of birds which strongly influence breeding success. In this paper we take the opportunity provided by a monitoring scheme of the white stork (Ciconia ciconia) to examine several features of the timing of arrival and breeding in relation to <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> in Slovakia during the period 1978 – 2002. First arrival dates ranged from 5 th March to 30 th April, and hatching dates varied between 26 th April and 8 th July. Generally, early arriving pairs started breeding earlier and a shorter interval between the arrival of the first partner and breeding, expressed here as hatching date, resulted in higher breeding success...|$|E
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the spatial}} and temporal dynamics of <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> of willow grouse "Lagopus lagopus" in the Swedish and Norwegian mountain region using harvest data covering 24 - 38 years and line-transect counts covering 6 - 10 years from the period 1960 - 2003. Juvenile and adult grouse were counted in the bag of harvested willow grouse in late August and throughout September at six sites in Sweden and Norway. In addition, numbers of juvenile and adult willow grouse were obtained from ine-transect counts at 21 sites in Sweden just before the hunting season started on 25 August. The juvenile:adult ratio from the harvest data, estimated as number of juveniles per two adults, showed similar long-term averages and distributions between all six sites. The results from the line-transect counts revealed an overall higher average and a greater range of production between sites. We suggest {{that the difference between}} estimates based on line-transect counts and harvest data are caused by hunter behaviour. Hunters did not sample the juvenile and adult grouse in proportion to what was present in the population, e. g., productivity estimates derived from harvest samples will underestimate the proportion of juveniles in autumn in most years. We suggest that it is the harvest process that acts to adjust the juvenile to old bird ratio in the harvest data to a similar distribution in different sites. We found little evidence of regular fluctuations/cycles in annual production of juveniles from either harvest data or line-transect data. We conclude that <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> in willow grouse appears to fluctuate more irregularly than was previously believed based on harvest data and can not be used as a potential forecasting tool in willow grouse management as suggested earlier. Spatial correlation was weak and investigating {{only a limited number of}} sites to predict the proportion of juveniles in autumn should not be considered as a management tool for large areas such as the state-owned land in Sweden. Line-transect counts are costly, but do provide a more accurate estimate of the proportion of juveniles in the fall population than is revealed by harvest data. A more detailed understanding of hunter behaviour is obviously needed for better interpretation of harvest data...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] obtained from a pair-mated ostrich flock located at Oudtshoorn in South Africa were used to derive line differences for live weight and reproduction performance in sexually mature ostriches of the Zimbabwean Blue (ZB) and South African Black (SAB) strains during 2003 to 2006. At the commencement of breeding ZB breeding stock were, on average, between 9 and 13 % heavier than SAB contemporaries. At the cessation of breeding the superiority of ZB birds was reduced to between 4 and 8 %, expressed relative to SAB breeding stock. Live weight at the commencement of breeding was complicated by an interaction between sire line and year. The interaction resulted from no line differences between SAB and ZB males in 2003, contrasted to marked differences in subsequent years. Egg production was affected by dam line, but not by {{the line of the}} sire or the interaction between dam line and sire line. Egg production of SAB females was almost twice that of ZB contemporaries, at respectively 43. 3 and 23. 3 eggs per season. The number of infertile eggs was not affected by any of the independent variables considered. The number of shell deaths was affected by both sire line and dam line. Overall, SAB females sustained lower levels of shell deaths than ZB females, while the eggs produced by mates of SAB males had higher shell deaths than mates of ZB males. <b>Chick</b> <b>production</b> was affected by dam line; the effects of sire line and the dam line x sire line interaction being non significant. Overall, SAB females produced more than double the number of chicks produced by their ZB contemporaries, at respectively 23. 1 and 10. 6 chicks per season. Both egg production and <b>chick</b> <b>production</b> were affected by a dam line x year interaction. No dam line difference was observed during 2003, whereas SAB females clearly outperformed ZB females in subsequent years. Further studies on the ostrich bloodlines and their crosses are needed to devise a selection and crossbreeding strategy for improving production and profitability in the industry.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{acknowledged}} as an emerging threat for top-order marine predators, yet obtaining evidence of impacts is often difficult. In south-eastern Australia, a marine global warming hotspot, {{evidence suggests that}} climate change will profoundly affect pinnipeds and seabirds. Long-term data series are available to assess some species 2 ̆ 7 responses to climate. Researchers have measured a variety of chronological and population variables, such as laying dates, <b>chick</b> or pup <b>production,</b> colony-specific abundance and breeding success. Here, we consider the challenges in accurately assessing trends in marine predator data, using long-term data series that were originally collected for other purposes, and how these may be driven by environmental change and variability. In the past, many studies of temporal changes and environmental drivers used linear analyses and we demonstrate the (theoretical) relationship between the magnitude of a trend, its variability, and the duration of a data series required to detect a linear trend. However, species may respond to environmental change in a nonlinear manner and, based on analysis of time-series from south-eastern Australia, {{it appears that the}} assumptions of a linear model are often violated, particularly for measures of population size. The commonly measured demographic variables exhibit different degrees of variation, which influences the ability to detect climate signals. Due to their generally lower year-to-year variability, we illustrate that monitoring of variables such as mass and breeding chronology should allow detection of temporal trends earlier in a monitoring programme than observations of breeding success and population size. Thus, establishing temporal changes with respect to climate change from a monitoring programme over a relatively short time period requires careful a priori choice of biological variables. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract. 1. Field {{data on the}} {{reproductive}} performance of parent stock and grandparent female line and male line broiler breeders were extracted from a commercial database covering the years of hatch from 1989 to 2002. The data were from the UK, Western Europe, Central and South America and Japan. Quadratic regression curves were fitted to the data to estimate the long term phenotypic trends in total egg production, hatching egg <b>production,</b> <b>chick</b> numbers, hatchability and female mortality. 2. Changes in performance over time were similar in the UK, Western Europe and Central and South America and {{are consistent with the}} suggestion that genetic selection in separate breeding programmes in the UK (supplying the UK and Western Europe) and Brazil (serving Central and South America) was associated with similar improvements in the performance of commercial parent stock and grandparent flocks. Changes in performance in Japan (supplied from the UK) were different but recent performance was similar to those in the other regions. 3. The mean annual improvement over 10 years to 2002 for male line, female line and parent stock respectively were 0. 4, 1. 7 and 1. 7 for total egg number; 0. 5, 1. 8 and 1. 6 for hatching egg number; 0. 6, 1. 8 and 1. 3 for total chick production; 0. 25, 0. 47 and 0. 09 % for hatchability; and - 0. 69, - 0. 05 and - 0. 41 % for female mortality. 4. The results are consistent with claims that significant genetic change in pedigree selection (nucleus) flocks by the primary breeding company are reflected in substantial improvements in reproductive performance in commercial flocks. The presence of similar rates of improvement in different geographical regions as a result of genetic selection in two continents representing tropical and temperate regions suggests that genotype-environment interactions for reproduction traits are not important...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND To date, Regulation (EC) 1804 / 1999 and UKROFS Standards allow {{conventionally}} produced day old chicks up {{to three}} days of age to be brought into systems of organic table chicken <b>production.</b> <b>Chicks</b> must be reared {{according to the rules}} laid down in Regulation (EC) 1804 / 1999 and according to UKROFS Standards for at least 70 days before the birds may be sold as being organic. The derogation for organic breeder flocks was agreed for a transitional period expiring on 31 st December 2003. An extension to the derogation is being discussed at EU level (Article 14 Committee) but, as an interim measure, a new end date has not yet been published in the Official Journal. If chicks are to be produced from breeder flocks in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1804 / 1999 this may potentially create a number of scientific and technical problems. A series of workshops and a literature review were commissioned by Defra to provide possible solutions to these problems. OBJECTIVES 1. To organise a workshop involving key representatives of Defra, Soil Association, the poultry industry (organic and conventional), feed trade and scientific community and poultry veterinary practitioners in order to identify the important technical problems and limiting factors, and to identify possible solutions. 2. To address some of the perceived technical and scientific problems by means of a review of the scientific literature. 3. To convene a second workshop to review progress and to discuss the findings of the literature review. The second workshop also considered future research needs and mechanisms for technology transfer. The initial workshop identified factors likely to limit the success of organic breeder production, and therefore of organic table chicken production. The priority issues were: the energy balance of breeders on range; supplying protein and amino acids; the future needs for 100...|$|R
