The company decided to focus instead on heavy construction equipment and sought to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. Laden with debt and needing more capital to switch its product line, the company struggled to move forward.|$|E

Smith was elected the new leader at the convention held in Edmonton on October 17.|$|E

5|$|The {{first film}} of its genre to be {{produced}} in the Indies, Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman was made to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> popularity of Wijnhamer and Hollywood characters such as Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto. Released in April 1941 to popular acclaim, it had a mixed critical reception; the reviewer Saeroen suggested that its success was entirely because of its star's renown. A sequel to this film, which is possibly lost, Pah Wongso Tersangka, was released later that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks on}} the slopes of seamounts are heavily populated by suspension feeders, particularly corals, which <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strong currents around the seamount to supply them with food. This is in sharp contrast with the typical deep-sea habitat, where deposit-feeding animals rely on food they get off the ground. In tropical zones extensive coral growth results in the formation of coral atolls late in the seamount's life.|$|E
5|$|After Blake's funeral, Manhattan {{is accused}} on {{national}} television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the U.S. government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. As Manhattan {{is one of the}} United States' greatest military powers, his departure throws humanity into political turmoil, with the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> perceived American weakness. Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt, and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch, a former supervillain, and imprisoned.|$|E

Behavior analysts <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Solitaire escape by {{boat and}} fly to New Orleans. There, Bond is {{captured}} by Kananga. It transpires that Kananga is producing two tons of heroin and is protecting the poppy fields by exploiting San Monique locals' fear of voodoo priest Baron Samedi, and the occult. Through his alter ego, Mr. Big, Kananga plans {{to distribute the}} heroin free of charge at his Fillet of Soul restaurants, which will {{increase the number of}} addicts. He intends to bankrupt other drug dealers with his giveaway, then charge high prices for his heroin later in order to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> huge drug dependencies he has cultivated.|$|E
5|$|Bullfrog Productions {{developed}} Dungeon Keeper 2 {{with a team}} {{of around}} fifty people. The team included people involved in the original Dungeon Keeper, including Richard Ridings and programmer Alex Peters. Electronic Arts wanted to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original game's success. Producer Nick Goldsworthy believed the key to success was carrying over aspects of the original game and adding new things. A project manager from Mitsubishi assisted the team in management of attaining milestones, and according to Goldsworthy, this taught the team a lot about the practices employed by major companies regarding game development.|$|E

An incomplete pass and a rush for no gain were followed by a false start penalty and another incomplete pass, and Florida State was forced to punt. Virginia Tech recovered the ball at its 26-yard line, but failed to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defensive stop. Marcus Vick threw two incomplete passes and was sacked before Virginia Tech was forced into a punt.|$|E
5|$|In 1632, Sigismund III Vasa, {{the king}} of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, died. Russia, having {{recovered}} {{to a certain extent}} from the Time of Troubles, decided to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> temporary confusion of its western neighbor. Russia's aim was to gain control of Smolensk, which it had ceded to the Commonwealth in 1618 at the Truce of Deulino, ending the last Russo-Polish War. Smolensk was the capital of the Commonwealth's Smoleńsk Voivodeship, but it had often been contested, and it changed hands many times during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries (from the days of the Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars).|$|E
5|$|Nintendo of America's Nintendo Entertainment System was {{the best}} selling console system and almost all video game {{developers}} and publishers wanted to contribute the video game library. The NES, at its peak, controlled 90% of the 8-bit market in the United States. Companies such as Konami, Capcom and Acclaim Entertainment derived many of their gaming ideas from two sources to better <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> growing industry. The first strategy was to take games that were already popular on arcade, such as Contra, and port them to home console versions. Their second idea was to produce game versions of popular movies and television.|$|E

5|$|Perón's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favoured {{increased}} agricultural output over industrialization, but {{industrial growth}} and high wages {{in previous years}} had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as {{the majority of those}} who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón's second economic plan sought to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> country's comparative advantage in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can avoid}} attacks from their opponents by dodging {{to the left}} or right or by ducking, but players cannot punch while dodging or ducking, nor can they duck body blows. They can also block attacks to either the head or the body, but they cannot block strong punches; strong punches must be avoided by dodging or ducking. Depending on the situation, the player must {{strategically}} block, dodge, or duck in order to avoid an opponent's attack. Players can <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opponent's attacks by launching counter-punches immediately after avoiding an attack.|$|E
5|$|Song of Innocence is {{the debut}} album of American {{composer}} and producer David Axelrod. It {{was released in}} October 1968 by Capitol Records. Axelrod sought to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> experimental climate of popular music {{at the time and}} composed the album as a suite-like tone poem based on Songs of Innocence, a 1789 illustrated collection of poems by William Blake. It was recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles with an orchestra and a variety of studio musicians, including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi, guitarist Al Casey, bassist Carol Kaye, and drummer Earl Palmer.|$|E

Defensive back Antonio Huffman returned the pick 54yards for a touchdown and put the Red Raiders up 24–10 late in the second quarter. Texas Tech was able to <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other take-aways as well, turning them into 14more points and held the lead until the fourth quarter. Two missed field goals and a fired-up Sooner defense held the Red Raiders off, however, and the Sooners were able to put the game away with a two-yard touchdown run by Brown.|$|E

They released the arcade game, Cliff Hanger, which used footage from this film, along with the previous Lupin film The Mystery of Mamo. Even though the films themselves weren't available in North America at the time, the Cliff Hanger game was featured in an episode of the game show Starcade.|$|E
