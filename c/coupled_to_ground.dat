50|$|Capacitive {{coupling}} {{is often}} unintended, {{such as the}} capacitance between two wires or PCB traces that are next to each other. Often one signal can capacitively couple with another and cause {{what appears to be}} noise. To reduce coupling, wires or traces are often separated as much as possible, or ground lines or ground planes are run in between signals that might affect each other, so that the lines are capacitively <b>coupled</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> rather than each other. Breadboards are particularly prone to these issues due to the long pieces of metal that line every row creating a several-picofarad capacitor between lines. To prototype high-frequency (10s of MHz) or high-gain analog circuits, often the circuits are built over a ground plane so that the signals couple to ground more than to each other. If a high-gain amplifier's output capacitively couples to its input it often becomes an electronic oscillator.|$|E
