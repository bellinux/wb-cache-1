50|$|The {{reason the}} {{rotation}} of the Earth in relation to the pendulum swing increases in time (decreases in effect) with decreasing latitude is related to the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>Effect.</b> As summarized in the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect</b> article, the effect is greatest in polar regions where the surface of the Earth is at right angles to the axis of rotation (the central axis of the pendulum aligns with the Earth's axis of rotation). The <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect</b> decreases nearer the equator because the surface of the Earth is parallel to the axis of rotation (the central axis of the pendulum is perpendicular with the Earth's axis of rotation). Refer to the article discussing the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>Effect</b> for further details.|$|R
5|$|Tornadoes {{normally}} rotate cyclonically (when {{viewed from}} above, this is counterclockwise {{in the northern}} hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect,</b> thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect</b> is unimportant, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effect</b> is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.|$|R
25|$|In polyatomic {{molecule}}s, {{the molecule}} motion {{can be described}} by a rigid body rotation and internal vibration of atoms about their equilibrium position. As {{a result of the}} vibrations of the atoms, the atoms are in motion relative to the rotating coordinate system of the molecule. <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> are therefore present, and make the atoms move in a direction perpendicular to the original oscillations. This leads to a mixing in molecular spectra between the rotational and vibrational levels, from which Coriolis coupling constants can be determined.|$|E
2500|$|In popular (non-technical) {{usage of}} the term [...] "Coriolis effect", the {{rotating}} reference frame implied is almost always the Earth. Because the Earth spins, Earth-bound observers need {{to account for the}} Coriolis force to correctly analyze the motion of objects. [...] The Earth completes one rotation per day, so for motions of everyday objects the Coriolis force is usually quite small compared to other forces; its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean. Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. This force causes moving objects {{on the surface of the}} Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the poles, since the effective rotation rate about a local vertical axis is largest there, and decreases to zero at the equator. Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would in a non-rotating system, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator and to the left of this direction south of it. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones (see <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> in meteorology).|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered rotating reference frame is the Earth. Moving objects {{on the surface of}} the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern. Movements of air in the atmosphere and water in the ocean are notable examples of this behavior: rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would on a non-rotating planet, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator, and to the left of this direction south of the equator. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones (see <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> in meteorology).|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] is {{sometimes}} referred to as the centrifugal term, and the term [...] as the Coriolis term. For example, see Shankar. Although these equations bear some resemblance in form to the centrifugal and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects</b> found in rotating reference frames, nonetheless these are not the same things. For example, the physical centrifugal and Coriolis forces appear only in non-inertial frames of reference. In contrast, these terms, that appear when acceleration is expressed in polar coordinates, are a mathematical consequence of differentiation; these terms appear wherever polar coordinates are used. In particular, these terms appear even when polar coordinates are used in inertial frames of reference, where the physical centrifugal and Coriolis forces never appear.|$|E
50|$|The Johnston’s organ {{plays a role}} in {{the control}} of flight {{stability}} in hawk moths. Kinematic data measured from hovering moths during steady flight indicate that the antennae vibrate with a frequency matching wingbeat (27 Hz). During complex flight, however, angular changes of the flying moth cause coriolis forces, which are predicted to manifest as a vibration of the antenna of at about twice wingbeat frequency (~60 Hz). When antennae were manipulated to vibrate at a range of frequencies and the resulting signals from the neurons associated with the Johnston’s organs were measured, the response of the scolopidia neurons to the frequency was tightly coupled in the range of 50-70 Hz, which is the predicted range of vibrations caused by <b>Coriolis</b> <b>effects.</b> Thus, the Johnston’s organ is tuned to detect angular changes during maneuvering in complex flight.|$|E
