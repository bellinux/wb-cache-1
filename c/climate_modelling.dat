5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global <b>climate</b> <b>modelling</b> makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E

500|$|The {{recovery}} of higher-resolution ice cores spanning {{more of the}} past 1,000,000 years by the ongoing EPICA project may help shed more light on the matter. A new, high-precision dating method developed by the team allows better correlation of the various factors involved and puts the ice core chronologies on a stronger temporal footing, endorsing the traditional Milankovitch hypothesis, that climate variations are controlled by insolation in the northern hemisphere. The new chronology is inconsistent with the [...] "inclination" [...] theory of the 100,000-year cycle. The establishment of leads and lags against different orbital forcing components with this method—which uses the direct insolation control over nitrogen-oxygen ratios in ice core bubbles—is in principle a great improvement in the temporal resolution of these records and another significant validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis. An international <b>climate</b> <b>modelling</b> exercise (Abe-ouchi et al., Nature, 2013) demonstrated that climate models can replicate the 100,000-year cyclicity given the orbital forcing and carbon dioxide levels of the late Pleistocene. The isostatic history of ice sheets was implicated in mediating the 100,000-year response to the orbital forcing. Larger ice sheets are lower in elevation because they depress the continental crust upon which they sit, {{and are therefore more}} vulnerable to melting.|$|E

The selection of <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> is not straightforward and can be done by following different methods. Usually, the selection is either based on the entire range of changes in climatic variables as projected by the total ensemble of available <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> or on the skill of <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> to simulate past climate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{limited number}} of complex {{numerical}} models that simulate the Earth’s atmosphere, ocean and land processes are the primary tool to study how climate may change over the next century due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. One standard assumption is that these <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> are random samples from a distribution of possible models centered around the true climate. This implies that agreement with observations and the predictive skill of <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> will improve as more models are added {{to an average of}} the models. In this paper, we present a statistical methodology to quantify whether <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> are indeed unbiased and whether and where model biases are correlated across models. We consider the simulated mean state and the simulated trend over the period 1970 - 1999 for Northern Hemisphere summer and winter temperature. The key to the statistical analysis is a spatial model for the bias of each <b>climate</b> <b>model</b> and the use of kernel smoothing to estimate the correlations of biases across different <b>climate</b> <b>models.</b> The spatial model is particularly important to determine statistical significance of the estimated correlations under the hypothesis of independent <b>climate</b> <b>models.</b> Our results suggest that most of the <b>climate</b> <b>model</b> bias patterns are indeed correlated. In particular, <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> developed by the same institution have highly correlated biases.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{parameter}} estimation targeting a chosen set of observations {{is an essential}} aspect of numerical modeling. This process is usually named tuning in the <b>climate</b> <b>modeling</b> community. In <b>climate</b> <b>models,</b> the variety and complexity of physical processes involved, and their interplay through {{a wide range of}} spatial and temporal scales, must be summarized in a series of approximate submodels. Most submodels depend on uncertain parameters. Tuning consists of adjusting the values of these parameters to bring the solution as a whole into line with aspects of the observed climate. Tuning is an essential aspect of <b>climate</b> <b>modeling</b> with its own scientific issues, which is probably not advertised enough outside the community of model developers. Optimization of <b>climate</b> <b>models</b> raises important questions about whether tuning methods a priori constrain the model results in unintended ways that would affect our confidence in climate projections.
