40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{emerging}} learning cultures. Its focus is on students and teachers who are engaged in using internet technologies for learning in {{higher education in the}} United Kingdom. The thesis provides an exploration of theoretical approaches to the cultural impact of new technologies, drawing on cultural, <b>cybercultural</b> and educational theory. It applies these theoretical insights to interview texts generated through discussions with learners and teachers. Its contribution lies in the originality of its empirical material and of the insights applied to their analysis, and in its application of cultural and <b>cybercultural</b> theory to the area of online learning and teaching.

40|$|Maternity, like <b>cyber(cultural)</b> space, is contested terrain. Despite {{challenges}} from feminism contemporary discussions, images {{and experiences of}} maternity are all too often still haunted by notions of the self-sacrificing, domestic and natural Good Mother. In the hope of something different this thesis turns to {{an investigation of the}} cyber-realm and the potential of this new domain to overturn dominant discourses of motherhood. Scholarship investigating intersections of maternity and technology, usually concerned with reproductive technologies, is expanded in this thesis into <b>cyber(cultural)</b> space as the cyber-domain increasingly engages with and is infiltrated by maternal bodies. This thesis draws on conceptualizations of <b>cyber(cultural)</b> space as culture and artefact to extend the popular notion of the cyber-realm as the Internet to include CD ROMs and galleries that display digital art. The thesis initially considers websites concerned with maternity and their virtual communities. This section begins by investigating commercial maternity sites and focuses on the intertwining of maternity with consumption and the surveillance and commodification of the pregnant and maternal body. It then examines two less commercial and more 'alternative' maternity sites - The Bad Mothers Club, with its signature of maternal humour and the e-zine Hip Mama and its political debates. The thesis then turns to two sites of cyber-culture where maternity has not thus far been the focus of critical discussion. It interrogates the capabilities of hypertext in Shelley Jackson's widely distributed CD ROM, Patchwork Girl. The focus of discussion about this cyber-feminist re-working of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is its construction of maternity as hybrid, monstrous, fragmented and queer. Shifting further along the spectrum of <b>cyber(cultural)</b> space the thesis visits the works of acclaimed Australian multi-media artist Patricia Piccinini. Her work inspires multiple readings and the discussion teases out the complex possibilities of monstrosity through which it constructs techno-maternities. The methodology employed owes a debt to Christine Hine's "virtual ethnography" — sustained and deep involvement with and analysis of online interactions and the meanings generated from the resulting connections and disconnections. The analyses rely upon discourse analysis and semiotic analysis in order to access the epistemological and ontological assumptions attached to the texts. <b>Cyber(cultural)</b> space is no guarantee of subversion and {{it is not only the}} commercial websites that make this clear. Nevertheless, the thesis concludes that <b>cyber(cultural)</b> space abounds with possibilities for the overturning of restrictive traditional tropes of mothering. In these cyber-spaces of subversion monstrous outlaw mother-bodies laugh at conventional motherhood as they write a techno-charged, queer and feisty maternity for the twenty-first century...|$|E

40|$|One way of {{approaching}} <b>cybercultural</b> studies {{is to focus}} on the relations and patterns, means and artifacts of cultural production and exchange online. Viewed as an evolving set of structures that enable and manifest the production of cyberculture, the hyperlinked, co-produced and ephemeral nature of the Web challenges traditional approaches to research of social, political and cultural interchange. Cultural studies of the Web may benefit from new methods of analyzing Web form and content, along with processes and patterns of production, distribution, usage and interpretation of Web-based phenomena. In this chapter, I propose the concept of a Web sphere as a unit of analysis for <b>cybercultural</b> studies, explain the value of Web archives, and discuss methods of Web sphere analysis that may be useful for understanding <b>cybercultural</b> phenomena. I illustrate these methodological reflections through two studies of personal expression on the Web {{in the wake of the}} attacks of September 11, 2001. Borrowing a concept from the work of Taylor and van Every (2000) on the relationship between communication and organizing, the Web could be viewed as both a “site and surface ” for communicative action. In order to conduct developmental analyses of both the “site ” and “surface ” of the Web, it is helpful to create and analyze an archive not just of discrete Web site...|$|E
40|$|The vast social {{apparatus}} {{of the computer}} network has aligned people with technology in unprecedented ways. The intimacy of the human-computer interface has {{made it impossible to}} distinguish technology from the social and cultural business of being human. Cyberculture is the broader name given to this process of becoming through technological means. This book shows that cyberculture {{has been a long time}} coming. In 'Prefiguring Cyberculture', media critics and theorists, philosophers, and historians of science explore the antecedents of such aspects of contemporary technological culture as the Internet, the World Wide Web, artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, virtual reality, and the cyborg. The contributors examine key texts that anticipate <b>cybercultural</b> practice and theory, including Plato's 'Simile of the Cave'; the Renaissance Ars Memoria; Descartes's 'Meditations' (on the mind-body split); Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein'; Alan Turing's 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence'; Philip K. Dick's 'Man, Android, and Machine'; William Gibson's 'Neuromancer'; and Arthur C. Clarke's 'Profiles of the Future'. In the final section, a number of cyberculture artists explore how <b>cybercultural</b> themes have been taken up and critiqued in the electronic arts...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to tread through the {{sometimes}} murky waters of <b>cybercultural</b> feminist theory in hope of clarifying {{the current status of}} the World Wide Web as an art medium, and its suitability as a vehicle for the expression of contemporary feminist concerns. I have divided this paper into four chapters. The first is a brief revision of the history of communication and computer technology, aimed at revealing the extent of women's exclusion from recorded historical accounts. The second chapter delves into current <b>cybercultural</b> theory dealing with central topics such as: disembodiment, the changing status of the postmodern subject in relation to gender theory, the reconciliation of gender with sexual difference theory, and the gender implications of hegemonic organization of the real vs. virtual experience. These themes are examined in the hope of illuminating some of the political motivations behind cyberfeminist visual culture. The final two chapters of my thesis consist of two case studies: the first focuses on the theoretical writings and work of contemporary web artist Mary Flanagan while the second deals with the web component of this interdisciplinary M.

40|$|This {{article is}} the result of a study carried out to {{investigate}} the process involved in the development of the didactic design and teaching for the online course "Teacher Education for Online Teaching", which formed the basis of inter-institutional research in the Moodle virtual learning environment involving researchers from 11 Brazilian and one Portuguese graduate programs. Morin's "complex thinking" (2007) formed the theoretical basis for a discussion of: a) online education as a <b>cybercultural</b> phenomenon; b) interactivity as a communicational paradigm in the mediation of learning in online courses; and c) didactic design as hypertextual dynamics at interfaces. The investigations were qualitative and involved a case study and document analysis. The results indicate that teacher mediation and didactic design in online courses presuppose recursion and a specific set of commitments: a) clarifying and putting into effect the activities intended for students and made available over the internet; b) ensuring interactivity at the communication and content interfaces in the virtual learning environment; c) developing activities and content in different languages; d) achieving a balance between the number of activities and the time available for them; e) promoting learner digital and <b>cybercultural</b> inclusion; and f) ensuring that activities that require advanced technical resources are compatible with the digital facilities available to learners. Putting these commitments into practice helps to improve the quality of the relationship between didactic design and teacher mediation in internet-based courses, as well as the quality of teacher education for learning mediation in online education...|$|E

40|$|Game {{studies has}} yet to engage with a {{sustained}} debate on the implications of its fundamentally technologically based foundation – i. e. the ‘digitality ’ of digital games. This paper calls for such a debate and offers some initial thoughts on issues and directions. The {{humanities and social sciences}} are founded on the principle that historical and cultural agency reside solely in the human and the social. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies, Actor-Network Theory and <b>cybercultural</b> studies, this paper argues that a full understanding of both the playing of digital games, and the wider techno-cultural context of this play, is only possible through a recognition and theorisation of technological agency. Taking the Gameboy Advance game Advance Wars 2 as a case study, the paper explores the implications for game studies of attention to non-human agency – specifically the agency of simulation and artificial life software- in digital game play.

40|$|This article {{draws on}} Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory to {{understand}} the regenerative “belief in the new” in new media culture and web history. I begin by noting that discursive constructions of the web as disruptive, open, and participatory have emerged at various points in the medium’s history, and that these discourses are not as neatly tied to economic interests as most new media criticism would suggest. With this in mind, field theory is introduced as a potential framework for understanding this (re) production of {{a belief in the}} new as a dynamic of the interplay of cultural and symbolic forms of capital within the new media field. After discussing how Bourdieu’s theory might be applied to new media culture in general terms, I turn to a key moment in the emergence of the new media field—the rise of <b>cybercultural</b> magazines Mondo 2000 and Wired in the early 1990 s—to illustrate how Bourdieu’s theory may be adapted in the study of new media history...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{published}} discussion {{and research on}} blogs and teaching and learning in higher education focuses on evaluation of blogging as a communicative technique. This type of discussion largely assumes that successful integration of blogging into course delivery should be judged against a pre-existing and unchallenged pedagogical model. This paper argues that to leverage its full educational potential blogging must be understood not just as an isolated phenomena, {{but as part of}} a broad palette of <b>cybercultural</b> practices which provide us with new ways of doing and thinking. The paper looks at the ways broader theoretical models associated with the development of the blogosphere might challenge or enhance current theories of teaching and learning. Spatial metaphors inherent in network models of blogging will be contrasted with the surface/depth model of student learning. The paper will argue that blogs should not be seen merely as a technological tool for teaching and learning but as a situated practice that must be brought into appropriate alignment with particular pedagogical and disciplinary practices. A model of blogging as a networked approach to learning suggests that blogging might achieve best results across the curriculum not through isolated use in individual units...|$|E
40|$|Task of {{this thesis}} is to analyse forms of autors {{functions}} in cyberspace. The term autor function commes from Michel Foucaults thesis based on {{historical and cultural}} determination of wiew on autorship. The theory is based on point of wiew that society see autor through his function in discours, in case this regularity function is in a discours present. It provides specific way of existence, circulation and effect of discours within society. The issue of cyberspace is that it established originaly new possibillities of spreading of data. This possibilities broke down a former fear felt by mass medias, which finaly {{decided to move to}} cyberpace, which was allowed by their digitalization. There are two ways how to use the cyberspace. First is mass medial way, second way is <b>cybercultural.</b> Those ways are contradictory. Each of those ways has its own cultural practises, on which is based form of author funcion. Biggiest difference between those forms is that the mass media takes this form as some kind of private property, on which is based their working. On the opposite is form of author funcion typical for cyberculture, which is property free. The difference of those forms of autor function is the main reason, why are these two ways of using cyberspace in constant conflict...|$|E
40|$|Using {{the form}} of dialogue, this paper {{analyzes}} reading in the digital age. The paper reveals the history of reading from Augustine to Wittgenstein as a changing and evolving set of practices such as the cultural invention of silent reading, mass reading, and rise of specialized reading publics. It analyzes various 153 ￼ changes to these practices {{in the age of}} digital technologies, and links digital reading practices to the bundle of related practices such as writing, viewing, listening, and surfing the Web. The paper shows that digital reading is a fundamental question in education at all levels. Situated within radical concordance of various media, digital reading expands human artificial memory and causes profound changes in human natural memory. The paper inquires these changes from various perspectives includ- ing neuroscience and psychology, and concludes that digital reading is predominantly a social phenomenon. It looks into the relationships between digital reading and cognitive capitalism, and shows that the theory of digital reading should recognize the topology and dynamics of the Web. It inquires this dynamics using the per- spective of cultural studies, and analyses digital reading in the context of cyber- cultures, community cultures, and algorithmic cultures. Finally, it develops the view to digital reading as a <b>cybercultural</b> concept which understands reading as a cultural behavior that emphasizes an ecosystem of digital practices...|$|E
40|$|We {{begin by}} {{examining}} the tensions between political and aesthetic aspects of cyberculture. Initially, we discuss the early utopian aspirations which saw the Internet as a democratic instrument, motivating the practice of artists who created net. art and, more recently, groups associated with the antiglobalization movement and cyberfeminism. These groups focused {{on the use of}} technology to mobilize actions and discussions {{about the impact of the}} digital culture on the life of marginalized communities, questioning the role of the Internet in the global market economy, articulating forms of resistance to neoliberalism. We then examine artistic productions of a more lyrical nature connected to the interactive installation. Upon examining the political and aesthetic aspects of <b>cybercultural</b> practices separately, we find it easy to identify groups with a strong tendency either for political activism or for involvement in research on sensorial perception, but we conclude that a strict division between "aesthetic versus political" approaches should be avoided. Este texto aborda tensões entre aspectos políticos e estéticos da cibercultura. Primeiramente, discute-se as aspirações utópicas iniciais em torno da internet como um instrumento democrático que motivou a produção de artistas da net. art e posteriormente grupos associados ao movimento antiglobalização e ciberfeminismo. Estes grupos se concentraram no uso da tecnologia para mobilizar ações e discussões sobre o impacto da cultura digital na vida de comunidades marginalizadas, questionando o papel da internet na economia global de mercado, articulando formas de resistência ao neoliberalismo. Em seguida, examinamos produções artísticas de caráter mais lírico, ligadas à instalação interativa. Ao examinar separadamente os aspectos políticos e estéticos nas diversas manifestações da cibercultura, encontramos facilidade em identificar grupos com tendência maior ao ativismo político ou ao desenvolvimento de obras ligadas à percepção sensorial, mas concluímos que uma divisão rígida de posicionamento "estético" versus "político" deve ser evitada...|$|E
40|$|Through an {{analysis}} of the transformations and persistencies in the image­-power­-knowledge relationship that result from the spread of digital communication's technologies, our goal is to characterize the emergence of a conflict that, in the politics of visuality and the cyberspace's techno­political configuration, reflects similar tensions that constitute the actual power relations diagram. The research begins with an investigation of the historical background that influenced Thomas Hobbes Leviathan's images production, where a given visual order corresponds to a new power order. Then, we analyze the changes of this specific configuration – that is perceptible as the Leviathan image regime's metaphor - in face of the analog and digital image production technologies. Our hypothesis is that the disputes (aesthetic, legal, economic) that attempt to regulate the image within the digital media domain and that shape a particular politics of visibility, are similar to those tensions that affect the cyberspace conditions to become a different 'sensible' surface (medium), that potentially mobilizes other forms of knowing, other models of organization and production. To examine this issue, we analyze the ongoing conflict between different social forces that point out both for new practices and meanings that emerge in the <b>cybercultural</b> arena, and for the trends that attempts to impose over the digital medium the regulatory mechanisms established in the context of analog medium. At the end we characterize the current power diagram, and we argue that cyberspace aesthetic and political configuration depend upon a capacity to intervene over the very fundamentals that regulate its field of enunciation and visibility. Finally, we take it as a struggle for others modes of thought and social organization models, as a war over the virtual and imaginary production, therefore a war that is oriented to the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master’s Dissertation is to study virtual {{libraries}} from a historical and descriptive standpoint, with emphasis on a recurrent conceptual setting {{within the context of}} cyberculture, taken as a time category corresponding to the contemporary phase of mediatic civilization. The empirical factors and aspects of the object of research have been delimited since at least 1994. Based on a research methodology founded upon a review of the literature, this work involves a study of traditional, real time and hybrid libraries. The subject of this research, marked by theoretical and practical aspects, encompasses general and specific implications concerning the emergence of virtual libraries, involving, simultaneously, the hypotheses that the emergence of virtual libraries may not show a correlation with traditional libraries and that the development of the former is due {{to the development of the}} latter or even to a process motivated by the typicity of the post-modern culture. The attainment of the objectives of this research presupposes an understanding of the social, historical and cultural statute of libraries in general and of the sociotechnological aspects of cyberculture and cyberspace; a study of the influence of post-modern culture on the development or the obliteration, oblivion or pulverization of traditional libraries; identification of the modus operandi of the process of acculturation in cyberspace; and an understanding of the change in the esthetics of information in the <b>cybercultural</b> environment. Similarly, this study aims to analyze the various models of organization of information, focusing on its access, within the ambit of in loco, real time and hybrid libraries, which, in this context, implies a critical survey of the technologies destined for the development of bibliotheconomic services. Based on this demarcation of theoretical and methodological principles, the development and consolidation of the horizons of this Dissertation encompass, fundamentally, its entire belongingness to the area of Communications...|$|E
40|$|The {{main concern}} of this {{research}} is the potential of digital assemblages of art and technoscience to generate change. The thesis investigates a selection of contemporary installation artworks that deploy a range of techno-scientific processes in the search for new aesthetic experiences. These examples open a way of thinking about the digital as virtual without reducing either the virtual or the digital to each other. The hype that followed the proliferation of digital media technologies, in the last two decades, prompted a tendency in <b>cybercultural</b> theory to either conflate or oppose the virtual to the digital, commonly addressing the latter as immaterial, quantifiable and probabilistic. The thesis develops an alternative virtual ecology that departs from the logic of binary representational thought, without reiterating the centrality of sensory perception in digital philosophy. It contends that the participation of self-referential, abstract-yet-material dimensions is immanent to the emergence of actual digital structures of material, aesthetic and scientific combination. This research project elaborates a philosophy of rhythm as an appropriate mode of analysis for revisiting contemporary debates about digital media, embodiment and temporality. It proposes an account of temporal agency active at a micro-perceptual resonant level, across the quasimathematical, biodigital and microsonic modulations of the virtual digital. Mainly, the project draws on philosophical material by Deleuze and Guattari, Massumi, Leibniz and Bachelard to further explore the microscopic (or molecular) scale of digital assemblages. This philosophical investigation provides a set of tools with which to evaluate the impact of rhythm on the production of aesthetico-scientific media environments. Overall, the thesis develops a theory of virtual dynamics for the digital as a non-computable, autonomous sphere specific to the actuality of digital code yet not fully exhausted in it...|$|E
40|$|Em 2006, durante as eleições para o Congresso americano, o YouTube e outras redes sociais registraram os primeiros sinais de ciberativismo político organizado por políticos e eleitores no âmbito da Internet. Em 2008, esse movimento se intensificou com a experiência de Barack Obama e a política passou a integrar amplamente a esfera das novas mídias digitais, com o aumento da interatividade nos processos de comunicação política via Web. Nesse contexto, o presente trabalho investiga, de um lado, como a sociedade {{americana}} utilizou o Youtube durante as eleições de 2008, e de outro, como se estruturou a chamada campanha on-line do então candidato Obama. Por meio da análise do discurso de campanha de Obama e de cinco vídeos postados por eleitores no Youtube durante o período eleitoral, este estudo busca explicações para o fenômeno que ficou conhecido como a primeira campanha em rede de toda história. As postulações de Manuel Castells sobre a sociedade em rede, os estudos ciberculturais e a semiótica discursiva foram adotados como referenciais teórico-metodológicos para a investigação dos sentidos produzidos nos processos que constituem o corpus desta pesquisaIn 2006, {{during the}} american electrons for Congress, Youtube and other social networks reported {{the first signs of}} orgaqnized political cyberactivism toward the Internet. In 2008, this movement has been intensified by the experience of Barack Obama and the politics was included largely the realm of new digital media, allowing more dialogue and interactivity between politicians and voters. In this context, this paper investigates on the one hand, as American society has used Youtube during the 2008 elections, and the other how was structured Obama's online campaign. Through the analysis of five videos with political content on Youtube durign the election period, this study seeks explanations for the phenomenon that became known as the first network campaign throughout history.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the historical {{moment of the}} transition of the Internet from a technology to a cultural form with widespread social use. It is a moment that contains traces of the utopian dreams of the early users of the Internet at the point when it became a widely available, accessible everyday resource. I examine this moment of transition {{in terms of a}} vocabulary of use that sought to give expression to the then novel experience of being online. These conceptualisation of use are called user types and usually appear as metaphors. The first two chapters begin with metaphor, presented both in theory and in practice. This is followed by an introduction to <b>cybercultural</b> studies and cyberferninism, approaches which provide both inspiration and counterargument to the here presented approach. This framework is expanded in the fourth chapter, in which existing methodologies are outlined to introduce the virtual archaeology. This approach is inspired by the most important theoretical reference point for the thesis: Benjamin and his Arcades Project (and within that: cyberflAnerie). Benjamin's project emphasises the analysis of fragments, which are juxtaposed to illuminate an otherwise invisible meaning. Similar structures are seen to exist online. These shape the particularity of the creation of meaning. Another important aspect of Benjamin is his emphasis on the city and the radical shift of modernity. Each user type is seen to similarly express a reaction to the shock of the new, expressing particular utopian moments in Internet history. User types tell us something of the formation of discourses that complete the transformation of a technology from the technical into recognisable social and cultural identities. The user types analysed in detail are: the cyberflAneur, cyberfldneuse, webgrrl, cyberpunk, netizen, cybernaut and surfer. Their detailed analysis provides {{the second part of the}} thesis. The aspects referred to in the first part are all part of these analyses. Final reflections about the user types' role as specific communication tools, which shape the cultural form of the new medium, conclude the thesis.

40|$|KAMPALA, Oct 13, 1998 (Reuters) - Thousands of Ugandan {{students}} are unsure {{whether they have}} won university places after rats chewed through computer cables at the National Examination Board causing the system to crash, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. The New Vision Daily said senior board officials were very concerned that rodents were able to infiltrate areas holding such vital information. The hitch has affected students who were {{to be placed in}} teacher training colleges, polytechnics and medical institutions. It {{is not the first time}} that rats have eaten away at important installations in Uganda. Earlier this year they chewed through telecommunications wires, cutting off phone links to parts of western Uganda and Rwanda. Last week a workshop on law reform heard that reams of vital computerised court evidence had been lost in the same way. " Coiled within the <b>cybercultural</b> discourse that pronounces the ends of history, the nation-state, and anti-modernity, lie tropes rooted in high colonialism. Nineteenth-century Indian social reformer Swami Vivekananda characterised the European view of his country thus: " [...] . three hundred million souls, [...] . swarming on the body of India, like so many worms on a rotten, stinking carcase. " (East and West, 1901) The "cleanliness versus filth" binary that structured nineteenth-century Europeans' experiences in the tropics is repeated, we argue, in certain late twentieth-century narratives of cybernetic progress [...] feeding on and quelling anxieties associated with fantasies of globalization, binding tropes of cleanliness and filth to spectres of racialized identity and technological primitiveness. Symbolic of the association of technological advancement with "purity" is the "clean room. " The term is widely used to describe both the hyper-sterile environments in which computer hardware is designed and manufactured; and the rigorous engineering control and extreme sequestering of software research projects, so as to reduce defects and provide protection from patent-infringement litigation. We discuss the "clean room" as a figure for a late-twentieth century obsession to eliminate the messy, abject materiality of the "natural," in favor of a dematerialized, sterile space of the "virtual. " We describe this insistence on cyber-cleanliness (and on the suppression of its opposite, "cyber-squalor") as a founding concept of cyberculture in general, and in particular, of its depictions of the benefits of cyberculture in the developing world...|$|E
40|$|As dinâmicas comunicacionais da cibercultura em sua fase atual são possíveis devido à revolução do processo de digitalização, que fez com que imagem, vídeo e som pudessem ser produzidos e compartilhados em/na rede, e pela possibilidade de todo e qualquer internauta ser emissor e {{receptor}} em potencial de informação. Diante disso, a pesquisa se dedicou a investigar a relação de jovens usuários do software social Facebook com os saberes que circulam na referida interface. Para interpretar os dados construídos com os sujeitos da pesquisa busquei auxílio nas contribuições de autores de diversas áreas do conhecimento, principalmente do campo da comunicação.

40|$|A sociedade na qual vivemos vem passando por grandes transformações que influenciam os modos de construir conhecimentos e veicular informações, as formas de se relacionar com o outro, a maneira de perceber o mundo e a si mesmo no mundo. Estas mudanças são marcadas pela interatividade, pela conectividade, pela velocidade, pela multilinearidade, pela complexidade e pela fragmentação tão presentes na cultura digital. Os jovens, nascidos em meio a estas transformações, vivenciam essas marcas em suas práticas culturais cotidianas, construindo uma nova lógica que orienta seu modo de perceber e agir na sociedade. No entanto, ao mesmo tempo em que os jovens orientam suas ações a partir dessa lógica que chamo nesse trabalho de cibercultural, vivenciam uma lógica linear na escola, o que acaba por produzir um hiato entre as culturas juvenis e a cultura escolar. Buscando contribuir para a construção de práticas pedagógicas mais concernentes às necessidades dos jovens contemporâneos, este estudo se propôs {{investigar}} o papel mediador das tecnologias digitais nos processos de ensino-aprendizagem. O estudo foi desenvolvido em uma escola de Ensino Médio Integrado, na zona norte do Rio de Janeiro, na qual os alunos têm acesso, em período integral, às disciplinas do currículo do MEC integradas às disciplinas de formação técnica voltadas às tecnologias digitais. Este projeto é fruto de uma parceria da Secretaria de Educação do Estado do Rio de Janeiro com um instituto privado, cujo objetivo é construir um espaço de pesquisa e de inovações em educação. A pesquisa se configurou como um estudo de caso, embora algumas reflexões possam contribuir para debates mais amplos em educação. O estudo apoiou-se teórico-metodologicamente nos Estudos Culturais Latino-americanos (Martín-Barbero e Canclini), que trazem contribuições para pensar o papel das mediações nos processos de recepção dos meios comunicacionais. Baseia-se, também, nos estudos sobre juventude (Dayrell e Carrano) que ajudaram a construir um olhar para os jovens pesquisados a partir do lugar ativo e protagonista de suas práticas dentro e fora da escola. Complementando estes aportes teóricos, o trabalho se fundamenta, ainda, nos estudos sobre a relação dos sujeitos com os ambientes virtuais ou ciberculturais (Lévy, Lemos e Santaella). As entrevistas realizadas com jovens e professores da escola e as observações em sala de aula foram exercícios de alteridade e exotopia, inspirados em Mikhail Bakhtin. O trabalho foi tecido numa perspectiva dialógica, buscando trazer para o texto impresso as experiências vividas no campo e os debates desencadeados a partir dessas experiências, propondo alguns caminhos para contribuir com uma escola mais significativa aos novos tempos. The {{society in}} which we live is undergoing major transformations that influence the ways of constructing knowledge and relay information, the forms of relating with other people, the way of perceiving the world and himself in the world. These changes are marked by interactivity, connectivity, speed, multilinearity, complexity and fragmentation so prevalent in digital culture. The contemporary young people who had been born in the middle of these changes, live these brands in their daily cultural practices, constructing a new logic that guides their way of perceiving and acting in society. However, while young people guide their actions from that logic that I call in this work of <b>cybercultural,</b> they live a linear logic inside the school, which produce a gap between youth culture and school culture. Searching to contribute to construct pedagogical practices concerning the needs of contemporary youth, this study aimed to investigate the digital technologies as their role as mediators in the teaching-learning process. The study was developed in a high school integrated in the northern zone of Rio de Janeiro, where the students have access, full time, on the subjects in the curriculum of MEC integrated to the disciplines of technical training related to digital technologies. This project {{is the result of a}} partnership between the Education Department of the State of Rio de Janeiro with a private institute, whose the objective is construct a space of research and innovations in education. The research was configured as a case study, although some reflections can contribute to wider debates in education. The study was supported theoretical and methodological by the Latin American Cultural Studies (Martín-Barbero and Canclini), which contributes to reflect on the role of mediation and the processes of reception the communication media. It is based also on studies of youth (Dayrell and Carrano) who helped to construct a way to look to the young people respondents from the place and active protagonist of their practices inside and outside of school. Complementing these theoretical contributions, the work is based also on studies of the relation of subjects with virtual or <b>cybercultural</b> environments (Lévy, Lemos and Santaella). The interviews with young people and school teachers and the classroom observations were exercises to construct a responsive look, inspired in Mikhail Bakhtin. This work was woven in a dialogic perspective, trying to bring to the printed text the experiences in the field and the debates initiated from these experiences and propose some ways to contribute to a school more meaningful to the contemporary times...|$|E
40|$|A presente dissertação examina os efeitos da invenção da {{internet}} na teologia e sociedade, definindo o que é ciberteologia a fim de descobrir qual sua contribuição para melhor compreender e inter-relacionar a cultura, a fé e o ser humano contemporâneo. Delimita-se o tema em cibergraça, entendida como a comunhão entre as pessoas nos tempos da rede. Primeiro, apreende-se o ciberespaço como um lugar profundamente antropológico onde se pode refletir teologicamente. O estudo também busca verificar como a rede afeta ou potencializa a relação de comunhão entre as pessoas, em especial com a juventude, público predominante no ciberespaço. Além disso, analisa o valor eclesiológico da internet na missão de evangelizar todos os povos, construindo a relação entre evangelização e comunhão na era digital. O trabalho utiliza basicamente os métodos de pesquisa exploratória, bibliográfica e documental. A dissertação se fundamenta principalmente nas obras e artigos de Antonio Spadaro, autor do livro e do campo teológico “Ciberteologia”, pano de fundo deste estudo. Para fundamentar a análise sociológica e cibercultural do primeiro capítulo, faz-se uso de autores como Manuel Castells, Pierre Lévy e André Lemos. Na teologia trinitária destaca-se a contribuição de Gisbert Greshake e John Zizioulas. Também o trabalho se inspira no pensamento científico-teológico de Teilhard de Chardin seja diretamente ou indiretamente através de autores como Jennifer Cobb, com sua obra “Cybergrace”. This dissertation {{examines the}} effects of the invention of the internet in theology and society, defining what is cybertheology to find out what their contribution to better understand and interrelate culture, faith and the contemporary human being. Wraps up the theme in cybergrace, understood as the communion of persons in the network times. First, seize up cyberspace as a profoundly anthropological place where you can reflect theologically. The study also aims to verify how the network affects or enhances the relationship of communion between people, especially youth, predominant public in cyberspace. Furthermore, it analyzes the ecclesiological value of the internet in the mission of evangelizing all people, building the relationship between evangelization and communion in the digital age. The work uses basically the methods of exploratory, bibliographical and documental research. The dissertation is based mainly in books and articles by Antonio Spadaro, author of the book and the theological field "Cybertheology" background of this study. In support of sociological and <b>cybercultural</b> analysis of the first chapter, makes use of authors such as Manuel Castells, Pierre Lévy and André Lemos. In Trinitarian theology highlights the contribution of Gisbert Greshake and John Zizioulas. Also the work is inspired by scientific and theological thought of Teilhard de Chardin either directly or indirectly through authors such as Jennifer Cobb, with her work "Cybergrace"...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} problem that guided this dissertation is: What {{are the most}} significant critical elements that affect the experience and coexistence in the network society, {{and what is the}} impact that they have on human activities, in the reconfiguration of universe of information, and in our Librarian task? The objectives are: to investigate in a critical and reflective way about the crucial elements that substantially modify the patterns of experience and coexistence in the network society; to analyze the consequences on human activities in the reconfiguration of the universe of information that have the experience and coexistence models in the network society; to determine the implications of this topic in the library science field and to propose a concrete agenda of research and writing about Librarianship. This research is divided into three chapters: The first chapter is about the analysis of critical elements of the network society. Particular attention is given to internet as a communication emblem of this model of society. To explain the current dynamics of social and cultural interaction in the social environment of this paradigm, is described in detail, the theory of new social movements. It is also considered relevant the careful examination of identities and the individual and collective actions as crucial elements for the characterization of the network society. The second chapter is directed {{to the study of the}} culture that gives, share, collaborate, recognize each other and is solidary in the network society, as fundamental components to understanding much of the peculiarities of the experience and coexistence, in this interconnected social environment. In such context, are discussed the reasons why hacker culture is considered representative of the new social movements, also is set out the reasons why hackers enclose social and cultural repercussions beyond the technological sphere. It also discussed two models with very deep impact in the networked society: the paradigm peer to peer (P 2 P) of sharing in the network and the paradigm wiki of collaborating into the network, standing out above all, not so much the software or tools used, but the philosophy inherent in the method and configuration of new forms of relationships, work, create, study, share works, etc. into this emerging social model. Based on the theoretical, critical reflective elements and about the social and cultural models of participation studied in the first two chapters, the main issue of the third chapter is the experience and coexistence in the network society. In this sense, is looking for the ideal of free society and culture, as well as the tensions and conflicts about it, generated largely by the economic forces of global markets. The <b>cybercultural</b> paradigms are analyzed in relation with alternatives of experience and coexistence in the network society. It is argued how these alternative models may imply a new qualitatively phase in the benefit of human evolution and to promote an intercultural dialogue more developed, laying the foundation for a new model of civilization in the network society. Of course, is also discussed the trouble spots that reflects an uncertain and problematic perspective in these areas. Finally, based on all the issues previously addressed, are made specific and critical proposals in order to develop a research and action agenda for the librarian, but based on the main axis of the issue as complex work of the experience and coexistence in the network society...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo {{consiste}} em uma investigaÃÃo sobre a inserÃÃo do letramento digital, envolvendo o uso do computador e da Internet, no Ãmbito das prÃticas de linguagens em uma escola pÃblica de Ensino MÃdio. Partiu-se, assim, do pressuposto de que e a linguagem veiculada na Internet, por ser predominantemente hipertextual e multissemiÃtica, e, ainda, por ter redimensionado os processos de comunicaÃÃo e de construÃÃo do conhecimento requer um letramento especÃfico. Desse modo, tal letramento precisa ser contemplado nos currÃculos e nas prÃticas de linguagens escolares, objetivando o desenvolvimento de um letramento que permita aos alunos agirem e interagirem, no universo cibercultural, de forma eficiente, eficaz, crÃtica e Ãtica. A pesquisa se embasa, principalmente, nos Novos Estudos do Letramento (PAHL & ROWSELL, 2012) e, dentro destes, nas ideias de multiletramentos (CAZDEN et al., 1996; ROJO, 2009, 2012), letramento como prÃtica social (STREET, 1984, 2003; LANKSHEAR & KNOBEL, 2006, 2011), e de letramento digital (MARTIN, 2008). No Ãmbito metodolÃgico, a pesquisa consiste em um estudo de caso, de carÃter qualitativo interpretativista, no qual sÃo analisados diversos contextos: inicialmente o prescritivo/orientativo, a partir de cujas informaÃÃes se procedeu ao exame dos demais contextos, a saber, o das condiÃÃes fÃsicas, o da formaÃÃo docente e o das prÃticas. A inclusÃo de todos esses contextos justifica-se por se considerar que a compreensÃo da inserÃÃo dos letramentos no contexto escolar estÃ condicionada por diversas dimensÃes. Os resultados do estudo indicam: (1) falta de sintonia entre os diversos contextos analisados, tendo como consequÃncia uma inserÃÃo mÃnima do letramento digital, no currÃculo escolar; (2) pouca afinidade dos docentes com as condiÃÃes fÃsicas disponÃveis; (3) formaÃÃo docente insuficiente para o desenvolvimento do letramento digital; (4) as prÃticas letradas digitais ainda sÃo bastante incipientes e pontuais, e consideram pouco as prÃticas sociodiscursivas dos alunos exteriores Ã escola. Portanto, as prÃticas de linguagens precisam ser redimensionadas, no Ãmbito da escola, para contemplarem o letramento digital. This study {{consists of}} an investigation on the inclusion of digital literacy involving {{the use of computers}} and the Internet within the scope of language practices in a public secondary school. It {{is based on the assumption}} that the language disseminated on the Internet requires specific literacy not only for being predominantly hypertextual and multisemiotic, but also for having resized the processes of communication and knowledge construction. Thus, this literacy needs to be contemplated in school language practices and curricula, aiming at the development of a literacy that enables students to act and interact in the <b>cybercultural</b> universe in an efficient, effective, critical and ethical way. The research was grounded primarily in the new literacy studies (PAHL & ROWSELL, 2012), especially in the ideas of multiliteracies (CAZDEN et al, 1996; ROJO, 2009, 2012), literacy as a social practice (STREET, 1984, 2003; KNOBEL & LANKSHEAR, 2006, 2011) and digital literacy (MARTIN, 2008). At the methodological level, as a case study, this qualitative and interpretative investigation analyzes several contexts: the first one is the prescriptive/guiding context, which provides the necessary information for the examination of the other contexts, namely physical conditions, teacher education and practices. The inclusion of all these contexts is justified on the grounds that the understanding of literacies insertion in the school context is conditioned by several aspects. The results of this study indicate: (1) lack of harmony between the various contexts analyzed, resulting in a minimal insertion of digital literacy in the school curriculum; (2) low affinity of teachers with the physical conditions available; (3) inadequate teacher training for the development of digital literacy; (4) digital literacy practices which are still very incipient and punctual, and consider only those student social and discursive practices outside school. Therefore, language practices need to be resized within the school sphere in order to encompass digital literacy...|$|E
40|$|It aims to {{understand}} how the undergraduates of UFC courses experience MDCR (Network Collaborative Digital Materials) proposed by the Project LIFE (Teacher Training Interdisciplinary Laboratory) in the theoretical perspective of cyberculture. This training involved copyright collaborative activities (through the development of MDCR), face-to-face and online interactions as well as the mobilization of teaching knowledge in line with the principles of the LIFE Project and Cyberculture. Specifically, the study intended to describe how the undergraduates participate and appropriate of LIFE training, from their point of views; to identify, with support on the perception of the undergraduate students, the teaching knowledge mobilized in training and how this knowledge dialogues with the principles of LIFE / UFC training and cyberculture and to see how the development process of MDCR, teaching strategies and learning developed by the undergraduates are related to the principles of cyberculture. The work expresses theoretical discussions of cyberculture, education, teacher training, teaching knowledge, complexity and interdisciplinarity. It is a qualitative ethnographic research, which had activities at LIFE-UFC and in a basic vocational school, partner in the project. Four undergraduates, both male and female and from four courses of UFC, participated in the study. The research techniques adopted were: participant observation, semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis. The results showed that the undergraduates in graduation phase externalize the existence of gaps in basic training with regard to teaching practice, particularly in relation to aspects of cyberculture and interdisciplinarity. For the undergraduates, LIFE articulated theory and practice and potentiated teaching experiences via <b>cybercultural</b> and interdisciplinary experiences â in the development of MDCR and in the established relationship with the students of the partner school â who want to teach. It was concluded that LIFE training is configured as a practical training for the undergraduates that sought it in the project, once it approximates the design elements of cyberculture and interdisciplinary school. The study showed, based on the contributions of the undergraduates, the need for discussions in the academy and school about the current policies of teacher training. Objetiva compreender como os licenciandos dos cursos da UFC vivenciam a formaÃÃo MDCR (Materiais Digitais Colaborativos em Rede) proposta pelo Projeto LIFE (LaboratÃrio Interdisciplinar de FormaÃÃo de Educadores) na perspectiva teÃrica da cibercultura. Essa formaÃÃo envolveu atividades colaborativas autorais (mediante o desenvolvimento dos MDCR), interaÃÃes presenciais e a distÃncia, bem como mobilizaÃÃo dos saberes docentes em consonÃncia com os princÃpios do Projeto LIFE e da Cibercultura. Especificamente, o estudo buscou descrever como os licenciandos participam e se apropriam da formaÃÃo LIFE, a partir da visÃo deles; identificar, com apoio na percepÃÃo dos licenciandos, os saberes docentes mobilizados na formaÃÃo e como esses saberes dialogam com os princÃpios da formaÃÃo LIFE/ UFC e da cibercultura e verificar como o processo de desenvolvimento do MDCR, estratÃgias de ensino e de aprendizagem desenvolvidas pelos licenciandos, estÃo relacionados aos princÃpios da cibercultura. O trabalho expressa discussÃes teÃricas sobre cibercultura, educaÃÃo, formaÃÃo de professores, saberes docentes, complexidade e interdisciplinaridade. Ã uma pesquisa qualitativa, de carÃter etnogrÃfico, que teve atividades desenvolvidas no LIFE-UFC e numa escola bÃsica profissionalizante parceira do projeto. Participaram do estudo quatro licenciandos de quatro cursos da UFC, de ambos os sexos. As tÃcnicas de pesquisa adotadas foram: observaÃÃo participante, entrevistas semiestruturadas em profundidade e anÃlise documental. Os resultados evidenciaram que os licenciandos, em fase de conclusÃo do curso, externam a existÃncia de lacunas na formaÃÃo inicial no tocante Ã prÃtica docente, em particular no referente a aspectos da cibercultura e da interdisciplinaridade. Para os licenciandos, o LIFE articulou teoria e prÃtica e potencializou experiÃncias associadas ao ensino, mediado por vivÃncias ciberculturais e interdisciplinares â no desenvolvimento dos MDCR e na relaÃÃo estabelecida com os alunos da escola parceira â que pretendem praticar na docÃncia. Concluiu-se que a formaÃÃo LIFE se configurou, para os licenciandos, como a formaÃÃo prÃtica que buscaram no projeto ao aproximar elementos da cibercultura e da interdisciplinaridade da escola. O estudo evidenciou, com suporte nas contribuiÃÃes dos licenciandos, a necessidade de discussÃes no Ãmbito da academia e da escola acerca das polÃticas atuais de formaÃÃo de professores...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the human and the technological has been a persistent concern in the dramas and images of digital games. Gameworlds are populated with mutants, cyborgs, robots and computer networks – avatars are augmented with headup displays, exoskeletons and impossible weaponry. Yet in significant ways digital games can be seen not only as representations of a putative future technoculture – as a technological imaginary of new media - but also as actual instances of a technoculture here and now. To play a digital game is to plug oneself into a cybernetic circuit. Any particular game-event is realised through feedback between computer components, human perception, imagination and motor skills, and software elements from virtual environments to intelligent agents. This <b>cybercultural</b> language has been regarded with some suspicion within the humanities and social sciences. For intellectual traditions founded on social constructivism any sense of technological determinism is problematic – historical and cultural agency, it is presumed, resides solely in the human and the social. This paper will argue that {{a full understanding of}} both the playing of digital games, and the wider techno-cultural context of this play, is only possible through a recognition and theorisation of technological agency. The paper will draw in particular on theoretical positions developed within the Sociology of Science and Technology and Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to explore how social constructivism might be challenged by the consideration of what Bruno Latour calls ‘the missing masses’ - the mass of non-human devices and objects that, he asserts, make up the 2 ̆ 7 dark matter 2 ̆ 7 of society. These masses are unobservable using established sociological lenses, but are theoretically necessary to the existence of human relationships and activities (Latour 1991). Whilst actor-network theory is concerned with artefacts, agents and networks from transport and health systems to road furniture and allergies, this paper will argue that digital game play – given its centrality to the development and dissemination of popular computer hardware, software and cultural practices - is a privileged, paradigmatic instance of an emergent digital popular technoculture (Turkle 1984). In these terms digital game play is a vivid instantiation of Donna Haraway’s figurative cyborg: an ambiguous and monstrous intimacy between the human and organic and the technological and inorganic (Haraway 1990). Digital games aestheticise this cyborg world, but they also realise it: this is an aesthetics of control and agency (or the loss of these) through immersive, embodied pleasures and anxieties; rather than (just) of dramatic scenarios and screen-presented action (Friedman 1999, Lahti 2003). The common experience of digital game play as characterised by the loss of distinction between game, software, machine and player, resonates with the ANT critique of the ‘object hypothesis’ (that entities are bounded, and discrete from other entities and their environment) (Woolgar 1991). Of the boundaries under threat, perhaps the most significant is that between subject and object – precisely the boundary that digital game play transgresses. The playing of the GameBoy Advance game Advance Wars 2 will be analysed, identifying the diverse agencies and valencies of elements or nodes in its circuit – player, console, and software. The latter will also be analysed as itself an actor-network – of algorithms, simulation and cellular automata. The implications for established analytical terms and boundaries {{in the study of the}} consumption of popular media will be addressed. Firstly: how is the user/player ‘configured’ (Woolgar 1991). Secondly: what are the subjects and objects of this simulation-conflict between cellular automata? Digital game studies has yet to engage with a sustained debate on the implications of its fundamentally technologically based foundation – i. e. the ‘digitality’ of digital games. This paper calls for such a debate and offers some initial thoughts on issues and directions.
