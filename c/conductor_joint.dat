During the test we (a) verified the DC and AC operating margin of the NbTi Cable-in-Conduit Conductor in conditions representative of {{the operation of the}} ITER PF coils, (b) measured the intermediate <b>conductor</b> <b>joint</b> resistance, margin and loss, and (c) measured the AC loss of the conductor and its changes once subjected to a significant number of Lorentz force cycles. We compare the results obtained to expectations from strand and cable characterization, which were studied extensively earlier. We finally discuss the implications for the ITER PF system...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{development}} of REBCO superconducting tapes, cabling methods and joint concepts {{could be a}} revolutionary development for magnetic fusion. REBCO has significantly better performance at high magnetic fields than traditional low temperature superconductors (LTS), and can be operated at a higher temperature than LTS for reduced thermodynamic cost of cooling. Use of REBCO superconductors in the magnet systems of tokamaks allows building demountable toroidal field (TF) coils, greatly simplifying reactor construction and maintenance. A demountable TF coil system with REBCO superconductors for a fusion reactor has been conceptually designed. The coil system operates at 20 K, with a maximum magnetic field of 20 T. The magnets are divided into two coil segments and can be detached and remounted to allow the internal components of the reactor to be removed vertically as one piece. Operating at 20 T and 20 K, the stress {{in most of the}} coils is acceptable (less than 2 / 3 the yield strength and less than 1 / 2 the ultimate tensile strength of the structural materials). The strain in the superconductors is lower than the reversible degradation limit. The electrical resistance in each <b>conductor</b> <b>joint</b> is 10 n [Omega]. The total heat generation in the reactor superconducting TF magnets is approximately 1. 9 MW, of which about 25 % is nuclear heating and 75 % joint heating. 71 MW of electricity are required for cooling the coils at 20 K, about 7 % of the electric energy the reactor generates. The expected time to warm-up the magnets from the operation temperature to room temperature is 7 days, and approximately the same for cool-down back to the operation temperature. The analysis of the conceptual magnet design is encouraging, as no insuperable problems have been identified. This conceptual design {{can be used as a}} starting point for a full engineering design of demountable fusion reactors magnets. by Franco Julio Mangiarotti. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{is one of}} the {{general-purpose}} detectors to {{be provided}} for the LHC project at CERN. The design field of the CMS superconducting magnet is 4 T, the magnetic length is 12. 5 m and the free bore is 6 m. The CMS coil consists of five independent modules each containing four winding layers. Each winding layer is composed of a single length of aluminum stabilized and aluminum alloy reinforced conductor. Each of the four conductor lengths within a module will be electrically joined after winding is completed, and each of the five modules will be connected to the magnet bus bars during module assembly. Due to the large dimensions of the conductor and to the high current it carries, the <b>conductor</b> <b>joints</b> are sources of substantial and nontrivial joule heating during nonsteady state operation of the magnet. In addition to steady-state conditions, three transient conditions have been analyzed.

40|$|Calculating the {{coupling}} losses in cable-in-conduit <b>conductor</b> (CICC) <b>joints</b> requires {{a large amount}} of numerical effort, which is why the numerical system is often reduced by grouping strands together. However, to better understand the loss behaviour, and eventually the stability mechanism in such joints, a full-sized model working on the level of individual strands is more desirable. For this reason, the numerical cable model JackPot-AC has been expanded to also simulate {{the coupling}} losses in a CICC joint. This model has been verified with AC loss measurements on a mock-up joint, which was subjected to an applied harmonic field at different angles. The mock-up joint consisted of two sub-sized CICCs connected by a copper sole. For additional verification the AC loss of one of these conductors and the copper sole was also measured separately. The results of the simulation agree with the measurements, and the model therefore proves to be a useful analytical tool for examining the coupling loss in CICC joint...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of a {{demountable}} and gas-permeable high voltage insulation was developed for the cable-in-conduit conductor connections of the superconducting Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) magnet system. These connections are situated within the cryovacuum space of the machine. Normal operation voltages are very low {{so that they do}} not need to be considered separately with respect to electrical insulation. On the other hand, in case of an emergency switch off the maximal voltage between two <b>conductor</b> <b>joints</b> might reach around 3 kV. Again, the normal operation cryovacuum is by far sufficient as an electrical insulator for this voltage too. However, in case of a vacuum failure which might occur simultaneously with or might even trigger a fast coil discharge, the gas pressure could reach the conditions of the 'Paschen minimum' which is characterized by a low breakdown voltage. In the worst case the leak woulder occur for instance between the cryovacuum space and the helium system leading to the minimal helium breakdown voltage of #approx# 160 V even for large electrode distances. The gas-permeable high voltage insulation was tested with regard to dc voltage strength and to gas flow for He below atmospheric pressure. Experiments were performed around the Paschen minimum region at ambient as well as LN_ 2 temperatures. The results show that this type of insulation has sufficient strength for the specified test voltage of 12 kV under all vacuum conditions. The gas flow investigations proved that the flow resistance and the ability to hold helium will hinder neither the pumping of the W 7 -X cryostat nor the leak tests. This work shows the principal applicability of the proposed insulation system. Further investigations would be needed for better physical understanding and for optimization. However, the development is so far advanced that one could start to build an insulation prototype for W 7 -X. A patent application was filed for this gas-permeable and dismountable high voltage insulation which is suitable also for other large superconducting magnets with cable-in-conduit conductors. (orig.)

40|$|Electrical and {{mechanical}} characterizations of YBCO coated <b>conductors</b> diffusion <b>joints</b> obtained in a 2 mm wide, Cu stabilizer free commercial tape provided by Superpower Inc. were reported. Two conductor pieces were overlapped for {{a length of}} 20 mm and kept in contact under a pressure as high as 80 MPa. A face-to-face approach was used, with or without an additional Ag tape insert. The joint was realized by Ag diffusion at a temperature of 200 and 400 ??C in N 2 and O 2 atmosphere, respectively. The resistivity of the joint was measured at 77 K in N 2 bath. The mechanical properties of the joint were characterized by means of single-lap tensile test operated at room temperature {{at a rate of}} 0. 5 mm/min. The best results were obtained by high temperature joining in O 2 atmosphere. The resistivity of the joints was as low as 3. 1 ?? 10 - 12 ?? m 2. This value is almost halved if an Ag insert is used. The mechanical properties of the joints are strongly dependent on the use of an Ag insert, since maximum load as high as 60 N can be applied if no additional insert is used. This value enhances to about 100 N when an Ag insert is employed. However, the joint obtained at low temperature in N 2 atmosphere is also interesting since the joint resistivity was slightly increased to 4. 7 ?? 10 - 12 ?? m 2 and a maximum load as high as 50 N was obtained indicating that diffusion joints can be safely handled. These results are promising in perspective of oxygen free diffusion joints in Cu stabilized coated conductors...|$|R

This Technical Note explains the purpose, types, and application procedures for the conformal coatings used to protect these sensitive circuits. Conformal coatings are protective materials that are designed to conform to the surface of printed circuit boards for the purpose of providing a durable barrier against environmental contaminants. A conformal coating is typically applied as a thin film with a thickness of 3 – 8 mil (0. 075 – 0. 2 mm). The physical and chemical compositions of various coatings differ, and thereby offer varying degrees of protection. However, all conformal coatings possess certain characteristics: 1. Conformal coatings prevent short circuits and corrosion of <b>conductors</b> and solder <b>joints</b> by providing a barrier against moisture, dust, and chemical contaminants. 2. The coatings provide durable insulation to help components tolerate shock and resist abrasion. The coatings also serve to reduce mechanical and thermal stresses on the components.

Europe (EU) is expected to provide to Japan (JA) the totality of the toroidal field (TF) magnet system, while JA will provide both Equilibrium field (EF) and Central Solenoid (CS) systems. All magnet designs were optimized trough the past years and entered in parallel into ex-tensive experimentally-based phases of concept validation, which came to maturation in the years 2009 and 2010. For this, all magnet systems were investigated by mean of dedicated samples, e. g. con-ductor and joint samples designed, manufactured and tested at full scale in ad hoc facilities either in EU or in JA.

40|$|The ITER Central Solenoid has 36 interpancake joints, 12 bus joints, and 12 feeder joints in the magnet. The joints are {{required}} to have resistance below 4 nOhm at 45 kA at 4. 5 K. The US ITER Project Office developed {{two different types of}} interpancake joints with some variations in details in order to find a better design, qualify the joints, and establish a fabrication process. We built and tested four samples of the sintered joints and two samples with butt-bonded joints (a total of eight joints). Both designs met the specifications.

40|$|JackPot is a {{new model}} {{that is used to}} analyse how and to what extend current {{non-uniformity}} among strands in a cable-in-conduit conductor (CICC) affects its performance. The joints at the extremities of the CICCs in coils and short samples introduce a non-uniform current distribution among the strands. A detailed and quantitative study down to strand level is required to explain the involved phenomena, to understand their implications on short sample and coil tests and to provide adequate solutions for improvements. The model can be used to evaluate the influence of the joint design and to define its baseline requirements for short-sample qualification testing, and for optimum magnet performance of for example the ITER coils. JackPot is an electrical network model that simulates the interaction between the superconducting strands in the cable (following their precise trajectories), the interstrand contact resistances, the conduit, and the cable’s connection to the joints. The backbone of JackPot is its cable geometry model, from which all relevant properties are derived. All parameters are derived from well defined experimental measurements on <b>conductor</b> sections and <b>joints,</b> except the axial strain for Nb 3 Sn strands, which is the only free parameter in the model. The simulations demonstrate that the current non-uniformity is the source for a number of observed phenomena. Another conclusion is that completely filling the bottom joints and upper terminations of a short sample with solder, opposed to only (partly) soldering the cable surface, improves short-sample testing significantly for qualifying the ITER type CICCs.
