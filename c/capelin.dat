5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} {{in summer and}} live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile Atlantic and Pacific salmon, herring, <b>capelin</b> and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.|$|E
5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish <b>capelin</b> (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like <b>capelin</b> and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and <b>capelin.</b> Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E
5|$|In the North Pacific, {{they feed}} on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia, Thysanoessa, and Nyctiphanes, large copepods in the genus Neocalanus, small {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Engraulis, Mallotus, Clupea, and Theragra), and squid. Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey species were <b>capelin</b> (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E

25|$|<b>Capelin</b> are a {{forage fish}} of the smelt family {{found in the}} Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of {{plankton}} {{at the edge of}} the ice shelf. Larger <b>capelin</b> also eat krill and other crustaceans. The <b>capelin</b> move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. The migration is affected by ocean currents. Around Iceland maturing <b>capelin</b> make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January.|$|E

25|$|In May 1804 she was {{commissioned}} under Lieutenant Archibald McDonald (or M'Donald; acting) for the Halifax station. On 20 December 1806 he faced a court martial for his conduct after <b>Capelin</b> had run aground while under his command. The court {{decided that the}} charge was partly proven and so reprimanded him. It also ruled that he forfeit all seniority on the lieutenants' list. Still, McDonald was promoted to lieutenant on 22 December 1806 and commanded <b>Capelin</b> until February 1807. At some point, possibly in 1806, Lieutenant J. Beckett may have commanded her for a short period.|$|E
25|$|Typical ocean {{forage fish}} are small, silvery {{schooling}} oily fish such as herring, anchovies and menhaden, and other small, schooling baitfish like <b>capelin,</b> smelts, sand lance, halfbeaks, pollock, butterfish and juvenile rockfish. Herrings are a preeminent forage fish, often marketed as sardines or pilchards.|$|E
25|$|Salmon as food, herring as food, smelt, halibut, flounder, tomcod, pike, and <b>capelin</b> were gutted and air dried or smoked. The fish heads {{they made}} into qamiqurrluk (cut and dried fish heads), and some they made into tepa (aged fish heads). Fish eggs (roe) were dried and stored.|$|E
25|$|By 2002, after a 10-year {{moratorium}} on fishing, the cod had still not returned. The local ecosystem {{seemed to have}} changed, with forage fish, such as <b>capelin,</b> which used to provide food for the cod, increasing in numbers and now eating the juvenile cod. The waters appeared {{to be dominated by}} crab and shrimp rather than fish.|$|E
25|$|HMS <b>Capelin</b> was a Royal Navy Ballahoo-class {{schooner}} carrying four 12-pounder carronades and {{a crew of}} 20. The {{prime contractor}} for the vessel was Goodrich & Co., in Bermuda, and she was launched in 1804. Like many of her class and the related Cuckoo-class schooners, she succumbed to the {{perils of the sea}} relatively early in her career.|$|E
25|$|The fishery {{has yet to}} recover, and may {{not recover}} at all because of a {{possibly}} stable change in the food chain. Atlantic cod was a top-tier predator, along with haddock, flounder and hake, feeding upon smaller prey such as herring, <b>capelin,</b> shrimp and snow crab. With the large predatory fish removed, their prey has had a population explosion and have become the top predators.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish, {{also called}} prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed {{near the base}} of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include {{particularly}} fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as <b>capelin,</b> and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.|$|E
25|$|Most filter-feeding {{pelagic fish}} found in coastal waters are small, silvery forage fish. Forage fish include fishes {{of the family}} Clupeidae (herrings, shad, {{sardines}} and pilchards, hilsa, menhaden and sprats), as well as anchovies, <b>capelin</b> and halfbeaks. They use schooling strategies to avoid predators, and different schools of forage fish often associate {{with each other in}} open coastal waters. Forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton and fry (recently hatched fish), often by filter feeding. In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals.|$|E
25|$|Steller {{sea lions}} are skilled and {{opportunistic}} marine predators, feeding {{on a wide}} range of fish and cephalopod species. Important diet components include walleye pollock, Atka mackerel, halibut, herring, <b>capelin,</b> flatfish Pacific cod, rockfish, sculpins, and cephalopods. They seem to prefer schooling fish and remain primarily between intertidal zones and continental shelves. They are also known to enter estuarine environments and feed on some brackishwater fish such as sturgeon. Very occasionally, they have been known to prey on northern fur seals, harbor seals, and sea otter pups. They are near the top of the marine food chain, but are susceptible to predation by killer whales and great white sharks.|$|E
25|$|Herring {{are found}} in the North Sea and the North Atlantic at depths to 200 meters. Important herring {{fisheries}} have existed in these areas for centuries. Herring of different sizes and growth rates belong to different populations, each of which have their own migration routes. When spawning, a female produces from 20,000 to 50,000 eggs. After spawning, the herrings are depleted in fat, and migrate back to feeding grounds rich in plankton. Around Iceland, three separate populations of herring were traditionally fished. These stocks collapsed in the late 1960s, although two have since recovered. After the collapse, Iceland turned to <b>capelin,</b> which now account for about half of Iceland's total catch.|$|E
25|$|One {{suspected}} {{cause of}} their precipitous decline was overfishing of Alaska pollock, herring, and other fish stocks in the Gulf of Alaska. This stems largely from the “junk-food hypothesis” representing a shift in their diet from fatty herring and <b>capelin</b> to leaner fare such as pollock and flounder, thereby limiting their ability to consume and store fat. Other hypotheses include increased predation by orcas and sharks, indirect effects of prey species composition shifts due to changes in climate, effects of disease or contaminants, shooting by fishermen, and others. The decline is certainly due to a complex of interrelated factors which {{have yet to be}} defined by the research effort.|$|E
25|$|These new {{technologies}} adversely affected the Northern Cod population in two important ways: {{by increasing the}} area and depth that was fished, the cod were being depleted {{to the point that}} the surviving fish were incapable of replenishing the stock lost each year; and secondly, the trawlers caught enormous amounts of non-commercial fish, which although economically unimportant, held huge ecological significance: incidental catch undermines the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole, depleting stocks of important predator and prey species. In the case of the Northern Cod, significant amounts of <b>capelin</b> – an important prey species for the cod – were caught as bycatch, further undermining the survival of the remaining cod stock.|$|E
25|$|Like many auks, puffins eat both {{fish and}} zooplankton, but feed their chicks {{primarily}} with small marine fish {{several times a}} day. The prey species of the Atlantic puffin include the sandeel, herring and <b>capelin.</b> The puffins are distinct {{in their ability to}} hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips, since they can come back with more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behaviour is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.|$|E
25|$|On average, {{an adult}} killer whale {{in the wild}} may eat about three to four percent of their body weight daily, or as much as 227kg (500lb) of food for a six-ton male. Their diet in the wild depends on what is available, and may include fish, walruses, seals, sea lions, penguins, squid, sea turtles, sharks and whales. According to SeaWorld, each of their adult orcas {{receives}} 140 to 240 pounds of food per day, primarily herring, <b>capelin,</b> salmon and mackerel. To maintain their alertness, the killer whales are fed at sporadic intervals throughout the day (as would happen in the wild) and feeding is often combined with training and shows. Each batch of fish is carefully tested to determine its nutritive composition, and each killer whale's weight, activity and health is carefully monitored to determine any special dietary requirements.|$|E
25|$|Belugas play an {{important}} role in the structure and function of marine resources in the Arctic Ocean, as they are the most abundant toothed whales in the region. They are opportunistic feeders; their feeding habits depend on their locations and the season. For example, when they are in the Beaufort Sea, they mainly eat Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and the stomachs of belugas caught near Greenland were found to contain rose fish (Sebastes marinus), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), while in Alaska their staple diet is Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In general, the diets of these cetaceans consist mainly of fish; apart from those previously mentioned, other fish they feed on include <b>capelin</b> (Mallotus villosus), smelt, sole, flounder, herring, sculpin, and other types of salmon. They also consume a great quantity of invertebrates, apart from shrimp, such as squid, crabs, clams, octopus, sea snails, bristle worms, and other deep-sea species. Animals in captivity eat 2.5% to 3.0% of their body weight per day, which equates to 18.2 to 27.2kg.|$|E
500|$|In the North Atlantic, they prey on euphausiids in the genera Meganyctiphanes, Thysanoessa and Nyctiphanes {{and small}} {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Clupea, Mallotus, and Ammodytes). Of the 1,609 fin whale stomachs examined at the Hvalfjörður whaling station in southwestern Iceland from 1967 to 1989 (caught between June and September), 96% contained only krill, 2.5% krill and fish, 0.8% some fish remains, 0.7% <b>capelin</b> (M. villosus), and 0.1% sandeel (family Ammodytidae); {{a small proportion}} of (mainly juvenile) blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) were also found. Of the krill sampled between 1979 and 1989, the vast majority (over 99%) was northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica); only one stomach contained Thysanoessa longicaudata. Off West Greenland, 75% of the fin whales caught between July and October had consumed krill (family Euphausiidae), 17% <b>capelin</b> (Mallotus) and 8% sand lance (Ammodytes sp.). Off eastern Newfoundland, they chiefly feed on <b>capelin,</b> but also take small quantities of euphausiids (mostly T. raschii and T. inermis). In the Ligurian-Corsican-Provençal Basin in the Mediterranean Sea they make dives as deep as [...] to feed on the euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica, while off the island of Lampedusa, between Tunisia and Sicily, they have been observed in mid-winter feeding on surface swarms of the small euphausiid Nyctiphanes couchi.|$|E
500|$|This alcid {{typically}} fed in shoaling {{waters that}} were shallower than those frequented by other alcids, although after the breeding season, {{they had been}} sighted as far as [...] from land. They {{are believed to have}} fed cooperatively in flocks. Their main food was fish, usually [...] in length and weighing , but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird's own length. Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that Atlantic menhaden and <b>capelin</b> were their favoured prey. Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers, shorthorn sculpins, cod, sand lance, as well as crustaceans. The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adults.|$|E
500|$|The {{great auk}} was [...] tall and weighed about , {{making it the}} second-largest member of the alcid family (Miomancalla was larger). It had a black back and a white belly. The black beak was heavy and hooked, with grooves on its surface. During summer, great auk plumage showed a white patch over each eye. During winter, the great auk lost these patches, instead {{developing}} a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only [...] long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the great auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish, including Atlantic menhaden and <b>capelin,</b> and crustaceans. Although agile in the water, it was clumsy on land. Great auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown marbling. Both parents participated in the incubation of the egg for around 6 weeks before the young hatched. The young left the nest site after 2-3 weeks, although the parents continued to care for it.|$|E
500|$|The Atlantic puffin diet {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of fish, though examination of its stomach contents shows that it occasionally eats shrimps, other crustaceans, molluscs and polychaete worms, especially in more coastal waters. When fishing, it swims underwater using its semi-extended wings as paddles to [...] "fly" [...] through the water and its feet as a rudder. It swims fast and can reach considerable depths and stay submerged {{for up to a}} minute. It can eat shallow-bodied fish as long as [...] but its prey is commonly smaller fish, around [...] long. It has been estimated that an adult bird needs to eat about forty of these per day—sand eels, herring, sprats and <b>capelin</b> being the most often consumed. It fishes by sight and can swallow small fish while submerged, but larger specimens are brought to the surface. It can catch several small fish in one dive, holding the first ones in place in its beak with its muscular, grooved tongue while it catches others. The two mandibles are hinged {{in such a way that}} they can be held parallel to hold a row of fish in place and these are also retained by inward-facing serrations on the edges of the beak. It copes with the excess salt that it swallows partly through its kidneys and partly by excretion through specialised salt glands in its nostrils.|$|E
