40|$|The {{potency of}} {{antimalarial}} dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, alone and in synergistic combination with dihydropteroate synthetase inhibitors, against the Kenyan K 39 strain of Plasmodium falciparum (pyrimethamine resistant) and against normal replicating human bone marrow cells in in vitro {{culture has been}} studied. Therapeutic indices and rank order of synergistic potency were derived. Trimethoprim, pyrimethamine, and the quinazolines WR 159412 and WR 158122 had the smallest therapeutic indices (1. 39, 4. 38, 2. 56, and 90. 0, respectively), while the three triazines <b>clociguanil,</b> WR 99210, and chlorcycloguanil had the largest (3, 562, 3, 000, and 2, 000, respectively). In rank order of decreasing activity against P. falciparum, the six most potent drug combinations were WR 99210 -dapsone, chlorcycloguanil-dapsone, WR 158122 -dapsone, WR 159412 -dapsone, WR 159412 -sulfamethoxazole, and chlorcycloguanil-sulfamethoxazole; pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine was the least potent combination. These experiments form {{a basis for the}} selection of rapidly eliminated antifolate combinations for further clinical testing...|$|E
