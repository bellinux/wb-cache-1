5|$|As Ironside was a {{marginal}} operation, {{and they were}} worried about exposing agents as false, the Twenty Committee for the most part utilised less important agents and added words of <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} race, Ryan Newman {{was the leader}} at the start. However, {{by the end of}} the lap Paul Menard became the leader. Afterward, the first caution was given after Newman spun sideways. On the 11th lap, Harvick moved to the first position. Twenty laps later, Busch became the leader. With four laps remaining, Michael McDowell's engine failed, {{prompting}} the second <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> be given.

5|$|Though {{initially}} {{perceived to}} be a potential threat to The Bahamas and Florida due to its westward motion, the hurricane curved northward on September13, mitigating any evacuation procedures. Despite the storm's change in track, the United States Weather Bureau cautioned shipping interests in the outlying islands of the Bahamas. Pan American World Airways was forced to postpone two transatlantic flights from New York City to Portugal due to the storm. After the hurricane recurved, the Weather Bureau advised <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> areas of the New England coast, particularly in Nantucket and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where strong winds and waves were anticipated. Storm warnings were posted for coastal areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine on September16. The warnings were discontinued after the hurricane passed the warned areas.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Stewart passed Harvick for {{the fourth}} {{position}} on the 219th lap. Three laps later, Robby Gordon spun sideways, prompting the fourth <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> be given.

5|$|Johnson {{moved back}} into the lead on lap 80, after {{receiving}} assistance from Earnhardt, before losing it to Stewart around the inside two laps later after Stewart was helped by Mike Wallace. On the 81st lap, Mike Wallace's right-rear tire blew causing a fifth <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> be displayed; Wallace regained control of his car but his tire struck Michael Waltrip's car forcing him to pit for repairs. Most of the field, including Stewart, elected to make pit stops for tires and fuel. Kyle Busch gained the lead after the pit stops, and led the field back up to speed at the lap-86 restart, followed by Earnhardt.

5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
5|$|On the 21st lap, Kyle Busch fell to {{the ninth}} position, after having no {{assistance}}. Two laps later, Bowyer took the first position, but after two more laps, he was passed by Gordon.

Seven laps later, Gordon, with assistance from Bayne became moved into {{the first and second}} positions. On the 39th lap, Brad Keselowski spun sideways after losing control of his car, prompting the third <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> come out. He slid through grass but continued without any apparent damage. At the lap 43 restart, Gordon remained in the first position, but on the following lap, Edwards retook the lead. On the 46th lap, Hamlin spun sideways to cause the fourth caution. Edwards remained the leader at the lap 49 restart. Five laps later, the fifth caution was given, after Todd Bodine crashed. With three laps remaining in the race, Burton and Bowyer were in the first two positions. Burton remained the leader to cross the finish line in first, ahead of Bowyer in second. Also on the final lap, there was an accident at behind the front runners. Michael Waltrip finished third, Kyle Busch clinched fourth, and Brian Keselowski rounded out the first five positions.|$|E

Ernie Irvan {{dropped to the}} rear of the field prior to the start of the race, due to a driver change; Ricky Craven had qualified the car. Although Bobby Labonte started on pole, Dale Jarrett, who had started third, led the first lap of the race; Dale Earnhardt took the lead on lap two and held it through the first caution period of the race, for rain, for three laps starting at lap 13. A large crash occurred on lap 32; initiated by Kevin Lepage losing control of his car in turn two, the wreck collected eleven cars, including Hut Stricklin, Geoff Bodine and three-time Winston Cup champion Darrell Waltrip; Earnhardt lost the lead during pit stops under <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> Rusty Wallace, with Dave Marcis pitting a lap later than the leaders to pick up five bonus points for leading a lap. Lepage suffered a fractured shoulder in a fall exiting his car.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached the United States East Coast on August 31, the United States Weather Bureau advised extreme <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> ships between Cape Hatteras and southern areas of New England. Storm warnings were issued for coastal regions between Wilmington, North Carolina and the Virginia Capes. These warnings were later extended northward to the Delaware Breakwater. Strong winds exceeding gale-force were expected {{for much of}} the East Coast, particularly for Cape Hatteras. On September1, hurricane warnings were ordered for areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Pamlico Sound, while previously issued storm warnings remained in place. On September2, gale warnings extended further north into Nantucket, Massachusetts. In Norfolk, Virginia, city department heads were ordered to stand by for potential emergency duties. United States Coast Guard personnel were also dispatched along the North Carolina coast. United States Navy personnel were detained in New London, Connecticut until the storm passed. In Westhampton, New York, a mass evacuation occurred, involving 10,000residences. Air traffic to and from Mitchel Air Force Base was cancelled, and 100airplanes stationed at the base were fastened to the ground. Police and firemen evacuated a 50mi (80km) stretch of the Rhode Island coastline. This included Roy Carpenter's Beach, where 1,000families were forced to evacuate. In Narragansett Bay, boats were sent back to harbors or towed to shore. The extensive precautionary measures undertaken occurred in part due to fears that the storm would cause similar effects to a destructive hurricane which swept through areas of New England two years prior.|$|E
