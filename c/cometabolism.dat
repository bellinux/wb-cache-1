50|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{within the}} soil are microbial populations that utilize hydrocarbons {{as a source}} of energy and Carbon. Upwards to twenty percent of microbial soil populations have the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons. These populations can through either accelerated or natural monitored attenuation be utilized to neutralize within the soil hydrocarbon pollutants. The metabolic mode of hydrocarbon remediation is primarily aerobic. The end products of the remediation for hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide and water. Hydrocarbons vary in ease of degradation based on their structure. Long chain aliphatic carbons are the most effectively degraded. Short chained, branched, and quaternary aliphatic hydrocarbons are less effectively degraded. Alkene degradation is dependent on the saturation of the chain with saturated alkenes being more readily degraded. Large numbers of microbes with the ability to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons are present within the soil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also susceptible to being degraded through anaerobic metabolism. Hydrocarbon metabolism is an important facet of in situ bioremediation due to the severity of petroleum spills around the world. Polynuclear aromatic carbons susceptibility to degradation is related to the number of aromatic rings within the compound. Compounds with two or three rings are degraded at an effective rate, compounds possessing four or more rings can be more resilient to bioremediation efforts. Degradation of polynuclear aromatic carbons with less than four rings is accomplished by various aerobic microbes present in the soil. For larger compounds the only metabolic mode that has shown to be effective is <b>cometabolism.</b> The fungus genus Phanerochaete under anaerobic conditions has species with the ability to metabolize some polynuclear aromatic carbons utilizing a peroxidase enzyme.|$|E

At the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, dissolved trichloroethylene (TCE) is disappearing from the Snake River Plain aquifer (SRPA) by natural attenuation, a finding that saves significant site restoration costs. Acceptance of monitored natural attenuation as a preferred treatment technology requires direct evidence of the processes and rates of the degradation. Our proposal aims to provide that evidence for one such site by testing two hypotheses. First, we believe that realistic values for in situ rates of TCE <b>cometabolism</b> {{can be obtained by}} sustaining the putative microorganisms at the low catabolic activities consistent with aquifer conditions. Second, the patterns of functional gene expression evident in these communities under starvation conditions while carrying out TCE <b>cometabolism</b> can be used to diagnose the cometabolic activity in the aquifer itself.

Realistic terms for <b>cometabolism</b> of TCE will provide marked improvements in DOE's ability to predict and monitor natural attenuation of chlorinated organics at other sites, increase the acceptability of this solution, and provide significant economic and health benefits through this noninvasive remediation strategy.

The K(infi) value for TCE (30 (mu) M) {{is similar to the}} K(infm) for ammonia (40 (mu) M). Second, we examined the toxicity associated with TCE <b>cometabolism</b> by N. europaea. Stationary-phase cells of N. europaea oxidized approximately 60 nmol of TCE per mg of protein before ammonia-oxidizing activity was completely inactivated by reactive intermediates generated during TCE oxidation. At the TCE concentrations used in these experiments, ammonia did not provide significant protection against inactivation. Third, we have determined the ability of cells to recover ammonia-oxidizing activity after exposure to TCE. Cells recovering from TCE inactivation were compared with cells recovering from the specific inactivation of ammonia-oxidizing activity by light. The recovery kinetics were indistinguishable when 40 % or less of the activity was inactivated. However, at increased levels of inactivation, TCE-inactivated cells did not recover as rapidly as light-inactivated cells.

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{objective of}} the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) enzyme activity probe (EAP) effort is to determine if aerobic <b>cometabolism</b> is contributing to the attenuation of trichloroethene (TCE) and other chlorinated solvents in the contaminated groundwater beneath PGDP. The site-specific objective for the EAP assessment is to identify if key metabolic pathways are present and expressed in the microbial community [...] namely the pathways {{that are responsible for}} degradation of methane and aromatic (e. g. toluene, benzene, phenol) substrates. The enzymes produced to degrade methane and aromatic compounds also break down TCE through a process known as <b>cometabolism.</b> EAPs directly measure if methane and/or aromatic enzyme production pathways are operating and, for the aromatic pathways, provide an estimate of the number of active organisms in the sampled groundwater. This study in the groundwater plumes at PGDP is a major part of a larger scientific effort being conducted by Interstate Technology and Regulatory Council (ITRC), U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM), Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), and North Wind Inc. in which EAPs are being applied to contaminated groundwater from diverse hydrogeologic and plume settings throughout the U. S. to help standardize their application as well as their interpretation. While EAP data provide key information to support the site specific objective for PGDP, several additional lines of evidence are being evaluated to increase confidence in the determination of the occurrence of biodegradation and the rate and sustainability of aerobic <b>cometabolism.</b> These complementary efforts include: (1) Examination of plume flowpaths and comparison of TCE behavior to 'conservative' tracers in the plume (e. g., {sup 99 }Tc); (2) Evaluation of geochemical conditions throughout the plume; and (3) Evaluation of stable isotopes in the contaminants and their daughter products throughout the plume.

40|$|Much {{work has}} {{suggested}} that the rate of attenuation of water-soluble organic contaminants in aerobic aquatic systems is dependent on the level of secondary nutrients in the water column. For example, the decay rate of alachlor, a common herbicide, was over 10 times higher under hypereutrophic compared with oligotrophic water conditions. It has been presumed that higher water column nutrient levels produce larger microbial communities, resulting in higher rates of alachlor <b>cometabolism.</b> However, most earlier field studies only assessed alachlor fate in systems with full light exposure (FLE). Therefore, new experiments were performed to assess how variations in light level affect alachlor <b>cometabolism</b> in such systems. Twelve tank mesocosms were maintained using identical nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply conditions: four units with full light exposure (100 % FILE), four with partial shading (19. 3 % FLE), and four with near complete shading (0. 5 % FLE). Alachlor half-lives were found to vary broadly, from 50 to 60 days in higher light units to > 180 days in the 0. 5 % FLE units. Nutrient analysis indicated that the low light units were severely carbon (C) -limited for microbial decomposition, whereas the other units had excess C relative to N and P. Apparently, reduced light levels cause decreased production of bioavailable C for decomposition, which significantly reduces alachlor <b>cometabolism.</b> The data suggest that water column nutrient levels only correlate with the alachlor decay rate when light levels are high, and that the biodegradable carbon supply must be considered when the fate of water-soluble contaminants in aerobic aquatic systems is assessed...|$|E

However, strain MA 01 was distinct from other TNT-reducing organisms in that it transformed these compounds into highly polar metabolites through an 02 -dependent process.

40|$|Trichloroethene (TCE), {{a common}} {{groundwater}} contaminant, can be degraded {{under certain conditions}} by microorganisms that occur naturally in the subsurface. TCE can be degraded under anaerobic conditions to less chlorinated compounds and ultimately into the non-chlorinated, non-hazardous end product, ethene, via anaerobic reductive dechlorination (ARD). ARD is widely recognized as a TCE degradation mechanism, and occurs in active groundwater remediation and can occur during monitored natural attenuation (MNA). MNA relies on natural processes, such as dispersion and degradation, to reduce contaminant concentrations to acceptable levels without active human intervention other than monitoring. TCE can also be biodegraded under aerobic conditions via <b>cometabolism,</b> in which microbial enzymes produced for other purposes fortuitously also react with TCE. In <b>cometabolism,</b> TCE is oxidized directly to non-hazardous products. <b>Cometabolism</b> as a TCE-degrading process under aerobic conditions is less well known than ARD. Natural attenuation is often discounted as a TCE remedial alternative in aerobic conditions based on the paradigm that TCE is biodegradable only under anaerobic conditions. In contrast to this paradigm, TCE was shown to degrade relative to conservative co-contaminants at an environmentally significant rate in a large (approximately 3 km long) TCE plume in aerobic groundwater at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and the degradation mechanism was shown to be <b>cometabolism.</b> MNA {{was selected as the}} remedy for most of this plume, resulting in a considerable cost savings relative to conventional remedial methods. To determine if <b>cometabolism</b> might be a viable remedy at other sites with TCE-contaminated aerobic groundwater, TCE plumes at Department of Energy (DOE) facilities were screened to evaluate whether TCE commonly degrades in aerobic groundwater, and if degradation rates are fast enough that natural attenuation could be a viable remedy. One hundred and twenty seven plumes at 24 DOE facilities were screened, and 14 plumes were selected for detailed examination. In the plumes selected for further study, spatial changes in the concentration of a conservative co-contaminant were used to compensate for the effects of mixing and temporal changes in TCE release from the contaminant source. Decline in TCE concentration along a flow path in excess of the co contaminant concentration decline was attributed to cometabolic degradation. This study indicated that TCE was degraded in 9 of the 14 plumes examined, with first order degradation half-lives ranging from about 1 to 12 years. TCE degradation in about two-thirds of the plumes examined suggests that <b>cometabolism</b> of TCE in aerobic groundwater is a common occurrence, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that TCE is recalcitrant in aerobic groundwater. The degradation half-life values calculated in this study are short enough that natural attenuation may be a viable remedy in many aerobic plumes. Computer modeling of groundwater flow and contaminant transport and degradation is frequently used to predict the evolution of groundwater plumes, and for evaluating natural attenuation and other remedial alternatives. An important aspect of a computer model is the mathematical approach for describing degradation kinetics. A common approach is to assume that degradation occurs as a first-order process. First order kinetics are easily incorporated into transport models and require only a single value (a degradation half-life) to describe reaction kinetics. The use of first order kinetics is justified in many cases because more elaborate kinetic equations often closely approximate first order kinetics under typical field conditions. A previous modeling study successfully simulated the INL TCE plume using first order degradation kinetics. TCE <b>cometabolism</b> is the result of TCE reacting with microbial enzymes that were produced for other purposes, such as oxidizing a growth substrate to obtain energy. Both TCE and the growth substrate compete for enzyme reactive sites, and the presence of one interferes with reactions with the enzyme by the other. It was assumed that a competitive inhibition kinetic expression would be more technically rigorous than a first order decay kinetic model. Two activities were undertaken to evaluate this assumption. First, a collaborator measured the parameters of this kinetic model under conditions {{similar to those of the}} INL TCE plume. The results will be used in a transport model to compare transport simulated using these measured values with transport simulated using kinetic parameter values from the literature, which are typically for actively growing microorganisms, in contrast to the steady-state, near starvation conditions in the INL TCE plume.

The batch system microcosms consisted of a known mass of wetland plant roots in aerobic growth media where the roots provided both an inoculum of root-associated ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms and a microbial habitat. Aqueous growth media, ammonium, and HAHs including trichloroethene (TCE), cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cis-DCE), chloroform (CF), 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane (1, 1, 2 -TCA), ethylene dibromide (EDB, or 1, 2 -dibromoethane, 1, 2 -DBA) and 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCA) were replaced weekly in batch microcosms while retaining roots and root-associated biomass. Molecular biology results indicated that ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were enriched from wetland plant roots while analysis of contaminant and oxygen concentrations showed that those microorganisms can degrade HAHs by aerobic <b>cometabolism.</b> <b>Cometabolism</b> of TCE, at 29 and 46 µg/L, was sustainable {{over the course of}} 9 weeks, with 20 - 30 mg/L ammonium-N. However, at 69 µg/L of TCE, ammonium oxidation and TCE <b>cometabolism</b> were completely deactivated in two weeks. This indicated that between 46 and 69 µg/L TCE with 30 mg/L ammonium-N there is a threshold [TCE] below which sustainable <b>cometabolism</b> can be maintained with ammonium as the primary substrate. However, cometabolism-induced microbial deactivation of ammonium oxidation and TCE degradation at 69 µg/L TCE did not result in a lower abundance of the amoA gene in the microcosms. In the following experiments with TCE and elevated concentration of 75 mg/L ammonium-N, the deactivation of <b>cometabolism</b> with TCE was observed again when TCE reached from ~ 50 to ~ 70 µg/L. The cometabolic system was activated again one week after the system was replaced by a TCE-free medium culture. Rate constants did not change significantly during the inactivation cycle if normalized by X. It can be inferred that the drop in ammonium and TCE degradation at certain [TCE] are due to the activity shut down by ammonia oxidizers. Similar deactivation trends were observed in microcosm amended with cis-DCE, 1, 1, 2 -TCA and EDB when HAHs concentration increased above ~ 150 µg/L. No deactivation was observed in the reactors with CF and 1, 2 -DCA. A shift of ammonium oxidation production from nitrite of nitrate after HAHs were added was observed in all the HAHs batch systems and those shifts all coincided with a moderate decrease in ammonium and HAHs degradation kinetics. Following sequencing analysis on a cometabolic system with TCE showed that the relative abundance of nitrite oxidizers (especially Nitrospira) changed significantly after 14 weeks, which suggest that the microbial community changed with the addition of elevated concentration of TCE. The relative abundance of previous dominance genera Nitrosomonas decreased at higher TCE concentrations while the abundance of nitrite oxidizers Nitrospira increased significantly due to the weakened competence for oxygen from Nitrosomonas. This research indicates that microorganisms associated with wetland plant roots can assist in the natural attenuation of HAHs in contaminated aquatic environments, such as urban or treatment wetlands, and wetlands impacted by industrial solvents...|$|E

Glucose supplementation did not suppress the activity of degrading enzymes, which were induced upon addition of aromatic compounds. The induction was inhibited by chloramphenicol, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis was essential. Cells showed <b>cometabolism</b> of aromatic compounds and organic acids; however, organic acids suppressed glucose utilization...|$|E

One of the isolates, an Arthrobacter sp., cometabolized m-chlorobenzoate to a product identified as 4 -chlorocatechol by thin-layer chromatography and ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy. The data indicate that <b>cometabolism</b> by the arthrobacter results from the formation of products by its benzoate-oxiding enzyme system that are not acted upon by the catechol-metabolizing enzymes of the bacterium...|$|E
40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{biodegradation}} of the antiviral drug acyclovir by an enriched nitrifying culture during ammonia oxidation {{and without the}} addition of ammonium. The study on kinetics was accompanied with the structural elucidation of biotransformation products through batch biodegradation experiments at two different initial levels of acyclovir (15 mg L and 15 μg L). The pseudo first order kinetic studies of acyclovir {{in the presence of}} ammonium indicated the higher degradation rates under higher ammonia oxidation rates than those constant degradation rates in the absence of ammonium. The positive correlation was found between acyclovir degradation rate and ammonia oxidation rate, confirming the <b>cometabolism</b> of acyclovir by the enriched nitrifying culture in the presence of ammonium. Formation of the product carboxy-acyclovir (P 239) indicated the main biotransformation pathway was aerobic oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group, which was independent on the metabolic type (i. e. <b>cometabolism</b> or metabolism). This enzyme-linked reaction might be catalyzed by monooxygenase from ammonia oxidizing bacteria or heterotrophs. The formation of carboxy-acyclovir was demonstrated to be irrelevant to the acyclovir concentrations applied, indicating the revealed biotransformation pathway might be the dominant removal pathway of acyclovir in wastewater treatment...|$|E
40|$|To {{enhance the}} removal {{efficiency}} of malathion in the wastewater from organophosphate pesticide mill, a bacterium, Acinetobacter johnsonii MA 19, that could degrade malathion with <b>cometabolism</b> was isolated from malathion-polluted soil samples using enrichment culture techniques. Four kinds of additional compounds, sodium succinate, sodium acetate, glucose, and fructose were tested {{to choose a}} favorite carbon source for the <b>cometabolism</b> of strain MA 19. The results showed that sodium succinate and sodium acetate could promote malathion biodegradation and cell growth. The investigation results {{of the effects of}} sodium succinate concentrations on the malathion biodegradation indicated that the more sodium succinate supplied resulted in quick degradation of malathion and fast cells multiplied. Zero-order kinetic model was appropriate to describe the malathion biodegradation when the concentration of sodium succinate was more than 0. 5144 g/L. The degradation rate constant (K) reached the maximum value of 3. 5837 mg/(L. h) when the mass ratio of sodium succinate to malathion was 128. 6 mg/mg. The aquatic toxicity of the malathion was evaluated using the test organism, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri. The data obtained suggested that the toxicity of malathion could be ignored after 84 h biodegradation. Our result demonstrates the potential for using bacterium A. johnsonii MA 19 for malathion biodegradation and environmental bioremediation when some suitable conventional carbon sources are supplied...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD) is {{a biological}} process which produces biomethane as energy source, using waste as substrate. <b>Cometabolism</b> {{is a novel}} way to enhance liquid AD, via augmenting the biodiversity of inoculums, especially in the hitherto little-studied 96 -h initiation period critical to AD startup. Dog, horse and sheep feces were used as sources of inoculum and mixed with fruit and vegetable waste (FVW) and water. Thermophilic (55 C), mesophilic (39) and psychrophilic (25 C) AD conditions were tested. As inoculum and water quantities alter the abundance and diversity of the anaerobic communities, 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 ratios of FVW feedstock to inoculum solutions were compared. Live Saccharomyces cerevisiae was supplemented as probiotic in the anaerobic reactors. Biogas, CO 2 and CH 4 were measured as well as digestion of FVW. Results showed consistently more CH 4 production under <b>cometabolism,</b> higher inoculum density and thermophilic conditions; higher CH 4, pH and digestion simultaneously occurred in the mixed-inoculum reactors. A strong relationship between biogas and its CO 2 and CH 4 main components was found. Horse inoculum in the mixed reactors enhanced CH 4 production; sheep inoculums improved digestibility; and the dog inoculum seemed to neutralize pH. S. cerevisiae may have improved cellulolytic activity in FVW digestion at 25 and 39 C, and provided an energy and nutrient source at 55 C...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The aerobic {{transformation}} of TCE and cis-DCE by a tetrabutoxysilane-grown microorganism (Vancheeswaran et al., 1999) {{led to the}} investigation of novel substrates, including benzyl alcohol, for promoting <b>cometabolism.</b> The culture grew on carboxylic compounds and alcohols, but did not grow on formate, methanol, methane, propane, butane, ethylene, benzene, toluene, or p-xylene. Cis-DCE transformation was observed when the culture grew on butyrate, glucose, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and phenol, and effectively transformed TCE, cis-DCE, and vinyl chloride when grown on phenol or benzyl alcohol. Several cycles of growth on benzyl alcohol led to increases in TCE transformation rates and transformation capacities. Products of benzyl alcohol degradation shifted from benzaldehyde to 2 -hydroxy benzyl alcohol (2 HBA) during the several cycles of growth. In resting cells studies, 2 HBA production rates were highly correlated with TCE transformation rates. TCE transformation and 2 HBA production rates doubled when the culture was grown on phenol and rates of TCE transformation were correlated with 2 HBA production rates. Benzyl alcohol- and phenol-grown cells oxidized toluene to o-cresol, which indicated the similarity between benzyl alcohol ortho-monooxygenase, phenol hydroxylase, and toluene ortho-monooxygenase. 2 -Butyne and 1 -hexyne (but not acetylene) inhibited benzyl alcohol- and phenol-grown cells similarly, indicating the same ortho-monooxygenase was responsible for TCE <b>cometabolism.</b> Resting cell kinetic studies were performed with cells grown on phenol or benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol degradation followed a Monod kinetics while phenol degradation followed a Haldane kinetics. The maximum transformation rates (k[subscript max]) of TCE, cis-DCE, and VC achieved by phenol-grown cells were about a factor of two higher than achieved with benzyl alcohol-grown cells, while the half-saturation constants (K[subscript s]) were in a similar range. Transformation capacities (Tc) for TCE, cis-DCE, and VC were about a factor of two to four higher with phenol-grown cells. The modeling of TCE, cis-DCE, and VC transformation using independently measured k[subscript max] and K[subscript s] values matched well with observed data from batch tests. Benzyl alcohol was shown {{to be an effective}} novel substrate for the aerobic <b>cometabolism</b> of TCE, cis-DCE, and vinyl chloride. Being a non-regulated compound, it might have applications for in-situ bioremediation...|$|E
40|$|In Enterococcus faecalis, the mae locus is {{constituted}} by two putative divergent operons, maePE and maeKR. The first operon encodes a putative H+/malate symporter (MaeP) and a malic enzyme (MaeE) previously {{shown to be}} essential for malate utilization in this bacterium. The maeKR operon encodes two putative proteins with significant similarity to two-component systems involved in sensing malate and activating its assimilation in bacteria. Our transcriptional and genetic assays showed that maePE and maeKR are induced in response to malate by the response regulator MaeR. In addition, we observed that both operons were partially repressed {{in the presence of}} glucose. Accordingly, the <b>cometabolism</b> of this sugar and malate was detected. The binding of the complex formed by CcpA and its corepressor P-Ser-HPr to a cre site located in the mae region was demonstrated in vitro and explains the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) observed for the maePE operon. However, our results also provide evidence for a CcpA-independent CCR mechanism regulating the expression of both operons. Finally, a biomass increment of 40 or 75 % was observed compared to the biomass of cells grown only on glucose or malate, respectively. Cells cometabolizing both carbon sources exhibit a higher rate of glucose consumption and a lower rate of malate utilization. The growth improvement achieved by E. faecalis during glucose-malate <b>cometabolism</b> might explain why this microorganism employs different regulatory systems to tightly control the assimilation of both carbon sources...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{application}} of biotechnological processes based on microbial metabolic degradation of halogenated compound has been investigated. Several studies showed {{that most of these}} pollutants can be biodegraded by single bacterial strains or mixed microbial population via aerobic direct metabolism or <b>cometabolism</b> using as a growth substrates aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons. The enhancement of two specific processes has been here object of study in relation with its own respective scenario described as follow: 1 st) the bioremediation via aerobic <b>cometabolism</b> of soil contaminated by a high chlorinated compound using a mixed microbial population and the selection and isolation of consortium specific for the compound. 2 nd) the implementation of a treatment technology based on direct metabolism of two pure strains at the exact point source of emission, preventing dilution and contamination of large volumes of waste fluids polluted by several halogenated compound minimizing the environmental impact. In order to verify the effect of these two new biotechnological application to remove halogenated compound and purpose them as a more efficient alternative continuous and batch tests have been set up in the experimental part of this thesis. Results obtained from the continuous tests in the second scenario have been supported by microbial analysis via Fluorescence in situ Hybridisation (FISH) and by a mathematical model of the system. The results showed that both process in its own respective scenario offer an effective solutions for the biological treatment of chlorinate compound pollution...|$|E
