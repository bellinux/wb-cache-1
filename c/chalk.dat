5|$|<b>Chalk</b> is a British {{television}} sitcom set in {{a comprehensive}} school named Galfast High. Two series, both written by Steven Moffat, were broadcast on BBC1 in 1997. Like Moffat's earlier sitcom Joking Apart, <b>Chalk</b> was produced by Andre Ptaszynski for Pola Jones.|$|E
5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} <b>chalk</b> {{on their}} hands to absorb sweat. It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply <b>chalk</b> during the climb. Brushes are used to remove excess <b>chalk</b> and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|E

30|$|Comparison between Figs.  3 and 4 {{shows that}} samples in the CR(inorg) corner do lose gloss (around 20 gloss units), {{but do not}} end up <b>chalking.</b> In fact, half the samples (14 out of 30) do not end up <b>chalking,</b> {{illustrating}} the protective effect of CR(inorg). The remaining 16 samples do reach a degree of <b>chalking,</b> but five {{of them are not}} completely <b>chalked</b> {{at the end of the}} extreme aging cycle. These five samples are expected to reach the fully <b>chalked</b> state if they would be subjected to continued exposure. The ratio at which <b>chalking</b> is still prevented by CR(inorg) in this design space is: 40 % CR(inorg) to 60 % UA[*]+[*]ZnO. We propose that, in the protected mixtures, the initial photocatalytic breakdown caused by UA or ZnO leads to a small initial gloss decay and thus a rougher surface, which subsequently enhances the UV scavenging properties of CR(inorg) at the surface.|$|R
5|$|The South Downs {{dominate}} Eastbourne and the Eastbourne Downland Estate can be {{seen from}} most of the town. These were originally <b>chalk</b> deposits laid down under the sea during the Late Cretaceous, and were later lifted by the same tectonic plate movements that formed the European Alps, during the middle Tertiary period. The <b>chalk</b> can be clearly seen along the eroded coastline {{to the west of the}} town, in the area known as Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters, where continuous erosion keeps the cliff edge vertical and white. The <b>chalk</b> contains many fossils such as ammonites and nautilus. The town area is built on geologically recent alluvial drift, the result of the silting up of a bay. This changes to Weald clay around the Langney estate.|$|E
5|$|As with Joking Apart, Ptaszynski {{produced}} <b>Chalk</b> {{for independent}} production company Pola Jones.

5000|$|The {{television}} show Miami Vice, {{a symbol of}} both Miami and the 1980s, featured a <b>Chalk's</b> seaplane in its opening credits. The music video for George Michael's Careless Whisper featured a <b>Chalk's</b> seaplane, N2974. In one of the final scenes {{of the motion picture}} Silence of the Lambs, Dr Frederick Chilton is seen disembarking a <b>Chalk's</b> aircraft in Bimini, where Hannibal Lecter is waiting to [...] "have him for dinner". A <b>Chalks</b> plane also makes an appearance {{at the end of the}} movie 'After The Sunset' with Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek's characters embracing as they stand next to it, (a twin engine seaplane). <b>Chalk's</b> fleet was as high-maintenance as it was glamorous. It was a unique carrier, its Watson Island base being the smallest port of entry in the United States. <b>Chalk's</b> revenues were about $7.5 million in 1986, when it carried 130,000 passengers. Most were staying at Resorts International properties, although island residents used the airline for shopping trips to Miami.|$|R
30|$|Outdoor {{exposure}} {{tests of}} WPCs {{were carried out}} at seven sites in Japan, and <b>chalking</b> {{on the surface of}} the WPCs was examined. It was determined that deterioration of wood elements, oxidation of polyolefins, and a decrease in the molecular weight of PP occurred {{on the surface of the}} WPCs. Surface sanding of the WPCs also promoted the occurrence of <b>chalking.</b> Furthermore, the results of a single regression analysis indicated that temperature and global solar radiation were the most dominant weather factor influencing <b>chalking.</b> In addition, <b>chalking</b> products can be washed away to a certain extent due to precipitation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chalking</b> is the {{progressive}} powdering {{of the paint}} film on the painted surface. The primary reason for the problem is polymer degradation of the paint matrix due to exposure of UV radiation in sunshine and condensation from dew. The degree of <b>chalking</b> varies as epoxies react quickly while acrylics and polyurethanes can remain unchanged for long periods. The degree of <b>chalking</b> can be assessed according to International Standard ISO 4628 Part 6 or 7 or American Society of Testing and Materials(ASTM) Method D4214 (Standard Test Methods for Evaluating the Degree of <b>Chalking</b> of Exterior Paint Films).|$|R
5|$|Fifteen {{or twenty}} barges were still using {{the river in}} the 1880s, {{although}} the upper reaches were no longer accessible. Arundel docks silted up between 1875 and 1896. In 1898, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, who by this time were {{the owners of the}} railway from Horsham to Littlehampton, drilled down into the tunnel where the main line and the branch to Midhurst crossed its course, and poured tons of <b>chalk</b> into the tunnel to stabilise it. A trade in <b>chalk</b> and lime extracted from Amberley <b>chalk</b> pits continued into the early twentieth century. Some ships were towed to Arundel by paddle tugs, and imports of salt, timber and coal for the gasworks continued. Arundel was visited by its last steamer in 1914, and the last sailing vessel to reach the port did so three years later. Passage of larger craft upstream was hindered by the construction of a swing bridge at Littlehampton in 1908, and prevented by a fixed railway bridge at Ford built in 1938. As freight traffic disappeared from the river, Edward Slaughter, who later became part of the company of Buller and Slaughter, was hiring pleasure craft by 1903, and the company was still doing so in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Fossils from {{terrestrial}} dinosaurs {{also have}} been found in the Niobrara <b>Chalk,</b> suggesting that animals who died on shore must have been washed out to sea (one specimen of a hadrosaur appears to have been scavenged by a shark).|$|E

30|$|Recently, the {{durability}} of WPCs has been a topic of growing interest, with several reports on the decrease in strength and surface deterioration [9 – 11]. A large scale outdoor exposure test is effective for evaluating the influence of weather factors on {{the durability}} of wood-based composites [12 – 14]. However, {{there have been few}} examples of such tests using WPCs [15]. Furthermore, little {{attention has been paid to}} research on the occurrence of <b>chalking,</b> which is one of the surface deterioration phenomena of WPCs [16]. <b>Chalking</b> is a phenomenon through which powders separate from the surface of WPCs. <b>Chalking</b> is seldom a problem when WPCs are used as decking, because it affects only footwear. So some commercial products of WPCs improved <b>chalking</b> generation using photo stabilizers or reducing wood content of the surfaces. However, the mechanism of <b>chalking</b> has not been cleared.|$|R
30|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{explaining}} the principal causes of <b>chalking</b> in WPCs. Outdoor exposure tests of WPCs were carried out at seven sites in Japan, {{and the process of}} <b>chalking</b> with respect to various weather factors was investigated.|$|R
30|$|Outdoor {{exposure}} {{tests of}} wood plastic composites (WPCs) were conducted at seven sites in Japan. The tests examined {{the process of}} <b>chalking</b> {{on the surface of}} the WPCs and the weather factors affecting <b>chalking.</b> Observations using a scanning electron microscope and a polarization optical microscope (POM), analyses of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, as well as differential scanning calorimetry showed that the deterioration of both wood and polyolefin elements occurs on the surface of WPCs. The POM observations revealed that surface sanding of WPCs in the manufacturing process promoted more <b>chalking.</b> Furthermore, it became clear that among the weather conditions studied, temperature and global solar radiation had the greatest influence on <b>chalking,</b> as determined from the results of single regression analysis.|$|R
5|$|I. hilli, {{coined by}} Edwin Tully Newton in 1892 for a tooth {{from the early}} Cenomanian Upper Cretaceous Lower <b>Chalk</b> of Hertfordshire, has been {{considered}} an early hadrosaurid of some sort.

5|$|In July 1925, Meher Baba began {{a life-long}} period of self-imposed silence, {{communicating}} first {{by use of}} <b>chalk</b> and slate, then by an alphabet board and later by self-styled hand gestures. In January 1927 he gave up writing with pen or pencil also.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} {{of a private}} bill that would be {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the Hampstead, St Pancras & Charing Cross Railway (HStP). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Heath Street in Hampstead to Strand in Charing Cross. The route was to run beneath Hampstead High Street, Rosslyn Hill, Haverstock Hill and <b>Chalk</b> Farm Road to Camden Town and then under Camden High Street and Hampstead Road to Euston Road. The route then continued south, following Tottenham Court Road, Charing Cross Road and King William Street (now William IV Street) to Agar Street adjacent to Strand. North of Euston Road, a branch was to run eastwards from the main alignment under Drummond Street to serve the main line stations at Euston, St Pancras and King's Cross. Stations were planned at Hampstead, Belsize Park, <b>Chalk</b> Farm, Camden Town, Seymour Street (now part of Eversholt Street), Euston Road, Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, Agar Street, Euston and King's Cross. Although a decision had not been made between the use of cable haulage or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains, a power station was planned on <b>Chalk</b> Farm Road close to the London and North Western Railway's <b>Chalk</b> Farm station (later renamed Primrose Hill) which had a coal depot for deliveries.|$|E

5|$|Lethbridge's {{next project}} focused on {{searching for a}} <b>chalk</b> hill figure that was {{reported}} to have once existed on Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire. Towards the end of 1954 he began investigating the site, inserting metal rods into the ground to determine where he believed the turf had once been removed to expose the <b>chalk</b> below. He believed that he had revealed three large figures, a warrior, a hooded goddess, and a sun god, asserting them to be likely 3000 years old, and then began excavation to remove the turf and reveal the figures. Lethbridge sought much publicity for his discovery, reporting on it to The Times and being interviewed by the London Evening News. However, many archaeologists were sceptical of Lethbridge's methodology and the existence of the hill figures; they believed that the soft patches of <b>chalk</b> were the result of <b>chalk</b> solifluction and were only interpreted as human-made figures through Lethbridge's vivid imagination. The Council for British Archaeology brought together a committee to assess Lethbridge's findings, composed of I. W. Cornwall, W. F. Grimes, Christopher Hawkes, and Stuart Piggott. With the aid of geologist F. E. Zeuner, the committee concluded that the shapes Lethbridge had discovered were natural, having been formed during the last Ice Age. However, Hawkes disagreed with his colleagues, and believed that while not proven, Lethbridge's conclusions could not be disproved. Lethbridge stuck by his original ideas, and wrote a book aimed at a general audience, Gogmagog – The Buried Gods on the basis of them. It was published by Routledge and Kegan Paul in 1957, but received no supportive reviews.|$|E

5|$|Ruisdael's {{work from}} c. 1646 {{to the early}} 1650s, when {{he was living in}} Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and {{laborious}} study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of <b>chalk.</b> Most of his thirty black <b>chalk</b> sketches that survive date from this period.|$|E
