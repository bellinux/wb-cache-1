5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: violent crime and property crime. Historically, violent <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most violent crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of the}} safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{markedly}} {{reduced and}} stability increased throughout Russia {{compared to the}} previous year, about 350 militants in the North Caucasus {{have been killed in}} anti-terror operations in the first four months of 2014, according to an announcement by Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev in the State Duma.|$|E
25|$|The Cincinnati Police Department {{has more}} than 1,000 sworn officers. Before the riots of 2001, Cincinnati's overall crime rate had been {{dropping}} steadily and by 1995 had reached its lowest point since 1992 but with more murders and rapes. After the riot, violent crime increased, but <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> on the decline since. In 2015, there were 71 homicides.|$|E

(Kazakhstan is a country situated partly in Europe and partly in Asia).|$|R

It may check business emails to assess whether a <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> committed or unauthorised activity has occurred, but only in strictly defined circumstances.|$|E
25|$|After a <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> committed, tactics such as {{cocooning}} {{have been}} shown to dramatically reduce the incidence of repeat offences. Cocooning involves notifying neighbours in the street that a break and enter has occurred, thereby encouraging a form of natural surveillance. Studies show this may decrease the rate of property crime by up to 50% in the local area.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s the New York City Police Department (NYPD) adopted CompStat, {{broken windows}} {{policing}} and other strategies {{in a major}} effort to reduce crime. The city's dramatic drop in <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> attributed by criminologists to policing tactics, {{the end of the}} crack epidemic, and some have speculated more controversial ideas such as the legalization of abortion approximately 18 years previous and the decline of lead poisoning of children.|$|E

25|$|As Washington neighborhoods undergo gentrification, <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{displaced}} further east. Crime {{in neighboring}} Prince George's County, Maryland, initially experienced an increase, but has recently witnessed steep declines as poorer residents {{moved out of}} the city into the nearby suburbs. Crime has declined both in the District and the suburbs in recent years. There was an average of 11 robberies each day across the District of Columbia in 2006 which is far below the levels experienced in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Graphic {{video footage}} shot by law {{enforcement}} officers in 2009 shows 6 Romani boys aged between 6-16 being forced to strip naked, kiss, and slap each other. It is alleged that the boys were then set upon by police dogs, {{with at least two}} sustaining serious injury. Officers attempted to justify their behaviour {{on the grounds that the}} boys were suspected of theft against an elderly citizen. However, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment by police, regardless of whether a <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suspected or committed, is prohibited under international law.|$|E
25|$|Justifications for harsher punishments for {{hate crimes}} {{focus on the}} notion that hate crimes cause greater {{individual}} and societal harm. It is said that, when the core of a person’s identity is attacked, the degradation and dehumanization is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the disempowerment of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> committed. The riots in Los Angeles, California that followed the beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist, by a group of White police officers are cited as support for this argument. The beating of white truck driver Reginald Denny by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.|$|E

500|$|The Vicinage Clause is a {{provision}} in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution regulating the vicinity from which a jury pool may be selected. The clause says that the accused shall be entitled to a jury [...] "of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law". The Vicinage Clause limits the vicinity of criminal jury selection to both the state and the federal judicial district where the <b>crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> committed whereas the venue provision of Article Three of the United States Constitution regulates the location of the actual trial.|$|E

500|$|<b>Crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a {{lingering}} problem {{in many of}} the Rust Belt's big and small urban communities, hampering economic recovery. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Youngstown was nationally identified with gangland slayings that were often committed with car bombs. The town gained the nicknames [...] "Murdertown, USA" [...] and [...] "Bomb City, USA," [...] while the phrase [...] "Youngstown tune-up" [...] became a nationally popular slang term for car-bomb assassination. The image of Youngstown's association with crime was reinforced by the construction of prisons inside the metropolitan area. As of 2012, three adult correctional facilities continue to operate within city limits: the Mahoning County Justice Center the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, and the Ohio State Penitentiary.|$|E
500|$|<b>Crime</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{very low}} in the park. Shortly after the second section opened in 2011, The New York Times {{reported}} {{that there have been}} no reports of major crimes such as assaults or robberies since its first phase opened two years prior. Parks Enforcement Patrols have written summonses for various infractions of park rules, such as walking dogs or riding bicycles on the walkway, but at a rate lower than in Central Park. Park advocates attributed that to the high visibility of the High Line from the surrounding buildings, a feature of traditional urbanism espoused by author Jane Jacobs nearly fifty years earlier. According to David, [...] "Empty parks are dangerous... Busy parks are much less so. You're virtually never alone on the High Line." ...|$|E
