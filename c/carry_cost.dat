40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{discusses}} profitability-liquidity relationships on {{accounting and}} market levels for 872 shares of publicly-traded Brazilian companies, observed between 1994 and 2013. On the market level, {{the assumption is}} that share liquidity is able to reduce some of the risks incurred by investors, making them more willing to pay a higher price for liquid shares, which would lower expected market returns. On the accounting level, the basic hypothesis argues that a firm's holding more liquid assets is related to a conservative investment policy, possibly reducing accounting returns for shareholders. Under the assumption of financial constraint, however, more accounting liquidity would allow positive net present value investments to be carried out, increasing future accounting returns, which would positively affect market liquidity and share prices in an efficient market, resulting in a lower market risk/expected return premium. Under the assumption of no financial constraint, however, more accounting liquidity would only represent a <b>carry</b> <b>cost,</b> compromising future accounting returns, which would adversely affect market liquidity and share prices and result in a higher market risk/expected return premium. Among the hypotheses, the presence of a negative market liquidity premium was verified in Brazil, with shares that traded more exhibiting a higher expected market return. On the margins of the major theories on the subject, only two negative relationships between excess accounting liquidity and market liquidity and accounting return, supporting the <b>carry</b> <b>cost</b> assumption for financially unconstrained firms, were verified. In terms of this paper's contributions, there is the analysis, unprecedented in Brazil as far as is known, of the relationship between liquidity and return on market and accounting levels, considering the financial constraint hypothesis to which the firms are subject...|$|E

One of the most known form of deductive learning is the acquisition of macro operators. Macro-operators <b>carry</b> <b>cost</b> as well as bene ts. When the costs outweigh the bene ts, we face the utility problem. The vast numberofmacrosavailable to the learner forces it to be selective toavoid the utility problem. The most common approach to selective macro-learning is using acquisition lters. Such lters try to estimate the utility of a macro before inserting it into the macro knowledge base. One problem with this approach isthatthe utility of a macro strongly depends on the problem being solved. In this work we suggest an alternative approach called utilization ltering. Instead of being selective when the macro is acquired, the learner is selective when the macro is utilized. We propose to use similarity-based ltering. A macro is considered as potentially useful for a particular problem if it proved to be useful for similar problems. Without further knowledge about the states in the search space,we suggest to use the heuristic function to determine similarity between states. Initial testing of this approach in the grid domain showed that indeed it is bene cial to delay selectivity tothe utilization stage. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Risk management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{inability}} to effectively hedge against unfavourable exchange rate movements, using the current {{forward exchange rate}} as the only guideline, is a key inhibiting factor of international trade. Market participants use the current forward exchange rate quoted in the market to make decisions regarding future exchange rate changes. However, the current forward exchange rate is not solely determined by the interaction of demand and supply, but is also a mechanistic estimation, {{which is based on}} the current spot exchange rate and the <b>carry</b> <b>cost</b> of the transaction. Results of various studies, including this study, demonstrated that the current forward exchange rate differs substantially from the realized future spot exchange rate. This phenomenon is known as the exchange rate puzzle. This study contributes to the dynamics of modelling exchange rate theories by developing an exchange rate model that has the ability to explain the realized future spot exchange rate and the exchange rate puzzle. The exchange rate model is based only on current (time t) economic fundamentals and includes an alternative approach of incorporating the impact of the interaction of two international financial markets into the model. This study derived a unique exchange rate model, which proves that the exchange rate puzzle is a pseudo problem. The pseudo problem is based on the generally excepted fallacy that current non–stationary, level time series data cannot be used to model exchange rate theories, because of the incorrect assumption that all the available econometric methods yield statistically insignificant results due to spurious regressions. Empirical evidence conclusively shows that using non–stationary, level time series data of current economic fundamentals can statistically significantly explain the realized future spot exchange rate and, therefore, that the exchange rate puzzle can be solved. This model will give market participants in the foreign exchange market a better indication of expected future exchange rates, which will considerably reduce the dependence on the mechanistically derived forward points. The newly derived exchange rate model will also have an influence on the demand and supply of forward exchange, resulting in forward points that are a more accurate prediction of the realized future exchange rate.

40|$|In many ways, {{public debt}} and pension fund {{managers}} {{share the same}} allocation problem: How to allocate optimally their assets and liabilities, assuming long-term uncertainties, complex business rules, and risk aversion. In that context, this thesis presents four studies, three {{from the point of}} view of public debt managers, and one {{from the point of view}} of closed defined benefits (DB) pension fund sponsors. We test the sensitivity of the optimal allocation to unexpected changes in life expectancy, to alternative macroeconomic environments, and to different aspects of pension funds regulation. The first study presents a new stochastic optimization model, based on the minimization of the certainty equivalent real <b>carry</b> <b>cost</b> of public debt, to compute optimal allocations for sovereign debt portfolios. We conduct five sensitivity exercises to test the consequences of different public policies and macroeconomic environments over the optimal liability allocation. The second study presents a stochastic simulation model to evaluate the main costs and risks associated with the issuance of longevity-linked bonds (LB) by governments. We conduct five exercises, in which we test the effects of the transition strategy, the relevance of choosing a correct design for LB, the longevity-risk premium, and two types of demographic shocks to simulate longevity risk. The third study presents a stochastic optimization model to assess the role of longevity-linked bonds in optimal sovereign debt portfolios. This model extends the first study, by incorporating demographic effects in fiscal policy, as well as the issuance of LB by governments. We conduct three exercises in which we test how the optimal allocation reacts to two types of demographic shocks and to alternative levels of the longevity-risk premium. The last study proposes a strategic asset allocation model for closed and mature DB schemes. The optimization criterion is to minimize a certainty equivalent cost for the pension scheme's sponsor that is defmed as the expected present value of the additional financial contributions (AFC) plus a fraction of their variance, the fraction characterizing the sponsor's risk attitude. AFC are determined by a rule that depends on the current funding ratio (FR), and two thresholds (minimum and maximum FR). We analyze four factors that influence the optimal asset mix: (i) the uncertainty about the remaining life expectancy of the beneficiaries, (ii) the expected equity return above a real (inflation adjusted) risk free rate, (iii) the time to restore the FR to normal levels, and (iv) the extent to which the sponsor can benefit from an asset surplus.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Risk Analysis)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010 In {{recent years}} {{investment}} products {{have become more}} complex by providing investors with various guarantees and bonus options. This increase in complexity has provided an impetus for the investigation into integrated asset and liability management frameworks that could realistically address dynamic portfolio allocation in a risk-controlled way. This thesis presents two stochastic programming frameworks forthe asset and liability management of investment products with guarantees. The asset side of these products usually contains fixed income securities. For this reason we {{are concerned with the}} stochastic evolution of the shape of the term structure of interest rates (or yield curve) over time. Literature in the field of scenario generation for multi-period stochastic programs has stated that the generation of a set of scenarios, which represents the uncertainty in the evolution of these risk factors over time, {{is one of the most}} important and critical steps in the multi-stage stochastic programming approach. The first part of this thesis presents two methods for yield curve scenario generation. The first method uses a moment-matching approach and the second a simulation approach which takes the movement of macro-economic factors into account. In asset and liability management under uncertainty, using stochastic programming, it is sometimes necessary to take into account flexible risk management actions, for example the reinvestment of coupons or the payment of liabilities at time steps smaller than those at which portfolio rebalancing (or restructuring, i. e. changing the portfolio composition) takes place. The yield curve scenarios at these intermediate time points have to be path dependent. Firstly this thesis proposes a momentmatching approach to construct scenario trees with path dependent intermediate discrete yield curve outcomes sufficient for the pricing of fixed income securities. As part of the second approach we estimate an econometric model that fits the South African term structure of interest rates, using a Kalman filter approach. The proposed model includes four latent factors and three observable macro-economic factors (capacity utilisation, inflation and repo-rate). The goal is to capture the dynamic interactions between the macro-economy and the term structure. The resulting model can be used to generate interest rate scenario trees that are suitable for fixed income portfolio optimisation. An important input into our scenario generator is the investor's view on the future evolution of the repo-rate. In practice most financial institutions have views on the macro-economy. These views are produced by means of an economic scenario generator (ESG) or expert opinion. These ESG's only produce forecasts for macro-economic factors, for example the repo-rate and not a complete yield curve. The second part of this thesis introduces and solves two asset and liability problems. The first problem is the asset and liability management of minimum liquid asset portfolios found in the banking environment and the second problem is the asset and liability management of insurance products with minimum guarantees. We discuss the formulation and implementation of these mUlti-stage stochastic programming models and back-test both models on real market data. Maintaining liquid asset portfolios involves a high <b>carry</b> <b>cost</b> and is mandatory by law for some financial institutions. Taking this into account, a financial institution's aim is to manage a liquid asset portfolio in an "optimal" way, such that it keeps the minimum allowed liquid assets to comply with regulations. This thesis proposes a mUlti-stage dynamic stochastic programming model for liquid asset portfolio management. The model allows for portfolio rebalancing decisions over a multiperiod horizon, as well as for flexible risk management actions, such as reinvesting coupons at intermediate time steps. The second problem is the asset and liability management of insurance products with minimum guarantees. This thesis proposes a mUlti-stage dynamic stochastic programming model for the integrated asset and liability management of insurance products with guarantees that minimise the down-side risk of these products. We investigate with-profits guarantee funds by including regular bonus payments while keeping the optimisation problem linear. The main focus is the formulation and implementation of a multi-stage stochastic programming model Dynamic optimization is perceived to be too difficult. [...] It would be nice to have a generic 'sledge hammer' approach for attacking this sort of problem. 1 A. D. Smith (1996), p. 1085 Doctora...|$|E
