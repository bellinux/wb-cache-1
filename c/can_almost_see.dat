500|$|One of {{the more}} {{positive}} responses to Chabon's brand of [...] "trickster literature" [...] appeared in Time magazine, whose Lev Grossman wrote that [...] "This is literature in mid-transformation.... he highbrow and the lowbrow, once kept chastely separate, are now hooking up, [...] you <b>can</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the future of literature coming." [...] Grossman classed Chabon with a movement of authors similarly eager to blend literary and popular writing, including Jonathan Lethem (with whom Chabon is friends), Margaret Atwood, and Susanna Clarke.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{performance}} drew {{praise from}} the national media. The Wall Street Journal called Robinson [...] "the breakout star of the young 2010 season" [...] and drew attention to his [...] "absurd rushing totals." [...] Columnist Mitch Albom wrote: [...] "Denard Robinson redefined the term 'offensive weapon' on Saturday against Notre Dame." [...] ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit noted the [...] "confident aura" [...] around Robinson:"The body language he exudes is, 'I'm a winner.' He's small in stature, but his heart you <b>can</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> it pounding through his jersey. And then he has, like all the great ones, he plays with a swagger like, 'You can't stop me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Spin magazine's Grayson Currin rated Oddfellows {{seven out}} of ten, finding that it [...] "presents a tide of ideas, information, and intrigue". Currin felt that the album {{attempted}} to blend both art rock and mainstream rock sounds, but was more successful when aiming solely for experimentation—finding [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>Almost</b> <b>See</b> Them" [...] and [...] "A Thousand Eyes" [...] to be examples of this. Consequence of Sound writer Len Comaratta awarded Oddfellows three stars out of five, finding that Dunn's bass playing improves the band's sound without altering it radically. Comaratta felt that the album rewarded patient listeners but did not provide memorable hooks or melodies, and compared its [...] "laid back" [...] sound to that of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.|$|E

2500|$|Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first {{appeared}} opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. While Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner [...] "easy to like and sharp with her timing", {{he was disappointed}} to see her as [...] "the love interest, {{which is not the}} same as a rounded character." [...] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as [...] "less a co-star than a place holder (you <b>can</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the words “enter generic female lead” in [...] screenplay)." [...] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner – [...] "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" [...] – against type. David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she [...] "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an [...] "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance" [...] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she [...] "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before." [...] Garner then appeared in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), sharing scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey. In 2011, she had a supporting role in Arthur as the villainous arranged bride of Russell Brand's character.|$|E

A moment looking around the audience with those piercing eyes, amid the perfect stillness. (I <b>can</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> him and the whole scene now.)
