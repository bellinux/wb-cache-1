Here we report that colonies of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae formed sharply divided layers of sporulating and nonsporulating cells. Sporulation initiated in the colony's interior, and this region expanded upward as the colony matured. Two key activators of sporulation, IME 1 and IME 2, were initially transcribed in overlapping regions of the colony, and this overlap corresponded to the initial sporulation region. The development of colony sporulation patterns depended on <b>cell-to-cell</b> <b>signals,</b> as demonstrated by chimeric colonies, which contain a mixture of two strains.

Phenotypic characterization showed that 81 % of these isolates produced the AI-dependent virulence factors elastase, protease, and rhamnolipids. We identified nine genotypically distinct P. aeruginosa strains. Six of these strains produced AIs [N-butanoyl-homoserine lactone or N-(3 -oxo-dodecanoyl) -homoserine lactone] and extracellular virulence factors (elastase, total exoprotease, rhamnolipid, hydrogen cyanide, or pyocyanin) in vitro. Three of the nine strains were defective in the production of both AIs and extracellular virulence factors. Two of these strains had mutational defects in both the lasR and rhlR genes, which encode the N-acyl-homoserine lactone-dependent transcriptional regulators LasR and RhlR, respectively. The third of these AI-deficient strains was only mutated in the lasR gene.

Previous studies suggested that C 4 -HSL plays no significant role in biofilm formation. However the wild-type PAO 1 strain PAO-BI, used as a control in these studies is itself impaired {{in the production of}} C 4 -HSL. We wondered therefore whether the role of C 4 -HSL in biofilm formation might have been underestimated, and whether azithromycin inhibits biofilm formation by interfering with <b>cell-to-cell</b> <b>signalling.</b> Methods: We used isogenic mutants of wild-type PAO 1 strains PAO-BI and PT 5 in a static biofilm model. Biofilm formation was quantified using Crystal Violet staining and exopolysaccharide measurements.

Using isogenic mutants of strain PT 5 we have shown that whereas a lasI mutant (deficient in 3 -oxo-C 12 -HSL) produced similar amounts of biofilm to the wild-type, a rhlI mutant (deficient in C 4 -HSL) produced 70 % less biofilm.

40|$|Numerous {{species of}} {{bacteria}} use an elegant regulatory mechanism known as quorum sensing {{to control the}} expression of specific genes in a cell-density dependent manner. In Gram-negative bacteria, quorum sensing systems function through a <b>cell-to-cell</b> <b>signal</b> molecule (autoinducer) that consists of a homoserine lactone with a fatty acid side chain. Such {{is the case in}} the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which contains two quorum sensing systems (las and rhl) that operate via the autoinducers, N-(3 -oxododecanoyl) -L-homoserine lactone and N-butyryl-Lhomoserine lactone. The study of these signal molecules has shown that they bind to and activate transcriptional activator proteins that specifically induce numerous P. aeruginosa virulence genes. We report here that P. aeruginosa produces another signal molecule, 2 -heptyl- 3 -hydroxy- 4 -quinolone, which has been designated as the Pseudomonas quinolone signal. It was found that this unique <b>cell-to-cell</b> <b>signal</b> controlled the expression of lasB, which encodes for the major virulence factor, LasB elastase. We also show that the synthesis and bioactivity of Pseudomonas quinolone signal were mediated by the P. aeruginosa las and rhl quorum sensing systems, respectively.

Infections by P. aeruginosa are difficult to treat and hence there is interest in the development of effective therapeutics.
