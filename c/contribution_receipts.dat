40|$|Campaign finance laws govern how {{political}} candidates raise and spend monies for their elections. In general, {{there are three}} ways in which states regulate campaign finance: (1) disclosure, (2) contribution limits, and (3) public financing. Disclosure requires a candidate to disclose campaign-related <b>contribution</b> <b>receipts</b> as well as expenditures. Expenditures can include anything from advertising material to travel expenses. Contribution Limits restrict {{the amount of money}} that an individual or other entity (corporation, partnership, etc.) can contribute to a candidate or political party. Public Financing can take many forms, but, generally speaking, it is a voluntary program that allows a candidate to receive public money in exchange for abiding by spending and fundraising limits...|$|E

This paper demonstrates how inflation alters the distributive properties of nominally defined tax systems {{and looks at the}} impact of the tax revenues and social insurance <b>contribution</b> <b>receipts</b> generated. It provides quantitative estimates for Germany, The Netherlands and the UK, using a preliminary version of EUROMOD, a European tax-benefit microsimulation model. The integrated framework provided by the model permits the use of common income concepts across countries and therefore enables one to make informative comparisons of the distributive consequences of the inflation induced erosion of tax- band limits, thresholds, deductions, tax credits, etc. The paper also tests the performance of automatic indexing regimes used in two of the countries.

40|$|The {{long-term}} demographic projections have progressively {{raised concerns}} {{about the consequences of}} ageing population. To better understand those changes and measure their size,projections of social expenditure have been built and progressively refined. Confronted with a large budgetary cost of ageing in the long run, the Government's alternative is: solve the problemwhen it comes up or try to anticipate the negative results and prevent them. Three ways are to be considered that are not mutually incompatible: reforming the social system {{in order to reduce the}} cost for the present and future generations, increasing the tax or <b>contribution</b> <b>receipts</b> by pushing up employment rates and the trend growth of GDP and saving now in the public sector to cover the increase of the future expenditure.

40|$|Bachelor thesis "The care {{allowance}} receive {{effect on the}} economic situation of seniors" {{research has focused on}} the selected sample of respondents´ financial situation. The theoretical part describes the current status. The description is divided into following parts: definitions, a comprehensive description of the {{care allowance}}, allowance proceedings description, Practical part is divided for thesis targets, methodology, data analysis, interpretation and discussion. The thesis target was to answer following question: "How do the seniors accept and feel the care allowance in relation to their economic situation". To find answers, three research questions were used. Care allowance receipt is primarily to contribute to improving the economic situation of the disabled. It should support remaining these people in their natural social environment and some way to compensate disabled people increased costs. The target was to receive the information, if the contribution fulfills these functions. Then, how do they feel the <b>contribution</b> <b>receipt</b> and how do they evaluate it´s value. Quality research strategy was used for the thesis processing. Also unstandardized semi structured interview with selected seniors was used. Data collection technique was the individual in-depth interview. The thesis aim was achieved by receiving answers for three partial research questions: 1. How does the receiving person feel and evaluate the contribution? 2. How does the person evaluate the contribution effect on his/her financial situation? 3. How does the person judge how much the contribution covers increased costs caused by his/her permanent adverse health conditions? The data obtained are analyzed and interpreted. The conclusion summarizes main research findings. The research confirmed fully, that allowance care contribution is right. It was also proved, that contribution level should be increased...|$|R

This article analyses how the required data are interactionally produced to be visible for the people behind the one-way screen, for the video and for the report. It describes the phenomenon of repeat receipts as a central device for producing visible data. Repeat receipts are sequences where the moderator repeats participants’ contributions, typically with intonational cues that mark completion. Repeat receipts have several functions. They can (a) highlight central market-research relevant terms from participants’ responses; (b) strip off rhetorical relations by repeating utterances in a decontextualized manner; (c) summarize contributions in repeating contributions of different authors as if of one voice; (d) cover conflict in repeating potentially contradictory contributions as discrete statements; (e) socialize responding by providing templates for the required <b>contributions.</b> Repeat <b>receipts</b> help shape the focus group interaction to generate visible data for the overhearing audience, the video and the report. The article ends with a comparison of repeats in market research focus groups, standardized surveys and news interviews...|$|R

The data were adjusted for inflation according to the Consumer Price Index and averaged for five-year periods beginning with 1946 - 1950 and continuing through 1991 - 1995. There were four objectives of the study. The first objective was to compare these states for annual agriculture receipts, crop receipts, and livestock receipts. State total agriculture receipts ranged from 1. 8 to 3. 2 billion dollars in 1946 - 50 and from 1. 4 to 4. 1 billion dollars in 1991 - 95. For total agriculture receipt, rankings were as follows: North Carolina highest, Kentucky intermediate, and Tennessee and Virginia lowest and about equal. State rankings for crop and livestock receipts were the same as those for total agriculture receipts except the North Carolina ranking for livestock receipts went from lowest to highest among the states during the period of study. In Kentucky and Tennessee, crop and livestock contributions were approximately equally throughout the study. Crop receipts exceeded livestock receipts in NC until the 1980 s, while in Virginia livestock receipts consistently exceeded crop receipts. The second objective was to determine the <b>contribution</b> of tobacco <b>receipts</b> and their relationships to the receipts of other agriculture commodities. Average state tobacco receipts in dollars ranged from 254 million to 1. 8 billion dollars in 1946 - 50 and from 129 to 723 million dollars in 1991 - 95. State rankings for tobacco receipts were as follows: North Carolina highest, Kentucky intermediate, and Tennessee and Virginia lowest and approximately equal. Tobacco receipts (dollars) for Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia were relatively consistent over the 50 -year period; however, the tobacco receipts for North Carolina decreased from 1. 8 billion to 723 million dollars during the period.

One effort to increase local revenues by optimizing the potential in the tourism sector. The link between industrial tourism and local revenues through the domestic income (PAD) and shared tax / no tax. Successing development of tourism sector, means that will enhance its role in locsl income, where tourism is the main component by taking into accounts the factors that influence it, such as: the number of attractions of tourism on offer, the number of tourists visiting; both domestic and international tourist, hotel occupancy rates, and certainly income per capita. And during the last 10 years is still going fluctuation <b>contribution</b> of tourism <b>receipts</b> to the domestic income (PAD) that should be reviewing the potential and also the factors that affect local revenue from tourism sector in addition to improving the facilities which can support tourist activity during the visit on a tourist attraction. Analysis method that used in this study is multiple linear regression with domestic income of tourism sector as the dependent variable and four independent variables are the variable number of attractions, the number of tourists, hotel occupancy rates and income per capita. After testing irregularities classical assumptions, the results indicate that data is normally distributed and there is no obtained a discrepancy. Based on calculations derived Eviews 6, calculated the F value = 15. 065 with significance of F for 0. 000. By using a significance level = 0. 05 was obtained value of F table value = 2. 61. Then the F test (15. 065) > F table (2. 61), or the significance of F of 0. 000 indicates less than 0. 05 so it can be concluded that the four independent variables in the number of attractions of tourism, the number of tourists, hotel occupancy rates and income per capita affect domestic income from tourism sector in Semarang City accepted. Partially, the number of attraction of tourism variable, the number of tourists and hotel occupancy rates has a significant effect. While variable income per capita are not significant.

40|$|The 'juste retour' attitude, namely each EU member state's {{priority}} for securing {{the best possible}} individual net financial position vis-à-vis the community budget over any other consideration concerning the community budget is stronger than ever. The differences across member states in terms of net financial positions are indeed remarkable. In the period 1997 - 2006 the group of major net payer countries (the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Austria) had an average 'deficit' vis-à-vis the EU budget amounting to 0. 35 % of the GNI. For the group of minor net payers (Denmark, France, Finland and Italy) the respective indicator was 0. 08 % only. The UK with its rebate stood closer to the second group. The full impact of the 2004 / 2007 enlargement will be felt in 2013, after the 'phasing in' process will have been nearly completed. Estimated net financial positions for 2013 show that major net payers' financial positions will not change significantly but those of the minor payers' will deteriorate to a large extent. The net beneficiary member states will typically get substantially less (net) EU transfers than the cohesion countries had received in the 1990 s. Several reform proposals envisage {{the introduction of a}} European tax. Various candidates for this tax were tested in the paper for fulfilling the requirement for proportionality of contributions to the EU budget with economic strength of the member states. The results show that a couple of member states would contribute substantially more or less to the community budget than their share is in the aggregate EU GNI, thus these taxes would open up a new battlefield for ¿juste retour¿ discussions. On the expenditure side of the EU budget conditions of eligibility for support have emerged over decades in the framework of various, with one another unrelated, EU policies. This led to a strong differentiation in the extent of financial support by member states, decoupled from their relative prosperity. Germany and the UK were overall 'losers' as in each main policy areas their share was substantially lower than in the aggregate EU GNI in 1997 - 2006. The Netherlands joined the club of overall 'losers' from 2003 on. The results of an estimation for 2013 hint at increasing polarization. 8 member states will be 'losers' both in agricultural and cohesion expenditures while 13 member states 'winners' in both areas, and only 6 of the 27 will have mixed position. The final chapter of the paper presents a comprehensive reform proposal which faces the juste retour problem frontally instead of negating or circumventing it. The corner stone of the proposed system is the EU 27 average per capita GNI, at official exchange rate. Each member state would receive annually a transfer from the EU budget that corresponds to 1 % of the EU average per capita GNI multiplied by the number of inhabitants in the member state concerned. The revenues of the EU budget would be secured through contributions from member states, which would amount to 1 % of the member state GNI. Member states with higher than EU average per capita GNI would be thus net payers, those with lower than the average per capita GNI of the EU would be net beneficiaries. Net <b>contributions</b> and <b>receipts,</b> respectively, would clearly reflect the difference in relative prosperity of the member states. This proposition is supplemented by recommendations for reform both on the revenues and expenditures sides of the EU budget. Comparing the estimated financial position of net payer member states in 2013 under the prevailing and the reformed system, respectively, show that each net payer would come off better, though to varying extent, under the new regime. Further enlargements, even with Turkey, would create an average net financial position for this group of member states matching that had been prevailing in 1997 - 2006. The same comparison for the net beneficiary member states, however, indicates less gains under the new regime. Clear rules for the post- 2013 years, smaller, but safely secured and for the long run foreseeable transfers from the EU budget, further significantly increased flexibility in utilization of the EU resources may win the net beneficiary member states for the reforms proposed.
