5|$|<b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|The CPC is, officially, {{organized}} on {{the basis}} of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress, convened every fifth year. When the National <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in session, the Central Committee is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year, most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party's leader holds the offices of General Secretary (responsible for civilian party duties), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and State President (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts the party leader is the country's paramount leader. The current paramount leader is Xi Jinping who was elected at the 19th National Congress held in October 2017.|$|E
25|$|Some delegates, such as Daoud Isa, {{complained that}} the <b>congress</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{sufficiently}} radical. After the congress the executive committee met British High Commissioner Herbert Samuel, who insisted that they accept British policy on the Jewish national homeland to receive official recognition. The British claim that the <b>congress</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> representative led to a broad campaign by the Muslim-Christian Associations to raise public awareness.|$|R

25|$|The seventh Syrian {{regional}} {{party congress}} {{was held in}} January 1980. The congress created a new institution, the Central Committee, {{to act as an}} intermediary body between the Regional Command and local branches. The Central Committee had 75 members. The eighth regional congress decided to expand the Central Committee to 95 members. The Central Committee was charged with electing the Regional Command, which previously had been done by the regional congress delegates. The Central Committee represents the regional congress when the <b>congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in session.|$|E
25|$|To {{allow the}} {{government}} to act quickly {{in case of a}} major domestic or international crisis arising when <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in session, the President is permitted to call extraordinary sessions of one or both Houses of Congress. If the two Houses cannot agree on a date for adjournment, the President may adjourn both Houses to such a time as befits the circumstances. The last time this power was exercised was in 1948, when President Harry S Truman called a special session of Congress. That was the twenty-seventh time in American history that a president convened such a session.|$|E

Because little of Edwards's work survives, few of his films have drawn attention from modern authors, but film historian Larry Langman included It Is the Law {{as an example of the}} evolution of avenging-spouse films to [...] "emphasize the inner strengths of their women" [...] in the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Constitution {{provides}} that each [...] "House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings," [...] therefore each Congress of the United States, upon convening, approves its own governing rules of procedure.

However, this account remains empty until Congress approves an [...] "appropriation", which requires the U.S. Treasury to provide funds (up to the limit provided for in the authorization). <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> required to appropriate {{as much money as}} is authorized.|$|E

2500|$|The World Jewish Congress's {{expressed}} {{goal was}} Jewish unity and {{the strengthening of}} Jewish political influence in order to assure {{the survival of the}} Jewish people, which involved the creation of a Jewish state. 230 delegates representing 32 countries gathered for the first WJC assembly. Addressing a press conference in Geneva, Stephen S. Wise assailed German Jews for opposing the WJC. He said: [...] "I must make clear that the <b>congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a parliament nor an attempt at a parliament. It is nothing more than an assembly of representatives of those Jewries which choose to associate themselves in defense of Jewish rights. The congress will not be wholly representative until all Jews choose to be represented by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the third season, Sue's {{campaign}} for <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> going well. She decides to pledge {{to get rid of all}} arts programs in schools, music and theater especially, until all students are reading at or above grade level. Will's attempt to embarrass Sue and highlight the value of the arts by glitter bombing her backfires, and Sue's poll numbers rise. She also goes back on her promise to leave the glee club alone by having her new cheerleading co-captains, Becky and Santana, sabotage the club's recruitment drive. She rails against the school musical, and succeeds in having its funding rescinded. This angers Kurt's father, Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), who arranges for local businesses to sponsor the musical, and he enters the congressional race as a write-in candidate to defeat her. Sue runs a negative campaign, airing political ads containing false statements about Burt's personal life through her political ads. One of the other candidates in the race discovers that Santana is a lesbian, and uses this to attack Sue on the issue of [...] "family values" [...] for appointing her a cheerleading captain, and to imply that Sue herself is a lesbian. Santana is devastated, as she has not yet come out as a lesbian. Sue attempts to combat the implications by starting a relationship one of her former bed partners, Ohio State football recruiter Cooter Menkins, who had recently been dating Coach Beiste. Being seen in public with Cooter does not help her in the voting, however; she comes in third, and Burt wins.|$|E
6000|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{legislative}} custom of [...] "eulogizing" [...] dead members of <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> apparent unless it is to add a terror to death and make honorable and self-respecting members rather bear the ills they have than escape through the gates of death to others that they know a good deal about. If {{a member of that}} kind, who has had the bad luck to [...] "go before," [...] could be consulted he would indubitably say that he was sorry to be dead; and that is not a natural frame of mind in one who is exempt from the necessity of himself [...] "delivering a eulogy." ...|$|E

60|$|However much {{fair-minded}} men {{may have}} been wearied with the backing and filling of Congress, and their uncertainty of action {{on some of the}} most important questions that have come before them,--however the dignity, and even propriety, of their attitude toward Mr. Johnson may be in some respects honestly called in question,--no one who has looked fairly at the matter can pronounce the terms they have imposed on the South as conditions of restoration harsh ones. The character of <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> before the country, but simply the character of the plan they propose. For ourselves, we should frankly express our disgust at the demagogism which courted the Fenians; for, however much we may sympathize with the real wrongs of Ireland, it was not for an American Congress to declare itself in favor of a movement which based itself on the claim of every Irish voter in the country to a double citizenship, in which the adopted country was made secondary, and which, directed as it was against a province where Irishmen are put on equal terms with every other inhabitant, and where their own Church is the privileged one, was nothing better than burglary and murder. Whatever may be Mr. Seward's faults, he was certainly right in his dealing with that matter, unless he is to be blamed for slowness. But as regards the terms offered by Congress to the South, they are very far from harsh or unreasonable; they are lamb-like compared to what we had reason to fear from Mr. Johnson, if we might judge by his speeches and declarations of a year or two ago. But for the unhappy hallucination which led Mr. Johnson first to fancy himself the people of the United States, and then to quarrel with the party which elected him for not granting that he was so, they would not have found a man in the North to question their justice and propriety, unless among those who from the outset would have been willing to accept Mr. Jefferson Davis as the legitimate President of the whole country. The terms imposed by Congress really demand nothing more than that the South should put in practice at home that Monroe Doctrine of which it has always been so clamorous a supporter when it could be used for party purposes. The system of privileged classes which the South proposes to establish is a relic of old Europe which we think it bad policy to introduce again on this continent, after our so fresh experience in the war of the evil consequences that may spring from it. Aristocracy can form no more intimate and hearty union with democracy under one form than under another; and unless such a union be accomplished, or we can see some reasonable hope of its future accomplishment, we are as far from our object as ever.|$|E
