5000|$|Back in the garden, Bugs {{has managed}} to tunnel through several carrots and lay down tracks for the mining cart he is using to dump the excess carrot chunks over a cliff. Smidgen, drawn {{to the sound of}} Bugs' singing, pulls up the carrot that Bugs is in with his teeth. Bugs comes out, stops at the sight of what he assumes is a large {{billboard}} (Smidgen's dog license), and wonders where it came from. Suddenly, he realizes that he is suspended high in the air, and frantically climbs up the carrot onto the edge of Smidgen's nose. Bugs then sees the large bloodshot eyes staring at him and realizes what he's up against. However, he becomes enraged, stating to the audience: [...] "I'll be scared later. Right now, I'm too mad." [...] He climbs up, approaches Smidgen's eye, and balls his fists to fight. Smidgen takes his fingers to flick Bugs off his bridge, but Bugs jumps up causing Smidgen to flick his own eye. Bugs then walks through the dog's head, out the left ear to the ground below, and runs down the garden with Smidgen not far behind. Bugs then happens upon a wormhole and dives in forcing its previous occupant, a worm, out. Smidgen sticks his nose over the hole and starts to sniff, unbeknownst that Bugs has a feather, which he uses to tickle Smidgen's nose, causing Smidgen to give a hearty sneeze that rockets Bugs into Paul's cabin and inside a moose <b>call</b> <b>horn.</b> Smidgen runs into the cabin, grabs the horn and gives several blows that alert a nearby moose. The normal-sized moose happily runs after what it believes is another moose, only to find in waiting an enormous dog. The moose instantly flees, yelping like a dog. Smidgen gives the horn another blow, sending Bugs flying into the barrel of a revolver. Smidgen fires it, sending the bullet Bugs is riding on into a nearby apple in a fruit basket. Smidgen grabs the apple and takes a large bite, leaving Bugs' lower half exposed. Smidgen then eats the entire apple, grabs a toothpick to pick his teeth, and walks away, assured that Bugs has been eaten and taken care of. When he picks his teeth, Bugs comes out unharmed {{on the top of the}} toothpick. Bugs then hops up grabbing Smidgen's ear and wraps it around Smidgen's head covering his eyes. Then Bugs dives into the hair on the back of Smidgen's neck. From there, Bugs proceeds to scratch the surface of Smidgen's skin, distracting the dog long enough to allow Bugs to exit via Smidgen's leg and leave the cabin. Smidgen chases after Bugs, except now he wants the rabbit to continue scratching. Bugs, feeling as though he's safe, stops to catch his breath, not knowing Smidgen is right behind him. Before he knows it, Bugs is licked by the dog's enormous tongue, which lifts him off the ground each time. Bugs tries to run away, but stops at the sight of something. Quickly, he sees the world's largest redwood tree and calls Smidgen's attention to it, and the dog runs off to it.|$|E

25|$|Males {{are usually}} smaller than females, with {{relatively}} longer legs. Unlike females, the males bear {{a pair of}} flagella, one on each chelicera.

His eyes, which Peter had always thought so soft and gentle, seemed to flash fire.|$|R
50|$|These {{processes}} {{also gave}} the Mission Mountains their distinct shapes. The many three-sided peaks, <b>called</b> <b>horns</b> or pyramidal peaks, and the knife-like ridges {{of the southern}} half of the range are results of the heavy mountain glaciation. The northern half of the range was largely rolled over by the Flathead Lobe, which was much like a huge moving ice sheet. This led to the shorter, more rounded features of the northern half of the range.|$|R

This practice is <b>called</b> <b>horn</b> tipping; it is less stressful on the animal {{because there is no}} blood loss and the horn is cut off where there are no longer any nerve endings. This practice does not eliminate the bruising damage done by the horns when cows fight, but it does eliminate the risk of puncture wounds and eye loss from pointed horns.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the start}} of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped cirque, which has escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the valley. Cirques are where ice begins to {{accumulate}} in a glacier. [...] Two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge, called an arête is left. This structure may result in a mountain pass. [...] If multiple cirques encircle a single mountain, they create pointed pyramidal peaks; particularly steep examples are <b>called</b> <b>horns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Horns {{usually have}} a curved or spiral shape, often with ridges or fluting. In many species only males have horns. Horns start to grow soon after birth, and {{continue}} to grow throughout {{the life of the}} animal (except in pronghorns, which shed the outer layer annually, but retain the bony core). Partial or deformed horns in livestock are called scurs. Similar growths on {{other parts of the body}} are not usually <b>called</b> <b>horns,</b> but spurs, claws or hoofs depending on the part of the body on which they occur.|$|R

50|$|Young begin {{calling for}} begging {{purposes}} {{in a slightly}} trill peeping noise, {{similar to that of}} a domestic chick. As they mature, their song changes to a more adult-like chittering. Their typical advertising call is loud and nasaly “aaarrh” descending in a pitch and ending in a trill. They use other calls during copulation, alarm and breeding ceremonies that are slightly variable from the advertising <b>call.</b> <b>Horned</b> Grebes are extremely vocal during breeding, territory establishment and defense. Their song is subdued during fall migration and at wintering sites.|$|R
