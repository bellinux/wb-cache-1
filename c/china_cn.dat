40|$|A {{survey of}} HIV- 1 strains {{circulating}} in the Tokyo-Kanagawa metropolitan area of Japan during 2004 - 2011 (n= 477) identified six Japanese males (patients # 1 through # 6), who harbored viruses with genome segments {{derived from a}} distinct CRF 01 _AE variant uniquely found among MSM in <b>China</b> (designated <b>CN.</b> MSM. 01 - 1). These six HIV infections were diagnosed in 2010 - 2011 among MSM (3 of 75) and men with unknown risk factors (3 of 63), and differed from {{the vast majority of}} HIV infections among MSM in Japan, which are overwhelmingly characterized by subtype B (239 of 246, 97. 2 %). Approximately one-third (91 of 239, 38. 1 %) of subtype B strains from MSM in Japan belong to a large monophyletic cluster (designated JP. MSM. B- 1). In addition, we identified a smaller subtype B cluster (n= 8) (designated JP. MSM. B- 2) that also contains strains from two Chinese MSM living in Japan. Interestingly, patients # 5 and # 6 were found to be co-infected with CRF 01 _AE (CN. MSM. 01 - 1) and subtype B (JP. MSM. B- 2 or JP. MSM. B- 1) variants that are unique to the HIV- 1 epidemics among MSM in China and Japan, respectively. Our study demonstrates {{for the first time the}} effect of the expanding HIV epidemic among MSM in China on transmission in neighbouring countries, and shows the ongoing mixing of CRF 01 _AE and subtype B lineages unique to HIV- 1 that co-circulate in MSM populations in East Asia. This finding highlights the importance of strengthening epidemiological surveillance in the region and the need for effective measures to limit transmission among MSM in East Asia. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Although {{there is}} no {{specific}} nanoparticle regulation, there are some food industry patent documents deposited in different countries. WO 2018029626, a patent application from Argentina, focused on chia oil with an edible nanoemulsion. It described a chia oil nanoemulsion comprising between 10 and 20 % of chia oil (Salvia hispanica L.), between 2 and 5 % of polysorbate, between 0.5 and 5 % {{of at least one}} emulsifier other than the polysorbate, between 0.05 and 0.2 % of at least one antioxidant, and water. Formulations of edible chia oil nanoemulsions used in transparent drinks and desserts, such as juices and jellies, were disclosed [95]. A patent application from the Republic of Korea, KR 20160005182, focused on cinnamon oil nanoemulsions to inhibit the development and increase of dangerous food microorganisms. Furthermore, this invention could not only be used for food additives, food packaging materials, preservatives, etc. but also be utilized in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries [96]. A mustard oil nanoemulsion application patent from <b>China,</b> <b>CN</b> 103315956, was prepared to alleviate the pungent smell of mustard oil to avoid volatilization, and the mustard oil may be used for bacterial resistance in food and drugs [97]. Wang Weichun Feng Wei submitted an application patent from <b>China,</b> <b>CN</b> 103750050, describing a palm oil nanoemulsion that solved the problems of high grease costs, low absorption rates, low oil content in the existing prepared palm oil nanoemulsions, large granularity, poor stability, long production periods, high equipment investments, and high production costs in existing young animal feeds. The palm oil nanoemulsion was prepared by mixing an emulsifier with palm oil, cutting and emulsifying the mixture, and ultrasonically performing cell breaking in the mixture. The process was simple, the entire reaction process was easily controlled, the entire process production period was short, the equipment investment and production costs were low, the oil content of the produced nanoemulsion was high, the distribution granularity was small, the stability was good, and the digestion by livestock increased [98].|$|E

Such agronomic trait variations, however, were matched by very low genetic diversity and medium level but significant epigenetic diversity. Significant difference in inner cytosine and double cytosine methylation at CCGG sites was also found among populations. Most epigenetic differential markers can be inherited as epialleles following Mendelian segregation. These results suggest possible involvement of epigenetics in jatropha development. </p...|$|E

Objectives: To understand media professionals’ experiences with applying controversial practices when reporting suicide news in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Methods: Face-to-face interviews with 33 journalists working at popular and representative media outlets in Mainland <b>China</b> (<b>CN),</b> Hong Kong (HK), and Taiwan (TW) were conducted. Grounded theory method was used for data analysis. Results: Controversial practices were commonly and consciously adopted by journalists in the three regions when reporting suicide news. To gather suicide news tips, the journalists in the three regions commonly wrote their suicide news articles {{based on what they}} overheard. Some journalists would fake their identities to gather information and some even stole photos or documents. Many CN journalists and some HK and TW ones secretly paid money to key informants. Some TW journalists obtained information leaked from their police contacts. At a suicide scene, HK and TW journalists often neglected surviving family members’ requests to stop taking photos and continued to do so. Conclusion: Journalists’ controversial practices violate suicidal individuals and their families’ privacy. More studies are needed to investigate how suicide survivors perceive and are influenced by these practices. Social services are also needed to alert suicide survivors with these practices and empower them to reject undesirable media intrusion...|$|E
40|$|Web {{crawling}} {{refers to}} the process of gathering data from the Web. Focused crawlers are programs that selectively download Web documents (pages), restricting the scope of crawling to a pre-defined domain or topic. The downloaded documents can be indexed for a domain specific search engine or a digital library. In this paper, we describe the focused crawling technique, review relevant literature, and report novel experimental results. Crawling is often started with URLs that point to the pages of central North-American and European universities, research institutions, and other organizations in North-America and Europe. In the experiments we investigated, first, how strongly this central region of the Web is connected to three other large geographical regions of the Web: Australia (top level domain. au), <b>China</b> (. <b>cn),</b> and five South-American countries (. ar,. br,. cl,. mx, and. uy). Test topics were selected from the domains of genomics and genetics which are typical scientific fields. We found that two focused crawling processes, one started from the central region and the other from the region of Australia / China / South-America, overlap only to a small extent, identifying mainly different relevant documents. Document relevance was assessed (1) by a human judge and (2) by assigning probability scores to documents using a search engine. Second, we investigated the coverage (number) of relevant documents obtained for different focused crawling processes started with URLs from the four different geographical regions. The results showed that all regions considered in this study are good starting points for focused crawling in the domains of genetics and genomics since each of them yielded a high coverage. As genomics and genetics are typical scientific domains we assume the obtained results to be generalizable to other scientific domains. We discuss what implications the observed results have for the selection of crawling approach in scientific focused crawling tasks. 1...|$|E
