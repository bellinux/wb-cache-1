There was also a program counter, four index registers, and a 16-bit real-time <b>clock</b> <b>register</b> which was incremented 32 times a second. Trigonometric sine and cosine functions used 1.4 degree precision (256 values) via look-up tables.|$|E
50|$|The main {{register}} set consisted of eight 64-bit scalar (S) registers and eight 24-bit address (A) registers. These were {{backed by a}} set of sixty-four registers each for S and A temporary storage known as T and B respectively, which could not be seen by the functional units. The vector system added another eight 64-element by 64-bit vector (V) registers, as well as a vector length (VL) and vector mask (VM). Finally, the system also included a 64-bit real-time <b>clock</b> <b>register</b> and four 64-bit instruction buffers that held sixty-four 16-bit instructions each. The hardware was set up to allow the vector registers to be fed at one word per cycle, while the address and scalar registers required two cycles. In contrast, the entire 16-word instruction buffer could be filled in four cycles.|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation examines the characterization and modeling of visible charge-coupled devices (CCDs). A theoretical model is discussed that represents the parallel <b>clock</b> <b>register</b> of a CCD as a lumped system of discrete resistances and capacitances. This model {{can be used to}} simulate the electrical performance of the <b>clock</b> <b>register.</b> From the simulation results the clock pulse degradation in the lossy transmission line model of the clock electrode can be determined. An upper limit is found to the parallel clock frequency at which reasonable pulse shapes are preserved. In addition, the model is used to find the current flow and the power dissipation within the clock electrodes. Through simulations, the total power dissipation on a high-speed, high-resolution CCD can be calculated and compared to theoretical values obtained from a conventional model. The experimental part of this dissertation covers the theory and application of test methodology for the characterization of high-speed, high-resolution CCDs. Both standard and novel techniques for CCD evaluation are discussed, covering all standard figures-of-merit such as read noise, full-well capacity, dynamic range, conversion gain, charge transfer efficiency, MTF, quantum efficiency, non-uniformity, dark current, linearity and lag. This chapter is followed by a discussion of the test camera hardware and software that is used to develop characterization techniques and apply them to specific devices. Finally, the characterization results from applying these techniques to the English Electric Valve (EEV) CCD 13 are presented. This device is a 512 by 512 pixel, 8 -output, three-phase, full-frame CCD that was designed for readout periods of less than 2 ms. It has been characterized at data rates up to 1 MHz, resulting in video acquisition of 128 by 64 pixel subarrays at 100 frames per second. The results show that both experimental characterization and theoretical modeling are two important aspects of CCD evaluation, providing necessary data to customers and valuable feedback to manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|We present two {{universal}} {{models of}} quantum computation with a time-independent, frustration-free Hamiltonian. The first construction uses 3 -local (qubit) projectors, {{and the second}} one requires only 2 -local qubit-qutrit projectors.

40|$|We {{propose a}} (theoretical;-) model for quantum {{computation}} where {{the result can}} be read out from the time average of the Hamiltonian dynamics of a 2 -dimensional crystal on a cylinder. The Hamiltonian is a spatially local interaction among Wigner-Seitz cells containing 6 qubits. The quantum circuit that is simulated is specified by the initialization of program qubits. As in Margolus' Hamiltonian cellular automaton (implementing classical circuits), a propagating wave in a <b>clock</b> <b>register</b> controls asynchronously the application of the gates. However, in our approach all required initializations are basis states. After a while the synchronizing wave is essentially spread around the whole crystal. The circuit is designed such that the result is available with probability about 1 / 4 despite of the completely undefined computation step. This model reduces quantum computing to preparing basis states for some qubits, waiting, and measuring in the computational basis. Even though it may be unlikely to find our specific Hamiltonian in real solids, it is possible that also more natural interactions allow ergodic quantum computing.

40|$|Modern design {{requirements}} have brought additional complexities to netlists and layouts. Millions of components, whitespace resources, and fixed/movable blocks are just few to {{mention in the}} list of complexities. With these complexities in mind, placers are faced with the burden of finding a spatial arrangement of components under strict wirelength, timing, and power constraints. Motivated by this challenge, this thesis presents our work on a general analytical placement framework and its applications to a variety of placement tasks. The first part of this thesis describes the basic architecture and technical details of our high-quality, large-scale analytical placer, APlace. We describe (i) a constrained minimization formulation for the global placement problem, (ii) a top-down multi-level global placement algorithm, and (iii) legalization schemes and novel detailed placement methods. We also provide extensive experimental results on a number of benchmark suites. The analytical placement framework has strong extensibility, and we have applied variants of APlace to several novel placement tasks. The second part of this thesis describes the following applications: (1) a timing-driven placement method with net weighting for performance improvement, (2) a power-aware placement method with <b>clock</b> <b>register</b> clustering and activity-based net weighting for clock power and switching power reduction, (3) a voltage degradation (IR drop) aware placement method that relocates cells for supply voltage drop improvement, (4) a lens aberration aware timing-driven placement method with awareness of across-field lens aberration effects for timing yield optimization, and (5) other applications to I /O-core co-placement and constraint handling for mixed- signal contexts.

50|$|The primary {{differences}} between CPLDs (complex programmable logic devices) and FPGAs are architectural. A CPLD has a somewhat restrictive structure consisting {{of one or}} more programmable sum-of-products logic arrays feeding {{a relatively small number of}} <b>clocked</b> <b>registers.</b> The result of this is less flexibility, with the advantage of more predictable timing delays and a higher logic-to-interconnect ratio. The FPGA architectures, on the other hand, are dominated by interconnect. This makes them far more flexible (in terms of the range of designs that are practical for implementation within them) but also far more complex to design for.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} Heraclitus as {{an example}} of a stream cipher that uses a 128 bit index string to specify the structure of each instance in real time: each instance of Heraclitus will be a stream cipher based on mutually <b>clocked</b> shift <b>registers.</b> Ciphers with key-dependent structures have been investigated and are generally based on Feistel networks. Heraclitus, however, is based on mutually <b>clocked</b> shift <b>registers.</b> Ciphers of this type have been extensively analysed, and published attacks on them will be infeasible against any instance of Heraclitus. The speed and security of Heraclitus makes it suitable as a session cipher, that is, an instance is generated at key exchange and used for one session. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{implementation}} of the IEEE 1149. 1 standard (JTAG) is presented in this paper. Rules are given for removing gated <b>clocks,</b> <b>registering</b> of all the TAP controller outputs, and daisy-chaining the boundary-scan cell clocks, resets, and control signals in a direction opposite to that of TDI to TDO signal. Several major advantages are obtained {{as a result of}} these implementation rules. Timing issues that occur while shifting between the boundary cells when the design is in layout are eliminated. During EXTEST instruction execution, skew is introduced between the toggling pad outputs to minimize damaging power spikes. Due to the elimination of the gated clocks, scan can be inserted without additional DFT logic. A method for inserting scan is given which mostly eliminates timing issues during shifting. Since the TAP controller outputs are fully registered and the gated clocks are recommended to be enables, more observe and control locations are available for an ATPG tool to easily create a high fault coverage pattern for the JTAG logic...|$|R
