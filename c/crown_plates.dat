50|$|In {{traditional}} timber framing, a crown post looks {{similar to}} a king post, {{but it is very}} different structurally: whereas the king post is in tension, usually supporting the tie beam as a truss, the crown post is supported by the tie beam and is in compression.

5000|$|A purlin {{plate in}} wooden {{construction}} is also called an [...] "arcade plate" [...] in European English, [...] "under purlin", and [...] "principal purlin". The term plate means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. Purlin plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and {{are supported by}} posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. Purlin plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America.

50|$|Strut is {{a common}} name in timber framing for a support or brace of {{scantlings}} lighter than a post.

In the U.K., strut is generally used {{in a sense of}} a lighter duty piece: a king post carries a ridge beam but a king strut does not, a queen post carries a plate but a queen strut does not, a crown post carries a <b>crown</b> <b>plate</b> but a <b>crown</b> strut does not.|$|R

30|$|The {{magnitude}} of clearance leakage {{rate in the}} impeller sealing ring can reflect the flow conditions in the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown</b> and the radial distribution of pressure and velocity in the back shroud and hub cavities in the centrifugal pump.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{understanding}} in the flow mechanism of the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown,</b> the current calculation of the disc friction loss and the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump often uses empirical formulas. Research on the flow characteristics of the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown</b> is of practical significance. The shroud and hub cavities are respectively studied with regard to tangential and radial velocities at the four different angular positions (0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °) at the four different operational points (0.6 Qsp, 0.8 Qsp, 1.0 Qsp, and 1.2 Qsp). Results indicate that at the same operational point, the smaller the volute chamber sectional area is, the higher the tangential velocity of the fluid core zone of the shroud cavity is. Radial leakage flow from the volute to the seal ring at the same operational point appears in 0 ° and 90 ° direction; when the flow is large, the tangential and radial velocities of the shroud and hub cavities with the same radius tend to be equal with axial symmetry. The axial leakage flow through the balance holes significantly affects the radial distribution of both tangential and radial velocities of fluid flow in the hub cavity. The numerical calculation results of fluid leakage through the clearance of back sealing ring are in good agreement with the test results. Accordingly, the magnitude of leakage is closely related to the fluid pressure and velocity distribution in the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown</b> of the centrifugal pump. The analysis of the flow characteristics in the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown</b> of the centrifugal pump could reveal the cause of the disc friction loss from the mechanism, providing a significant guidance for improving the accuracy of calculation and balancing the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump.|$|R

The study was also aimed to analyze the radial distribution of the dimensionless tangential and radial velocities of the flow field in the back shroud and hub cavities.

30|$|In an {{impeller}} with balance holes of the double-sealing ring structure in a centrifugal pump, the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown</b> of the impeller {{is divided into}} a shroud cavity and a hub cavity by the sealing ring. The calculation of round disk friction loss and axial thrust {{is closely related to}} the flow in the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown.</b> Research on the shroud cavity, hub cavity, and sealing ring leakage has revealed the mechanism of the internal round disk friction loss and axial thrust of the centrifugal pump. Yang et al. [1] pointed out that disc friction loss calculated by the conventional method would produce more errors since it only considered the friction torque of the impeller at its periphery but ignored the major part at the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown</b> and sealing ring. In the derivation of the axial thrust calculation formula, under the assumption that no fluid leakage flow exists in the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown</b> and the fluid rotational angular velocity within the shroud cavity is half of the impeller rotational angular velocity, no rotating motion of the hub cavity fluid exists within the sealing ring [2 – 4]. Salvadori et al. [5] pointed out that the cavity flow behavior is a key parameter for the pressure field evaluation and then for the thrust calculation. Over the pump operating range the main contribution to the axial thrust is due to the impellers flow fields, the leakage flows through sealing rings and the pressure distribution that occurs inside the cavities between impeller shrouds and pump stationary walls. Test results on disk friction loss or axial thrust calculated in terms of the theoretical formula in fluid flow velocity in the shroud cavity did not match the results of practical tests [6]. To calculate the axial thrust of centrifugal pump with higher accuracy, Liu et al. [7, 8] developed a mathematical model of the shroud cavity liquid pressure on the design condition by simplifying the Navier–Stokes equations for the movement of cavity fluid. The results of liquid pressure test verified the reliability of the model. The study of Mu et al. [9] showed that the pump clearance leakage flow has significant influence on the flow field in the hub <b>plate</b> <b>crown.</b> The angular velocity of the fluid in the back shroud cavity is less than 0.5 times the angular velocity of impeller. Besides, compared with the experiment result, the axial thrust was found underestimated by the conventional formula. Research has shown that both cavities velocity field in the shroud and hub and the axial changing laws in the centrifugal pump are similar to the velocity field in the enclosed cylinder body [10 – 12]. That is, in the fluid flow velocity of the shroud and hub cavities, a turbulent boundary layer exists near the outer wall of the rotating impeller back shroud. Near the internal wall of the fixed motionless pump shroud, a flow core zone exists along the axial direction without significant changes between two boundary layers [13 – 15]. The flow core zone is the main region of fluid within the shroud and hub cavities. It occupies over two-thirds of the axial distance, whereby the fluid flow conditions within the shroud and hub cavities can be reflected.|$|R
