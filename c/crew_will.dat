5|$|A bulker's voyages are {{determined}} by market forces; routes and cargoes often vary. A ship may engage in the grain trade during the harvest season and later move on to carry other cargoes or work on a different route. Aboard a coastal carrier in the tramp trade, the <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> often not know the {{next port of call}} until the cargo is fully loaded.|$|E
5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E
5|$|Fireflash is {{recalled}} and Captain Hanson and his co-pilot {{instructed to}} circle the airspace above the airport. The shielding on the airliner's atomic reactor is weakening; if Fireflash does not land within two hours, the passengers and <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> die of radiation exposure. Air Traffic Control commandeers an Air Force jet called a TX-204 Target Carrying Aircraft that docks with Fireflash in flight, allowing a Lieutenant Bob Meddings to board the hold and attempt to remove the bomb. Meddings is almost killed when he falls through the unclosed maintenance hatch and plummets to the ground; moments before impact, however, he successfully deploys his parachute and ultimately survives.|$|E
50|$|Firefighters {{are part}} of a Watch system that {{consists}} of 'core' crews and 'late' crews depending on the station they are serving at. Staff that {{are part of}} the core <b>crews</b> <b>will</b> be on duty for two days from 8am until 6pm, then two nights from 6pm until 8am. Late crews are on duty from 10am until 10pm for four days in a row. Firefighters {{that are part of the}} core <b>crews</b> <b>will</b> belong to either a Red, Green, White or Blue Watch, and those in the late <b>crews</b> <b>will</b> belong to either an Orange or Purple Watch.|$|R

5|$|Captain Rachel Garrett of the Enterprise-C and {{her crew}} learn they have {{traveled}} into the future. Garrett explains {{that they were}} responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on NarendraIII, and were attacked by Romulan starships. While his crew works to repair the Enterprise-C and tend to the crew's injuries, Picard and his command staff discuss {{whether or not the}} ship should return to the past. Commander Riker argues that their deaths would be meaningless, but Data suggests that it would be considered an honorable act by the Klingons. Picard discusses the situation with Garrett, who tells him that her <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> serve the Federation in the present. Picard quietly reveals to her that the Federation {{is on the verge of}} defeat and the presence of one ship will make no difference, but if the Enterprise-C were to return to the past they might prevent the war from ever starting. Garrett agrees and announces to her crew that they will return through the anomaly; at that moment, the two ships are ambushed by a Klingon Bird of Prey. Garrett is killed, and her helmsman, Richard Castillo, takes command.|$|E
25|$|Although the minke whaling vessels {{also use}} harpoon cannons, {{due to the}} smaller size of minke whales, the boats are able to haul a caught whale on deck where the <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> butcher the animal at sea.|$|E
25|$|From the {{perspective}} of an onboard observer, the <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> feel a gravitational field opposite the engine's acceleration, and the universe ahead will appear to fall in that field, undergoing hyperbolic motion. As part of this, distances between objects {{in the direction of}} the ship's motion will gradually contract until the ship begins to decelerate, at which time an onboard observer's experience of the gravitational field will be reversed.|$|E

25|$|Modules {{are usually}} {{installed}} {{and replaced by}} a 15-ton capacity mobile crane. A module can be swapped out and replaced within half an hour, and after system testing completed, the ship is ready to deploy within a few hours. However, refresher training for the ship's <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> take significantly longer. Standardised consoles are fitted in the combat information centre: the console's role {{is defined by the}} software installed, which can be quickly replaced. The ease of installation and use is compared by naval personnel to another Danish product: Lego.|$|E
25|$|After the {{audition}}er's {{number is}} called for {{the second round of}} audition known as Tier 2, an audition <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> take them along with couple others to the waiting room once more. The competitors will have to wait there until their number is called, and then they will be sent into the audition room. In Tier 2, the competitors will audition to a producer of the show, where they will be asked to sing a minimum of two songs. The successful auditioner will receive a Blue Ticket, and will need to return to the registration desk to register for the Celebrity Judges round.|$|E
25|$|Most often, sword {{fighting}} duels {{occur when}} two ships collide during naval combat. Sword fights can also break out during attacks on cities, {{particularly if the}} city has too few defenders to mount a battle outside the city gates, but also if the player manages to reach the town gates during such land battles without first having defeated the enemy force. During these two kinds of fights, the player's crew and the enemy <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> have an important influence on combat. Crew sizes and morale dictate which side {{is more likely to}} lose men during the conflict - any men lost on one side will cause a reduced effectiveness of that side's leader's combat moves.|$|E

25|$|Three months later, as Lovell {{conducts a}} VIP tour of NASA's Vertical Assembly Building, his boss Deke Slayton informs him {{that because of}} Alan Shepard's medical emergancy, his <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> fly Apollo 13 instead of 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their new mission. A few days before launch, Mattingly is exposed to the measles, and the flight surgeon demands his {{replacement}} with Mattingly's backup, Jack Swigert. Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband getting killed in space, but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off.|$|E
25|$|Van Orman survived other, less inspiring incidents: {{once he was}} {{assaulted}} by an unidentified man, allegedly hired by one of Van Orman's competitors; on another occasion during prohibition period he landed a balloon {{in the middle of}} an illegal distillery operation, and was confronted by bootleggers wielding shotguns who mistook him for a federal agent. During the 1933 National Race Van Orman's balloon flew deep into Canadian forests. He and his partners wandered through the wilderness, starving; back at home they were already considered dead. Finally, they reached a telephone line running through the forest; they chopped down a pole, severing the line, expecting that a repair <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> eventually locate them. After this incident Van Orman, a single parent (his first wife died in 1932), quit balloon racing forever.|$|E
25|$|As the Seahawk {{enters a}} {{powerful}} hurricane, Charlotte {{falls from the}} ratlines and is saved by a man whom she believes is Zachariah, despite his apparent death. As she climbs back down, the crew finds {{the body of the}} first mate, Mr. Hollybrass, stabbed in the back, by the dirk Zachariah gave her. She is ordered to the brig, where she finds Zachariah, who has been hiding there since he was thrashed nearly to death. Captain Jaggery holds a trial and conveniently finds her guilty of Mr. Hollybrass' murder after accusing Charlotte of being unnatural in many aspects of her life, and comparing this to the unnatural murder of Hollybrass. Captain Jaggery tells Charlotte that he won't be the jury; instead the <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> be the jury. As Charlotte has vowed to expose his cruelty when they land, he threatens to hang her unless she will align herself with him and become a respectable young woman again.|$|E

25|$|HNoMS Maud {{was ordered}} on 28 June 2013 to replace HNoMS Tyr and HNoMS Valkyrien {{at a cost}} of NOK1,320m (~£140m} with 100% offsets. She is based on the AEGIR-18R design. but {{includes}} a 48-bed hospital underneath the flight deck with an operating theatre, isolation ward and CT scanner. She can carry 7000 tonnes of F76 fuel oil, 300 tonnes of F44/JP-5 jet fuel, 200 tonnes of ammunition and 40 ISO containers or a mix of vehicles and boats. She has two abeam RAS rigs and a stern reel, and a 25-tonne deck crane. A side ramp allows easy access for vehicles and for the support of submarines and other small vessels. The flight deck can accommodate helicopters up to CH-53 Super Stallion size, and the hangar can operate one NH90 with level 2 maintenance or stow a second. The core <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> be 40-50, with accommodation for 100 more if needed; facilities include a gym and sauna. Four Sea PROTECTOR remote weapon stations are planned.|$|E
25|$|In Captain Carrot and the Final Ark (October 2007), {{written by}} Bill Morrison, with art by co-creator Scott Shaw, The Zoo Crew reunite {{in the midst}} of growing strife between the land and the sea creatures of Earth-26, sparked by Starro. Unfortunately, they {{encounter}} Starro and most of their powers are neutralized except for Pig Iron. Furthermore, that Earth is rendered uninhabitable and the Crew has an ocean liner loaded with refugees transported off the planet by the Just-A-Lot-Of-Animals. Unfortunately, the ship is accidentally sent to New Earth. Although the Justice League encounter the ship and land it safely, all the passengers, including The Crew are transformed into their animal forms indigenous to that Earth and, although they all apparently still have their human level intelligence, they are unable to speak. However, some time in the future, the <b>Crew</b> <b>will</b> discover that their powers have been restored. In Final Crisis #7, Captain Carrot is seen in the climactic battle with his humanity and powers restored, and Pig Iron is with him.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 8, the Cupola was {{successfully}} moved from its launch location to its permanent {{location on the}} earth facing side of Tranquility. Cupola was moved by the space station robot arm (SSRMS), which was operated by Kay Hire and Terry Virts. ISS commander Jeff Williams assisted them by releasing the bolts and hooks that held the Cupola in place and then securing it to its new home. The process was slightly delayed due to some bolts that were torqued tighter than expected on the ground, but flight controllers were able to increase the torque to release the bolts. Once the move of the Cupola was complete, outfitting continued to get the cupola ready. The <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> be able to ingress it tomorrow, but the window covers will not be opened until after {{the third and final}} spacewalk. While the Cupola relocation was going on, some of the crew members participated in transferring items between the shuttle and station. Also during this time Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick prepared the tools that they will use during the final spacewalk scheduled for flight day 10. During this time the pair re-sized another spacesuit on station for use by Behnken. This was done because the suit Behnken had been using had some problems with its communications equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Novice <b>crews</b> <b>will</b> often decode {{and plot}} while stationary, then drive the plotted route - {{this is the}} more literal meaning of [...] "plot 'n' bash". However, as {{experience}} is gained, most <b>crews</b> <b>will</b> decode, plot and drive the route simultaneously. This requires considerable skill {{on the part of}} the navigator, who must decipher the route and plot it while giving the driver up-to-the-second information about where they are right now, and what is ahead, as well as calculating due times and handling the paperwork, etc. The driver, by contrast, merely drives. This second approach is usually the more competitive, but prone to much larger errors if the navigator misreads the directions.|$|R

500|$|The {{music at}} the start of the episode of the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon parodies the theme from the {{original}} [...] series. Itchy bursts out of Scratchy's stomach in a parody of the creature from the Alien films. Homer hopes that his <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> not be sent to [...] "that terrible Planet of the Apes", only to suddenly figure out the film's ending; he then unwittingly performs Charlton Heston's final scene in the film. Much of the episode parodies The Right Stuff, with sequences such as Barney and Homer's training, Homer's walk to the shuttle and the shuttle's re-entry paying homage to the film. Barney sings the first part of the Major-General's Song from Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance while doing flips to show how fit he is, while Homer responds with cartwheels, reciting [...] "There once was a man from Nantucket...".|$|E

After Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) pursues the Vidiians to recover Neelix's organs, the Vidiians explain that their entire species has been infected by a pandemic known as the Phage. They have developed advanced medical technology to remotely harvest organs directly from living humanoids {{in order to stop}} the progression of the Phage, which causes tissue to disintegrate on a cellular level. Motura informs Janeway that he has already implanted Neelix's lungs into his own body, but would be willing to kill himself to allow them to be restored to Neelix. Faced with a moral dilemma, Janeway refuses his offer and allows both Dereth and Motura to leave. She instructs them to tell the other Vidiians that any attempt to take another organ from Voyagers <b>crew</b> <b>will</b> be met with deadly force. Dereth and Motura perform an operation and adapt the body of Kes (Jennifer Lien), an Ocampa and Neelix's romantic partner, to make a lung compatible with Neelix's physiology. They are able to successfully implant the lung into Neelix's body.|$|E
