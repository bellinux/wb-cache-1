The effects of FDI on selective peripheral integration of parts of CEE into the European car production system, as well as the role of <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> in the <b>division</b> of labour in the European passenger car industry, are also considered. ...|$|R

40|$|Spiders (Araneae) are predators {{utilizing}} many {{strategies for}} hunting their prey. Their diet is often extensive. To obtain food, many various interactions occur among the spiders, and some species {{are not even}} afraid to hunt over other spiders. In the first two chapters, I describe the environment of spiders. I focus on the basic classification of spiders, following by {{an overview of the}} most important families in <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> and their <b>division</b> into the weavers of different types of cobwebs, and spiders who do not hunt through the webs but have a similar style of hunting, in hunting groups (guilds). Further on, the work deals with intraspecific interactions between spiders, such as competition, cannibalism or cooperation that influence the success in hunting prey and consequently the success in survival of spiders. In the last two chapters I deal with the interactions in the framework of the hunting groups, and between different hunting groups that affect other species of the ecosystem and are a driving force in shaping animal communities...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{different}} {{conceptions of}} <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> {{in the literary}} and historical discourse of the 20 th century, {{and at the same}} time, compares how the concept of <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> is defined in the works of Havel, Kundera, Konrád and others. <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> has always been a cultural and geographical crossroads between the East and the West, with shifting centres and peripheries, overlapping ethnic groups, cultures and religions. For simplicity, two conceptions of <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> can be distinguished: minimalist and maximalist. The minimalist conception regards <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> as part of the West, because of analogous historical structures and cultural values. It partly overlaps the original Habsburg Empire and is opposed to the Balkans and Russia. The maximalist conception applies an axiological approach, regarding <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> as a set of historically established ideas, connected with the traditions of Christian civilisation, i. e. it includes the eastern and southern corners of <b>Europe</b> as well. <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> then is geographically identified with the symbolism of the Danube, as both a dividing and unifiying feature. According to Kundera, it is the Jewish people who have made the greatest contribution to the multicultural character of <b>Central</b> <b>Europe,</b> which after 1945 was politically aligned with the East, although historically it {{had been part of the}} West...|$|R
