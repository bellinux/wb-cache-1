5|$|On 8 June 1966, XB-70A No. 2 was {{in close}} {{formation}} {{with four other}} aircraft (an F-4 Phantom, an F-5, a T-38 Talon, and an F-104 Starfighter) for a photoshoot {{at the behest of}} General Electric, manufacturer of the engines of all five aircraft. After the completion of the photoshoot, the F-104 drifted into contact with the XB-70's right wing, flipped over and rolled inverted {{over the top of the}} Valkyrie, striking the vertical stabilizers and left wing of the bomber. The F-104 exploded, destroying the Valkyrie's rudders and damaging its left wing. With the loss of both rudders and damage to the wings, the Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow, California. NASA Chief Test Pilot Joe Walker (F-104 pilot) and Carl Cross (XB-70 co-pilot) were killed. Al White (XB-70 pilot) ejected, sustaining serious injuries, including one arm crushed by the closing clamshell-like escape <b>crew</b> <b>capsule</b> moments prior to ejection.|$|E
25|$|An escape <b>crew</b> <b>capsule</b> is {{an escape}} capsule which allows {{one or more}} {{occupants}} of an aircraft or spacecraft {{to escape from the}} craft while it is subjected to extreme conditions, such as high speed or altitude. The occupant remains encapsulated and protected until such time as the external environment is suitable for direct exposure or the capsule reaches the ground.|$|E
25|$|The Ares I rocket was {{specifically}} being designed {{to launch the}} Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. Orion {{was intended as a}} <b>crew</b> <b>capsule,</b> similar in design to the Apollo program capsule, to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, the Moon, and eventually Mars. Ares I might have also delivered some (limited) resources to orbit, including supplies for the International Space Station or subsequent delivery to the planned lunar base.|$|E

25|$|The Gemini <b>crew</b> <b>capsule</b> (referred {{to as the}} Reentry Module) was {{essentially}} an enlarged version of the Mercury capsule. Unlike Mercury, the retrorockets, electrical power, propulsion systems, oxygen, and water were located in a detachable Adapter Module behind the Reentry Module. A major design improvement in Gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components, which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary, without removing or disturbing other already tested components.|$|E
25|$|The F-111 was an {{all-weather}} attack aircraft, {{capable of}} low-level penetration of enemy defenses to deliver ordnance on the target. The F-111 featured variable-geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with side-by-side seating. The cockpit {{was part of}} an escape <b>crew</b> <b>capsule.</b> The wing sweep varied between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The wing included leading edge slats and double slotted flaps over its full length. The airframe was made up mostly of aluminium alloys with steel, titanium and other materials used in places. The fuselage was made of a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb structure panels for skin.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} goals of Constellation was the {{development}} of spacecraft and booster vehicles to replace the Space Shuttle. NASA had already begun designing two boosters, the Ares I and Ares V, when the program was created. Ares I was designed {{for the sole purpose}} of launching mission crews into orbit, while Ares V would have been used to launch other hardware which required a heavier lift capacity than the Ares I booster provided. In addition to these two boosters, NASA designed other spacecraft for use during Constellation, including the Orion <b>crew</b> <b>capsule,</b> the Earth Departure Stage secondary booster, and the Altair lunar lander.|$|E

25|$|The F-111B was an {{all-weather}} {{interceptor aircraft}} intended to defend U.S. Navy carrier battle groups against bombers and anti-ship missiles. The F-111 features variable geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with {{side by side}} seating. The cockpit {{is part of an}} escape <b>crew</b> <b>capsule.</b> The wing sweep varies between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The airframe consisted mostly of aluminum alloys with steel, titanium and other materials also used. The fuselage is a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb sandwich panels for skin. The F-111B was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines and included the AN/AWG-9 radar system for controlling the AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles. Poor visibility over the nose made the aircraft more difficult to handle for carrier operations.|$|E
500|$|The F-111 was an {{all-weather}} attack aircraft {{capable of}} low-level penetration of enemy defences to deliver ordnance on the target. It featured variable geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with side-by-side seating. The cockpit formed {{part of an}} escape <b>crew</b> <b>capsule.</b> The F-111 had a three-point undercarriage arrangement with a two-wheel nose gear and two single-wheel main undercarriage. [...] Most F-111 variants included a terrain-following radar system connected to the autopilot. The aircraft were powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{released}} in July 2009 by the 45th Space Wing of the US Air Force concluded that an abort 30–60 seconds after launch {{would have a}} ~100% chance of killing all crew, due to the capsule being engulfed until ground impact by a cloud of [...] solid propellant fragments, which would melt the capsule's nylon parachute material. NASA's study showed the <b>crew</b> <b>capsule</b> would have flown beyond the more severe danger.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{they were}} {{intended}} to fly too high and fast for safe use of conventional ejection seats, the Bell X-2, B-58 Hustler, XB-70 Valkyrie, and B‑1A Lancer all used enclosed escape <b>crew</b> <b>capsules</b> of some kind.|$|R
25|$|Some crewed rockets, {{notably the}} Saturn V and Soyuz have launch escape systems. This is a small, usually solid rocket that {{is capable of}} pulling the <b>crewed</b> <b>capsule</b> away from the main vehicle towards safety at a moments notice. These types of systems have been {{operated}} several times, both in testing and in flight, and operated correctly each time.|$|R
50|$|The Bigelow Next-Generation Commercial Space Station is {{a private}} orbital space station {{currently}} under development by Bigelow Aerospace. The space station may be constructed of two B330 expandable spacecraft modules {{as well as a}} central docking node, propulsion, solar arrays, and attached <b>crew</b> <b>capsules,</b> though other possibilities like attaching a B330 to the International Space Station or flying a B330 alone have been suggested by Robert Bigelow.|$|R
2500|$|On June 30, 2017, President Donald Trump {{signed an}} {{executive}} order to re-establish the National Space Council, chaired by Vice President Mike Pence. [...] The Trump administration’s first budget request keeps Obama-era human spaceflight programs in place: commercial spacecraft to ferry astronauts {{to and from the}} International Space Station, the government-owned Space Launch System, and the Orion <b>crew</b> <b>capsule</b> for deep space missions, while reducing Earth science research and calling for the elimination of NASA’s education office.|$|E
2500|$|F-111B numbers 1 to 3 were initial prototypes; and No. 4 and 5 were prototypes with {{lightened}} airframes. No. 6 and 7 had lightened airframes {{and improved}} TF30-P-12 engines and were built to near production standard. These were also approximately [...] longer {{due to an}} added section between the cockpit and radome. The first five aircraft included Triple Plow I intakes. The last two had Triple Plow II intakes. The first three B-models were fitted with ejection seats and the remainder included the escape <b>crew</b> <b>capsule.</b>|$|E
2500|$|It {{features}} an egg-shaped <b>crew</b> <b>capsule</b> nicknamed the [...] "blast bucket". It is shaped to deflect blasts and bullets {{and act as}} a roll-cage if the vehicle flips. The four occupants sit back to back in a diamond arrangement {{so that they can}} see hazards from all directions, a suggestion from troops in the field. It also moves the occupants away from the wheels, which are typically what sets off a land mine. The Ultra AP includes race car technology from NASCAR engineers like multipoint safety harnesses and shock-absorbing seats mounted on Skydex, which is used to cushion the outfield walls of baseball stadiums. It also uses the latest in bulletproof glass and the newest light-weight armor technology.|$|E

5000|$|By mid-2010, Bigelow was {{actively}} pursuing launch options for its space station modules and <b>crew</b> <b>capsules</b> from two launch systems: the Boeing CST-100 capsule on a ULA Atlas V launcher {{and also the}} SpaceX Dragon / Falcon 9 capsule/launcher combination. [...] "Bigelow offers Boeing, SpaceX, and other vehicle developers ... {{the promise of a}} sustained, large market for space transportation services."With the initial Space Complex Alpha, Bigelow [...] "would need six flights a year; with the launch of a second, larger station, that number would grow to 24, or two a month." [...] After 2010, no further concrete plans have been announced for transport with Atlas V launch vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|The first American {{attempt to}} design such an escape capsule {{was for the}} U.S. Navy F4D Skyray. It was tested in 1951-52 but was never {{installed}} in the aircraft. The Bell X-2, designed for flight in excess of Mach 3, could jettison the cockpit, though the pilot {{would still have to}} jump out and descend under his own parachute. The first production aircraft with an escape <b>crew</b> <b>capsule</b> was the Mach 2 B-58 Hustler. It was developed by the Stanley Aviation Company for Convair. [...] The capsule was pressurized, sheltered the pilot from the airstream, and contained food and survival supplies. [...] During testing of the [...] "Stanley Capsule" [...] in 1962, a bear became the first living creature to survive a supersonic ejection.|$|E
50|$|This {{flight was}} used to test orbital injection, {{separation}} and re-entry procedures and systems of the <b>Crew</b> <b>Capsule.</b> Also tested were the capsule separation, heat shields and aerobraking systems, deployment of parachute, retro-firing, splashdown, flotation systems and procedures to recover the <b>Crew</b> <b>Capsule</b> from the Bay of Bengal.|$|E

40|$|The Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle is {{the first}} <b>crewed</b> <b>capsule</b> design to be {{developed}} by NASA since Project Apollo. Unlike Apollo, however, the CEV is being designed for service in both Lunar and International Space Station missions. Ascent aborts pose some issues that were not present for Apollo, due to its launch azimuth, nor Space Shuttle, due to its cross range capability. The requirement that a North Atlantic splashdown following an abort be avoidable, {{in conjunction with the}} requirement for overlapping abort modes to maximize crew survivability, drives the thrust level of the service module main engine. This paper summarizes 3 DOF analysis conducted by NASA to aid in the determination of the appropriate propulsion system for the service module, and the appropriate propellant loading for ISS missions such that crew survivability is maximized...|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} Space Exploration {{includes}} missions to the moon, asteroids, Mars, and beyond. To get there, the mission concept is to launch multiple launch vehicles months, even years apart. In {{order to achieve}} this, launch vehicles, payloads (satellites and <b>crew</b> <b>capsules),</b> and ground systems must be highly reliable and/or available, to include maintenance concepts and procedures {{in the event of}} a launch scrub. In order to achieve this high probability of mission success, Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) has allocated Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RMA) requirements to all hardware and software required for both launch operations and, {{in the event of a}} launch scrub, required to support a repair of the ground systems, launch vehicle, or payload. This is done concurrently with the design process (30 / 60 / 90 reviews) ...|$|R

50|$|On {{the path}} to {{developing}} New Shepard, a <b>crew</b> <b>capsule</b> was also needed, and design was begun on a space capsule in the early 2000s. One development milestone along the way became public. On 19 October 2012, Blue Origin conducted a successful Pad Escape a full-scale suborbital <b>Crew</b> <b>Capsule</b> at its West Texas launch site. For the test, the capsule fired its pusher escape motor and launched from a launch vehicle simulator. The <b>Crew</b> <b>Capsule</b> traveled to an altitude of 2307 ft under active thrust vector control before descending safely by parachute to a soft landing 1630 ft downrange.|$|E
