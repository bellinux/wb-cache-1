50|$|The {{ski area}} is multi-directional, with {{portions}} of the main ski area facing south or southwest and other portions north-facing. Thunder Mountain areas serviced by Chair 3 are north-facing, resulting in longer-lasting snow conditions. The majority of the steep Chair 1 terrain down to the base area and parking lot along with the Chair 4 portion of the resort faces west and south, resulting in frequent spring conditions and <b>corn</b> <b>snow.</b> Snow on the lower portion of the mountain is typically hard with afternoon softening on north-facing slopes due to brief thaw/shade conditions. In times of abundant snowfall, prior to complete solar melting of the snowpack on south-facing slopes, there is sunny skiing on the slopes from Chair 4 down to the base area.|$|E
40|$|Blowing snow {{can cause}} {{significant}} problems for mobility and safety during winter weather in three distinct ways. It may drift onto the road, thus requiring almost continuous plowing while {{the wind is}} blowing (which may occur when a given winter storm is over). Snow may drift onto wet pavement (perhaps caused by ice control chemicals) and dilute out the chemicals on the road, creating ice on the road. And sufficient blowing snow can cause a major deterioration in visibility on the road, a factor which {{has been shown to be}} significant in winter crashes. The problem of blowing snow can be very effectively addressed by creating a snow storage device upwind of the road that requires protection from snow drifting. Typically, these storage devices are fences. Extensive design guidance exists for the required height and placement of such fences for a given annual snowfall and given local topography. However, the design information on the placement of living snow fences is less complete. The purpose of this report is to present the results of three seasons of study on using standing corn as snow fences. In addition, the experience of using switch grass as a snow storage medium is also presented. On the basis of these experimental data, a design guide has been developed that makes use of the somewhat unique snow storage characteristics of standing <b>corn</b> <b>snow</b> fences. The results of the field tests on using standing corn showed that multiple rows of standing corn store snow rather differently than a traditional wooden snow fence. Specifically, while a traditional fence stores most of the snow downwind from the fence (and thus must be placed a significant distance upwind of the road to be protected, specifically at least 35 times the snow fence height) rows of standing corn store the majority of the snow within the rows. Results from the three winters of testing show that the standing <b>corn</b> <b>snow</b> fences can store as much snow within the rows of standing corn as a traditional fence of typical height for operation in Iowa (4 to 6 feet) can store. This finding is significant because it means that the snow fences can be placed at the edge of the farmer’s field closest to the road, and still be effective. This is typically much more convenient for the farmer and thus may mean that more farmers would be willing to participate in a program that uses standing corn than in traditional programs. ii On the basis of the experimental data, design guidance for the use of standing corn as a snow storage device in Iowa is given in the report. Specifically, it is recommended that if the fetch in a location to be protected is less than 5, 000 feet, then 16 rows of standing corn should be used, at the edge of the field adjacent to the right of way. If the fetch is greater than 5, 000 feet, then 24 rows of standing corn should be used. This is based on a row spacing of 22 inches. Further, it should be noted that these design recommendations are ONLY for the State of Iowa. Other states of course have different winter weather and without extensive further study, it cannot be said that these guidelines would be effective in other locations with other winter conditions...|$|E

40|$|Being able to {{simulate}} granular matter is important, {{because they are}} ubiquitous both in nature and in industry. Some examples of granular materials are ore, sand, coffee, rice, <b>corn,</b> and <b>snow.</b> Research and development of new, more accurate, and faster methods {{to simulate}} even more complex materials with millions of particles are needed. In the work of this thesis a typical scene containing thousands of particles {{has been used for}} analysing simulation performance using the iterative Gauss-Seidel method adapted to the specifications and capabilities of the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor. The work began with analysing the performance (wall-clock time and speedup) of a method developed by Algoryx Simulation. The work continued with finding the parts in the code causing bottlenecks and implementing improvements such as a distributed task scheduler and vectorization of operations. In the end, this resulted in shorter execution time and linear speedup using more than 40 threads, compared to 20 in the initial state. We also investigated the benefit of other techniques, such as cache prefetching and usage of huge page sizes, but found no performance gain from these. It is well known that the Xeon Phi coprocessor performs well when executing highly parallel applications, but overload may occur if excessive amount of data is requested by many threads simultaneously. To tackle this issue, the convergence rate of the Gauss-Seidel method during simulation has been measured and suggested modifications of the method decreasing data flow have been implemented and analysed...|$|R
40|$|Today, Florida’s most {{important}} {{crops such as}} <b>corn,</b> peppers, and <b>snow</b> beans owe their existence to constant vigilance by the Florida Department of Agriculture (FDACS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Customs 2 ̆ 6 Border Protection Agricultural Specialists (CBP); all three agencies work together to keep many dangerous pests out of the state. Diligent inspectors working alongside the Customs officers, meet all arriving vessels that arrive by land, sea, or air. The officers inspect cargo and passengers’ baggage, the holds of vessels, cabins, crew’s quarters, and storerooms of vessels themselves to keep out potential insects hitch-hiking on commodities or on the vessels. The interception of insects, diseased plants, and disease-causing organisms is a daily occurrence. Numerous attempts are made to smuggle plants into the state, and each year the ever-increasing array and speed of commercial and private means of transportation add {{to the difficulty of}} detecting and excluding foreign pests. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize the different modes of insect introduction into Florida over an eleven-year period (2005 – 2015), and to discuss the surveillance and detection efforts undertaken by government agencies: Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS), Custom and Border Patrol (CBP), and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for diverse {{biofuels}} in the United States. Potential feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol include corn (Zea mays, L.) stover and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum, L). Lands used to provide for corn production can provide some cellulosic feedstock through corn stover, but crop residue removal can have negative impacts on soil quality. Furthermore, arable land must supply both fuel and food. To meet both demands, lands considered marginal for row-crop production will likely be used to produce dedicated bioenergy crops such as switchgrass. Marginal lands are typically placed in conservation programs because they are prone to erosion and soil quality degradation, so {{it is imperative to}} understand the impacts biofuel production have on marginal soils. A long term, no-till, marginal site in eastern Nebraska was established to assess the impacts of management on soil quality. This study considers continuous corn, switchgrass, and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) as an interim crop, as well as nitrogen (N) and harvest practices in corn (residue retention/removal) and switchgrass plots (harvest in August or October). Soil microbial data, nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, crop N use efficiency, and soil N were measured to assess management impacts on soil, water, and air quality at this site. Abundances of soil microbial biomarkers and biomass responded to all treatments, but crop type was the strongest determining factor. In one of two years of observation, there was no significant treatment effect on N 2 O emissions. In the second year, N 2 O emissions increased with N fertilization. Crop N recovery varied with all treatments and year. Relatively low levels of soil nitrate (NO 3 -) were found under switchgrass and soybean plots, compared to higher levels under corn plots. Switchgrass production on marginal soils appears less likely to result in N loss as N 2 O or NO 3 - than corn. High microbial biomass, soil organic matter and low NO 3 - concentrations also suggest soil quality will be better retained under switchgrass than <b>corn.</b> Advisers: Daniel <b>Snow,</b> Virginia Ji...|$|R
6000|$|A similar superstition, {{concerning}} abstraction by daemons, seems, in {{the time}} of Gervase of Tilbury, to have pervaded the greatest part of Europe. [...] "In Catalonia," [...] says that author, [...] "there is a lofty mountain, named Cavagum, at the foot of which runs a river with golden sands, in the vicinity of which there are likewise mines of silver. This mountain is steep, and almost inaccessible. On its top, which is always covered with ice and snow, is a black and bottomless lake, into which if a stone be thrown, a tempest suddenly rises; and near this lake, though invisible to men, is the porch of the palace of daemons. In a town adjacent to this mountain, named Junchera, lived one Peter de Cabinam. Being one day teazed with the fretfulness of his young daughter, he, in his impatience, suddenly wished that the devil might take her; when she was immediately borne away by the spirits. About seven years afterwards, an inhabitant of the same city, passing by the mountain, met a man, who complained bitterly of the burthen he was constantly forced to bear. Upon enquiring the cause of his complaining, as he did not seem to carry any load, the man related, that he had been unwarily devoted to the spirits by an execration, and that they now employed him constantly as a vehicle of burthen. As a proof of his assertion, he added, that the daughter of his fellow-citizen was detained by the spirits, but that they were willing to restore her, if her father would come and demand her on the mountain. Peter de Cabinam, on being informed of this, ascended the mountain to the lake, and, in the name of God, demanded his daughter; when, a tall, thin, withered figure, with wandering eyes, and almost bereft of understanding, was wafted to him in a blast of wind. After some time, the person, who had been employed as the vehicle of the spirits, also returned, when he related where the palace of the spirits was situated; but added, that none were permitted to enter but those who devoted themselves entirely to the spirits; those, who had been rashly committed to the devil by others, being only permitted, during their probation, to enter the porch." [...] It may be proper to observe, that the superstitious idea, concerning the lake {{on the top of the}} mountain, is common to almost every high hill in Scotland. Wells, or pits, on the top of high hills, were likewise supposed to lead to the subterranean habitations of the Fairies. Thus, Gervase relates, (p. 975), [...] "that he was informed the swine-herd of William Peverell, an English baron, having lost a brood-sow, descended through a deep abyss, in the middle of an ancient ruinous castle, situated on the top of a hill, called Bech, in search of it. Though a violent wind commonly issued from this pit, he found it calm; and pursued his way, till he arrived at a subterraneous region, pleasant and cultivated, with reapers cutting down <b>corn,</b> though the <b>snow</b> remained on the surface of the ground above. Among the ears of corn he discovered his sow, and was permitted to ascend with her, and the pigs which she had farrowed." [...] Though the author seems to think that the inhabitants of this cave might be Antipodes, yet, as many such stories are related of the Fairies, it is probable that this narration is of the same kind. Of a similar nature seems to be another superstition, mentioned by the same author, concerning the ringing of invisible bells, at the hour of one, in a field in the vicinity of Carleol, which, as he relates, was denominated Laikibraine, or Lai ki brait. From all these tales, we may perhaps be justified in supposing, that the faculties and habits ascribed to the Fairies, by the superstition of latter days, comprehended several, originally attributed to other classes of inferior spirits.|$|R
