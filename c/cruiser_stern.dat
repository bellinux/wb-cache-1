25|$|Palatia {{was built}} by Schiffswerft H. Koch A.G. in Lübeck in 1928, with yard number 273. Launched on 26 May 1928, and {{completed}} in October of the same year, she had a length of 114 metres, beam of 16.4 metres, draught of 6.9 metres and a tonnage of 3,979 tons. She was a single deck, steel-hulled ship with diesel engines, electric lights, wireless radio and a <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern.</b> The 6-cylinder diesel engine produced 3,500 horsepower, and gave Palatia {{a top speed of}} 12 knots.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s the world's main {{shipping}} lines were Britain's Cunard Line and White Star Line and France's Compagnie Générale Transatlantique. [...] Each {{of these three}} were operating ageing vessels and required new larger and more modern 1000ft long superliners to remain competitive. [...] CGT began construction of the SS Normandie while Cunard placed an order for the RMS Queen Mary. White Star, placed an order to their shipbuilders Harland and Wolff for the Oceanic, a successor to the line's inaugural 1870 liner, the RMS Oceanic. [...] The exact intended design of the Oceanic III is unknown, although company concept renderings show {{it to be a}} three-funnelled 1000-foot liner. However, early plans from Harland and Wolff's archives show a design drawn in 1927 for a four funnelled liner almost identical to the Olympic-class design except sporting a more modern <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1936 she {{was taken}} out of service for a {{complete}} rebuild at Trondhjems mekaniske Værksted and the Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskabs own repair yard Nordre Verft in Trondheim. As part of the 1936 Hurtigruten contract with the Norwegian government, Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskab had obligated itself to put a new ship into the service. Rather than building a new ship, Nordenfjeldske decided to rebuild Prins Olav for the Hurtigruten cargo/passenger service on the coast of Norway. The rebuild, which lasted until 27 May 1937, changed her tonnage to 2,147 gross register tons (1,247 net register tons). In her new configuration she had the capacity to carry 450 passengers, with 95 cabins in the First Class section and 145 cabins in the Third Class section. Much effort was put into providing good standards for the Third Class section. Her turbines were replaced with a 3,500 ihp four-cylinder compound engine, the largest steam engine built in Norway up to that point in time. The engine had been manufactured by the shipyard Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted, where Prins Olav had previously had modification work done. The new shape of Prins Olav included a single funnel, unlike the two she had had in her previous guise. While Prins Olav had featured two decks and a shelter deck prior to her rebuild, the rebuilt ship had an additional promenade deck and a <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Three ships, Prince David, [...] and [...] {{were ordered}} in 1929 from Cammell Laird & Co. by the Canadian National Railways {{subsidiary}} CN Steamships {{to operate as}} small luxury liners on the West Coast of Canada. The specifications for all three ships had been identical: three decks, three funnels, <b>cruiser</b> <b>sterns</b> and accommodation for 300 passengers. Each had cost $2,000,000 at completion and with a speed of , {{they were among the}} fastest ships in the Canadian registry.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{the storm}} passed, Pittsburgh {{found itself in}} calm waters 900 miles from Guam. [...] "There was nothing to it from then on," [...] Gingrich recalled. Pittsburgh arrived at Guam {{five days after the}} storm and was {{equipped}} with a temporary bow, leaving two weeks later for permanent repairs at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Washington. A week after Pittsburgh departed, the ship's bow was discovered afloat and towed back to Guam. The 500-mile separation between the <b>cruiser's</b> <b>stern</b> and bow led contemporary news accounts to dub Pittsburgh [...] "the longest ship in the Navy." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1956, during Khrushchev's {{visit to}} Britain, the Soviet Sverdlov class cruiser Ordzhonikidze visited Portsmouth Harbour. The Royal Navy was {{interested}} in anti-submarine warfare equipment carried under the <b>cruiser's</b> <b>stern.</b> Elliott arranged for Crabb, an experienced ex-naval frogman, to investigate. He made one successful run under the ship, came back for an extra pound of weight for his next attempt and failed to return from the second dive. Elliott speculated in his autobiography that Crabb suffered equipment failure. Subsequent criticism of Crabb, whom Elliott {{believed to be a}} brave and honourable officer and who had undertaken successful operations of the same kind before, was resented by Elliott.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{outstanding}} pieces of salvage work performed by the Vestal was for Pensacola, heavily damaged at the Battle of Tassafaronga. A torpedo had caused such extensive damage aft that the heavy <b>cruiser's</b> <b>stern</b> was barely attached {{to the rest of}} the ship and swayed gently with the current. A few frames, some hull plating, and one propeller shaft were practically all that still held the aftermost section {{to the rest of the}} ship. As Vestals commanding officer later recounted, [...] "Never had an AR (repair ship) been presented with such a task; no records on how it should best be done were available." ...|$|R
5000|$|Three ships, Prince David, [...] and [...] {{were ordered}} in 1929 from Cammell Laird & Co. by the Canadian National Railways {{subsidiary}} CN Steamships {{to operate as}} small luxury liners on the West Coast of Canada. The specifications for all three ships had been identical: three decks, three funnels, <b>cruiser</b> <b>sterns</b> and accommodation for 300 passengers. Each had cost $2,000,000 at completion and with a speed of 22 kn, {{they were among the}} fastest ships in the Canadian registry. Prince David arrived on the West Coast in the summer of 1930 and was put on the Vancouver - Victoria - Seattle daily service.However, the decline in trade due to the Depression had made it impractical for all three ships to operate in British Columbia waters.|$|R
5000|$|On 29 April, {{the convoy}} was spotted by a German Ju-88 {{reconnaissance}} plane {{as well as}} by German U-boats. Two days after leaving Murmansk, the convoy was attacked by several U-boats. On 30 May [...] and [...] both made unsuccessful attacks on the convoy. Later that day, however, [...] fired torpedoes at Edinburgh and scored two hits. One torpedo hit the cruiser's forward boiler room while the other hit the <b>cruiser's</b> <b>stern,</b> destroying its rudder and two of its four propellers. Edinburgh was badly damaged, but still afloat. Edinburgh left the convoy and headed back towards Murmansk, escorted by Foresight and Forester. Several ships were sent from Murmansk to assist Edinburgh, among them the British minesweepers Gossamer, Harrier, Hussar, and Niger, the Soviet destroyers Gremyaschi and Sokrushitelny, the Soviet guard ship Rubin, and a tug.|$|R

50|$|The ship's {{follows the}} archetypal windjammer design, with a clipper bow and a wood-carved figurehead {{representing}} Liberty {{in a long}} flowing robe and a <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern</b> bearing the Argentine coat of arms in cast bronze.|$|E
25|$|As {{ships of}} wooden {{construction}} {{gave way to}} iron and steel, the cruiser stern—another design without transoms and known variously as the canoe stern, parabolic stern, and the double-ended stern—became the next prominent development in ship stern design, particularly in warships of {{the latter half of}} the 20th century. The intent of this re-design was to protect the steering gear by bringing it below the armor deck. The stern now came to a point rather than a flat panel or a gentle curve, and the counter reached from the sternpost all the way to the taffrail in a continuous arch. It was soon discovered that vessels with <b>cruiser</b> <b>sterns</b> experienced less water resistance when under way than those with elliptical sterns, and between World War I and World War II most merchant ship designs soon followed suit.|$|R
50|$|Mel Whitley and Robert Hammond {{designed}} the Batboat from a Glastron V-174. They added a red flashing beacon, glowing eyes, batzooka hatches, seats for both Batman and Robin {{at the front}} of the boat, twin wind screens, a center console, an outdrive jet cover, and an aft to deck cover with a glowing Bat-Signal on the tail fin. Although the boat was powered by a Merc <b>Cruiser</b> L-6 <b>stern</b> drive and Attwood Corporation manufactured the hardwire, a water squirter and a jet nozzle were added to make the Batboat look like it was nuclear-powered. It took 31 days to build.|$|R
5000|$|Simultaneously, Perry {{was working}} on what would be his {{landmark}} design, the Valiant 40. Along with Nathan Rothman and Sylvia and Stanley Dabney, he would design the first [...] "performance cruiser." [...] They all met at Benford's ferro-cement studio, but even as Perry moved to work for Dick Carter they continued to strategize about building a bluewater cruising boat like the Westsail 32 that would have better performance.Rothman contacted Uniflite, a Bellingham, Washington boat builder, and by 1974 the first Valiant rolled off their line. The design combined the classic canoe <b>stern</b> <b>cruiser</b> shape with a fin keel and skeg hung rudder instead of the traditional full keel.|$|R
50|$|When commissioned, Explorer {{was painted}} a {{brilliant}} white, with a brown deckhouse and red funnel and masts.

5000|$|A semi-traditional stern is a {{compromise}} {{to gain some}} of the [...] "social" [...] benefits of a <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern,</b> while retaining a more traditional design and providing some protection for the steerer in bad weather or in cooler seasons. As with the <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern,</b> the deck is extended back from the hatch and rear doors, {{but in this case}} most of the deck is protected at the sides by walls which extend back from the cabin sides - giving a more sheltered area for the steerer and companions, usually with lockers to sit on. The engine is located under the deck, much like a cruiser, again allowing a separation between the cabin and the engine bay, with the steps down to the cabin being located past the false sides of the [...] "semi-trad" [...] social area.|$|E
50|$|The Bloemfontein Castle {{was given}} the {{familiar}} Union-Castle profile of well-raked rounded stem, <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern,</b> a low streamlined funnel and a single mast abaft the bridge, giving a well-balanced appearance. There were two hatches forward and three aft, served by six 10-ton and four 5-ton capacity derricks. Cargo tweendeck spaces were insulated for the carriage of fruit, with certain compartments for chilled and frozen produce.|$|E
50|$|Adventure {{was built}} to replace the {{converted}} First World War veteran Princess Margaret, and her design was dictated by a requirement for a large mine capacity and a good cruising range. The mineload was to be carried completely internally, dictating a long, tall hull, and there were four sets of rails running {{the length of the}} hull to chutes at the stern. She was built with a transom, or flat, stern, to improve cruising efficiency, but the dead water caused by such a form meant that mines tended to be sucked back into the hull when they were launched; an obviously dangerous situation for a minelayer. As a result, she was rebuilt with a traditional <b>cruiser,</b> or rounded, <b>stern,</b> increasing the length by 19 ft.|$|R
6000|$|The {{men were}} {{leaning on the}} trawl capstan, while our old landlord, with half-a-dozen pipes within a foot of his face, droned out some long sea-yarn about Ostend, and muds, and snow-storms, and revenue- <b>cruisers</b> going down <b>stern</b> foremost, kegs of brandy and French prisons, which I shall not repeat; for indeed the public has been surfeited with sea-stories of late, from many {{sufficiently}} dull ones up to the genial wisdom of 'Peter Simple,' and the gorgeous word- painting of 'Tom Cringle's Log.' And now the subject is stale--the old war and the wonders thereof have died away into the past, like the men who fought in it; and Trafalgar and the Bellerophon are replaced by Manchester and 'Mary Barton.' We have solved the old sea-going problems pretty well--thanks to wise English-hearted Captain Marryat, now gone to his rest, just when his work was done; and we must turn round and face a few land-going problems not quite so easy of solution. So Claude and I thought, as we leant over the sloop's bows, listening neither to the Ostend story forwards nor the forty-stanza ballad aft, which the old steersman was moaning on, careless of listeners, to keep himself awake at the helm. Forty stanzas or so we did count from curiosity; {{the first line of}} each of which ended infallibly with ...|$|R
50|$|This {{ship was}} the first North Atlantic liner with a <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern.</b> The vessel was built by William Beardmore & Co Ltd. at Glasgow. She was an 18,481 gross tonnage ship, length 571.4 ft x beam 72.4 ft, two funnels, two masts, four {{propellers}} and a speed of 18 knots. Her initial configuration provided accommodation for 287 1st class, 504 2nd class and 848 3rd class passengers.|$|E

50|$|The C1-B {{cargo ships}} were {{constructed}} with flush full scantling type decks having a raked stem and <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern.</b> Two complete steel decks, the main and second decks, were fitted {{and a third}} deck was fitted below the second deck extending from the stem to the forward machinery space bulkhead. The double bottom extended from the forward collision bulkhead to the after collision bulkhead. Two 28-foot lifeboats, with a capacity of 60 persons each, were stowed under mechanical davits on the bridge deck.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} {{preceding}} class, the fleet {{found that the}} tapered <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern,</b> which made for a nice depth charge deployment feature, dug {{into the water and}} increased the turning radius, thus hampering anti-submarine work. While an increased rudder size helped, the answer would be in a redesigned stern, but this was not implemented. They were reported to be prone to heavy rolling in light load conditions. [...] The flush deck gave the hull great strength but this also made the deck very wet.|$|E

50|$|Several sets {{of plans}} for the ships design were {{produced}} by Harland and Wolff for Oceanic between 1926 and 1928. The first set showed a 900 ft-long four-funnel liner. The second set drawn in 1927 showed a 935 feet long and 100 feet wide liner with three funnels. It was roughly {{the same size as}} Europa and Bremen. The third set showed the current 1,050 ft design with three funnels and <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern</b> typical of liners being built in the mid to late 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{specifications}} {{called for}} a five-hold steel cargo ship with raked stem and <b>cruiser</b> <b>stern,</b> complete shelter and second decks, and a third deck in Nos. 1-4 holds. Dimensions of the hatches were 20 ft × 30 ft, except for No. 2, which was 20 ft × 50 ft, allowing such cargo as locomotives, naval guns, long bars, etc. Ventilation to the holds was provided by hollow kingposts, which also served as cargo masts. Cargo handling gear consisted of fourteen 5-ton cargo booms, plus two 30-ton booms at Nos. 3 and 4 hatches.|$|E
