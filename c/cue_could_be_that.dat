40|$|Although {{restrained}} eaters try {{to limit}} their food intake, they often fail and indulge in exactly those foods {{that they want to}} avoid. A possible explanation is a temporal attentional bias for food <b>cues.</b> It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> for these people food stimuli are processed relatively efficiently and require less attentional resources to enter awareness. Once a food stimulus has captured attention, it may be preferentially processed and granted prioritized access to limited cognitive resources. This might help explain why restrained eaters often fail in their attempts to restrict their food intake. A Rapid Serial Visual Presentation task consisting of dual and single target trials with food and neutral pictures as targets and/or distractors was administered to restrained (n = 40) and unrestrained (n = 40) eaters to study temporal attentional bias. Results indicated that (1) food cues did not diminish the attentional blink in restrained eaters when presented as second target; (2) specifically restrained eaters showed an interference effect of identifying food targets on the identification of preceding neutral targets', (3) for both restrained and unrestrained eaters, food cues enhanced the attentional blink; (4) specifically in restrained eaters, food distractors elicited an attention blink in the single target trials. In restrained eaters, food cues get prioritized access to limited cognitive resources, even if this processing priority interferes with their current goals. This temporal attentional bias for food stimuli might help explain why restrained eaters typically have difficulties maintaining their diet rules. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Object {{recognition}} was {{studied in}} human subjects {{to determine whether}} the storage of the visual objects was in a two-dimensional or a three-dimensional representation. Novel motionbased and disparity-based stimuli were generated in which three-dimensional and two-dimensional form <b>cues</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> manipulated independently. Subjects were required to generate internal representations from motion stimuli that lacked explicit two-dimensional cues. These stored internal representations were then matched against internal three-dimensional representations constructed from disparity stimuli. These new stimuli were used to confirm prior studies that indicated the primacy of two-dimensional cues for view-based object storage. However, under tightly controlled conditions for which only three-dimensional cues were available, human subjects were also able to match an internal representation derived from motion to that of disparity. This last finding suggests <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> an internal storage of an object's representations in three dimensions, a tenet <b>that</b> has <b>been</b> rejected by view-based theories. Thus, any complete theory of object recognition <b>that</b> <b>is</b> based on primate vision must incorporate three-dimensional stored representations. ...|$|R

Women using oral contraceptives showed weaker facial and vocal masculinity preferences and weaker associations between masculinity preferences across modalities than women not using oral contraceptives.

The experiment showed that within-compound associations had formed between the geometry and landmarks, and that representations of absent geometric <b>cues</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> evoked via presentation of the landmark cues alone. We argue that these evoked representations of the absent geometry cues can counteract any overshadowing of the landmark by geometry cues, and may sometimes result in potentiation. The results of this study do not support theories of cue-competition failure based on independent cue processing, but remain readily explicable by appeal to an account based on within-compound associations...|$|R

Decision strategies were analyzed using a maximum-likelihood strategy classification method, taking into account choices, response times and confidence ratings simultaneously.

If so, brain activation patterns for /da/ should be more unique when the syllable is presented at the /da/ biasing (i. e. its "preferred") phase. To test this hypothesis we presented non-ambiguous /da/ and /ga/ syllables at either their preferred or non-preferred phase (using sensory entrainment) while measuring 7 T fMRI. Using multivariate pattern analysis in auditory regions we show that syllable decoding performance is higher when syllables are presented at their preferred compared to their non-preferred phase. These results suggest that phase information increases the distinctiveness of /da/ and /ga/ brain activation patterns...|$|R
