Unobtrusive, naturalistic observation is used to identify, categorise and evaluate the behaviour of <b>customers</b> on other <b>customers</b> across two empirical studies. In total 242 episodes were observed and analysed from 40 separate observation sessions, ranging from 60 to 150 min across three settings. A third study, comprised of four focus groups explores the why of the observed behaviours of Studies 1 and 2, and supports their key findings. Our findings show {{not only that the}} presence of <b>customers</b> influences the duration of the stay (social influence) of other <b>customers,</b> but also that <b>customers</b> influence other <b>customers</b> spatially (spatial influence). Specifically, individual <b>customers</b> and couples chose to be spatially close to other <b>customers</b> present for non-business meetings. Conversely, for business meetings <b>customers</b> tend to choose to be spatially apart from other <b>customers.</b> Managers and service personnel need to understand that <b>customers</b> influence other <b>customers</b> present even when there is no direct contact. First, service providers should recognise the occasion (business/social) and nature of the party (single/couples/group). Second, <b>customers</b> like to be spatially near other <b>customers</b> when they are on their own or as a couple and when they are there for a social, rather than business, occasion.
