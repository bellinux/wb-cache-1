25|$|When the sender's job was complete, it {{connected}} the talk {{path from the}} originating to the terminating side, and {{dropped out of the}} call, thus being idle for accepting the next caller. A comparatively small number of senders could handle a large amount of traffic, as each was only used for a short duration during <b>call</b> <b>setup.</b> This principle became known as common control, and was used in all subsequent switching systems.|$|E
2500|$|Mobile phones {{can be used}} in {{countries}} with different emergency numbers. This means that a traveller visiting a foreign country does not have to know the local emergency numbers. The mobile phone and the SIM card have a preprogrammed list of emergency numbers. When the user tries to set up a call using an emergency number known by a GSM or 3G phone, the special emergency <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> takes place. The actual number is not even transmitted into the network, but the network redirects the emergency call to the local emergency desk. [...] Most GSM mobile phones can dial emergency numbers even when the phone keyboard is locked, the phone is without a SIM card, emergency number is entered instead of the PIN or there isn't a network signal (busy network).|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that Fido systems were generally clustered – of the 15 systems running {{by the start of}} June 1984, 5 of them were in St. Louis. [...] A user on Jennings's system in San Francisco that addressed emails to different systems in St. Louis would cause calls to be made to each of those BBSes in turn. [...] Local calls were normally free or charged at a low rate. [...] Additionally, the initial <b>call</b> <b>setup,</b> generally the first minute of the call, was normally billed at a higher rate than continuing an existing connection. Therefore, it would make sense to deliver all the messages from all the users in San Francisco to all of the users in St. Louis in a single call. Packets were generally small enough to be delivered within a minute or two, so delivering all the messages in a single call could greatly reduce costs by avoiding multiple first-minute charges. Once delivered, the packet would be broken out into separate packets for local systems, and delivered using multiple local free calls.|$|E

50|$|In {{telecommunications}} a {{call attempt}} invokes a <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> procedure, which, if successful, {{results in a}} connected call. A <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> procedure may fail due {{to a number of}} technical reasons. Such calls are classified as failed call attempts. In many practical cases this definition needs to be further expanded with a number of detailed specifications describing which calls exactly are counted as successfully set up and which not. This is determined to a great degree by the stage of the <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> procedure at which a call is counted as connected. In modern telecommunication systems, such as cellular (mobile) networks, the <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> procedure maybe very complex and the point at which a call is considered successfully connected may be defined in a number of ways, thus influencing the way the <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> success rate is calculated. If a call is connected successfully but the dialled number is busy, the call is counted as successful.|$|E

In mobile communication systems using radio channels the <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> success rate is lower and may range for commercial networks between 90% and 98% or higher. The {{main reasons for}} unsuccessful call setups in mobile networks are lack of radio coverage (either in the downlink or the uplink), radio interference between different subscribers, imperfections in {{the functioning of the}} network (such as failed <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> redirect procedures), overload of the different elements of the network (such as cells), etc.|$|E

40|$|Past {{and current}} campus data {{networks}} generally utilize connection-less network layer protocols like IP. Future networks {{are expected to}} use ATM which provides a connection-oriented service. New ATM switches are coming to market with baseline parameters such {{as the number of}} concurrent SVC's supported and the number of <b>call</b> <b>setups</b> possible per second. These parameters will determine the usefulness of this equipment in large campus networks for current applications and topologies. We present an analysis of the effect of these parameters on the ability of a circuit-based network to support the networking requirements of a college campus. We performed this analysis using IP traffic logs from three distinct networks within our campus. We consider four different ATM deployment scenarios and two circuit replacement algorithms. From our analysis we derive expected requirements for SVC setup rates and hold times necessary to support the measured traffic. College of Computing Georgia Institute [...] ...|$|R
