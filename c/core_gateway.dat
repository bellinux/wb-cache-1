With them, parallel clustering mechanism is used to faster the computation time of data access with minimal cost. But, this mechanism is not feasible for efficient data retrieve over cloud environment and is not provided with fault tolerant design. The proposed paper attempts to develop data scalability in a cloud environment by implementing Cloud based Gateway Clustering (CBGC) mechanism with fault tolerant design. The Client accesses {{the data from the}} cloud using Cloud core storage gateway, which is an API. This paper proposes a <b>core</b> <b>gateway</b> which is divided into multiple sub virtual gateways to improve the data access speed. Also an enhanced Gateway Cut Detection (GCD) Algorithm is proposed to detect and recover sub-gateway failures and make sub- gateways to be available throughout the communication.

40|$|AbstractThis paper applies {{equilibrium}} {{analysis in}} micro-economics to analyze a stable structure {{in a model}} of human society. The structure is observed {{in the study of}} the distribution of information. It forms a three-layered hierarchy. These layers are called brains, gatekeepers and end users. The three-layer structure is widely observed in a variety of research fields. For example, in computer networks, <b>core</b> <b>gateways</b> correspond to brains, stub gateways behave like gatekeepers, and local networks are end users. The three-layer model is considered to be an essential extension of the popular “client-server” concept in computer science. This paper calculates the supply and demand curves in micro-economics to show how the equilibrium is established. The law of diminishing utility is utilized to represent the distribution of information or knowledge. The calculations are straightforward if the dependence of the end users on the other layers is taken into account. The results can explain many properties of the three-layer model...|$|R

40|$|The label {{switching}} forwarding mechanism, {{which was}} derived from the connection oriented ATM protocol, is currently being applied to IP networks. Use of this mechanism brings significant advantages in terms of simplifying forwarding decisions as well as enabling implementation of comprehensive traffic engineering mechanisms. Label switching simplifies forwarding by replacing the longest-match prefix search algorithms with a simple lookup table. This thesis concentrates on examining the use of label switching techniques for scalable best effort unicast forwarding. Most label switching protocols are capable of operating over cell based switched networks such as ATM, and we constrain this thesis to examining this case. In essence w e examine the implementation of label switching techniques in an Internet wide environment. The aim of this work is to examine ways of maximizing the percentage of packets following label switched paths and therefore reducing the number of packets that require traditional IP forwarding. We concentrate on core Internet routers. There is a significant body of literature proposing and examining implementations several label switching approaches such as: Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), IP Switching, IP Navigator, Aggregate Route Based IP Switching, and Tag Switching. W e present an extensive literature survey. In addition we present a comprehensive classification of label switching techniques to provide scalable best effort IP forwarding in the Internet. From this work we isolate several areas of work for further consideration. Specifically, these areas concern the use of label switching forwarding in future IP networks including: an IP version 6 environment with highly aggregated routing tables; use of label switching in conjunction with congestion sensitive routing; and an optically switched network. The examination of label switching in hierarchical networks examines the impact a high level of IP routing table aggregation that will be associated with IP version 6. We show that the popular MPLS best effort forwarding mechanism will perform poorly in this environment and will require a high level of forwarding in <b>core</b> <b>gateway</b> routers. We propose and examine the performance of a hybrid label switching protocol, called Destination Site Label Switching (DSLS), which performs well in this environment. W e show using traffic traces that the network layer forwarding requirement of DSLS can be reduced to below 0. 2...|$|E

40|$|International audienceParalleling the {{increasing}} traffic {{and the associated}} degradation of services in operators' networks, {{there have been numerous}} research initiatives to explore potential solutions to better optimize network resources and maintain a high quality of experience (QoE) for subscribers. Although several possible solutions do exist, the focus {{of this paper is to}} survey one specific emerging family of solutions, called offload. Offloading's primary goal is to avoid transporting low priority traffic in costly networks in order to avoid degrading the perceived QoE. In particular, mobile operators target traffics that cause network congestion without creating any additional revenue. Offloading is based on traffic redirection from parts of the network where congestion could occur to other low-cost parts of the network where capacity is available and less expensive. In this paper, we present a survey on the offload approaches at different parts of the global network (access, <b>core,</b> and <b>gateway).</b> The aim of these approaches is to help mobile operators to face challenges such as capacity crunch, radio access saturation, average revenues per user decrease, and lack of indoor coverage...|$|R

In applications where end-hosts of a network seek anonymity, the communication between such hosts behind secured gateways are supported by a heterogeneous, mixed wired/wireless network <b>core.</b> The secured <b>gateway</b> fully encrypts and anonymizes all data packets sent through the network core. While attacks on data itself is possible via crypt-analysis, real-time intrusion detection by studying packet header information is not possible as these packets are fully encrypted.

40|$|Abstract—Today the {{construction}} of wireless sensing systems {{requires the use of}} rather high-priced pieces of hardware and the assembly of these hardware parts (wireless transmission <b>core,</b> sensor module, <b>gateway</b> device), as well as the implementation of the according software (sensor mote software, gateway software, end user software).

30|$|Solar [25] is a {{middleware}} for {{ubiquitous computing}} {{that was designed}} to be scalable in the set of communicating nodes and is based on a self-organising P 2 P (Peer-to-Peer) overlay network. Solar employs a specific programming model called filter-and-pipe, where each component (filter) has a set of entry and exit ports and there may be data producers (sources) and consumers (sinks). In the Solar architecture, each node is considered a planet (that may have a number of “satellite nodes”), and the more nodes are used, the more scalable the system is. This middleware uses two transport protocols, DHT Pastry (Distributed Hash Table), for Discovery and routing, and TCP, for “inter-planetary communication”. Unlike SDDL, which uses the DDS-based <b>core</b> (and the <b>Gateways),</b> to ensure real-time and reliable delivery of data to and from the mobiles, Solar is based on DHT and TCP, which are not suited to mobile networks (TCP) and to low-latency message routing and delivery (DHT).|$|R

40|$|Modern {{researches}} {{in field}} of mobile network depend on network infrastructure {{in a specific}} region. Nowadays, the actual issue is reforming of the existing frequency range for LTE deployment. The most common band is 900 / 1800 MHz, which in usual licensed for the GSM networks. It known that LTE net-work core can be easily integrated with the existing GSM infrastructure. The convergent base stations had been already known which can operate with GSM/LTE/WCDMA simultaneously. Therefore, the urgent task is implementation of radio interface based on spectrum sensing between different technologies in the same band. This work is devoted to building effective frequency planning networks for LTE technology on the existing GSM band. While making frequency planning of LTE technology, we {{take into account the}} presence coverage of existing GSM network. Thus, we consider two different methods of frequency planning: soft and fractional. Both of these methods of frequency reuse well described in LTE. In both cases, the whole frequency band divided into two groups. One of them used by the subscribers located inside the cell as well as on it edges, the other – only in-side the cell. Deploying LTE coverage on GSM spectrum may arise the situation when operating frequencies of GSM base station can fully interfere with one of the LTE bands. We propose modified method of soft frequency re-use, which lies in exception of conflict bands from an inside-cell frequency band. At the border of the cell, we propose to use coordinated service that is providing service to the subscriber by multiple base stations, in order to achieve higher throughput. This technology lies in synchronizing multiple base stations in time and frequency in their interaction via optical channel. Using a joint processing method, we obtain a significant increase in throughput at the border of the cell, which compensates some drawbacks of the soft frequency reuse method. One of the options for deploying LTE network is construction of a common network between several operators. It is a widespread practice these days and leads to the solution for a number of problems, which are connected, in particular, to the lack of spectrum for 3 rd and 4 th generation networks deployment. Given the global experience, we consider the following model of cooperation between operators: two or more operators carry out reforming of their own bands to release continuous frequency band, merging of which forms a common frequency band. From the set of architectural solutions, we chose two models in which we will be interested. <b>Gateway</b> <b>Core</b> Network – main principal of which lies in closer interaction in a network control segment and allows to install shared mobility management entities as well as common radio access network. Multi Operator Core Network – uses separate MME modules, which, in comparison to GWCN, allows to de-crease amount of service traffic in transport network and to simplify the setup of each core network. According to Ukrainian circumstances and the need of CAPEX reducing in the initial stage we propose to use a GWCN model. Проаналізовано використання нових методів повторного використання частот.

40|$|The urban {{landscape}} is an interspersed mixing of residences, shops, theaters, parks, natural areas, and {{a multitude of}} other uses. From {{the early days of}} the central markets, to the planned downtown, to the heavily planned super-regional shopping complexes, commercial landscapes evolve. There has been considerable research conducted on analyzing the commercial structure of urban environments in an attempt to better understanding the nature of retailing and its resultant impacts on the geography of the city. This research has three broad goals: a) to develop a technique that makes operational, in a systematized and objective manner, an approach to analyzing the structure of the commercial environment; b) to apply the approach within a GIS environment, and; c) to develop a generalized typology of urban commercial structure. The systematized analysis is a series of guidelines and statistics which can be applied in an objective manner. The development of the nearest commercial neighbor as a statistical measure of proximity to other commercial operations was the foundation of the approach to clustering commercial operations in to retail areas. To achieve the overall goals, three census metropolitan environments (Sudbury, Kitchener and Ottawa) were used as study areas. These cities represent small, medium and large census metropolitan environments, respectively, within Canada. Commercial locations for each city were extracted from a national database of locations and mapped in a GIS environment. For each study area, the nearest commercial neighbor values were generated and the appropriate statistics extracted. Commercial clusters were generated by using the average nearest commercial neighbor value and multiples of the median commercial neighbor value. These nearest neighbor and median values were inputted into a buffering routine as the buffer size. The resulting clusters were then compared to ortho-imagery and in the case of Kitchener, land use planning documents. Two approaches for cluster generation were employed; 1) Point-only where all individual addresses were used on the clustering, and; 2) Point plus Polygon where those commercial operations that existed within polygons (malls and central business districts) were removed from the dataset, the remaining points were then clusters and the polygons added back to the results. Finally the results from both clustering approaches were compared to land use parcels to assess accuracies of the technique. The results indicated that the overall method proposed was effective in determining commercial zones, and that the 2 x iteration of the median nearest commercial neighbor technique yielded the most accurate results. Moreover, three main conclusions were drawn. The first was that there was a difference, and in some cases significant differences, between the land use planned commercial areas and areas that have grown larger through agglomeration. Secondly, there are density variations between core and suburban areas that, at times, resulted in a larger definition of a commercial area within the core because the lesser dense suburban areas having an impact on the nearest commercial neighbor values. Thirdly, there was considerable over-capturing of commercial areas when the buffer multiples were greater than 3 x. In addition, the point plus polygon clustering technique indicated that while the defined areas were more accurate when the polygons were used, it was only in areas where those polygons were the main commercial cluster. In mixed areas, there was no discernable advantage to using the polygons. Furthermore, the removal of points had a strong impact of the nearest commercial neighbor values generated. Lastly, when dealing with polygons, the geographic arrangement of the commercial type became important. Based on the findings of the commercial zone analysis, a typology of commercial development was detailed. This typology contained three main geographic components, namely the <b>core,</b> suburb and <b>gateway</b> areas of the urban environment. Within each geographic location, a series of commercial forms were identified. This new typology allowed for the inclusion of historical remnants of landscapes and consequently allows for a comparison against older typologies. The typology employed a three part urban classification system which is applicable to any type of urban environment and, finally, the focus on geographic form removes the impact of store changes and the changes in the nature of commercial zones over time. This research has operationalized a systematic and replicable method of examining urban commercial location data for the purpose of determining commercial structure. This technique can be applied to future datasets easily and objectively allowing for a readily updatable typology; thus rendering it less static than previous typologies. It is the use of the technology, namely GIS, that adds this dynamism to the analyses. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the potential exists for using GIS to analyze commercial location data. This research has contributed to this evolution by analyzing the geography of commercial development during a snapshot in time. However, by developing a series of operational and repeatable techniques that focus on the geographical organization of commercial locations, it is hoped that the results will function as the conceptual and practical framework for commercial structural analysis of urban environments for future studies...|$|R
