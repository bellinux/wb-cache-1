500|$|In 2013, Khan {{appeared}} in three films, the first being Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola, a political satire {{set in the}} rustic surroundings of a village in Haryana. Co-starring with Pankaj Kapur, Anushka Sharma and Shabana Azmi, Khan played Hukum Singh Matru, an educated community activist and Kapur's right-hand man. To prepare for the role, he lived in Delhi for three months and learned to speak Haryanvi from theatre group Act One. The film (and his performance) generated mixed reviews from critics, and its eventual box-office profit was poor. Reuters Shilpa Jamkhandikar wrote, [...] "Imran Khan goes {{red in the face}} trying to muster up a Haryanvi accent and act tough. You <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the effort in his acting and that's why it jars all the more." [...] Subhash K Jha described it as a good effort, at best. Khan also sang for the film's soundtrack in [...] "Chaar Dina Ki".|$|E
500|$|The team {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} anime elements for the game's animation. Inafune explained, [...] " [...] hand transforms into {{a gun and}} you <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> it {{come out of his}} arm. We {{wanted to make sure that}} the animation and the motion was realistic and actually made sense. So with Mega Man, we had this perfect blending of game character with animation ideas." [...] The gameplay for Mega Man was inspired by the game rock-paper-scissors. The project supervisor wanted a simple system that offered [...] "deep gameplay". Each weapon deals a large amount of damage to one specific Robot Master, others have little to no effect against them, and there is no single weapon that dominates all the others. Mega Man was originally able to crouch, but the team decided against it since it made players' ability to determine the height of onscreen projectiles more difficult. Naoya Tomita (credited as [...] "Tom Pon") began work on the Mega Mans scenic backgrounds immediately after his Capcom training. Tomita proved himself amongst his peers by overcoming the challenges of the console's limited power through maximizing the use of background elements.|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with several}} critics particularly complimenting the [...] "Swanson Pyramid of Greatness" [...] joke. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said the episode {{was effective in}} appealing to both new and old viewers, developing various character subplots and establishing the harvest festival story arc. He also praised the performances of Chris and Ann, which he called a far better and more interesting pairing than Ann with Mark Brendanawicz. Linda Holmes of NPR suggested the season premiere {{was a good place}} for newcomers to the series to start watching. She said all the characters were funny and the two new cast members had been seamlessly integrated into the show. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik called the episode an [...] "excellent start" [...] to the season, and said the harvest festival subplot would help better focus the series by giving the characters a single goal. Poniewozki said it also [...] "reminds us that the show is about something: the idea, maybe quaint-seeming in this political climate, that civil servants <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> themselves as servants and work in their community's interest". Damian Holbrook of TV Guide said [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] was an improvement on an already strong second season, claiming [...] "the comedy seemed snappier, the relationships better grounded and the ensemble cast at their best." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{what good}} do the aphides {{themselves}} {{derive from the}} power of secreting honey-dew? For we know now that no animal or plant is ever provided with any organ or part merely {{for the benefit of}} another creature: the advantage must at least be mutual. Well, in the first place, it is likely that, in any case, the amount of sugary matter in the food of the aphides is quite in excess of their needs; they assimilate the nitrogenous material of the sap, and secrete its saccharine material as honey-dew. That, however, would hardly account for the development of special secretory ducts, like the honey-tubes, in which you <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the little drops of honey rolling, under the microscope. But the ants are useful allies to the aphides, in guarding them from another very dangerous type of insect. They are subject to the attacks of an ichneumon fly, which lays its eggs in them, meaning its larvæ to feed upon their living bodies; and the ants watch over the aphides with the greatest vigilance, driving off the ichneumons whenever they approach their little protégés.|$|E

5000|$|The aerial {{cableway}} from Flims onto Cassonsgrat {{takes you to}} the tear-off edge of the landslide. There is various hikes to this ridge as well.

60|$|There {{is another}} and equally curious branch of our subject; namely, serial homologies, or the {{comparison}} of the different parts or organs in the same individual, and not of the same parts or organs in different {{members of the same}} class. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous--that is, correspond in number and in relative connexion--with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in all the higher vertebrate classes are plainly homologous. So it is with the wonderfully complex jaws and legs of crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see,</b> during the early or embryonic stages of development in flowers, as well as in crustaceans and many other animals, that organs, which when mature become extremely different are at first exactly alike.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the lower}} corner {{of this great}} picture, at the right hand of the spectator, is a hideous figure of a damned person, girdled about with a serpent, the folds of which are {{carefully}} knotted between his thighs, so as, at all events, to give no offence to decency. This figure represents a man who suggested to Pope Paul III. that the nudities of the [...] "Last Judgment" [...] ought to be draped, for which offence Michael Angelo at once consigned him to hell. It shows what a debtor's prison and dungeon of private torment men would make of hell {{if they had the}} control of it. As to the nudities, if they were ever more nude than now, I should suppose, in their fresh brilliancy, they might well have startled a not very squeamish eye. The effect, such as it is, of this picture, is much injured by the high altar and its canopy, which stands close against the wall, and intercepts a considerable portion of the sprawl of nakedness with which Michael Angelo has filled his sky. However, I am not unwilling to believe, with faith beyond what I <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see,</b> that the greatest pictorial miracles ever yet achieved have been wrought upon the walls and ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.|$|E
60|$|That {{the central}} glands, if irritated, send {{centrifugally}} some influence to the exterior glands, {{causing them to}} send back a centripetal influence inducing aggregation, {{is perhaps the most}} interesting fact given in this chapter. But the whole process of aggregation is in itself a striking phenomenon. Whenever the peripheral extremity of a nerve is touched or pressed, and a sensation is felt, it is believed that an invisible molecular change is sent {{from one end of the}} nerve to the other; but when a gland of Drosera is repeatedly touched or gently pressed, we <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> a molecular change proceeding from the gland down the tentacle; though this change is probably of a very different nature from that in a nerve. Finally, as so many and such widely different causes excite aggregation, it would appear that the living matter within the gland-cells is in so unstable a condition that almost any disturbance suffices to change its molecular nature, as in the case of certain chemical compounds. And this change in the glands, whether excited directly, or indirectly by a stimulus received from other glands, is transmitted from cell to cell, causing granules of protoplasm either to be actually generated in the previously limpid fluid or to coalesce and thus to become visible.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth.

From this definition, the h-index applies in general trees of depth 3 and <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> be <b>seen</b> as a {{modified}} version of the Extended Strahler numbers. In this modification, a root node (e.g. an author) does not increase value from his maximum valuated nodes, but instead gets weighted by the maximum Extended Strahler number of his direct descendants (i.e. the publications).|$|R
5000|$|Because IRVR is not derived using human observers, {{the values}} {{obtained}} {{are not a}} reliable guide to what a pilot <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> expect to <b>see.</b> This can easily be demonstrated {{by the fact that}} when obscuration such as fog is variable, different values can apply simultaneously at the same physical point.|$|R
60|$|I have {{a drawing}} here, sketched {{many years ago}} by Hooker, {{when he made his}} investigations. It is the drawing of the flame of a lamp, but it will apply to the flame of a candle. The cup of the candle is the vessel or lamp, the melted {{spermaceti}} is the oil, and the wick is common to both. Upon that he sets this little flame, and then he represents what is true--a certain quantity of matter rising about it which you do not see, and which, if you have not been here before, or are not familiar with the subject, you will not know of. He has here represented the parts of the surrounding atmosphere that are very essential to the flame, and that are always present with it. There is a current formed, which draws the flame out--for the flame which you see is really drawn out by the current, and drawn upward to a great height--just as Hooker has here shewn you by that prolongation of the current in the diagram. You may see this by taking a lighted candle, and putting it in the sun so as to get its shadow thrown on a piece of paper. How remarkable it is that that thing which is light enough to produce shadows of other objects, can be made to throw its own shadow on a piece of white paper or card, so that you <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> streaming round the flame something which {{is not part of the}} flame, but is ascending and drawing the flame upwards. Now, I am going to imitate the sunlight, by applying the voltaic battery to the electric lamp. You now see our sun, and its great luminosity; and by placing a candle between it and the screen, we get the shadow of the flame.|$|E

But the photo is misleading: only two of the Flames are visible, partially obscured, and it was clearly taken at the Apollo Theater in New York City, not at the Royal. The Flames are pictured with Brown on the original album insert's liner notes, and are included with Brown in the album's intro.|$|R
50|$|The word ‘Ilam’ {{comprises}} two words-‘I’ and ‘Lam’. In Limbu language, {{the word}} ‘I’ means ‘winding’ and ‘lam’ denotes to the way.

As a heavenly (atmospheric) deity Perkūnas, apparently, is the assistant and executor of Dievas‘s will. However, Perkūnas tends to surpass Dievas, deus otiosus, because he <b>can</b> be <b>actually</b> <b>seen</b> and has defined mythological functions. Perkūnas is pictured as middle-aged, armed with an axe and arrows, riding a two-wheeled chariot harnessed with goats, like Thor.|$|R

50|$|Night of the Living Dead 3D or Night of the Living DE3D is a 2006 horror film made in 3D. It is {{the second}} remake of the 1968 horror classic Night of the Living Dead. The first remake was {{released}} in 1990 and was directed by Tom Savini from a revised screenplay by George A. Romero. Unlike the first remake, no one involved with the original is involved with this version.
