40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s, then President Bush visited Krakow, Poland. The terrible air quality theremotivated him to {{initiate}} a USAID-funded program, managed by DOE, entitled �Krakow Clean Fossil Fuels and Energy Efficiency Program. � The primary objective of this program was to encourage the formation of commercial ventures between U. S. and Polish firms to provide equipment and/or services to reduce pollution from low-emission sources in Krakow, Poland. This program led to the award {{of a number of}} cooperative agreements, including one to Control Techtronics International. The technical objective of CTI�s cooperative agreement is to apply <b>combustion</b> <b>controls</b> to existing boiler plants in Krakow and transfer knowledge and technology through a joint U. S. and Polish commercial venture. CTI installed automatic <b>combustion</b> <b>controls</b> on five coal boilers for the district heating system in Krakow. Three of these were for domestic hot-water boilers, and two were for steam for industrial boilers. The following results have occurred due to the addition of CTI�s <b>combustion</b> <b>controls</b> on these five existing boilers: ! 25 % energy savings ! 85 % reduction in particulate emissions The joint venture company CTI-Polska was then established. Eleven additional technical and costing proposals were initiated to upgrade other coal boilers in Krakow. To date, no co-financing has been made available on the Polish side. CTI-Polska continues in operation, serving customers in Russia and Ukraine.

50|$|A {{comprehensive}} makeover for the VK Black {{engine was}} completely dropped {{in favour of}} an imported 3.0-litre RB30E straight-six unit designed and manufactured by Nissan in Japan. This featured an overhead camshaft (OHC) and an alloy cylinder head. The reason for the Nissan-Holden combination was because all cars manufactured in Australia from 1 January 1986 had to run on unleaded 91 octane fuel. The previous six-cylinder Black motor was unable to do this, as was the V8, hence the later release date of this engine. As the tooling for the Holden straight-six engine had become worn by this stage, it also was not considered cost-effective to adapt the design to unleaded petrol. The new engines included features such as an Electronic <b>Combustion</b> <b>Control</b> System (ECCS) and a ram-tuned intake manifold.|$|E

It was used in Japan on Toyota Carina T150 replacing the TTC-V (Vortex) exhaust gas recirculation approach used earlier, Toyota Corolla E80, and Toyota Sprinter. The lean mixture sensor was provided in the exhaust system to detect air-fuel ratios leaner than the theoretical air-fuel ratio. The fuel injection volume was then accurately controlled by a computer using this detection signal to achieve lean air-fuel ratio feedback.For optimal combustion, the following items were applied: program independent injection that accurately changed the injection volume and timing for individual cylinders, platinum plugs for improving ignition performance with lean mixtures, and high performance igniters.|$|E
