5000|$|In {{addition}} to interconnecting the supergrid system, the West Burton 400 kV substation also feeds {{into the local}} 132 kV network. This connection is made via two 240 MVA, 400/132 kV auto-transformers manufactured by Associated Electrical Industries. The windings consists of a tertiary winding, a common, a tapping and a series winding. They are arranged so that the helical single layer tertiary winding is nearest the core, the continuous disc <b>common</b> <b>winding</b> next, followed by the interleaved full-length helical type tapping winding and the multi-layer type series winding and line shield. A continuously transposed conductor was used to minimise eddy current losses and reduce the space requirement of the windings. High speed resistor tap changers are provided on the 132 kV side of each transformer, giving a tapping range of plus 15% to minus 5%. The tapping winding has 7 taps which {{in conjunction with a}} buck/boost switch provide fourteen steps. The fixed contacts of each of the two rotary tap selector units associated with each phase are connected to one half of the tappings from the windings while the moving contacts are connected to the diverter switches. The diverter switch assembly, together with the transition resistors and operating mechanism is mounted on top of the 132 kV bushing which forms {{an integral part of the}} tap changer. Erection of the transformer was carried out inside a translucent plastic dome, inflated by a small blower. This allowed the work to continue regardless of the weather and thus reduced the time normally taken for erecting large transformers in the open. By working day and night within the plastic dome the time for erection on site was reduced from an estimated 8 weeks to 3 weeks. Completely assembled, each transformer is 14.94 m (49 ft) long, 10.06 m (33 ft) wide, and weighs 325.1 tonnes (320 tons) made up of 154.4 tonnes (152 tons) of steel, 30.48 tonnes (30 tons) of copper, and 19.3 tonnes (19 tons) of insulation and 98,420 litres (26,000 gallons) of oil.

40|$|In Modern {{power system}} the Power {{transformer}} {{is one of}} the most costly equipment installed in power system. Power transformers are designed to withstand a variety of stresses and mechanical forces during their service life. Abnormal forces generated during short-circuit event (occurring near to a transformer) is the main reason behind the deformation of winding and core. Hence, special care to be taken during installation of a new power transformer in an electrical substation. Studies Shows several winding deformations, which includes tilting and bending of conductors and inter-disc fault. These three faults are examined in terms of their severity of damage and location of the fault. Statistical analysis is applied to determine the overall condition of the winding. In order to contribute to diagnose these faults sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA) is a powerful and highly sensitive diagnostic method of measurement on several <b>common</b> <b>winding</b> deformations including winding deformations and displacements, shorted turns and open windings, loosened or broken clamping structures, core connection problems, partial winding collapse, faulty core grounding, core movements and hoop buckling and explores a new potential diagnostic scheme of FRA Moreover, because FRA relies on graphical analysis, it needs an expert person to analyze the results as so far, there is no standard code for FRA interpretation worldwide. To provide such a reference curve, some manufacturers now carry out SFRA tests on all new transformers before they are dispatched to site. But FRA results are graphical in nature and require trained experts to interpret test results. The work reported discusses numerical-criteria based evaluation techniques. Persons not familiar with interpreting the FRA results can apply the evaluation criteria. The various criteria help in deriving proper conclusions. By evaluating Correlation Coefficient (CC),Standard Deviation (SD) and Absolute Sum of Logarithmic Error(ASLE),Comparative Standard Deviation (CSD),Absolute Difference (AD), Min Max Ration (MM), Mean Square Error (MSE) it is possible to discriminate between defective and non-defective windings vi easily.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years the number of {{renewable}} energy installations has shown a strong increase rate. Due to the ambition to close down fossil and nuclear power plants, this rate of increase is not expected to decline during the coming decades. In particular, wind energy represents one of the most dominant renewable energy sources. Due to the fact that wind energy has become such an important source of electric power, stable operation as well as high availability is needed. With the increasing amount of installations and the increase in power ratings of the single turbines, the task of maximizing the operational time of the wind turbine is more and more important {{in order to reduce the}} cost of energy. Under this scenario, early detection of fault conditions can be important to minimize the damage and therefore reduce the downtime of the wind turbine. It is therefore important to understand the behavior of the faulty component, both in order to limit the damage, but also to be able to more efficiently detect the fault. This work presents a system model of the electrical parts of a full power converter wind turbine with a permanent magnet synchronous machine as generators. The system model is modular based, where each sub-system can be replaced by a model of a faulty component in order to study its impact on a system level. Statistics has shown that faults occur in all of the different sub-systems of the turbine, not only in the electrical parts. However, generator faults are among the most common wind turbine component to fail, and in addition it is a costly and time consuming component to replace. This work presents an analytical model of a permanent magnet synchronous machine with a turn-to-turn fault, which is the most <b>common</b> <b>winding</b> fault. There are other works available in this subject, however there is little information regarding how to detect a turn-to-turn fault. The derived analytical model of the faulty machine is verified using a finite element model. In order to simulate the transition of the generator from healthy to faulty conditions, a flexible model of the permanent magnet synchronous machine is developed. The flexible model can also be used to emulate the evolvement of the fault by using a variable resistance in the fault loop of the investigated winding. The developed model can also be used to understand which quantities that needs to be monitored to be able to early detect a faulty condition in the machine. It is shown that turn-to-turn faults in the permanent magnet synchronous generator can be detected through monitoring of the harmonic content of the stator current in the rotating reference frame as the harmonic content slightly change when a turn-to-turn-fault arise...|$|E

The timeline of events {{will include the}} feasibility study conducted by and for the university, grant awards from the Texas State Energy Conservation Office to fund the project, and a three-year sample of real time performance data since installation. The purpose of this case study is to compare the energy generation estimates by various stakeholders to the measured energy generation using a new but uniform performance relationship. In order to optimize energy generation in wind turbine generator systems, the most <b>common</b> <b>wind</b> speeds measured at the site should also be the most efficient wind speeds at which the wind turbine can convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical energy and ultimately electrical energy. The tool used to convey this relationship will be a figure plotting the wind speed profile against the efficiency curve of the wind turbine. Applying this relationship tool to the UNT Apogee Stadium wind turbines provided valuable results. The most <b>common</b> <b>wind</b> speeds at Apogee Stadium are not the most efficient wind speed for the turbine.

Obtaining accurate and reliable design data for thick laminates is subject of investigations. Due to the poor thermal conductivity properties of composites and the material self-heating that occurs during the fatigue loading, high temperature gradients may appear through the laminate thickness.
