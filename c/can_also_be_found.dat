40|$|To solve a given fine mesh problem, {{the design}} of a multigrid method {{requires}} the definition of coarse levels, associated coarse grid operators and inter-grid transfer operators.

This paper analyzes these two options, shows the connections of the volume-agglomeration method with algebraic methods and proposes a new definition of prolongation operator suitable for the application of the volume-agglomeration method to elliptic problems...|$|R
