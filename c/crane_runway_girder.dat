Rail is analyzed as a continuously long girder on a solid elastic base loaded with a local torque. The <b>crane</b> <b>runway</b> <b>girder</b> web is simulated as an elastic base. The expressions of the rail rotation angle and girder web {{as well as the}} value of full torque are obtained as a result of solving the differential equation of girder twisting on the elastic half-plane. It is shown that these parameters depend not only on the torsional stiffness of crane rail, but also on the upper zone of <b>crane</b> <b>runway</b> <b>girder</b> as well as the elastic characteristic of the lower layer. Obtained expressions can be used to analyze stress strain state of both crane rail and the upper zone of <b>crane</b> <b>runway</b> <b>girder</b> web...|$|E

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} in <b>crane</b> <b>runway</b> <b>girders</b> to place a channel, open-side down, over the top flange of a W- or S-section. The built-up WC (W-section with Channel) or SC (S-section with Channel) section has been proven to be efficient and economical. However, the theoretical moment calculation for WC/SC section is not a tough task and the difficulty comes from the evaluation of torsional properties including warping constant (Cw), monosymmetric parameter (βx), and torsional constant (J). The AISC specification provides the approximate formulas which are derived from singly symmetric I-shaped sections. Results from this study show that these formulas underestimate the elastic moment strength of WC/SC girders. This paper furnish the formulas for the torsional properties (Cw, βx, J) of WC/SC sections. The moment design parameters and torsional properties of WC/SC girders evaluated based on the theory and AISC are provided in tabular forms.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of elastic moment for built-up <b>crane</b> <b>runway</b> <b>girders</b> {{is not an}} easy task as the difficulty involves the calculation of torsional properties including warping constant, the coefficient of monosymmetry, and torsion constant. To date, all AISC specifications offer no specific formulas for determining the elastic critical moment for WC (W-shape with Cap channel) or SC (S-shape with Cap Channel) girders. They provide only the approximate formulas which were derived from singly symmetric I-sections. Based on this study, the AISC approximate formulas would underestimate the elastic critical moment of WC/SC girders by 6 – 25 % depending upon the unbraced length. This paper first summarizes the theoretical and AISC formulas for WC/SC girders. Theoretical torsional properties and relevant design parameters for WC/SC girders are computed and arranged in tabular form for design purposes. With these design values made available, engineers can perform more rational {{evaluation of}} WC/SC girders more conveniently. Lastly, a simplified but rational design approach is proposed for all available WC and SC girders listed in the AISC design manuals...|$|R

40|$|Parameters (Lp and Lr) for LRFD (1993, 1999) and AISC (2005, 2010) {{have been}} studied. This study has {{explored}} major fundamental equations {{regarding to the}} flexural design of steel beam based on the AISC (2005, 2010). Various beam sections, which are double symmetric I-shaped with compact webs and noncompact or slender flanges, and other I-shaped members with compact or noncompact webs, were investigated. The various failure modes involved in beams were discussed. They are elastic, inelastic and plastic modes for the lateral-torsional buckling of beams. The current AISC specifications provide no theoretical formulas for the elastic critical moment of WC section, but do give the approximate formulas which were actually derived from a singly symmetric I-shaped section as briefly described in this study. Based on this study, the AISC approximate formulas underestimate the elastic critical moments of WC section. It again thoroughly discusses of theoretical elastic moment for built-up <b>crane</b> <b>runway</b> <b>girders.</b> The difficulty comes {{from some of the}} evaluation of torsion properties including the warping constant (Cw) and coefficient of monosymmetry (βx), the torsion constant (J). This new set of design parameters and properties for WC section will enable practicing engineers to perform more in-depth evaluation in their routine deigns. The formulas for beam webs and flanges with concentrated loads are also introduced and investigated in this study. These include the flange local bending, the web local yielding, the web crippling, and the web sidesway buckling. 本研究比較撓曲設計參數（Lp, Lr）在LRFD (1993, 1999) 與AISC (2005, 2010) 之間的差異。整合介紹AISC (2005, 2010) 之鋼樑構件撓曲設計之方程式和基本背景:包含有雙對稱I-型結實斷面、非結實斷面與細長斷面，其它I-型結實斷面與非結實斷面。在側向扭曲挫曲的情況下，提出雙對稱I-型結實斷面與非結實斷面的例子，分析彈性、非彈性與塑性的行為。 因為現有設計規範沒有提供適當公式作為計算彎矩強度，僅以雙對稱I-型樑以及單對稱I-型樑相關之簡化公式評估單對稱斷面之彈性彎矩強度。所以進一步探討單對稱鋼樑斷面的彎矩強度，評估WC斷面理論強度時，必須計算翹曲常數Cw、單對稱係數以及扭力常數J。因為翹曲常數Cw、單對稱係數以及扭力常數J等牽涉到複雜積分運算。所以本研究提供常見WC 斷面之翹曲常數Cw、單對稱係數、扭力常數J以及設計相關表值。進而評估現有規範與理論值之差異。最後在針對集中荷重在梁的翼板與腹板時，分別有flange local bending、web local yielding、web crippling與web sidesway buckling四種狀態下分別進行討論，並整理相關規範與例題。Table of Contents Abstract………………………………………………………………… [...] .

40|$|The {{process of}} {{surveying}} <b>crane</b> <b>runways</b> has been continually refined {{due to the}} competitive situation, modern surveying instruments, additional sensors, accessories and evaluation procedures. Guidelines, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 12488 - 1, define target values that must be determined by survey. For a <b>crane</b> <b>runway</b> these are for example the span, the position and height of the rails. The process has to be objective and reproducible. However, common processes of surveying <b>crane</b> <b>runways</b> do not meet these requirements sufficiently. The evaluation of the protocols, ideally by an expert, requires many years of experience. Additionally, the recording of crucial parameters, e. g., the wear of the rail, or {{the condition of the}} rail fastening and rail joints, is not regulated and for that reason are often not considered during the measurement. To solve this deficit the Advanced Rail Track Inspection System (ARTIS) was developed. ARTIS is used to measure the 3 D position of crane rails, the cross-section of the crane rails, joints and, for the first time, the (crane-rail) fastenings. The system consists of a monitoring vehicle and an external tracking sensor. It makes kinematic observations with the tracking sensor from outside the rail run, e. g., the floor of an overhead <b>crane</b> <b>runway,</b> possible.

The object of practical considerations in the paper is a crane working in the area with unfavourable geotechnical conditions and the settling limits attributed to this crane and location area in the technical design.

40|$|Nowadays {{steel and}} {{concrete}} composite beams are widely applied in structures mainly subjected to dynamic loads, such as railway and road bridges exposed to traffic loads and industrial <b>crane</b> <b>runways</b> exposed to folk-lift truck loads, the fatigue resistance of these structures must be generally and carefully verified. And normally the shear forces between concrete flange and steel beams are all transferred by {{different kinds of}} shear connectors, fatigue failure of composite beam may happen on shear connectors. So the fatigue resistance of shear connectors in composite beams is significant for the safe of whole structure {{and needed to be}} well investigated. The fatigue strength of shear connectors could be explained in three ways, the fatigue endurance described by the relationships between stress range (S) and number of cycles (N), the static residual strength after a certain number of cycling loading, and the slip behavior during the cycling tests. S-N curves which widely used for steel fatigue assessment are also useful for shear connectors. Although there are already S-N curves for headed steel studs in Eurocodes and AASHTO, they are normally available for common studs. Whether these S-N curves applicable for large diameter studs or studs embedded in high strength concrete or other kind shear connectors is questionable. And the factors influencing fatigue life of shear connectors are needed more research. Furthermore, for the fatigue life assessment of existing structures, it is important to attain the residual strength after a certain service life or the principles of slip developing behavior during the service life. Then it is possible to assess how long the shear connectors could still service...|$|R
40|$|After the {{construction}} of the paving for container storage in the Genova-Voltri port, considerable ground swellings (up to 30 cm) took place, leading to dimensional damage of both <b>crane</b> <b>runways</b> and loading/unloading area, including the container ground slots. This is due to expansible chemical reactions occurred within blast-furnace slags employed as a foundation material. The aim of this study was that to determine the chemical and mineralogical characteristics of blast-furnace slag and to identify the phases that are expected to be responsible for expansible chemical reactions. For this purpose, materials from three geognostic drillings 20 m deep were analyzed and their stratigraphic sequence reconstructed. The study of the drillings (from 0 to 3 m deep) led to a full characterization of the foundation materials used for building the IV module in the port of Genoa-Voltri. The present study revealed the presence of a complex stratigraphy, with layers indicating the presence of metallurgical slag. The slag-rich layers are present at varying depths in the various surveys and their average thickness is about 90 cm in the three examined ones. Thin section study, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy observations and microanalyses of some selected samples allowed to identify the presence of chrysotile and of the phases commonly described in the metallurgic slag. The chemical and mineralogical data showed the presence of anhydrous phases: merwinite (3 CaO MgO 2 SiO 2), olivina 2 (MgO, FeO) SiO 2, alite C 3 S (3 CaO SiO 2), belite C 2 S (2 CaO SiO 2), ferrite phase C 4 AF (4 CaO Al 2 O 3 Fe 2 O 3), lime CaO, periclase MgO, wuestite FeO and a phase with intermediate composition FeO-MnO-MgO. Hydrated phases such as brucite, portlandite, gibbsite, goethite, and products of hydration of the cement phases have been also identified by XRPD and TG/DSC analyses. The formation of these hydrated phases caused a significant volumetric instability, mainly due to the presence of free CaO and free MgO, which in the presence of water form portlandite, Ca(OH) 2 and brucite, Mg(OH) 2. According to literature studies, the hydration reaction of free lime can lead in few days to a volume increase up to 100 %. Hydration reaction of free periclase is instead slower, leading to considerable volume increase even after months or years. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} exclude that in the next future relevant swelling phenomena should occur again...|$|R
