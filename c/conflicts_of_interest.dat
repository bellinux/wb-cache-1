5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the layoff of Icos employees, {{other aspects of the}} acquisition were equally controversial, such as assertions that Icos was being sold too cheaply and that <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> existed. The latter related to Icos senior executives, who– despite poor stock performance, in part from failed clinical development programs and an inability to successfully license drugs over the preceding years– were to be massively compensated upon a successful acquisition.|$|E

5|$|In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles {{study by}} former fellows of a {{conservative}} think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the study after The Wall Street Journal (85.1). The validity of the study has been questioned, however. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan, cited flaws in the study's methodology.|$|E

5|$|Orr {{became an}} agent {{representing}} hockey players in 1996. Along with investors, Orr purchased the Woolf Associates agency founded by Boston lawyer Bob Woolf.

5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa {{incorporating}} Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E

40|$|<b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{interests}}</b> arise due to {{the fact}} that a person’s right to demand to act in his interests imposes a duty on another person to act in such a way. Different concepts <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> used in various sectors and their problems are analyzed in the article. Whereas there is no unified concept <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> used in practice it is unclear which types of relations are regarded as <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> when <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> arises and what are the solutions to it. Due to these reasons universal concept <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> is constructed and elements <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> are analyzed in this article. The concept <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> is discussed in the context of agency theory in the broad sense, i. e. in the legal and economic sense. Theoretical model and types <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> are particularly important while trying to solve <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> There are two main categories of solutions: preventive and managing measures. Preventive measures are intended to avoid <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> before it arises and managing measures are intended to manage already risen <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> and to prevent negative consequences. The article concludes with the concept <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> its types and solutions...|$|R

5|$|Culverhouse's {{relationships}} with other NFL owners were occasionally, as in {{his relationship with the}} Rams, alleged to constitute <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> His $3 million loan to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example, as it violated the NFL constitution and bylaws. On other occasions, he was criticized for his overly-secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman, as other league owners found it difficult to obtain information on how league finances were being spent. In particular, owners were upset about not being informed about money given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5-year extension of his contract. The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982, even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Democratic {{governor}} Bill Ritter named Marostica, a Republican, to {{the post}} of {{executive director of the}} Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, replacing Don Elliman, who Ritter had tapped as Colorado's chief operating officer.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E

5|$|Lobbying {{is common}} in Annapolis; {{there are more than}} 700 lobbyists {{registered}} with the state. While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy, they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns. Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six Senators. Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1967, President Lyndon Johnson {{nominated}} Combs to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, {{replacing the}} deceased Shackelford Miller, Jr., and the Senate confirmed the nomination on April 5, 1967. Because {{of the rules}} of the federal judiciary, Combs had to liquidate his business and banking assets and severely restrict contact with many of his political acquaintances to avoid potential <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> with cases he might adjudicate on the Court of Appeals. He expressed frustration that the cases that came before the court were frequently appealed to the Supreme Court, which often gave little weight to the opinions rendered by the Court of Appeals. Consequently, he resigned from the court on June 5, 1970, and joined the Louisville law firm of Tarrant, Combs, and Bullitt (later Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs).|$|E
