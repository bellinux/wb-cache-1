5|$|The Public Faroese Health School (Faroese: Heilsuskúli Føroya) in Suðuroy is a {{vocational}} school offering {{two types of}} education. The health care assistant education (Heilsuhjálpari) takes fifteen months. Following graduation, pupils can choose to leave the school and work in home care and retirement homes. Alternatively they can continue with another 22 months and become an assistant nurse (heilsurøktari). The assistant nurse <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> various places, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals. The graduates from the Health School are mainly women. In 2012 almost 90% of the School's graduates were women.|$|E

5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform {{tasks such}} as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because they <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous {{to work with and}} are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.|$|E

25|$|Aluminum media: Aluminium {{media are}} {{typically}} cast parts {{and are available}} {{in a wide variety}} of shapes and sizes. Aluminum scrubs parts and <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with cleaning compounds to clean parts. Since aluminum is fairly nonabrasive it tends to remove surface impurities without affecting the part's surface qualities. Its cost is typically higher than other cast media. Wear rates are lower than ceramic but higher than steel media.|$|E

25|$|For toddlers: doctors may {{recommend}} a treatment {{with a mild}} dandruff shampoo such as Selsun Blue or Neutrogena T-gel, even though the treatment may cause initial additional scalp irritation. A doctor may instead prescribe an antifungal soap such as ketoconazole (2%) shampoo, which <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> a single treatment and shows significantly less irritation than over-the-counter shampoos such as selenium disulfide shampoos, but no adequate and controlled study has been conducted for pediatric use as of 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} features {{distributed processing}} abilities, which can function across an Ethernet LAN. One machine runs the Logic Pro app, {{while the other}} machines on the network run the Logic node app. Logic will then offload the effects and synth processing to the other machines on the network. If the network is fast enough (i.e. gigabit Ethernet) this <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> near-real time, depending on buffer settings and CPU loads. This allows users to combine the power of several Mac computers to process Logic Pro’s built-in software instruments and plug-ins, and 3rd party processing plug-ins.|$|E
25|$|In {{species or}} {{population}} analysis, {{for example in}} conservation work, PCR primers which amplify microsatellites in one individual or species <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> other species. However, the risk of applying PCR primers across different species is that null alleles become likely, whenever sequence divergence is too great for the primers to bind. The species may then artificially {{appear to have a}} reduced diversity. Null alleles in this case can sometimes be indicated by an excessive frequency of homozygotes causing deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{arrangements}} under which general practitioners <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the UK. While the main career aim {{is becoming a}} principal or partner in a GP surgery, many become salaried or non-principal GPs, work in hospitals in GP-led acute care units, or perform locum work. Whichever of these roles they fill, {{the vast majority of}} GPs receive most of their income from the National Health Service (NHS). Principals and partners in GP surgeries are self-employed, but they have contractual arrangements with the NHS which give them considerable predictability of income.|$|E
25|$|Some {{unregistered}} staff <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> other roles, {{for example}} as phlebotomists (taking blood samples), ECG technicians (recording electrocardiograms) or smoking cessation therapists, a scheme currently being employed {{in a number}} of general practitioner surgeries. Others can expand their ward-based role to include these tasks and others. There are few areas of nursing practice that cannot be legally performed by suitably trained non-registered staff, although they cannot fully replace them, as they legally must be supervised (either directly or indirectly) by a fully qualified registered nurse.|$|E
25|$|Countering the {{argument}} of a Celtic origin is the literary evidence that the Cimbri originally came from northern Jutland, an area with no Celtic placenames, instead only Germanic ones. This does not rule out Cimbric Gallicization during the period when they lived in Gaul. Boiorix, who may have a Celtic name if not a Celticized Germanic name, was king of the Cimbri after they moved away for their ancestral home of northern Jutland; Boiorix and his tribe lived around Celtic peoples during his era as J. B. Rives points out {{in his introduction to}} Tacitus's Germania (book) and moreover that the name Boiorix <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Proto-Germanic as well as Celtic.|$|E

25|$|Insects are {{the only}} group of {{invertebrates}} that have evolved wings and flight. Two insect groups, the dragonflies and the mayflies, have flight muscles attached directly to the wings. Other insects have the flight muscles attached to the thorax, making it oscillate and indirectly causing the wings to beat. Some very small insects make use not of steady-state aerodynamics but of the Weis-Fogh clap and fling mechanism, generating large lift forces {{at the expense of}} wear and tear on the wings. Many insects can hover, maintaining height and controlling their position. Some insects such as moths have the forewings coupled to the hindwings so these <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> unison.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, to be a {{psychiatric}} nurse a bachelor's degree of nursing {{need to be}} obtained {{in order to become}} a registered nurse (RN) and this degree takes 3 years full-time. Then a diploma in mental health or something similar will need to also be obtained, this is an additional year of study. An Australian psychiatric nurse has duties that may include assessing patients who are mentally ill, observation, helping patients take part in activities, giving medication, observing if the medication is working, assisting in behaviour change programs or visiting patients who are at home. Australian nurses <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> public or private hospitals, institutes, correctional institutes, mental care facilities and homes of the patients.|$|E
25|$|Installing {{a hybrid}} OR is a {{challenge}} to standard hospital room sizes, as not only the imaging system requires some additional space, but there are also more people in the room as in a normal OR. A team of 8 to 20 people including anasthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, technicians, perfusionists, support staff from device companies etc. <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> such an OR. Depending on the imaging system chosen, a room size of 70 square meters including a control room but excluding a technical room and the preparation areas is recommended. Additional preparations of the room necessary are 2-3mm lead shielding and potentially enforcement of the floor or ceiling to hold the additional weight of the imaging system (approximately 650–1800kg).|$|E

25|$|Satoyama {{have been}} disappearing {{due to the}} drastic shift in natural {{resources}} from charcoal and firewood to oil and the change from compost to chemical fertilizer. Also, the problem of aging in Japanese society can cause the disappearance of satoyama because there are fewer people who <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> satoyama which are considered as intermediate disturbance on forests such as harvesting trees for timber and charcoal, cutting shrubs for firewood and collecting litter as compost. These human impacts can help {{the success of the}} forest occur. As the final causality of the disappearing of satoyama, pine dominated secondary forests in satoyama were increasingly destroyed since pine wilt disease devastated pine forests in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{citizens}} can {{study in the}} United Kingdom for up to 6 months as a student visitor without the need {{to apply for a}} visa {{as long as they do}} not work during this period. If attending a course which is longer than 6 months, New Zealand {{citizens can}} apply for a Tier 4 student visa in New Zealand or in the UK merely by completing the application form, quoting the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) reference number issued to them by their UK education provider and presenting evidence of care arrangements (if under the age of 18); they do not need to submit proof of sufficient funds, qualifications or English language ability (which most other foreign nationals need to demonstrate) as long as the UK education provider is recognised as a 'Highly Trusted' sponsor by the UK Border Agency. However, the UK Border Agency reserves the right to request such evidence in particular situations and New Zealand citizens must still present such evidence if applying for a Tier 4 student visa outside New Zealand or the UK. New Zealand citizens who have been issued with a Tier 4 student visa (but not those who are in the UK as student visitors) <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the UK for up to 20 hours per week during term-time and without time restrictions outside term-time.|$|E
