50|$|On 12 February 2013, a 600 m2 {{section of}} {{the roof of the}} turbine-building, {{adjacent}} to the sarcophagus, collapsed. At first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it. However the amount of snow was not exceptional, and the report of a Ukrainian fact-finding panel concluded that the part collapse of the turbine-building was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure. The report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the turbine-building added a larger strain on the total structure than expected, and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding. Experts such as Valentin Kupny, former deputy director of the nuclear plant, did warn that the complex {{was on the verge of}} a collapse, leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition. A proposed reinforcement in 2005 was cancelled by a superior official. After the 12 February incident, radioactivity levels were up to 19 becquerels per cubic meter of air: 12 times normal. The report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed. All 225 workers employed by the Chernobyl complex and the French company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse. According to the managers of the <b>complex,</b> <b>radiation</b> levels around the plant were at normal levels (between 5 and 6 µSv/h) and should not affect workers' health. According to Kupny the situation was underestimated by the Chernobyl nuclear complex managers, and information was kept secret.|$|E

40|$|Regardless of the unspecific {{notions of}} photons as light <b>complexes,</b> <b>{{radiation}}</b> bundles or wave packets, the radiation {{from a single}} state transition is at most a single continuous wave train that starts and ends with the transition. The radiation equilibrium spectrum must be the superposition sum of the spectra of such wave trains. A classical equipartition of wave trains cannot diverge since they would be finite in number, whereas standing wave modes are by definition infinite, which had doomed Rayleigh's theory, and concern only the total radiation. Wave trains are the microscopic entities of radiation interacting with matter, that correspond to molecules in kinetic theory. Their quantization came from matter transitions in Einstein's 1917 derivation of Planck's law. The spectral scatter of wave trains by Doppler shifts, which cause the wavelength displacements in Wien's law used for the frequency dependence in Einstein's derivation, is shown to yield {{the shape of the}} Planck spectrum. A Lorentz transform property of Doppler shifts discovered by Einstein is further shown equivalently necessary and sufficient to have corrected Rayleigh's theory.

40|$|A radio-fluorogenic (RFG) gel is a {{polymer gel}} {{that can be}} applied as a 3 D {{radiation}} dosimeter in radiotherapy. The gel becomes fluorescent in UV light after exposure to high-energy radiation and the intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the local radiation dose. This radiation-induced fluorescence is permanent, which distinguishes it from transitory optical emission or scintillation effects. In the thesis we demonstrate that a quasi-rigid RFG gel, consisting of tertiary-butyl acrylate (TBA) with ca 100 ppm maleimido-pyrene (MPy), has the potential to produce spatially resolved images of dose deposition. The work focuses on the fundamental radiation chemistry and photophysics of the medium. In particular, we have investigated the dose and dose-rate dependences of polymer formation and fluorescence intensity using cobalt- 60 gamma-ray sources. We have also used collimated beams of 200 kVp X-rays to produce <b>complex</b> <b>radiation</b> fields for test purposes and constructed a tomographic method for reconstructing full 3 D images of the dose distribution with submillimetre spatial resolution.

The resulted GRB spectrum is a broken power law in both the fast and slow cooling phases. On {{the basis of this}} electron spectrum, the spectral indices of the Band function in four different phases are presented. In the <b>complex</b> <b>radiation</b> frame, the detail investigation on physical parameters reveals that both the reverse shock photosphere model and the forward shock with strong coupling model can answer the α∼ - 1 problem. A possible marginal to fast cooling phase transition in GRB 080916 C is discussed. The time resolved spectra in different pulses of GRB 100724 B, GRB 100826 A and GRB 130606 B are investigated. We found that the flux is proportional to the peak energy in almost all pulses. The phases for different pulses are determined according to the spectral index revolution. We found the strong correlations between spectral indices and the peak energy in GRB 100826 A, which {{can be explained by the}} Compton effect in the fast cooling phase.

40|$|Radiation {{protection}} dosimetry in radiation fields {{behind the}} shielding of high-energy accelerators such as CERN is a challenging task and the quantitative {{understanding of the}} detector response used for dosimetry is essential. Measurements with ionisation chambers are a standard method to determine absorbed dose (in the detector material). For applications in mixed radiation fields, ionisation chambers are often also calibrated in terms of ambient dose equivalent at conventional reference radiation fields. The response of a given ionisation chamber to the various particle types of a <b>complex</b> high-energy <b>radiation</b> field in terms of ambient dose equivalent depends of course on the materials used for the construction and the chamber gas used.
