5|$|It {{has been}} noted that the feather, the first {{specimen}} of Archaeopteryx described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of Archaeopteryx. It <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this feather is known so far. As the feather had been designated the type specimen, the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer {{be applied to the}} skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.|$|E

Two anecdotal stories revolve around Catherine Montagu; in one she {{is identified as}} the [...] "Countess of Salisbury" [...] from whose dropped garter Edward III named the Order of the Garter. In the other, Edward III {{falls in love with}} the countess, and arranges to be alone with her so he can rape her. Neither story is supported by contemporary evidence, and the latter almost <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> product of French propaganda.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, the {{executive}} producers of [...] It was directed by Mike Vejar, his sixth episode of the series. He previously directed episodes for three other Star Trek series. When asked {{about the use of}} time travel stories in Star Trek in relation to [...] "Carpenter Street", Scott Bakula said that [...] "Obviously it's something you want to be careful of, and {{yet at the same time}} I'm told that the fans love the time travel episodes, and there's certainly an effort on Rick and Brannon's part to write things that they hope the fans will love. This particular journey back in time is very grounded in story." [...] He added that he believed that the setting for the episode was chosen because the production values were [...] "easily accomplished" [...] and that [...] "because the episode deals with germ warfare, and that <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> relevant topic today." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Rugrats Passover" [...] {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews and}} became one of the series' all-time most popular episodes. John J.

[...] Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called the episode [...] "among the best holiday TV specials ever produced." [...] Other reviews applauded the episode for its treatment of Judaism. Authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin, in their book Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim praised the episode for celebrating [...] "secular Jewishness in the wisest and most entertaining fashionGrandpa Boris regales the kids with an epic, albeit abridged, Exodus story." [...] Halley Blair of Forward Magazine called the episode [...] "a comical primer for getting children ready for upcoming seders," [...] and Danny Goldberg, in How The Left Lost Teen Spirit, noted that the episode's Jewish themes were [...] "clearly expressed {{in the context of a}} mass appeal entertainment." [...] Among many positive reviews of the episode in Jewish community publications, Gila Wertheimer of the Chicago Jewish Star said that the episode [...] "will entertain children of all ages – and their parents." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1980s, when no {{effective}} medication was yet available for AIDS treatment, Paul spoke publicly against all {{federal funding for}} AIDS research.

The individual suffering from AIDS <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> victim – frequently a victim of his own lifestyle – but this same individual victimizes innocent citizens by forcing them to pay for his care.

2500|$|MMT does point out, however, {{that debt}} {{denominated}} {{in a foreign}} currency <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fiscal risk to governments, since the indebted government cannot create foreign currency. In this case {{the only way the}} government can sustainably repay its foreign debt is to ensure that its currency is continually and highly demanded by foreigners over the period that it wishes to repay the debt – an exchange rate collapse would potentially multiply the debt many times over asymptotically, making it impossible to repay. In that case, the government can default, or attempt to shift to an export-led strategy or raise interest rates to attract foreign investment in the currency. Either one has a negative effect on the economy. Euro debt crises in the [...] "PIIGS" [...] countries that began in 2009 reflect this risk, since Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, etc. have all issued debts in a quasi-"foreign currency" [...] – the Euro, which they cannot create.|$|E
