The political and decision-making structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrated lack of actual commitment to the realization of the rights of minorities referring to participation in decision-making processes. Bearing in mind formal position within parliaments, visibility, and a significant promotional capacity for presence in the public sphere, the councils on national minorities may represent a significant body and channel for the minority – majority dialogue. However, at the moment, the national minority councils’ capacity to ensure participation of national minorities in Bosnian political life and their influence in decision-making process remains insufficient. In general, the <b>consultative</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> within their mandated responsibilities, have had insignificant and minimal impact on the practical, political and legislative segment...|$|R

50|$|Vitalis {{has been}} a senior New Zealand {{negotiator}} at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) including on trade and environment-related issues (2004-8). In particular, he {{is believed to have}} played an influential role in the WTO negotiations on environmental goods, including by chairing the 'Friends of Environmental Goods' process which collectively identified and tabled at the WTO more than 150 specific products as environmental goods (2004-7). The 'Friends' grouping included primarily OECD countries. Vitalis is also believed to have first proposed the innovative 'living list' concept also formally tabled at the WTO by New Zealand. Such a 'living' process would enable the regular updating of any list of products agreed at the WTO to ensure that the list keeps pace with the rapid evolution of environmental technologies http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/NZ-and-the-WTO/Trade-Issues/0-environment-goods-feb-05.php#ref1. At the same time, a series of papers tabled by New Zealand at the WTO and also believed to have been written by Vitalis proposed the establishment of a Voluntary <b>Consultative</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (later, a Voluntary Consultative Process) as a Pareto optimal way to address the apparent intersection between trade measures contained in Multilateral Environmental Agreements and the WTO Agreements http://www.panda.org/downloads/policy/measwto.pdf.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increased}} use of employee involvement and participation mechanisms in corporate decision making in the 1990 s. These are often initiated by management {{as a means of}} harnessing employee expertise in decisions to introduce new technologies and to gain employee cooperation in substantial corporate restructuring and changes to work practices which have been introduced to improve the competitiveness of these organisations in global markets. It has been suggested that managers have a preference for direct negotiations with employees rather than representational consultative mechanisms, which often involving union representatives, when negotiating organisational change. Australia has had a relatively low use of formal <b>consultative</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This may be a means of avoiding involving unions in these decisions, which are considered an area of managerial prerogative.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{an insight into}} Washington&# 039;s foreign policy {{establishment}} and its vision of European integration under the Nixon administration. It argues that President Nixon and his National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, managed to formulate many important aspects of foreign policy at the White House. From a realist perspective, the Nixon-Kissinger team saw {{the emergence of a}} new world order and in it the evolvement of European integration in a way different from previous U.

The paper begins by discussing the Nixon administration&# 039;s realist approach to foreign policy before analyzing President Nixon&# 039;s determination to make decisions on foreign relations at the White House. Next, the paper examines the main features of the Nixon-Kissinger team&# 039;s vision of European integration. It concludes that, as realists, the Nixon administration supported integration in Western Europe, yet Washington was ambivalent if a united Europe with increasing self-confidence and self-assertiveness would be in the U. S. national interest. Henceforth, the European integration process had to be, in the Nixon-Kissinger view, taking place under U.

40|$|Commentators in Australia and the United States have {{observed}} that the shift in power in universities from academic departments to administration {{has been accompanied by}} a number of changes, leading to 'corporate managerialism'. As a result, managers make the most important decisions and make them quickly. These managers also restructure their institutions to mould them into streamlined operations which allow only a few people in the whole organisation the information base to make decisions. At the same time, these managers devolve administrative tasks to divisions and departments where Executive Deans have increasing power. The result is that academics have a lot less control over their institutions. This paper narrates the views of 253 academics interviewed in six American and Australian universities from 1994 - 1997 about how these changes have affected their universities. It explores how various forms of managerialism are applied in these universities and how academics try to resist them.

Difficulties in implementing participatory rights exist in all countries: there are logistic difficulties in the establishment of effective mechanisms enabling the involvement of the whole spectrum of stakeholders in decision-making. This article reveals obstacles to Russia’s implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, with a focus on participatory rights (Article 15). It is argued that Russia does not meet the requirements of Article 15, owing {{to the fact that the}} form of participation offered to minorities is devoid of guarantees that it will be ‘effective’. An analysis of the two forms of participation – representation in elected bodies and <b>consultative</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> with a particular reference to National Cultural Autonomy – reveals an over-reliance on informal networks and practices in the management of majority-minority relations. Mechanisms for participation are locked into a system that has features partly originating from the Soviet period and partly from policies introduced by former Russian President Vladimir Putin. The article concludes that international standards on minority participation are unlikely to induce a substantial shift in minority policies in Russia given the international standards’ own flexibility and the Russian leadership’s commitment to its own approach to nationality issues in the context of its plans for a ‘managed democracy’. Despite this, it is argued that international standards should not be dismissed as irrelevant in Russia...|$|R
