Dry milling was optimized in the past to extract energetic compounds of grains (starch, protein) recovered in refined flour/semolina from which almost all fibres and micronutrients are discarded. Conventional milling processes can be revisited to produce flours enriched in these components ofinterest. Moreover, innovative technologies, such as <b>cryogeny</b> or electrostatic separation, are underinvestigations to produce new food ingredients either from wheat grains or brans (coming fromconventional milling) ...|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{approach}} to centralized multiple-faults diagnostics is extended to distributed transducer networks monitoring large experimental systems. Given {{a set of}} anomalies detected by the transducers, each instance of the multiple-fault problem is formulated as several parallel communicating sub-tasks running on different transducers, and thus solved one-by-one on spatially separated parallel processes. A micro-genetic algorithm merges evaluation time efficiency, arising from a smallsize population distributed on parallel-synchronized processors, with the effectiveness of centralized evolutionary techniques due to optimal mix of exploitation and exploration. In this way, holistic view and effectiveness advantages of evolutionary global diagnostics are combined with reliability and efficiency benefits of distributed parallel architectures. The proposed approach was validated both (i) by simulation at CERN, on {{a case study of}} a cold box for enhancing the <b>cryogeny</b> diagnostics of the Large Hadron Collider, and (ii) by experiments, under the framework of the industrial research project MONDIEVOB (Building Remote Monitoring and Evolutionary Diagnostics), co-funded by EU and the company Del Bo srl, Napoli, Italy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new implementation of monolithic horizontal sensor, {{developed at the}} University of Salerno, based on the Folded Pendulum architecture, configurable both as seismometer and as accelerometer. The large low-frequency band (10 - 6 ÷ 10 Hz), the high sensitivity (10 - 12 m/sqrt(Hz) in the band 0. 1 ÷ 10 Hz) and the high quality factor in air (Q > 1500) are largely better than all the previous Folded Pendulum implementations. Moreover its monolithic implementation of the whole mechanics, coupled with a full tunability of its resonance frequency (70 mHz ÷ 1. 2 Hz) obtained with a specially designed calibration procedure and with an integrated laser optical readout, guarantees both compactness, robustness and immunity to environmental noises. This makes this sensor suitable for {{a large number of}} scientific applications, also in high vacuum and <b>cryogeny.</b> Applications of this sensor are already started in the field of geophysics, including the study of seismic and newtonian noise for characterization of suitable sites for future underground interferometric detectors of gravitational waves...|$|E
40|$|Host and {{reservoir}} rocks like rock salts, clay stones, shales {{and tight}} gas sandstones are of major importance for society {{since they are}} considered as the probable solution for the nuclear waste storage in deep geological formation; in addition, good understanding of their chemical, physical and mechanical properties is essential for reservoir development in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Bulk mechanical and fluid flow properties of such rocks are widely documented and investigated, however much less is known about the impact of microstructures on these properties. In the ideal case, the investigation of microstructures in such wet, fine grained and heterogeneous geomaterials requires a multi-scale and multi-dimensional approach with samples preserved in their original hydric state and stress field. Works presented in this habilitation presents developments of novel and innovative methods to access microstructures: (1) in rocksalt the grain microstructures are decorated by gamma-irradiation, (2) ion beam beam milling tools (focussed ion beam-FIB and broad ion beam-BIB) were established to prepare extremely high quality cross-sections suitable for SEM imaging down to nanometer scale and (3) <b>cryogeny</b> methods were deveopped both to preserve specimen from drying damages and quench fluid within pores and grain boundaries. The combination of methods (2) and (3) allow SEM-imaging of preserved wet structures on atomically smooth cross-sections at cryo-temperature. Particularly, a novel instrument allowing argon broad ion beam tomography in a cryogenic scanning electron microscope (BIB-cryo-SEM) to study representative microstructures in sedimentary rocks containing pore fluid was developed. The use of the different methods above coupled with other traditional methods to characterize the microstructure allows having new insigths in the coupling between the microstructural evolution, the poromechanical behaviour and the state of hydration of the system that occur within the studied geomateials. Results are paving towards the better calibration of constitutive laws for the estimation of chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the host and reservoir rocks...|$|E
