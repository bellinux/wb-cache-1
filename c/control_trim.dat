5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped <b>control</b> <b>trim</b> drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E

5000|$|Elevator trim frees {{the pilot}} from exerting {{constant}} {{pressure on the}} pitch controls. Instead, the pilot adjusts a longitudinal <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> (often {{in the form of}} a wheel) to cancel out control forces for a given airspeed / weight distribution. Typically, when this <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> (wheel or lever) is rotated or moved forward, the nose is held down; conversely, if the <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> is moved back, the tail becomes [...] "heavy". Many newer aircraft, especially jet aircraft, have electric <b>trim</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} rotor <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> {{system was}} developed and successfully used during a wind tunnel test of a full-scale UH- 60 rotor system with Individual Blade Control (IBC) actuators. The <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> system allowed rotor trim to be set more quickly, precisely and repeatably than in previous wind tunnel tests. This control system also allowed the rotor trim state to be maintained during transients and drift in wind tunnel flow, and through changes in IBC actuation. The ability to maintain a consistent rotor trim state was key to quickly and accurately evaluating the effect of IBC on rotor performance, vibration, noise and loads. This paper presents details of the design {{and implementation of the}} <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> system including the rotor system hardware, <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> requirements, and <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> hardware and software implementation. Results are presented showing the effect of IBC on rotor trim and dynamic response, a validation of the rotor dynamic simulation used to calculate the initial control gains and tuning of the control system, and the overall performance of the <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> system during the wind tunnel test...|$|R

25|$|Trim is the diver's {{attitude}} in the water, in terms of balance and alignment with the direction of motion. Accurately <b>controlled</b> <b>trim</b> reduces swimming effort, as it reduces the sectional area of the diver passing through the water. A slight head down trim is recommended to reduce downthrust during finning, and this reduces silting and fin impact with the bottom.|$|R

50|$|There {{is also a}} {{conflict}} between the requirements for a lifejacket, which must keep the wearer face up and afloat even when unconscious, and a buoyancy compensator, which should allow the diver freedom to <b>control</b> <b>trim</b> attitude both underwater and floating at the surface.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of water ballast {{is that the}} tanks can be emptied, reducing draft or {{the weight of the}} boat (e.g. for transport on ground) and water added back in (in small boats, simply by opening up the valves and letting the water flow in) after the boat is launched or cargo unloaded. Pumps {{can also be used to}} empty the leeward ballast tank and fill the windward tank as the boat tacks, and the quantity of ballast can be varied to keep the boat at the optimum angle of heel. On empty cargo vessels water is added to ballast tanks to increase propeller immersion, to improve steering, and to <b>control</b> <b>trim</b> and draft.|$|E

50|$|S-36 ran at one-third speed, her depth <b>control</b> and <b>trim</b> poor. Soon {{her main}} motor bearing began smoking; oil was applied by hand squirt gun. At about 06:30, {{almost an hour}} and a half after the initial contact, she lost depth <b>control.</b> Her <b>trim</b> pump stalled. The No. 2 main ballast was blown and at 230 ft the boat began to rise. Previously taken steps were reversed; venting and {{flooding}} was begun. She stopped at 90 ft.|$|R
50|$|While the YF120 engine {{never went}} into production, it was {{installed}} in the YF-22 used for the high angle of attack demonstration program {{as part of the}} ATF competition. During this demonstration, the YF120 powered aircraft flew, trimmed, at 60 degrees angle of attack at 82 knots. At this attitude the aircraft was able to demonstrate controlibility. Later analysis revealed that the aircraft could have maintained <b>controlled,</b> <b>trimmed</b> flight up to 70 degrees angle of attack.|$|R
50|$|The glider was {{constructed}} predominantly from wood {{with a single}} spar built from laminated wood supporting wooden built up ribs covered with a relatively thick plywood skin, {{which resulted in a}} smooth surface with minimal distortion.The wing had three distinct sections, comprising a constant-chord, unswept centre section flanked by swept tapered outer sections. Primary flight controls consisted of elevons on the trailing edges of the outer wing sections for pitch and roll, with fins and rudders on the wing-tips for yaw stability and <b>control.</b> <b>Trim</b> in pitch was achieved by adjusting the incidence of movable wing tips using screw jacks. For approach and landing split flaps were fitted to the wing centre section trailing edge.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} Sedona {{was the second}} top selling large MPV in the UK market, and in 2010 received a new grille, new equipment (including a reversing camera built into the rear-view mirror) and a single engine choice, a 192PS 2.2 CRDi I4 replacing the 183PS 2.9 CDRi. The {{second generation}} was marketed in three trim levels (1,2 & 3) with a 5-speed manual transmission or six-speed automatic gearbox. Trim level 1 included air-conditioning, electric windows. Trim level 2 received alloy wheels, rear parking camera with the display incorporated into the rear-view mirror, and climate <b>control.</b> <b>Trim</b> level 3 added electronic stability control, leather seats, heated front seats, power tail gate and powered folding door mirrors.|$|E
50|$|The Type 10 is {{significantly}} {{smaller than the}} Type 1 and consequently has a much smaller warhead of 300 kg. The forward section of the weapon contains the warhead and the manual electric fuze, but no contact detonator unlike other kaiten types. The midsection contains {{the first set of}} Type 92 batteries as well as a steering air bottle strapped to the underneath of the weapon. The pilot's compartment contains firing, starting and gyroscope starting switches as well as a fixed periscope that could only be rotated but not raised or lowered, the rudder <b>control,</b> <b>trim</b> gauge and a sodium peroxide tin for air purification. The latter part of the weapon contained the remainder of the batteries and a small external steering air bottle. The control planes are identical to the Type 92 torpedo's other than having a manually operated rudder fitted.|$|E

50|$|Underwater trim is the diver's {{attitude}} in the water, in terms of balance and alignment with the direction of motion. Accurately <b>controlled</b> <b>trim</b> reduces swimming effort, as it reduces the sectional area of the diver passing through the water. The effect of swimming with a head up angle, of about 15° as is quite common in poorly trimmed divers, can {{be an increase in}} drag in the order of 50%.A slight head down trim is recommended to reduce downthrust during finning, and this reduces silting and fin impact with the bottom.|$|R

A slight head down trim is recommended to reduce downthrust during finning, and this reduces silting and fin impact with the bottom. Buoyancy compensators and weighting systems that make horizontal trim difficult are deprecated for this reason. Systems are recommended that concentrate weight centrally and restrict weighting to what is actually needed to compensate for equipment buoyancy and use of gas during the dive.|$|R
40|$|Design {{procedures}} for VTOL automatic control {{systems have been}} developed and are presented. Using linear-optimal estimation and control techniques as a starting point, digital-adaptive control laws have been designed for the VALT Research Aircraft, a tandem-rotor helicopter which is equipped for fully automatic flight in terminal area operations. These control laws are designed to interface with velocity-command and attitude-command guidance logic, {{which could be used}} in short-haul VTOL operations.

40|$|A frequency-based {{performance}} identification {{approach was}} evaluated using flight {{data from the}} NASA F- 15 Highly Integrated Digital Electronic Control aircraft. The approach used frequency separation to identify the effectiveness of multiple controls simultaneously {{as an alternative to}} independent control identification methods. Fourier transformations converted measured control and response data into frequency domain representations. Performance gradients were formed using multiterm frequency matching of control and response frequency domain models. An objective function was generated using these performance gradients. This function was formally optimized to produce a coordinated <b>control</b> <b>trim</b> set. This algorithm was applied to longitudinal acceleration and evaluated using two control effectors: nozzle throat area and inlet first ramp. Three criteria were investigated to validate the approach: simultaneous gradient identification, gradient frequency dependency, and repeatability. This report describes the flight test results. These data demonstrate that the approach can accurately identify performance gradients during simultaneous control excitation independent of excitation frequency...|$|E
40|$|The human {{tripartite}} motif (TRIM) family comprises 70 members, including HIV restriction factor TRIM 5 α and disease-associated proteins TRIM 20 (pyrin) and TRIM 21. TRIM proteins have conserved domain architecture but diverse cellular roles. Here, {{we describe}} how the C-terminal PRYSPRY domain mediates diverse TRIM functions. The crystal structure of TRIM 21 PRYSPRY in complex with its target IgG Fc reveals a canonical binding interface comprised of two discrete pockets formed by antibody-like variable loops. Alanine scanning of this interface has identified the hot-spot residues that <b>control</b> <b>TRIM</b> 21 binding to Fc; the same hot-spots control HIV/murine leukemia virus restriction by TRIM 5 α and mediate severe familial Mediterranean fever in TRIM 20 /pyrin. Characterization of the IgG binding site for TRIM 21 PRYSPRY reveals TRIM 21 as a superantigen analogous to bacterial protein A {{and suggests that}} an antibody bipolar bridging mechanism {{may contribute to the}} pathogenic accumulation of anti-TRIM 21 autoantibody immune complex in autoimmune disease...|$|E

40|$|A maximum-likelihood output-error {{parameter}} estimation technique {{is used to}} obtain stability and control derivatives for the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center SR- 71 A airplane and for configurations that include experiments externally mounted {{to the top of}} the fuselage. This research is being done as part of the envelope clearance for the new experiment configurations. Flight data are obtained at speeds ranging from Mach 0. 4 to Mach 3. 0, with an extensive amount of test points at approximately Mach 1. 0. Pilot-input pitch and yaw-roll doublets are used to obtain the data. This report defines the {{parameter estimation}} technique used, presents stability and control derivative results, and compares the derivatives for the three configurations tested. The experimental configurations studied generally show acceptable stability, <b>control,</b> <b>trim,</b> and handling qualities throughout the Mach regimes tested.

40|$|Presented are methods, instrumentation, and {{difficulties}} associated with drag {{measurement of the}} X- 29 A aircraft. The initial performance objective of the X- 29 A program emphasized drag polar shapes rather than absolute drag levels. Priorities during the flight envelope expansion restricted the evaluation of aircraft performance. Changes in aircraft configuration, uncertainties in angle-of-attack calibration, and limitations in instrumentation complicated the analysis. Limited engine instrumentation with uncertainties in overall in-flight thrust accuracy {{made it difficult to}} obtain reliable values of coefficient of parasite drag. The aircraft was incapable of tracking the automatic camber <b>control</b> <b>trim</b> schedule for optimum wing flaperon deflection during typical dynamic performance maneuvers; this has also complicated the drag polar shape modeling. The X- 29 A was far enough off the schedule that the developed trim drag correction procedure has proven inadequate. However, good drag polar shapes have been developed throughout the flight envelope. Preliminary flight results have compared well with wind tunnel predictions. A more comprehensive analysis must be done to complete performance models. The detailed flight performance program with a calibrated engine will benefit from the experience gained during this preliminary performance phase...|$|E
