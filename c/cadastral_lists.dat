40|$|It is January 1930 and {{the restless}} Southern Ocean is heaving itself up against the frozen coast of Eastern Antarctica as the {{exploring}} ship Discovery shoves {{its way through the}} pack. One of the key moments of the British, Australian, and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) —is about to occur: the expedition is about to succeed in its primary mission. Douglas Mawson, the expedition's Australian leader, ascends to the island's bleak summit. There, he and his crew assemble a mound of stones and insert into it the flagpole they’ve carried with them across the ocean. Mawson reads an official proclamation of territorial annexation, the photographer Hurley shoots the moment on film, and one of the men hauls the Union Jack up the pole. In the freezing wind, the men take off their hats and sing "God Save the King. " They deposit a copy of the proclamation into a metal canister and affix this to the flagpole. The men row back to the Discovery; Mawson returns to his cabin and writes up the event. A crucial moment in Antarctica's spatial history has occurred: on what Mawson has aptly named Proclamation Island, Antarctica has been produced as Australian space. But how, exactly, does this production of Antarctica as a spatial possession work? How does this moment initiate the transformation of six million square kilometres of Antarctica— 42 % of the continent—into Australian space? The answer to this question lies in three separate, but articulated cultural technologies: representation, the body of the explorer, and international territorial law. This article attends {{to the ways in which}} these spatialising forces together 'nationalise' Antarctica by transforming it into Australian national space. Mawson’s BANZARE performance on Proclamation Island is a moment in which the legal, the physical, and the textual clearly intersect in the creation of space as a national possession. Australia did not take possession of forty-two percent of Antarctica after BANZARE by law, by exploration, or by representation alone. The Australian government built its Antarctic space with letters patent. BANZARE produced Australia's Antarctic possession through the physical and legal rituals of flag-planting, proclamation-reading, and exploration. BANZARE further contributed to Australia's polar empire with maps, journals, photos and films, and <b>cadastral</b> <b>lists</b> of the region’s animals, minerals, magnetic fields, and winds. The laws of "discovery of terra nullius" and of "the spirit of possession" coalesced these spaces into a territory officially designated as Australian. It is crucial to recognise that the production of nearly half of Antarctica as Australian space was, and is not a matter of discourse, of physical performance, or of law alone. Rather, these three cultural technologies of spatial production are mutually imbricated; none can function without the others, nor is one reducible to an epiphenomenon of another. This article examines the ways in which six million square kilometres of Antarctic ice were, and continue to be, produced as Australian national space...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time the full modern <b>cadastral</b> <b>list</b> of fishes living in Dniprovs’ke (Zaporiz’ke) {{reservoir}} is resulted. The list contains 52 kinds concerning 11 groups, 14 families and 43 genuses. Latin and Russian names of fishes, their status and economic value of the species are presented. Provided list of fishes comprises taxonomic changes made in scientific descriptions of fresh-water ichthyofauna after publication by L. S. Berg’s papers (1948 - 1949...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is {{to address the issue}} of social {{inequity}} in Italy due to property taxation. The European Union has declared the fact that cadastral values used to define property taxation in Italy do not reflect market prices. In this paper, we analyze the discrepancies between <b>cadastral</b> values and <b>listing</b> prices. Furthermore, we find empirical coefficients to apply to current cadastral values to reduce the spread between current cadastral values and market prices. The procedure used is very simple and could easily be applied by local public administrations in order to correct the inequity produced by the current property taxation system within the same city and among various cities...|$|R
50|$|Rümmelsheim’s Jewish {{graveyard}} {{was laid}} out no later than 1808. Laid to rest here were not only Jewish inhabitants from Rümmelsheim but also those from Waldalgesheim. Only six gravestones, in varying states of preservation, still stand at the graveyard. Of these, only one is still fully legible (the stone for Wolfgang Stern, 1844-1913). The graveyard’s area is 975 m² spread over two parcels of 790 m² and 185 m². The graveyard lands were not sold off {{in the time of}} the Third Reich. Even in 1958, the Rümmelsheim <b>cadastral</b> register still <b>listed</b> the Rümmelsheim synagogue community, which had ceased to exist {{more than half a century}} earlier, as the owner of those parcels. The graveyard lies 2 km northwest of the village in the woodland known as Horet, not far from the Waldlaubersheim Jewish graveyard.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this diploma thesis is to analyse {{the changes in the}} {{cadastral}} income in the period 1990 to 2012 in Slovenia, which is illustrated for the case of savinjska statistical region. The theoretical part presents the legislation which deals with determining the cadastral income in the years 1990 - 2012. Using the regulations that determine the methodology to calculate the cadastral income in the given period, we compared the values of cadastral income just for the selected cadastral culture in the first cadastral class from the analysed cadastral districts belonging to the savinjska statistical region. In the practical part of diploma thesis, we compared the cadastral income for the following cadastral cultures: fields, gardens, meadow orchards, extensive orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, meadows, pasture lands and forests, in the chosen cadastral classes from 1990 to 2012 in the savinjska statistical region. We studied further land bonita points appointed to the previously <b>listed</b> <b>cadastral</b> cultures. In the future, land bonita points {{are going to be the}} basic criteria for determining the cadastral income. We come at the conclusion that within one cadastral district there are major dissimilarities in cadastral income (for a factor 10 or more) based on the cadastral culture and class. ...|$|R
