The bioinformatics and cheminformatics courses involved 12 months of classes and, {{in the third}} term, a six-month internship placement in industry or academia. The biotechniques course involved eight months of coursework and an optional six-month research project. These courses have now been stopped (see below).|$|E
25|$|This {{position}} was subsequently abandoned, as theologians such as A. B. Bruce, Marcus Dods and George Adam Smith began {{to teach a}} more liberal understanding of the faith. 'Believing criticism' of the Bible was a central approach taught by such as William Robertson Smith and he was dismissed from his <b>chair</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Assembly in 1881. Attempts were made between 1890 and 1895 to bring many of these professors to the bar of the Assembly on charges of heresy, but these moves failed, with only minor warnings being issued.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1993, despite not seeing or {{speaking}} to Jackson {{for a number of}} years, La Toya Jackson claimed that her brother was a pedophile and that she had proof, which she was prepared to disclose for a fee of $500,000. A bidding war between US and UK tabloids began, but fell through when they realized that her revelations were not what she had claimed them to be. Then in Israel, she stated, [...] "I cannot and will not be a silent collaborator in his crimes against young children... Forget about the superstar, forget about the icon. If he was any other 35-year-old man who was sleeping with little boys, you wouldn't like this guy". She also claimed that checks had been made out to several boys and that Jackson's own physical abuse as a child had turned him into an abuser. She would later claim that Jackson had tried to kidnap and kill her. The rest of the family disowned her, and in subsequent years she would insist that she was forced to make the allegations by her then husband for financial gain. Just prior to making the allegations, her husband was arrested for striking her in the face, arms and legs with a <b>chair.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> turn of the millennium Jackson had forgiven his sister.|$|E

2500|$|While {{some sources}} say he {{graduated}} from Harvard College in 1751, {{it is far more}} likely that this was his 21-year-old son, Joseph, Jr., rather than the 46-year-old Wanton, who was by then a highly successful merchant sailing the globe in pursuit of commercial interests. [...] That he was well educated, however, is certain from the vast amount of correspondence in which he engaged, particularly as governor of the colony. [...] In the mid-1750s, the Boston portraitist, John Greenwood, followed a group of sea captains and merchants to Surinam on the northeast coast of South America. [...] The trading usually took time, so the men often waited in pubs. [...] Being commissioned by the merchants to create a satirical painting, Greenwood concocted a 22-figure tavern scene, showing himself among the affluent traders, all subject to the [...] "intoxicating effects of alcohol and economic ambition." [...] Most accounts agree that Wanton is the bald man slumped in a <b>chair</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> table, being doused with a pitcher of rum, by one account, or of punch and vomit, by other accounts.|$|E
