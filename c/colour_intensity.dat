25|$|The {{impetus for}} a more complex type of {{television}} remote control came in 1973, {{with the development of}} the Ceefax teletext service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of teletext sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select teletext pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, <b>colour</b> <b>intensity,</b> etc. Early teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of the remote control required for teletext quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977–1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.|$|E
25|$|Silver {{staining}} is {{used when}} more sensitive {{method for detection}} is needed, as classical Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining can usually detect a 50ng protein band, Silver staining increases the sensitivity typically 10-100 fold more. This {{is based on the}} chemistry of photographic development. The proteins are fixed to the gel with a dilute methanol solution, then incubated with an acidic silver nitrate solution. Silver ions are reduced to their metallic form by formaldehyde at alkaline pH. An acidic solution, such as acetic acid stops development. Silver staining was introduced by Kerenyi and Gallyas as a sensitive procedure to detect trace amounts of proteins in gels. The technique has been extended to the study of other biological macromolecules that have been separated in a variety of supports. Many variables can influence the <b>colour</b> <b>intensity</b> and every protein has its own staining characteristics; clean glassware, pure reagents and water of highest purity are the key points to successful staining. Silver staining was developed in the 14th century for colouring the surface of glass. It has been used extensively for this purpose since the 16th century. The colour produced by the early silver stains ranged between light yellow and an orange-red. Camillo Golgi perfected the silver staining {{for the study of the}} nervous system. Golgi's method stains a limited number of cells at random in their entirety.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} colour and {{lighting}} {{conditions on the}} emotions and performance of people is gaining greater importance in our urban societies. While large resources are allocated for well designed spaces with the right choices of colour and lighting conditions, there is little scientific evidence that supports these choices. Although the literature on light and colour is extensive, it does not present a uniform set of findings for a consistent perspective {{on the influence of}} colour and light. Most of the research reported in this field uses subjective measures to study the emotional effects of light and colour on people. It has been reported in literature that emotion manifests itself in three separate sections; (i) physiological (i. e. objective measures), (ii) psychological (subjective measures), (iii) behavioral, and it is necessary that studies not be limited to the assessment of a single response but include sample measures from each of the three manifestations. This research is built on the current body of knowledge {{that there is a need}} for a study on the emotional effects of light and colour on people using physiological and psychological measures, to ensure the objectivity and reproductivity of the experiments. It is well documented in literature that there is close correlation between emotions, heart rate (HR), and skin conductance (SC). Hence HR and SC are expected to be good physiological measures of environmental conditions on people. Thus this thesis reports changes in the HR, SC and self-assessment reports of arousal and valence (SAM) for people when exposed to different <b>colour</b> and <b>intensity</b> lights. The aim is to help provide an objective rationale for the choice for light <b>intensity</b> and <b>colour</b> by architects, interior designers and other professionals. The experiments were conducted on 15 participants who were exposed to 8 different <b>colour</b> and <b>intensity</b> light conditions. The participants&# 039; HR and SC were recorded under each <b>colour</b> and <b>intensity</b> light, and they were asked to complete SAM. The research demonstrates that there is a change in HR, SC, arousal and valence of participants due to change in the <b>colour</b> and <b>intensity</b> of lights. However, the direction of change was subject dependent, where the same <b>colour</b> and <b>intensity</b> light can have different effects on people. The research suggests that architects and designers of any space must take into account the individual differences of the predicted users when designing the lights and colours. It is also seen from the results that some <b>colour</b> and <b>intensity</b> lights have greater impact on the emotions of participants than others. Although it is not possible to correlate the colour and lighting conditions to a specific effect on all participants, general effects for some colour lights were drawn from the results. It is well documented in literature that HR and SC are a good measure of emotion. However the results of this study show very high inter subject variation in HR and SC. This is due to people having different HR and SC in normal conditions. This research demonstrates that the use of HR and SC to measure the effect of a stimulus on a group of people is unreliable because it is hard to compare the results...|$|R

On SOIL- 47, 100 % recognition rate is achieved for single training view per object. On COIL- 100, 99. 9 % recognition rate is obtained for 18 training views per object. Robustness to severe occlusions is demonstrated by only a moderate decrease of recognition performance in an experiment where half of each test image is erased. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An image {{retrieval}} system based on local affine frames is introduced. The system provides highly discriminative retrieval of rigid objects under a very wide range of viewing and illumination conditions, and is robust to occlusion and background clutter. Distinguished regions of data dependent shape are detected, and local affine frames (coordinate systems) are obtained. Photometrically and geometrically normalised image patches are extracted and used for matching. Local correspondences are formed either by direct comparison of photometrically normalised <b>colour</b> <b>intensities</b> in the normalised patches, or by comparison of DCT (discrete cosine transform) coefficients of the patches. Experimental results are presented on a publicly available database of real outdoor images of buildings. We demonstrate {{the effect of the}} number of DCT coefficients that are used for the matching. Using the DCT, excellent results with a retrieval performance of 100 % in rank 1 are achieved, and memory usage is reduced by a factor of 4. ...|$|R
