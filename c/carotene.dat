5|$|Clotted {{cream can}} be used as an accompaniment to hot or cold desserts. Clotted cream, {{especially}} clotted cream from Devon, where it is less yellow due to lower <b>carotene</b> levels in the grass, is regularly used in baking. It is used throughout southwest England in the production of ice cream and fudge.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported <b>carotene</b> contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} structure of xanthophylls {{is similar to}} that of <b>carotenes,</b> but xanthophylls contain oxygen atoms, while <b>carotenes</b> are purely hydrocarbons with no oxygen. Xanthophylls contain their oxygen either as hydroxyl groups and/or as pairs of hydrogen atoms that are substituted by oxygen atoms acting as a bridge (epoxide). For this reason, they are more polar than the purely hydrocarbon <b>carotenes,</b> and it is this difference that allows their separations from <b>carotenes</b> in many types of chromatography. Typically, <b>carotenes</b> are more orange in color than xanthophylls.|$|R
40|$|<b>Carotenes</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} vitamin A precursor in human nutrition which has numerous advantages. Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) is wastewater which consists of <b>carotenes</b> in the oil and grease content. Therefore, adsorption chromatography is used to separate the <b>carotenes</b> from the oil and grease in POME. Several types of adsorbents, temperatures and mass loading were studied in the experiments. The 40 °C and oil:adsorbent ratio of 1 : 5 was recommended to be the most suitable temperature and mass loading for separation of <b>carotenes</b> by adsorption chromatography. Silica gel also shows better quality of adsorbent in separation of <b>carotenes</b> in hexane fractions...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{comparing}} the stability of <b>carotenes</b> (α- and β-carotene) in oil solutions with their stability when spray-dried encapsulation is applied. The <b>carotenes</b> were isolated from carrot. A storage test was subsequently performed. The stability of <b>carotenes</b> in oil solutions was determined with the HPLC method. The color of the samples was also analyzed. The oil solutions of <b>carotenes</b> were microencapsulated with the spray-drying method.

5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (<b>carotene,</b> lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters {{that may be}} used to help distinguish S.dudleyi from some other Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta <b>carotene,</b> and give the fruit body its color.|$|E
25|$|Bracketed {{values are}} retinol {{activity}} equivalences (RAEs) {{and percentage of}} the adult male RDA, per 100 grams of the foodstuff (average). Conversion of <b>carotene</b> to retinol varies {{from person to person}} and bioavailability of <b>carotene</b> in food varies.|$|E
5000|$|The unoxygenated (oxygen free) {{carotenoids}} such as α-carotene, β-carotene, and lycopene, {{are known}} as <b>carotenes.</b> <b>Carotenes</b> typically contain only carbon and hydrogen (i.e., are hydrocarbons), and are in the subclass of unsaturated hydrocarbons.|$|R
25|$|Chemically, <b>carotenes</b> are {{polyunsaturated}} hydrocarbons containing 40 carbon atoms per molecule, variable {{numbers of}} hydrogen atoms, {{and no other}} elements. Some <b>carotenes</b> are terminated by hydrocarbon rings, on one or {{both ends of the}} molecule. All are coloured to the human eye, due to extensive systems of conjugated double bonds. Structurally <b>carotenes</b> are tetraterpenes, meaning that they are synthesized biochemically from four 10-carbon terpene units, which in turn are formed from eight 5-carbon isoprene units.|$|R
50|$|The orange colour of carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, oranges, {{and many}} other fruits and {{vegetables}} comes from <b>carotenes,</b> a type of photosynthetic pigment. These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the sun into chemical energy for the plants' growth. The <b>carotenes</b> themselves take their name from the carrot. Autumn leaves also get their orange colour from <b>carotenes.</b> When the weather turns cold and production of green chlorophyll stops, the orange colour remains.|$|R
25|$|Parsley is {{a source}} of {{flavonoids}} and antioxidants, especially luteolin, apigenin, folic acid, vitamin K, vitamin C, and vitamin A. Half a tablespoon (a gram) of dried parsley contains about 6.0µg of lycopene and 10.7µg of alpha <b>carotene</b> as well as 82.9µg of lutein+zeaxanthin and 80.7µg of beta <b>carotene.</b>|$|E

25|$|Carotenemia or hypercarotenemia is excess <b>carotene,</b> {{but unlike}} excess vitamin A, <b>carotene</b> is non-toxic. Although hypercarotenemia is not {{particularly}} dangerous, {{it can lead to}} an oranging of the skin (carotenodermia), but not the conjunctiva of eyes (thus easily distinguishing it visually from jaundice). It is most commonly associated with consumption of an abundance of carrots, but it also can be a medical sign of more dangerous conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Red {{palm oil}} {{is rich in}} <b>carotenes,</b> such as alpha-carotene, {{beta-carotene}} and lycopene, which give it a characteristic dark red color.

40|$|Food {{processing}} and occurrence of dietary lipids {{are believed to}} be important and limiting factors for carotenoid bioavailability in humans. In the present study the isolated and combined effects of household cooking and addition of olive oil on the bioaccessibility of <b>carotenes</b> from carrots have been investigated. Although thermal treatment during cooking showed to {{have a negative impact on}} the carotenoid content, a positive effect on the micellarisation of <b>carotenes</b> and therefore on their bioaccessibility was found. <b>Carotenes</b> transferred to the digests were micellarised to a higher extent from cooked carrots (52...|$|R

40|$|The isoprenoids, {{cholesterol}} and rubber, {{are known to}} arise from mevalonic (3, 5 -dihydroxy- 3 -methylvaleric) acid (5, 7). The {{same is true of}} <b>carotenes</b> (1, 6). Thus it has been found in this laboratory that mevalonic acid is rapidly incorporated into <b>carotenes</b> and related compounds in the tomato fruit (6). The hydrocarbon fraction of tomatoes previously incubated with 2 -C 14 -mevalonate contains radioactivity, however, not only in the known <b>carotenes</b> but also in a previously undescribed, · colorless polyene which possesses absorption maxima at 208 nw and 231 mμ, The high specific activity of this compound, which has been referred to as fraction II (6), suggests that it may be a precursor of <b>carotenes.</b> This paper reports further experiments pertaining to the identity of fraction II and to its role in the biosynthesis of carotenoids...|$|R
5000|$|... β-Carotene is an organic, {{strongly}} colored red-orange pigment {{abundant in}} plants and fruits. It {{is a member}} of the <b>carotenes,</b> which are terpenoids (isoprenoids), synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units and thus having 40 carbons. Among the <b>carotenes,</b> β-carotene is distinguished by having beta-rings at both ends of the molecule. β-Carotene is biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.|$|R
25|$|<b>Carotenes</b> are {{carotenoids}} containing no oxygen. Carotenoids containing some oxygen {{are known}} as xanthophylls.|$|R

25|$|<b>Carotenes</b> {{are found}} in plants in two primary forms {{designated}} by characters from the Greek alphabet: alpha-carotene (α-carotene) and beta-carotene (β-carotene). Gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-carotene (γ, δ, ε, and ζ-carotene) also exist. Since they are hydrocarbons, and therefore contain no oxygen, <b>carotenes</b> are fat-soluble and insoluble in water (in contrast with other carotenoids, the xanthophylls, which contain oxygen and thus are less chemically hydrophobic).|$|R

25|$|Peter Bramley {{discovered}} in the 1990s that a single phytoene desaturase gene (bacterial CrtI) {{can be used to}} produce lycopene from phytoene in GM tomato, rather than having to introduce multiple <b>carotene</b> desaturases that are normally used by higher plants. Lycopene is then cyclized to beta-carotene by the endogenous cyclase in Golden Rice.|$|E
25|$|Too much vitamin A in retinoid form can {{be harmful}} or fatal, {{resulting}} {{in what is}} known as hypervitaminosis A. The body converts the dimerized form, <b>carotene,</b> into vitamin A as it is needed, therefore high levels of <b>carotene</b> are not toxic compared to the ester (animal) forms. The livers of certain animals, especially those adapted to polar environments such as polar bears and seals, often contain amounts of vitamin A that would be toxic to humans. Thus, vitamin A toxicity is typically reported in Arctic explorers and people taking large doses of synthetic vitamin A. The first documented death possibly caused by vitamin A poisoning was Xavier Mertz, a Swiss scientist who died in January 1913 on an Antarctic expedition that had lost its food supplies and fell to eating its sled dogs. Mertz may have consumed lethal amounts of vitamin A by eating the dogs' livers.|$|E

25|$|<b>Carotenes</b> are {{responsible}} for the orange colour of the carrot, for which this class of chemicals is named, and for the colours of many other fruits, vegetables and fungi (for example, sweet potatoes, chanterelle and orange cantaloupe melon). <b>Carotenes</b> are also responsible for the orange (but not all of the yellow) colours in dry foliage. They also (in lower concentrations) impart the yellow coloration to milk-fat and butter. Omnivorous animal species which are relatively poor converters of coloured dietary carotenoids to colourless retinoids have yellowed-coloured body fat, {{as a result of the}} carotenoid retention from the vegetable portion of their diet. The typical yellow-coloured fat of humans and chickens is a result of fat storage of <b>carotenes</b> from their diets.|$|R

Thus, it has been demonstrated that a soluble extract of an acetone powder of tomato fruits converts mevalonic acid to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and isopentenyl pyrophosphate to phytoene, phytofluene, neurosporene and lycopene. Finally, it has been demonstrated that lycopene is converted into mono-and dicyclic <b>carotenes</b> by soluble extracts of plastids of tomato fruits.
