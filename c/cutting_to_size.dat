40|$|Abstract: Bandsawing is an {{important}} primary operation {{in a variety of}} industries, particularly steel suppliers who need to cut-off raw material for secondary processes. Bandsawing is a competitive method of <b>cutting</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> as it achieves a low kerf width, high metal removal rates, and good surface finish. One specific feature of the bandsaw metal-cutting operation is that the depth of cut per cutting edge is small (5 – 50 µm). Under conditions of low depth of cut and restricted chip formation, metal is removed by a complex combination of fragmented chips, ploughing, and some continuous conventional chips. The process of bandsawing is scientifically evaluated by measuring forces and associated parameters. Wear modes and mechanisms are also monitored, characterized, and their validity discussed...|$|E

50|$|A steel {{service center}} buys steel from a manufacturer, stores it, and sells {{it to end}} users as required. This saves the SME from the trouble of buying extra steel or even {{maintaining}} an inventory. The steel service center may also process the steel, e.g. by <b>cutting</b> <b>to</b> a <b>size</b> or shape specified by the customer, before sale. The quantity and the methods of processing of steel vary from center to center. It mostly depends on the product mix and the customer mix of the center.|$|R
50|$|The {{aquarium}} {{opened in}} 1985 after 10 months of construction. Tarlton {{developed a new}} method of building an acrylic tunnel by taking large sheets of clear acrylic, <b>cutting</b> them <b>to</b> <b>size</b> and heating them in an oven until they took {{the shape of the}} mould. Some of the sheets weighed over one tonne. Because of the refraction caused by light traveling through water, and the acrylic sheets used {{in the creation of the}} tunnel, the fish appear to be one third smaller than they are.|$|R
25|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} <b>cutting</b> the members <b>to</b> <b>size</b> and then drilling {{a series of}} holes in the joint surface of each member. Holes are often drilled {{with the assistance of}} a dowelling jig which aids in accurate hole placement— accuracy is paramount in this technique to ensure members line up perfectly in the completed joint. The holes are drilled such that there are corresponding holes in each member into which short dowels are inserted with some glue. The joint is brought together and clamped until the glue has dried.|$|R
50|$|The slate blocks were {{initially}} {{removed from the}} large open pits by blasting and then reduced <b>to</b> a manageable <b>size</b> using a mell (sledge hammer) and tully (long-handled wedge-shaped hammer) before being transported <b>to</b> the <b>cutting</b> sheds, sawn <b>to</b> <b>size</b> and riven into thin slates. Typical of many Welsh slate quarries, such as Dinorwig, Penrhyn and Rhiw-Bach, Burlington adopted {{the use of a}} long series of inclined trackways and water balance lifts to provide material transport from the quarries. The lowest of the series was the Sandside, which connected Burlington with the port and mainline railway at Sandside on the Duddon Estuary.|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid the}} need for rolling-up excess length, using an {{extension}} reel or for <b>cutting</b> the cord <b>to</b> <b>size,</b> extension cords are sold in prefabricated lengths of 1 to 150 feet (30 cm to 45 m). Every foot of cord increases the electrical resistance, in turn decreasing the power the cord can deliver. Therefore, the longer the cord, the larger {{the diameter of the}} conductors need be to minimise voltage drop (wire gauge numbers are smaller for larger diameter wire). Because of this, it is best to use a cord that's exactly as long as needed and no more.|$|R
50|$|As the fur trade began {{they also}} {{became known as}} skilled traders. Highly skilled in canoe making and later shipbuilding, a number of trading schooners were made in Bella Bella by the canoe makers who had learned to make western style vessels. For a time they acted as {{middlemen}} in the fur trade, benefiting from early access to guns. The traders complain in some of their records of the Heiltsuk being hard to trade with, passing off land otter skins for sea otter, demanding extra large blankets, then <b>cutting</b> them <b>to</b> standards <b>size</b> for retrade and sewing the extra pieces together to make more blankets.|$|R
5000|$|A kitchen utensil is a {{small hand}} held tool used for food preparation. Common kitchen tasks include <b>cutting</b> food items <b>to</b> <b>size,</b> heating food on an open fire or on a stove, baking, grinding, mixing, blending, and measuring; {{different}} utensils are made for each task. A general purpose utensil such as a chef's knife {{may be used for}} a variety of foods; other kitchen utensils are highly specialized and may be used only in connection with preparation of a particular type of food, such as an egg separator or an apple corer. Some specialized utensils are used when an operation is to be repeated many times, or when the cook has limited dexterity or mobility. The number of utensils in a household kitchen varies with time and the style of cooking.|$|R
40|$|With the {{agricultural}} {{economy of the}} Central Pyrenees in steady decline, natural forest stands are colonising abandoned agricultural meadows. The present study seeks to define the economic conditions for a new fuel-wood local economy based on these extensions of the forest cover. Farmer/forest owners are capable of exploiting this resource, involving logging, hauling and <b>cutting</b> the wood <b>to</b> <b>size,</b> <b>to</b> meet their own heating needs. In this way, owners could thus recuperate a maximum unit value estimated at 11. 2 to 22. 3  € per stere (1 cubic metre), or an average value of 16. 8  € per stere after deduction of all costs. An economy based on wood energy, using wood from spontaneously generated forest growth on private land, is therefore possible. A development policy for such an activity could be envisaged with appropriate initiatives to stimulate the owners of land where spontaneous ash reforestation has occurred to harvest this potential resource...|$|R
50|$|In 1949 {{he moved}} to the United States, and became General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera the {{following}} year, a post he held for 22 years. During the 1960s, he supervised the move of the old Metropolitan on Broadway and 39th Street, to its new quarters in Lincoln Center and presided over {{one of the most prominent}} eras of the Met. It was summed up in 1990 by James Oestreich in the New York Times as follows:Wielding his powerful position at the Metropolitan Opera with intense personal charisma over two decades, Sir Rudolf Bing ruled much of the operatic universe in autocratic fashion, nurturing young artists and <b>cutting</b> superstars down <b>to</b> <b>size</b> with equal enthusiasm. He oversaw the abandonment in 1966 of the stately but somewhat dilapidated old Metropolitan Opera House he then had razed and the construction of a grand monument to his regime, the building the company now occupies, which dominates Lincoln Center. His conservative musical and dramatic bent, preference for Italian opera and concern for theatrical values yielded an identifiable artistic legacy.|$|R
5000|$|The Workbench Challenge - Each {{year since}} the second season, contestants are tasked with {{building}} a workbench as a working surface during construction. However, in this year's challenge, the workbench must be repurposed into a massage table in the final episode. The contestants may use the experts' table as a reference. Rob ends up building the best workbench, but is judged to have failed the challenge, since {{not only did he}} injure himself for the third time, he also injured Joe-Anne as well. Ajay builds a relatively decent workbench, but forgets {{to take into account the}} fact that it's supposed to become a massage table and makes it far too short for that purpose, leading to him failing. Matt's workbench seems solid, but when subjected to a [...] "jump test" [...] one of the main braces fractures. Charlene fails as her workbench lacks a top, having given up on <b>cutting</b> a top <b>to</b> <b>size.</b> Dan is the only handyman to pass the challenge, despite his table being a full sheet of plywood and his lower shelf being at floor level.|$|R
5000|$|Wall insulation: For this episode's first challenge, {{the teams}} must tear {{down one of}} the walls in their cabins, place {{fibreglass}} insulation in the gaps (cutting and installing extra wall studs if needed), place a vapour barrier over the insulation and then add in new wall panelling. Despite the teams being explicitly told that they are to install their insulation in a wall that has two windows, Jake ignores this instruction and decides to install it {{in the corner of the}} kitchen, even as Nicole (and later Rob when he drops by to see how they're doing) tries to remind him of the instructions. On top of that, the two fail to install the needed extra studs, and affix their wall panelling so poorly that a small tug from Hillary brings it all falling down, cementing the Green Team as the worst in this challenge. The Purple Team do an okay job of attaching their wall panelling and vapour barrier, but resort to haphazardly stuffing chunks of insulation in the wall instead of <b>cutting</b> it <b>to</b> <b>size,</b> which the experts tell them is a waste of materials and will not insulate effectively. The Blue and Red Teams both get their insulation and vapour barriers installed correctly, but their wall panelling is visibly loose in places; the Red Team also have issues with Fabian and Luaynworking together. The Pink Team, therefore, are named the winners, as while their job wasn’t perfect by any means (in particular, they left large, obvious joins between their sheets of wall panelling), it was still the best of the five teams.|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} {{composite}} {{was made from}} epoxy resin of the type GY- 191 produced by Hexion Speciality Chemical Pty Ltd, epoxidised linseed oil locally produced from the University of Southern Queensland lab and fillers of sawdust and Evirospheres (SLG). Aradur- 250 amine was used as hardener. Ratio of epoxy resin to Aradur hardener was varied; the first ratio was 2 : 1 and last one was 3 : 1. Background information pressure on traditional building material such as concrete, timber and steel is becoming unbearable. As such a number of researches are being carried out throughout the world to look for material that will release pressure on building materials. For material to be accepted as a building material it’s physical, mechanical and structural properties have to be known to meet basic criteria for building material. Aims and objectives: The aims of the project were to investigate the physical, mechanical and structural properties of composite made from renewable resources (Epoxy resin and epoxidised vegetable oil (linseed oil (ELO)) and by using wastes material such as sawdust and SLG as fillers. Preparation Samples were prepared with different percentage in weight of sawdust and SLG. The two main sizes of sawdust used were 600 and 1650 microns. Percentage of SLG was varied as well as sawdust. The composite was subjected to preparation that includes weighing, mixing, curing, <b>cutting</b> <b>to</b> <b>sizes</b> and polishing. Curing was done {{at room temperature for}} 24 hours followed by 4 hours of 80 degrees Celsius in an industrial oven. Methodology: Three main tests were used in the investigation of the composite properties. The tests were flexural, impact fracture toughness and DMA analysis. Each of these tests was adopted to determine different expects of the mechanical, physical and structural properties. Both flexural and Impact fracture toughness tests were carried out using MTS alliance provided by CEEFC. The properties investigate in this methods include flexural modulus, peak load, peakstress, deflection and strain at failure. Samples specimen for flexural and impact toughness were made of bar shape with dimensions of 64 x 15 x 10 mm according MTS alliance specifications. DMA samples were smaller made according Q 800 specifications of 35 x 12 x 4 mm. DMA was used to determine thermal mechanical properties. The thermal properties determined were glass transition temperature (Tg), storage modulus, and tan delta. Results and Conclusion: Results obtained for the samples for flexural revealed flexural modulus of up to 1880 MPa for composite with sawdust and SLG in its composition. Composites samples with ELO have lower flexural modulus as compare to ones without ELO. The trend observed was that when more sawdust was added to the composite, storage, peak load, and flexural modulus increased up to a certain limit at which they drop. Addition of more sawdust was observed to lower deflections of composite bars. The result from various combinations of epoxy resin and waste material was compared to the one for the pure or neat epoxy resin. It was found that with addition of ELO, the physical, mechanical and structural properties were much lower compared with the neat epoxy resin properties...|$|R
