2500|$|Not all {{critiques of}} the {{podcasting}} format {{have been as}} equivocal. PopMatters observed that podcasting is a new distribution model, very different from television as a distribution model because it gives users access to media {{and the freedom to}} listen to episodes of a long-form story while doing other things. The reviewer applauded the focus on long-form journalism and added, [...] "Suddenly you feel like the full promise of podcasting has just been unleashed. That long-form narrative nonfiction is really the way to best leverage the potential of podcasting as a distribution model." [...] A Wall Street Journal critic observed: [...] "podcasts have slipped marketers' minds. ZenithOptimedia, for example, put out a forecast predicting 0% growth for the medium after years of positive momentum." [...] Discussing the economics of podcast advertising, New York Magazine noted that the personal nature of the podcast format allows higher advertising rates: [...] "CPM (the cost to an advertiser per thousand impressions, a standard ad-industry unit) was between $20 and $45. <b>Compare</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> a typical radio CPM (roughly $1 to $18) or network TV ($5 to $20) or even a regular old web ad ($1 to $20), and the podcast wins." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morbidity can {{be major}} (myocardial infarction, pneumonia, {{pulmonary}} embolism, renal failure/insufficiency, postoperative cognitive dysfunction and allergy) or minor (minor nausea, vomiting, readmission). [...] There is usually overlap in the contributing factors {{that lead to}} morbidity and mortality between {{the health of the}} patient, the surgery being performed and the anesthetic. [...] To understand the relative risk of each contributing factor, consider that the rate of deaths totally attributed to the patient's health is 1:870. [...] <b>Compare</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the rate of deaths totally attributed to surgical factors (1:2860) or anesthesia alone (1:185,056) illustrating that the single greatest factor in anesthetic mortality is the health of the patient. [...] These statistics can also be compared to the first such study on mortality in anesthesia from 1954, which reported a rate of death from all causes at 1:75 and a rate attributed to anesthesia alone at 1:2680. [...] Direct comparisons between mortality statistics cannot reliably be made over time and across countries because of differences in the stratification of risk factors, however, there is evidence that anesthetics have made a significant improvement in safety but to what degree is uncertain.|$|E

"I don't {{know that}} it quite means what Oxford does to you, but it's {{something}} of the kind; you might have seen the fine buildings {{at the foot of}} the mountain, if you had stayed in Montreal.

Still, so far as I understand your English ideas, there's a difference--our boys go to McGill or Toronto with the intention of learning something that will open up a career. They certainly play football and one or two other games pretty well, but that's a very secondary object; so's the acquiring of a polished style.

5000|$|This formula {{looks very}} surprising, {{but it is}} correct: the propulsive power (or power {{available}} [...] ) of a jet engine increases with its speed. If the speed is zero, then the propulsive power is zero. If a jet aircraft is at full throttle but attached to a static test stand, then the jet engine produces no propulsive power, however thrust is still produced. <b>Compare</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> a piston engine. The combination piston engine-propeller also has a propulsive power with exactly the same formula, and {{it will also be}} zero at zero speed -- but that is for the engine-propeller set. The engine alone will continue to produce its rated power at a constant rate, whether the aircraft is moving or not.|$|E
5000|$|... where again, N is {{the number}} of firms in the market, and H is the usual Herfindahl Index, as above. Using the normed Herfindahl index, {{information}} about the total number of players (N) is lost, as shown in the following example: Assume a market with two players and equally distributed market share; H = 1/N = 1/2 = 0.5 and H* = 0. Now <b>compare</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> a situation with three players and again an equally distributed market share; H = 1/N = 1/3 = 0.333..., note that H* = 0 like the situation with two players. The market with three players is less concentrated, but this is not obvious looking at just H*. Thus, the normalized Herfindahl index can serve as a measure for the equality of distributions, but is less suitable for concentration.|$|E
